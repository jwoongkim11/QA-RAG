 '--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 , Do DMF holders need to wait for a new ANDA applicant to request a letter of authorization before the DMF is assessed to be available for reference?\n--------------------\nContext: 1 Backlog Fees\n\nAny person who owned an original ANDA that failed to pay the backlog fee was placed on a publicly available arera\'s list available at www.fda.gov/GDUFA. FDA will not receive - within the meaning of section 505(j)(5)(A) of the FD&C Act70 - a new ANDA or supplement submitted by that person, or any affiliate of that person, until the outstanding fee is paid.71\n\nFootnote 70: This provision references the “receipt” of ANDAs by FDA. The Agency evaluates an ANDA after it is submitted to determine whether it may be received. Receipt of an ANDA means that FDA has made a threshold determination that the ANDA is substantially complete; 21 CFR 314.101(b)(1).\n\nFootnote 71: Section 744B(g)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\n1 DMF Fees\n\nA DMF will be deemed available for reference if both the DMF fee is paid in full and the DMF has not failed an initial completeness assessment. No generic drug submission referencing the DMF will be received unless the fee is paid and the DMF is deemed available for reference.\n\nANDA applicants that reference a DMF for which a fee is due but has not been paid will be provided notification of the DMF holder\'s failure to satisfy the user fee obligation. If the DMFfee is not paid within 20 calendar days after notification, the generic drug submission referencing the DMF will not be received.72\n\nFootnote 72: Section 744B(g)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 73: Section 744B(g)(3) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 74: Section 744B(a)(3)(F) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 75: Section 744B(g)(3) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 76: Section 744B(g)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAppendix C ANDA Filing Fees\n\nIf an applicant does not submit payment of the ANDA filing fee within 20 calendar days of the due date, its application will be deemed incomplete on the date of submission and will not be received.73 So long as FDA finds that none of the disqualifications outlined in 21 CFR 314.101(d) and (e) apply (i.e., the ANDA is otherwise substantially complete), the application will be considered submitted as of the date all user fee obligations are satisfied in full.\n\nFootnote 73: Id.\n\nAppendix D Fee for API Information Not Included by Reference to DMF - (a)(3)(F) Fee\n\nIf a generic drug applicant submission contains information concerning the manufacture of an API at a facility by means other than reference by a letter of authorization to a Type II API DMF, and a fee equal to the DMF fee has not been previously paid with respect to such submission, then the applicant shall pay a fee in the amount described in section VII.D, in addition to the applicable ANDA filing fee.74 If these fees are not submitted within 20 calendar days of the due date then the submission will not be received.75 So long as FDA finds that none of the disqualifications outlined in 21 CFR 314.101(d) and (e) apply (i.e., the ANDA is otherwise substantially complete), the application will be considered submitted as of the date all user fee obligations are satisfied in full.\n\nFootnote 75: Id.\n\nAppendix E Facility Fees\n\nFailure to pay the facility fee within 20 calendar days of the due date will result in the following penalties:76\n\nFootnote 76: Id.\n\nNo new ANDA or supplement submitted by the person responsible for paying the fee or that person\'s affiliates will be received.\n\nNo new generic drug submission referencing the facility will be received until the fee is paid.\n\nThe facility will be placed on a publicly available arrears list.\n\nFDA will notify the referencing ANDA applicant of the facility\'s failure to satisfy its user fee obligations.\n\nFurther, all FDFs or APIs manufactured in the non-paying facility and all FDFs containing APIs manufactured in such a facility will be deemed misbranded.77 This means that it will be a violation of federal law to ship these products in interstate commerce or to import them into the United States. Such violations can result in prosecution of those responsible, injunctions, or seizures of misbranded products. Products deemed misbranded are subject to being denied entry into the United States.\n\nGDUFA Program Fees\n\nFailure to pay the GDUFA program fee within 20 calendar days of the GDUFA program fee due date will result in the following penalties:78\n\nFootnote 78: Section 744B(g)(5) of the FD&C Act.\n\nApplicants will be placed on a publicly available arrears list.\n\nAny ANDAs submitted by the applicant or an affiliate of that applicant will not be received.\n\nFurther, all drugs marketed pursuant to ANDAs held by such applicant or an affiliate of that applicant will be deemed misbranded.79 This means that it will be a violation of federal law to ship these products in interstate commerce or to import them into the United States. Such violations can result in prosecution of those responsible, injunctions, or seizures of misbranded products. Products deemed misbranded are subject to being denied entry into the United States.\n\nFootnote 79: Id.\n\nHowever, if an application or supplement was already received by FDA prior to the applicant being placed in arrears, FDA will continue the review of and accept amendments to those applications.\n\nXII Payment Information and Procedures\n\nThe payment process for GDUFA III is similar to the previous iterations of the program and other FDA user fees. The FDA website80 contains instructions for paying the fees.\n\nFootnote 80: https://www.fda.gov/industry/fda-user-fee-programs/generic-drug-user-fee-amendments.\n\nPayment Procedures for GDUFA Fees\n\nThose responsible for payment of fees enter required information on FDA\'s User Fee System to generate a GDUFA cover sheet.\n\nThe cover sheet is designed to provide the minimum necessary information to determine if a person has satisfied all relevant user fee obligations.\n\nThe cover sheet is submitted to FDA electronically generating a user fee payment identification number (PIN) to assist in tracking payment.\n\nCover sheets for ANDA filing fees should be submitted with ANDA submissions. The Generic Drug User Fee Cover Sheet and additional payment information is available on the GDUFA website (www.fda.gov/GDUFA).\n\nAcceptable Forms of Payment\n\nPayment must be made in U.S. currency drawn on a U.S. bank.81 Fee payers may pay online by credit card or Automated Clearing House (ACH) electronic check or send payment by check, bank draft, U.S. postal money order, or wire transfer.\n\nFootnote 81: See 87 FR 61601 (October 12, 2022), available at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2022-10-12/pdf/2022-22099.pdf.\n\nTimely Payment of Fees\n\nFDA\'s expectation is for full and timely payment of all GDUFA fees. Penalties associated with non-payment, including, but not limited to, refusal to receive a generic drug submission, drug product deemed misbranded, and failure of a DMF to be placed on a publicly available reference list, will apply until such obligations are satisfied in full.\n\nOne entity may pay GDUFA fees on behalf of another entity. Those paying fees are responsible for determining all financial institution transaction fees that may be deducted from an entity\'s authorized amount for payment to FDA. These include wire transfer and foreign exchange fees.\n\nRefund and ""Transfer"" Requests\n\nOther than as described in section VII.A, FDA will only fully refund payments of fees made in error. If a fee was properly incurred, there will be no refund of the payment.\n\nTo qualify for the return of a fee claimed to have been paid in error, a person shall submit to the Secretary a written request justifying such return within 180 calendar days after such fee was paid.82 The format for submitting refund requests is Form FDA 3913, attached as Appendix 1 and available at\n\nFootnote 82: Section 744B(m) of the FD&C Act.\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/UCM492188.pdf.\n\nA Form FDA 3913 written refund request should be submitted to the Division of User Fee Management at CDERCollections@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nFDA no longer permits the administrative action of applying a previously paid GDUFA fee (also referred to as a ""transfer"") from a closed-out fiscal year cover sheet to a different fiscal year cover sheet.83 Instead, payments from closed-out fiscal year cover sheets will only be processed as refunds to the original payors, provided that the request is made within 180 calendar days from when the original payment was made.\n\nRequests for the ""transfer"" of payments within the same fiscal year or open fiscal year may be permitted for the same fee type and for a fee obligation of the same payor, provided that the request is made within 180 calendar days from the original payment date. For example, a request to ""transfer"" a fee payment from a FY 2023 cover sheet to another FY 2023 cover sheetwithin the same fee type (perhaps due to an incorrect FEI) by the same payor will be processed, provided the request is made within 180 calendar days of the original payment date.\n\nAs another example, during September 2023 (FY 2023), an applicant may request a ""transfer"" of a fee to a FY 2024 cover sheet of the same fee type because FY 2023 has not yet been closed-out. However, if an applicant requests a ""transfer"" of a fee from a FY 2023 cover sheet during FY 2024 (beginning October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024), this transaction will not be permitted as FY 2023 has already been closed-out.\n\nTo request a ""transfer,"" applicants should complete Form FDA 3914 and email the form to\n\nCDERCollections@fda.hhs.gov. Form FDA 3914 is attached as Appendix 2 and is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/UCM492195.pdf\n--------------------\nContext title: Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 , Do DMF holders need to wait for a new ANDA applicant to request a letter of authorization before the DMF is assessed to be available for reference?\n--------------------\nContext: In accordance with the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments Reauthorization Performance Goals and Program Enhancements (GDUFA II Commitment Letter),15 FDA committed to complete the initial CA review for 90% of Type II API DMFs within 60 days of the later of the date of DMF submission or DMF fee payment.\n\nFootnote 15: Available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM370352.pdf.\nFDA will use the CA Checklist to perform the CA. At the top of the cover page of the CA Checklist, FDA will fill in basic information about the DMF, including its name, number, receipt date, and whether the DMF was submitted in electronic or paper format.\n\nThe FDA will also note whether the primary DMF the ANDA references refers to any other DMFs (subject DMFs). A primary DMF can reference subject DMFs, which provide additional information needed to completely describe the manufacture of an API.16 Before submitting its DMF, the primary DMF holder should check with the holders of any referenced subject DMFs to make sure the subject DMFs are filed with FDA and FDA still considers them active.\n\nFootnote 16: For example, a subject DMF may describe the manufacture of a material used in producing the active ingredient. If a subject DMF does not meet the definition of a Type II API DMF, it will not incur a DMF fee.\n\nIs the DMF Active?\n\nBefore assigning a DMF to a reviewer for a CA, FDA will confirm that the DMF is active.17 If the primary DMF or any referenced subject DMFs on file at FDA are inactive, FDA will consider the primary DMF incomplete and send a letter notifying the DMF holder.\n\nFootnote 17: “Active” is defined in the Definitions section of this guidance.\n\n2 Has the DMF fee been paid?\n\nBefore assigning a DMF to a reviewer for a CA, FDA will confirm that the DMF fee has been paid. If it has not, FDA will not assign the DMF for CA. ANDA applicants that reference a DMF for which a fee is due will be notified that the DMF holder has not paid the fee. If the DMF fee is not paid within 20 days after notification, FDA will refuse to receive the ANDA referencing the DMF.\n\nHas the DMF been previously reviewed for chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) by FDA in the context of a review of a prior application?\n\nIf FDA has reviewed the DMF for CMC after November 30, 2007, the DMF will be considered to have passed the CA without further analysis. If the DMF was reviewed for CMC prior to November 30, 2007, a CA assessment will need to be performed. For all DMFs that have not previously received a full CMC review, a CA assessment will need to be performed. If the DMF has not previously received this full review, it will be assigned to a reviewer for a CA.\n\n3 Check of Completeness Assessment Elements\n\nFDA will complete the administrative part of the CA Checklist (i.e., ""General Information"") during the CA. If the DMF is incomplete, FDA will send the DMF holder a GDUFA DMF Incomplete Letter. With certain exceptions specified in this guidance document, this letter will provide comments about each element that resulted in an incomplete designation for the CA.\n\nIf an item is marked ""n/a"" and does not apply to the DMF, the element is treated the same as if it were marked ""yes.""1. Is the subject of the DMF a single API produced by one manufacturing process?\n\nThe subject of a DMF should be limited to one API and one manufacturing process. If a DMF includes information on more than one API or more than one manufacturing process for an API, the DMF will be deemed incomplete. If the DMF describes multiple APIs, the DMF holder should file separate DMFs for each API. Similarly, if there are multiple manufacturing processes for an API, the DMF holder should file separate DMFs for each manufacturing process.\n\n2 Does the DMF holder need to submit a complete update?\n\nIf the DMF is in paper format and it has been five years or more since the DMF received a complete update,18 or if there have been more than five amendments to the DMF, the DMF holder should provide a complete and comprehensive update to it. If such a DMF has not received an update, FDA will consider the DMF incomplete. The DMF holder must submit a complete update for FDA to determine whether it passes the CA.19\n\nFDA believes that the remainder of the CA Checklist is self-explanatory.\n\nFootnote 18: All changes must be reported as amendments. Annual reports are NOT to be used to report changes in the DMF.\n\nFootnote 19: The requirement for a complete update does not apply to the DMF if the entire DMF is in eCTD format, which always presents the DMF in its current state. The Agency highly encourages DMF holders to convert the entire DMF into an eCTD submission, which does not require reference to any previous paper submission.\n\n4 Completeness Assessment Outcomes\n\nFollowing the CA, FDA will find the DMF either complete or incomplete.\n\nIf the DMF is found complete, FDA will post the DMF number on a publicly available list on FDA\'s Web site to indicate the DMF is available for reference by generic drug submission applicants.20 Footnote 20: For the public list of DMFs available for reference, see http://www.fda.gov/gdufa.\n\nIf the DMF is found incomplete, the CA findings and comments will be compiled in a GDUFA DMF Incomplete Letter to the DMF holder that explains why the DMF was deemed incomplete. Information about the CA status of a DMF, other than the lack of a public listing on the FDA\'s Web site, will not be provided to anyone except the DMF holder and, as necessary, any generic drug submission applicant that the DMF holder has authorized to rely on the DMF.\n\nTo remedy a GDUFA DMF Incomplete Letter and pass the CA, the DMF holder should submit an amendment to its DMF to correct the deficiencies identified in the Incomplete Letter, or, if FDA has determined that the DMF should undergo a complete update, the DMF holder should resubmit the DMF with that update. FDA will then assess the revised DMF\'s completeness. If there are no deficiencies at this time, FDA will declare the DMF to be complete and to have passed the CA.\n\nAlthough a DMF may be deemed incomplete upon its first CA, FDA will work with DMF holders to provide guidance on how to revise the DMF so it may be found complete after resubmission. Once the DMF passes the CA, FDA will make the DMF number publicly available on its Web site.21 Footnote 21: Under GDUFA, a condition for a Type II API DMF to be considered available for reference is that it “has not failed an initial completeness assessment” (Section 744B(a)(2)(D)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act). FDA does not interpret that provision as disqualifying a DMF if it has ever failed a CA. Instead, FDA considers this condition to be satisfied when, after submission of an amendment or resubmission of the DMF to address deficiencies identified by FDA, FDA finds that the DMF has passed the CA.\n\nV API information included in a generic drug submission\n\nIf a generic drug submission contains all the necessary API information and does not rely on information contained in a DMF, no CA will be performed. Instead, this information will be evaluated during the ANDA filing review.22 However, because GDUFA requires collection of a one-time fee for API information included in a generic drug submission (i.e., an (a)(3)(F) fee),23 the applicant submitting the generic drug submission containing the API information must pay this fee.\n\nFootnote 22: See guidance for industry ANDA Submissions – Refuse-to-Receive Standards.\n\nFootnote 23: Section 744B(a)(3)(F) of the FD&C Act.\n\nVI Summary\n\nOnce the DMF fee is received, FDA will evaluate the DMF to make sure it meets the CA criteria.\n\nIf the DMF passes the CA, it will be found complete and the DMF number will be made publicly available on FDA\'s Web site.\n\nIf the DMF fails the CA, FDA will send a GDUFA DMF Incomplete Letter describing to the DMF holder the missing elements in its DMF.\n\nIf the DMF holder addresses all the deficiencies and amends the DMF or completely updates the DMF per the CA request, the FDA will complete its CA. If the DMF is then found complete, the DMF number will be made publicly available on FDA\'s Web site.\n\nIf a generic drug submission contains all the necessary API information and does not reference a DMF, the generic drug submission applicant will be required to pay the (a)(3)(F) fee. No CA will be conducted.\n\nDefinitions\n\nActive pharmaceutical ingredient24 (as defined by GDUFA):**\n\nFootnote 24: Section 744A(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\n(A) A substance, or a mixture when the substance is unstable or cannot be transported on its own, intended\n\n(i) to be used as a component of a drug; and\n\n(ii) to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure,\n\nmitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any\n\nfunction of the human body; or\n\n(B) a substance intended for final crystallization, purification, or salt formation, or any\n\ncombination of those activities, to become a substance or mixture described in\n\nsubparagraph (A).\n\nActive DMF: A drug master file (DMF) for which the FDA has made a determination that the\n\nDMF was acceptable for filing administratively and is up to date.\n\nDMF holder:25 Designated owner of the DMF, which may be different from the U.S. agent\n\nlisted as the contact.\n\nFootnote 25: See 21 CFR 314.420(a).\n\nGeneric drug submission:26 An abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), an amendment to\n\nan ANDA, a prior approval supplement (PAS) to an ANDA, or an amendment to a PAS.\n\nLetter of authorization (LOA):27 A written statement by the holder or designated U.S. agent or\n\nrepresentative permitting FDA to refer to information in the DMF in support of another\n\nperson\'s28 generic drug submission.\n\nFootnote 28: Section 744A(12) of the FD&C Act; also see 21 CFR 314.420(a)(2).\n\nType II Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Drug Master Files:29 The submission of API\n--------------------\nContext title: Completeness Assessments for Type II API DMFs Under GDUFA Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry'

Failure to meet these obligations may delay approval of applications that rely on the information in your DMF or result in the Agency closing your DMF. The following discusses your responsibilities.\n\nChanges to your DMF\n\nAny addition, deletion, or change to information in your DMF is required to be submitted to the Agency in duplicate (21 CFR 314.420(c)). This includes changes you formerly reported to the Agency under 21 CFR 314.70 when the information was part of an approved bulk application. The submission describing the change should include appropriate cross-references to the affected information in previous submissions, including the date(s), volume(s), section(s), and/or page number(s). Additionally, you must notify each person (applicant) authorized to reference information in your DMF of pertinent changes (21 CFR 314.420(c)). Notification should be provided well in advance to give the affected persons (applicants) ample time to amend or supplement their applications as necessary under 21 CFR 314.70.\n\nAnnual Update\n\nYou should update your DMF on an annual basis. The update should identify all changes and additional information incorporated into your DMF since the previous update. If no changes were made to your DMF, you should provide a statement that the information remains current. For more information on annual updates see CDER's guidance on Drug Master Files.\n\nListing of Persons Authorized to Reference your DMF\n\nYour DMF must contain a complete list of persons currently authorized to reference information in your DMF (21 CFR 314.420(d)). For more information on this topic see CDER's guidance on Drug Master Files.\nIf you have an appointed agent for your DMF, you should include a signed letter of appointment in your DMF that includes the agent's name, address, and scope of responsibility (administrative and/or scientific).\n\nAppendix E Transfer of Ownership\n\nIf you intend to transfer ownership of your DMF to another party, you should notify the Agency and persons authorized to reference the DMF (applicants) in writing. Details regarding information to be included in the letter are provided in CDER's guidance on Drug Master Files.\n\nAppendix F Incorporation of Information into a Dosage Form Application\n\nIf you do not wish to maintain a DMF, the information may be filed as part of one or more dosage form applications (IND, NDA, or ANDA). The dosage form applicant is then responsible for ensuring this information meets regulatory requirements. If the information is certified as being current and there have been no changes, it may be submitted to the dosage form application(s) as an annual report. If the information is not current or changes have been made, the DMF information should be filed as (1) a prior approval supplement, changes being effected supplement, or annual report for an NDA or ANDA or (2) an information amendment or annual report for an IND. The reporting category would depend on the nature of the change.\n\nGLOSSARY\n--------------------\nContext title: Drug Master Files for Bulk Antibiotic Drug Substances Guidance for Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 , Do DMF holders need to wait for a new ANDA applicant to request a letter of authorization before the DMF is assessed to be available for reference?\n--------------------\nContext: A resubmission of an ANDA is a formal response to a refuse-to-receive determination and is submitted to the ANDA that was refused for receipt.33 Accordingly, a full ANDA filing fee is due upon resubmission of the ANDA that FDA had refused to receive. Submission of a dispute of a refuse-to-receive determination without attempting to remedy the deficiencies (i.e., without resubmitting the ANDA) is not considered a resubmission and is therefore not subject to a new ANDA filing fee.\n\nFootnote 33: See FDA’s draft guidance for industry ANDA Submissions – Refuse-to-Receive Standards: Questions and Answers (October 2017). When final, this guidance will represent the FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nFDA no longer permits the administrative action of applying a previously paid GDUFA fee (also referred to as a ""transfer"") from a closed-out fiscal year cover sheet to a different fiscal year cover sheet. For additional information regarding ""transfer"" requests, please see Section XII.D.\n\nExemptions to the Application Filing Fee\n\nAn applicant will not incur an ANDA filing fee under the following circumstances:34\n\nFootnote 34: Sections 744A(1)(B) and 744B(l) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe application is for a positron emission tomography (PET) drug.\n\nThe application is submitted by a State or Federal Government entity for a drug that is not distributed commercially.\n\nApproved applications of the types described in this section will also not be considered in the determination of GDUFA program fees (see Section IX below).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nD. Fee for API Information Not Included by Reference to DMF - (a)(3)(F) Fee\n\nAn applicant is required to pay an additional fee, also known as the (a)(3)(F) fee (because this fee is referenced in section 744B(a)(3)(F) of the FD&C Act), for a generic drug submission that contains information concerning the manufacture of an API at a facility by means other than reference by a letter of authorization to a Type II API DMF.\n\nUnder GDUFA, this (a)(3)(F) fee must be paid for each combination of API and the API\'s manufacturing facility, provided that a DMF fee or (a)(3)(F) fee has not already been paid for the manufacture of the same API by the same facility. The (a)(3)(F) fee amount for each API and facility combination is equal to the DMF fee and is paid only once.\n\nExample:\n\nAn applicant (XYZ Corp.) submits an ANDA that, rather than referencing a DMF, describes the manufacture of three APIs at one or more facilities. The (a)(3)(F) fee has been paid for the combination of API Beta manufactured at Facility 2.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \\hline\nProduct & API & API Manufacturing Facility \\ \\hline Drug X & Alpha & 1, 2, 3 \\ \\hline  & Beta & 1, 2 \\ \\hline  & Gamma & 1 \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nIn this example, the calculation for the (a)(3)(F) fee that XYZ Corp. owes is as follows:\n\n(a)(3)(F) Fee API-Facility combinations:\n\n(Alpha-Facility 1) + (Alpha-Facility 2) + (Alpha-Facility 3) + (Beta-Facility 1) + (Gamma-Facility 1) = 5 unpaid API-Facility combinations*\n\nNote: The Beta-Facility 2 combination has been paid and is, therefore, not included.\n\n(a)(3)(F) fee amount = (5 API-Facility combinations) x DMF fee amount\n\n[=5\\text{ x DMF fee amount}]\n\nThis information must be listed correctly in the Generic Drug User Fee Cover Sheet (Form FDA 3794) for the generic drug submission.\n\nSerially Submitted ANDAs\n\nIn the past, some ANDA applicants chose to serially submit complete ANDAs containing ""paragraph IV certifications"" in anticipation of a newly listed patent for a reference listed drug.35 However, these ""serial submissions"" with such paragraph IV certifications are not permittedunder FDA regulations.36 ANDA applicants must not submit a paragraph IV certification earlier than the first working day after the day the patent is listed in FDA\'s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the ""Orange Book.""37 The regulations reflect FDA\'s judgment that permitting serial submissions of amendments and multiple notices of paragraph IV certifications is overly burdensome to FDA and new drug application applicants. In this situation, applicants should remit their application filing fee with their ANDA on the first working day after the day the relevant patent is listed in the Orange Book or, if the application is not submitted on that date, the application filing fee should be remitted on the date the application is submitted.\n\nFootnote 36: See 81 FR 69580, 69610 (October 6, 2016), citing 21 CFR 314.94(a)(12)(viii)(C)(1)(ii) and 21 CFR 314.95(b)(2).\n\nFootnote 37: Available at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/approved-drug-products-therapeutic-equivalence-evaluations-orange-book.

Accordingly, an ANDA that is withdrawn still owes the fee. However, if an application is withdrawn before being received, the applicant is eligible for a 75 percent refund of the ANDA filing fee.38\n\nFootnote 38: See 81 FR 69580, 69610 (October 6, 2016), citing 21 CFR 314.94(a)(12)(viii)(C)(1)(ii) and 21 CFR 314.95(b)(2).\n\nVIII Facility fees\n\nUnder the current GDUFA authorization, the owner of a facility continues to incur a fee when both of the following conditions are met on the facility fee due date:\n\nThe facility is referenced in an approved generic drug submission; and\n\nThe facility is engaged in manufacturing or processing an API or FDF.39\n\nFootnote 39: Available at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/approved-drug-products-therapeutic-equivalence-evaluations-orange-book.

Summary\n\nThis guidance adopts many aspects of the former Administrative Conference of the United States' (1964 to 1995) recommendations concerning direct final rulemaking. FDA may use the direct final rule process when the agency does not anticipate receiving any significant adverse comment, or when a rule may qualify for exemption from notice-and-comment rulemaking. FDA will publish in the notice of direct final rulemaking the full text of the rule and the statement of basis and purpose, including all the material that would be required in the preamble to a final rule. FDA will also publish a companion proposed rule in the same issue of the Federal Register. That proposed rule will serve the purpose of issuing a proposed rule under usual notice-and-comment procedures in the event the direct final rule is withdrawn because the agency receives any significant adverse comment. FDA ordinarily will allow at least 75 days for comment on the direct final rule after it is published in the Federal Register. If the agency receives any significant adverse comment, the agency will publish a notice of significant adverse comment and withdraw the direct final rule within 30 days after the comment period ends. In that circumstance, any comments received will be considered comments on the proposed rule and will be considered in developing afinal rule using the usual APA notice-and-comment procedures. If the agency receives no significant adverse comment during the specified comment period, the direct final rule will go into effect no later than 60 days after the comment period ends. The agency will publish a document confirming the effective date within 30 days after the comment period ends, which ordinarily will state that the direct final rule will go into effect 30 days after the confirmation notice is published. This means that a direct final rule that receives no significant adverse comment will go into effect no later than 135 days after its publication in the Federal Register. FDA will adopt ACUS's definition of significant adverse comment. Thus, significant adverse comment is defined as one where the comment explains why the rule would be inappropriate, including challenges to the rule's underlying premise or approach, or would be ineffective or unacceptable without a change. In determining whether a significant adverse comment is sufficient to terminate a direct final rulemaking, FDA will consider whether the comment raises an issue serious enough to warrant a substantive response in a notice-and-comment process. FDA notes that comments that are frivolous, insubstantial, or outside the scope of the rule would not be considered adverse under this procedure. A comment recommending a rule change in addition to the rule would not be considered a significant adverse comment, unless the comment states why the rule would be ineffective without the additional change. In addition, if a significant adverse comment applies to part of a rule and that part can be severed from the remainder of the rule (e.g., where a rule deletes several unrelated regulations), FDA may adopt as final those parts of the rule that are not the subject of a significant adverse comment. As discussed previously, FDA will only use direct final rulemaking procedures when the agency expects that there will be no significant adverse comment. For example, FDA will consider direct final rulemaking for minor, substantive changes to regulations; incorporation by reference of the latest edition of technical or industry standards; extensions of compliance dates, direct incorporations of mandates from new legislation; and other non controversial rules where FDA determines that use of direct final rulemaking is in the public interest and that the rule is unlikely to result in any significant adverse comment.\n\nIII Significance of Guidance\n\nThe agency has adopted Good Guidance Practices (GGP's), which set forth the agency's policies and procedures for the development, issuance, and use of guidance documents (62 FR 8961, February 27, 1997). This guidance is issued as Level 1 guidance consistent with GGP's. The agency will not solicit public input prior to implementation because the guidance presents a less burdensome policy that is consistent with the public health. This guidance represents the agency's current thinking on direct final rules. It does not operate to create or confer any right for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulation, or both.\n\nIV Request for Comments\n\nInterested persons may, at any time, submit written comments on this guidance to the\n\nDockets Management Branch (address above). Such comments will be considered when\n\ndetermining whether to amend the current guidance. Two copies of any comments are to be\n\nsubmitted, except that individuals may submit one copy.\n--------------------\nContext title: Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n--------------------\nContext: In response to several requests submitted to the 2016 Consumer Antiseptic - Rub PR, FDA temporarily - deferred a GRAS/GRAE - determination - for three active ingredients--benzalkonium chloride, - ethyl alcohol, and isopropyl alcohol-to allow time for interested parties to complete the studies necessary to fill - the safety and effectiveness data gaps identified - for these ingredients.\n\nAs a result of the deferrals, the Consumer - Antiseptic - Rub FR does not include - a determination - on the GRAS/GRAE status of benzalkonium - chloride, ethyl alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol for use in consumer antiseptic - rubs. FDA intends to address the GRAS/GRAE - status of these three active ingredients - either after completion - and analysis of studies to fill - the identified - safety and effectiveness data gaps for these ingredients - or at another time if these studies are not completed.6\n\nFootnote 6: The CARES Act added section 505G to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C Act). Under 505G(a)(3) of the FD&C Act, drugs that were classified as category III in a tentative final monograph (TFM), including the 1994 TFM for over-the-counter topical antiseptic (59 FR 31402) - as further amended by the 2016 Consumer Antiseptic - Rub proposed rule (81 FR 42912) - are not required to have an approved application under section 505 in order to be marketed, as long as they are in conformity with the relevant conditions of use outlined in the applicable TFM and comply with all other applicable requirements for nonprescription drugs.\n\nThe Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR covers OTC consumer antiseptic - rub products - that are sometimes - referred to as rubs, leave-on products, or hand sanitizers. The Consumer AntisepticRub FR also covers OTC consumer antiseptic - wipes. These products are intended to be used when soap and water are not available - and are left on and not rinsed off with water.\n\nThe Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR does not address the monograph - status of other OTC antiseptic - products, including: (1) consumer antiseptic - washes, which are personal care products - that are intended - for use with water and are rinsed off after use, such as antibacterial - soaps, antibacterial - hand washes, and antibacterial - body - washes; (2) health care antiseptic, which are antiseptic - products that are intended for use by health care professionals - in a hospital setting or other health care situations - outside of the hospital; (3) first aid antiseptic, - which are skin antiseptic, skin-wound - cleansers, and skin-wound - protectants used primarily - by consumers for first aid use; and (4) antiseptic - used by the food industry. - The monograph - status of the active ingredients - intended for use in these other OTC antiseptic - products - has been and/or will be addressed separately.\n\nWhat active ingredients are subject to the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR?\n\nIn the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR, we found that three active ingredients - were eligible - for evaluation under the OTC Drug Review for use in a consumer antiseptic - rub. The three ingredients - are:\n\nEthyl alcohol\n\nIsopropyl alcohol\n\nAs noted above, FDA temporarily - deferred - a final determination - regarding the GRAS/GRAE - status of these three active ingredients - to allow time for interested parties to complete the studies necessary to fill - the safety and effectiveness data gaps - identified - for these ingredients.\n\nIn the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR, we also found 28 active ingredients - ineligible - for evaluation under the OTC Drug Review as a consumer antiseptic - rub. The 28 ingredients - are:\n\ncetyl phosphate\n\nChloroxylenol\n\nCloflucarban\n\npotassium vegetable oil solution, phosphate sequestering agent, and triethanolamine\n\nFluorosalan\n\nHexachlororphene\n\nHexylesercinol\n\nIodine complex (ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate)\n\nIodine complex (phosphate ester of alkylaryloxy polyethylene glycol)\n\nMethylbenzothium chloride\n\nNonylphenoxyypoly (ethyleneoxy) ethanoliodine\n\nPhenol (equal to or less than 1.5 percent or greater than 1.5 percent)\n\nPoloxamer iodine complex\n\nPolyhexamethylene biguanide\n\nPovidone-iodine (5 to 10 percent)\n\nSalicylic acid\n\nSecondary amyltricresols\n\nSodium hypochlorite\n\nSodium oxychlorosene\n\nTea Tree Oil\n\nTribromsalan\n\nTrickocarban\n\nTrickosan\n\nTriple dye\n\nUndecoylium chloride iodine complex\n\nWhen and how do manufacturers have to comply with this final rule?\n\nIn the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR, FDA found 28 active ingredients - ineligible - for evaluation under the OTC Drug Review as a consumer antiseptic - rub. On or after the April 13, 2020, effective date of the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR, any OTC consumer antiseptic - rub drug product containing - one or more of the 28 ingredients - that FDA has found ineligible - cannot be introduced or delivered for introduction - into interstate commerce unless the drug product is the subject of an approved NDA or ANDA. This means that manufacturers will need to obtain an NDA or ANDA to market consumer antiseptic - rub drug products containing - any of these 28 active ingredients. Alternatively, manufacturers of consumer antiseptic - rubs containing - antiseptic - active ingredients - can comply with the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR by removing their products from the market, or reformulating - them to remove the ineligible - active ingredients, - and then marketing - them appropriately (e.g., by substituting - one of the three active ingredients - described above or by marketing - the products as antiseptic-free - rubs or wipes without drug claims).\n\nWhat if my OTC antiseptic product uses an active ingredient not mentioned in the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub final rule?\n\nOTC consumer antiseptic - rub or wipe products containing - active ingredients not mentioned in the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR are considered new drugs, for which an approved NDA or ANDA is required before marketing such products. Manufacters of such products can also pursue one of the alternatives - explained in Q3 to comply - with this final rule.\n\nWhy did FDA not address final formulation - testing or labeling in the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR?\n\nWe did not address final product formulation - testing or labeling - requirements in the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR because none of the consumer antiseptic - rub active ingredients - that are the subject of the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR were found to be GRAS/GRAE - for use in consumer antiseptic - rub products. Final formulation - testing and labeling - for the three deferred active ingredients - may be addressed in the future once their GRAS/GRAE - determination - has been concluded.\n\nWhy were three consumer antiseptic - rub active ingredients deferred from further rulemaking?\n\nFDA temporarily - deferred a final determination - on the GRAS/GRAE status of - three active ingredients - used in consumer antiseptic -benzyl-benzkonium - chloride, ethyl alcohol, and isopropyl alcohol--to allow time for interested parties to complete - the studies necessary to fill the safety and effectiveness data gaps identified - for these ingredients. - FDA made the decision - to defer that determination - in response to several requests submitted - to the 2016 Consumer Antiseptic - Rub PR.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhere can I get more information, if needed?\n\nQuestions regarding compliance with the Consumer Antiseptic Rub FR should be directed to CDERCompliance@fda.hhs.gov. Questions regarding other OTC issues should be directed to OTCDrugs@fda.hhs.gov.\n--------------------\nContext title: Consumer Antiseptic Rub Final Rule Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA\'s specific recommendations on the data and information needed to support a positive GRASE determination under the SIA are detailed in sections II (pharmaceutical quality/manufacturing information), III (safety data), and IV (effectiveness data). Section V presents FDA\'s current thinking on an approach to safety testing of final sunscreen formulations that it anticipates adopting in the future.\n\nAlthough sunscreen products are typically formulated with two or more active ingredients, the recommendations in sections II through IV generally contemplate that testing will be performed using formulations including one active ingredient FDA anticipates that these data would also generally be sufficient to assess whether, and under what conditions, that active ingredient is GRASE for use as part of a combination of sunscreen active ingredients. In some situations, additional data and testing beyond what is recommended in this guidance may be needed to support a positive GRASE determination and to establish the associated conditions for a particular active ingredient. The following are examples in which additional data may be needed:\n\nData suggest that there may be a safety or efficacy concern with a particular combination of active ingredients or active and inactive ingredients\n\nInformation indicates that an active ingredient is unstable when exposed to sunlight and suggests that the active ingredient may need to be combined with a photostabilizer to be safe or effective\n\nOther situations may occur in which additional data are needed (see, e.g., section III for some additional examples). Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA any questions about whether additional data may be needed for a particular active ingredient.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Pharmaceutical Quality/Manufacturing Information\n\nFDA needs information that sufficiently characterizes the identity of each sunscreen active ingredient for FDA reviewers to determine how, if at all, the safety and efficacy studies submitted for review are relevant to the ingredient for which GRASE determination is sought.10 This information would also be needed to appropriately characterize the active ingredient in the final sunscreen order. Sponsors should provide the compendial status of the ingredient, including reference to a United States Pharmacopeia National Formulary monograph. Sponsors should also provide any known chemical and/or manufacturing characteristics of the active ingredient that may be relevant to FDA\'s GRASE evaluation and to the establishment of the conditions of any resulting final sunscreen order.11 Such information should include known interactions with other sunscreen active ingredient(s) or commonly used sunscreen vehicle component(s) and particle size information for micronized or nanoscale active ingredients. In addition, sponsors should describe any aspects of formulation that are needed to ensure stability, or other characteristics of the active ingredient that are needed to establish conditions under which it is GRASE for use in sunscreens.\n\nFootnote 11: The determination of whether a sunscreen active ingredient is GRASE and not misbranded also requires the Agency to describe the conditions under which any future product incorporating that sunscreen active ingredient will be GRASE and not misbranded (see, e.g., section 586C(e) of the FD&C Act; see also section V of this document).\n\n3 Safety Data\n\nFDA\'s OTC drug regulations identify both the general types of safety information that sponsors should submit as evidence that an OTC drug is GRASE for use as labeled (SS 330.10(a)(2) (21 CFR 330.10(a)(2))) and the standard by which such safety information is to be judged (SS 330.10(a)(4)(i)). When applying these regulations to a given active ingredient, FDA uses its scientific expertise to determine what constitutes ""adequate tests by methods reasonably applicable to show the drug is safe under the prescribed, recommended, or suggested conditions of use.""12\n\nFootnote 12: § 330.10(a)(4)(i).\n\nFDA recognizes the contribution that broad spectrum sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) value of 15 or higher can make to decrease the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging caused by the sun if used as directed with other sun protection measures. To protect the public health, it is also important for FDA to balance the potential benefits of these sunscreen products to consumers against their potential risks. Providing an adequate safety margin13 for OTC sunscreen active ingredients and finished sunscreen products is a key element of FDA\'s risk assessment. When determining the specific testing and other data needed to adequately demonstrate that an OTC sunscreen active ingredient is safe, FDA considers both the circumstances under which OTC sunscreen products are intended to be used by consumers and current scientific knowledge and assessment technology.\n\nFootnote 13: For drugs with a known potential for adverse effects based on animal data, the anticipated level of risk for humans may be quantified using a safety margin calculation. A safety margin calculation takes the highest animal no observed adverse effect level and estimates a maximum safe level of exposure for humans. One caveat to the safety margin calculation is that animal studies do not always predict effects in humans, and the actual threshold for an effect in humans may be different (higher or lower) than in the species tested. The human sensitivity to a drug is often unknown. To account for this, the predicted safe exposure level in humans that is reflected in the safety margin is well below where toxicities were seen in animals.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nHuman dermal safety studies for topical products in which exposure to light after application is anticipated generally consist of two sets of studies--those conducted without specific exposure to light and those conducted to assess reactions after ultraviolet exposure (photosafety studies).17 These study sets usually consist of dermal irritation patch testing, dermal sensitization patch testing, dermal phototoxicity testing, and dermal photoallergenicity testing.\n\nFootnote 17: See the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidance for industry S10 Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance Web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidancCompilanceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nBecause marketed sunscreen products typically contain a combination of active ingredients and because brand name product formulations frequently change, it is difficult for FDA to determine causal links between individual active ingredients and reported irritation and hypersensitivity adverse events associated with a particular product. Therefore, FDA generally expects to use data from human irritation studies, human skin sensitization studies, and human photosafety studies, in conjunction with postmarketing adverse event data, to inform GRASE determinations and labeling. Nonetheless, in some cases, depending on the rigor of available postmarketing safety information, it may be reasonable for sponsors to omit human irritation studies, human skin sensitization studies, and/or human photosafety studies. For example, if FDA concludes that there is a positive risk-benefit for a sunscreen active ingredient but that it is known to be a sensitizer, it may be possible to develop safety labeling to address this risk without data generated in the human dermal safety studies described below. Sponsors who believe there is a scientific rationale that may preclude the need for some or all of the described studies are urged to contact FDA before initiating studies.\n\na. Human irritation and sensitization studies\n\nStudies of skin irritation and sensitization that use the repeat insult patch test or other relevant tests are recommended elements in FDA\'s safety evaluation of topical drug products that, like sunscreens, are applied to the skin repeatedly over long periods of time. These tests, which are designed to detect the potential of topical drug products for local dermatologic events with fewer subjects than might be observed in larger clinical trials, often involve applying product more frequently and/or for longer durations than the proposed clinical dosing of those drug products. In dermal irritation studies, a test substance is applied to a small pad (patch) and affixed to the test subject\'s skin, usually on the back, to determine whether the ingredient causes direct skin toxicity. Dermal sensitization studies are conducted similarly but are designed to detect immunologically mediated reactions, which require prior exposure to the allergen.\n\nNonprescription sunscreen active ingredients, when found to be GRASE, may be used in numerous, as yet unknown, product formulations. Therefore, FDA recommends that cumulative irritation studies evaluate (1) the proposed sunscreen active ingredient at the highest concentration for which a GRASE determination is sought, in an appropriate vehicle; (2) the vehicle alone; (3) a negative control; and (4) a positive control. The evaluation should include scoring of erythema, edema, and a popular response or skin erosion.\n\nSkin sensitization studies, conducted to detect immunologically mediated reactions, should be conducted in the following three phases:\n\nThe induction phase (three weekly applications for 3 weeks)\n\nThe rest phase (no product application for 10 to 14 days)\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonprescription Sunscreen Drug Products – Safety and Effectiveness Data'

This guidance document is being implemented immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency\'s good guidance practices.\n\nThe contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way, unless specifically incorporated into a contract. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law. FDA guidance documents, including this guidance, should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThere is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The virus has been named ""SARS-CoV-2"" and the disease it causes has been named ""Coronavirus Disease 2019"" (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, HHS issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.1 In addition, on March 13, 2020, there was a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in response to COVID-19.2\n\nFootnote 1: Secretary of Health and Human Services, Determination that a Public Health Emergency Exists (originally issued Jan. 31, 2020, and subsequently renewed), _available at_https://www.phe.gov/emergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx.\n\nFootnote 2: Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak (Mar. 13, 2020), _available at_https://trumpwhitechouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/.\n\nHypercoagulability, an abnormally increased risk for blood clotting, has been observed in patients with COVID-19. Laboratory abnormalities commonly observed among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 associated coagulopathy include: mild thrombocytopenia, increased D-dimer levels, increased fibrin degradation products, and prolonged prothrombin time.3 Hypercoagulability has been most notably reported in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).4 FDA believes the policy set forth in this guidance will help address these urgent public health concerns by helping to expand the availability and capability of coagulation systems for measurement of whole blood viscoelastic properties. Coagulation systems for measurement of whole blood viscoelastic properties can help identify changes in coagulation status and are used routinely as an aid in the assessment of hemostasis in the perioperative period of select surgical procedures and in the assessment of bleeding and thrombosis following a traumatic injury or event. Modified use of these devices in hospital patient healthcare settings may increase access to important examination of whole blood viscoelastic properties to facilitate patient management by healthcare providers during the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThe enforcement policy described in Section IV of this guidance applies to the legally marketed coagulation systems listed in Table 1 intended for use in measuring the dynamics of clot formation, firmness, and dissolution as affected by the kinetics of thrombin generation, platelet activation, fibrin generation, clot strength, clot stability, and inhibitory effects in whole blood, and that have been subsequently modified to facilitate patient management by healthcare providers during the COVID-19 public health emergency. The output for these coagulation systems consists of semi-quantitative results and a graphical display (e.g., tracing or curve) that demonstrates the kinetic changes of whole blood as it clots over time.\n\nIV. Policy\n\nAs hypercoagulability has been observed in patients with COVID-19, FDA recognizes the importance and utility of increased availability of devices to test for and manage coagulopathies in patients in hospitals and other healthcare facilities, which are experiencing increased patient load due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. In developing this policy, FDA\'s intent is to foster the continued availability of safe and effective medical devices while being flexible regarding certain modifications made to coagulation systems for measurement of whole blood viscoelastic properties to include use in hospital patient healthcare settings in response to the COVID-19 public health emergency. Currently, coagulation systems for measurement of whole blood viscoelastic properties have not been cleared or approved for use in hospital patient healthcare settings. FDA recognizes that expanded use of coagulation systems for measurement of whole blood viscoelastic properties may help facilitate the assessment of hemostasis beyond the perioperative and trauma settings. Thus, FDA does not intend to object to limited modifications to the\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \\hline\nDevice Type & Classification Regulation & Product Code & Class \\ \\hline Multipurpose system for in vitro coagulation studies & 21 CFR 864.5425 & JPA5 & II \\ \\hline Coagulation system for the measurement of whole blood viscoelastic properties & 21 CFR 864.54306  & QFR & II \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1:indications, functionality, hardware, and/or software of the coagulation systems for measurement of whole blood viscoelastic properties that are within the scope of this guidance as identified in Section III, without prior submission of a premarket notification under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 807.81,7 where the modification does not create an undue risk to the patient in light of the public health emergency.8 This policy applies where a modification is made to the device that would typically require that a manufacturer submit a new 510(k) submission to FDA.\n\nFootnote 7: For further guidance on modifications that trigger the requirement that a manufacturer submit a new premarket notification (510(k)) to FDA, refer to “Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/deciding-when-submit-510k-change-existing-device.\n\nFootnote 8: Certain modifications to the indications, functionality, or hardware or software of the exempt devices in Table 1 may require premarket notification subject to the limitations of the exemption under 21 CFR 864.9.\n\nManufacturers must document changes to their device in their device master record and change control records and make this information available to FDA, if requested, as required by 21 CFR 820.30 and 21 CFR 820.180.\n--------------------\nContext title: Coagulation Systems for Measurement of Viscoelastic Properties- Enforcement Policy During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency (Revised) Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats including emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to provide a policy to help expand the availability and capability of sterilizers, disinfectant devices, and air purifiers during this public health emergency.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act).\n\nGiven this public health emergency, and as discussed in the Notice in the Federal Register of March 25, 2020, titled ""Process for Making Available Guidance Documents Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019,"" _available at_https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-03-25/pdf/2020-06222.pdf, this guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because the FDA has determined that prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate (see section 701(h)(1)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 10.115(g)(2)). This guidance document is being implemented immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency\'s good guidance practices.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThere is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The virus has been named ""SARS-CoV-2"" and the disease it causes has been named ""Coronavirus Disease 2019"" (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, HHS issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.1 In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.2\n\nSARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated the capability to spread rapidly, leading to significant impacts on health care systems and causing societal disruption. The potential public health threat posed by COVID-19 is high, both globally and to the United States. To respond effectively to the COVID-19 outbreak, appropriate clinical management and infection control in conjunction with implementation of community mitigation efforts are critical.\n\nFDA believes the policy set forth in this guidance will help address these urgent public health concerns by helping to increase the availability of sterilizers, disinfect devices, and air purifiers during this public health emergency. Increased access to these devices may facilitate rapid turnaround of sterilized or disinfected medical equipment and reduce the risk of viral exposure for patients and health care providers to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nFootnote 1: Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M Azar, Determination that a Public Health Emergency Exists. (Jan. 31, 2020), available at https://www.phe.gov/emergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/2019-nCoV_aspx).\n\nFootnote 2: Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak (Mar. 13, 2020), available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/.\n\nIII Scope\n\nThe enforcement policies described in this guidance apply to the following devices and their accessories during the COVID-19 public health emergency. This enforcement policy applies to devices that already have FDA marketing authorization, as well as devices that are not currently marketed but would fall under one of the classification regulations set forth below.\n\nA Sterilizers\n\nSterilizers for use in a health care facility are medical devices that are regulated by FDA and are intended to render medical devices sterile (i.e., free from viable microorganisms). Sterilizers vary in both construction (ranging from small table-top sterilizers to large sterilizers intended for large loads) and modality (e.g., steam, ethylene oxide, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, etc.). FDA evaluates and authorizes sterilizers for marketing with specific cycle parameters intended for specific loads and with their own sterilization accessories (e.g., biological indicators, chemical indicators, wraps, trays,\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]\n\n2 Ultraviolet (UV) Disinfecting Devices\n\nUV disinfecting devices are devices that use UVA or UVC light to produce a germicidal effect. They are intended to augment disinfection of health care environmental surfaces after manual cleaning has been performed. UV disinfecting devices include UV radiation chamber disinfection devices, which are regulated as Class II devices under 21 CFR 880.6600 (product code OSZ).8\n\nFootnote 8: Subject to special controls.\n\nAppendix C Air Purifiers\n\nAir purifying devices are intended for medical purposes to kill pathogens/microorganisms in the air by exposure to UV radiation or remove them through filtration. The classification regulations and associated product codes for air purifying devices, to which the policy in this guidance applies, are listed in Table 3:\n\nAppendix H Policy\n\nIn the context of the COVID-19 public health emergency, it is necessary to maintain an adequatesupply of sterilizers, disinfectant devices, and air purifiers that can facilitate rapid turnaround of sterilized or disinfected medical equipment and that help reduce the risk of viral exposure for patients and health care providers to SARS-CoV-2. FDA believes that certain sterilizers, disinfectant devices, and air purifiers falling within the scope of this guidance (see Section III) may help reduce this risk of viral exposure based on our current understanding of these devices and SARS-CoV-2.\n--------------------\nContext title: Enforcement Policy for Sterilizers, Disinfectant Devices, and Air Purifiers During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n--------------------\nContext: In this guideline, requirements of specific sections of 21 CFR Part 211 are presented along with practices and procedures that FDA believes may be useful to persons seeking to meet those requirements. This guideline does not attempt to address all sections of the regulations that apply to the preparation of investigational new drug products, but rather only those sections for which questions have been raised most frequently.\n\nIII. CONTROL OF COMPONENTS\n\nRequirements\n\nSection 211.80(a) requires, in part, control of components and drug product containers and closures by means of written procedures that detail handling, identification, sampling, testing, and storage.\n\nSection 211.84(a) requires, in part, testing or examination as appropriate and approval of components, containers, and closures, before use.\n\nGuidance\n\nFDA recognizes that the experimental nature of the drug substance, formulation, and dosage form at an early stage of development will have an impact on establishing specifications. At early stages, the acceptance/rejection criteria may not be as specific; however, it is vital that such criteria be scientifically sound and based upon available scientific data. Specifications used as the basis for approval or rejection of components, containers, and closures will be more specific and uniform as additional data become available. It is vital that, at all stages, specifications used are fully documented.\n\nIV. PRODUCTION AND PROCESS CONTROLs\n\nRequirements\n\nSection 211.100 requires, in part, that procedures that have a bearing on quality of drug products be written, be approved by the quality control unit, and be followed and documented in the execution of the production and process controls.\n\nGuidance\n\nDuring the IND stage of drug development, written production and control procedures are developed and initially may be more general because such procedures and controls are usually undergoing considerable refinement. However, initial procedures should be as complete and detailed as knowledge and experience with the product and dosage form permit. It is important that initial procedures be reviewed and approved prior to implementation, that they be followed, and that they be documented at the time of performance. It is vital that actual specific process control procedures and conditions such as timing, temperature, pressure, and adjustments (e.g., mixing, filtration, drying) be fully documented to permit review and approval by the quality control unit and to permit development of more specific written production and control procedures as research and development reach conclusion. It is essential that all changes from initial procedures be fully documented, and be based on well-founded scientific data or expert knowledge of a researcher having training and experience in the field of science being applied.\n\nV. CALCULATION OF YIELD\n\nRequirements\n\nSection 211.103 requires calculations of actual yield and percentages of theoretical yield, at each appropriate phase of the process. Further, it is required that the calculations be verified by a second person.\n\nSection 211.186(b)(7) requires that master production and control records include a statement of theoretical yield along with limits on percentages of theoretical yield that trigger investigations of discrepancies.\n\nSection 211.188(b)(7) requires that batch production records include statements of actual and percentage of theoretical yields at appropriate phases of processing.\n\nGuidance\n\nSignificant differences between actual and theoretical yields can signal processing errors that result in mixups, superpotency, subpotency, and contamination. It is, therefore, essential to reconcile those differences. In the case of investigational new drugs, a variety of factors, such as the preparation of relatively small batch sizes and subdivision of in-process material for research purposes, may result in significant yield discrepancies. Those resulting discrepancies may not necessarily imply problems. However, even in the presence of such factors, yield discrepancies should be evaluated because other potential factors may have induced the discrepancies and may signal processing errors.\n\nSpecifications regarding theoretical yield that would trigger an investigation may initially be wider than at later stages of the drug product\'s development. However, it is vital that those initial specifications be established using the best information available, and that they assure a final product that meets identity, strength, and purity specifications. As clinical investigations progress and experience with production of the product increases, it is expected that these specifications will narrow, reaching levels that will be appropriate for full scale commercial production. Where yield discrepancies are significant or unexplained, it is essential that products not be released unless and until there is reconciliation of all materials used at each appropriate phase of production and other appropriate investigations have been conducted.\n\nVI. EQUIPMENT IDENTIFICATION\n\nRequirements\n\nSection 211.105 requires, in part, that all compounding and storage containers, processing lines, and major equipment be identified to indicate their contents and, when necessary, the phase of production.\n\nGuidance\n\nFDA recognizes that investigational new drug products are sometimes prepared on a small scale basis, using equipment considerably downsized from devices used in commercial scale production. When such small scale equipment is used in an enclosed area, dedicated exclusively to one batch, adequate identification may be attained by a single sign used in a manner that appropriately identifies the material, stage of production, and batch number of the product.\n\nWhere several containers, each holding material at a different processing stage, are in proximity to each other (likely in small scale production), it is important that each container be appropriately identified in order to prevent mixups.\n\nVII. PACKAGING AND LABELING OPERATIONS\n\nRequirements\n\nSection 211.130 requires, in part, that written procedures be designed and followed to assure that correct labels and labeling materials are used for drug products..\n\nSection 211.130(b) requires a lot or control number (defined at $ 210.3(b)(ll)) for identification of the drug product.\n\nGuidance\n\nFor investigational new drug products, certain labeling information may be provided separately from the drug container, where it is essential to the clinical study objectives that the drug(s) be provided as ""blinded."" In such cases a code-breaking guide is furnished to each investigator for emergency uses.

New data suggest that the systemic exposure to these active ingredients is higher than previously thought, and new information about the potential risks from systemic absorption and long-term exposure has become available. Moreover, new safety information also suggests that widespread antiseptic use can have an impact on the development of bacterial resistance. Accordingly, the safety data needed to demonstrate safety for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients fall into three broad categories: (1) safety data studies in current FDA guidance (e.g., preclinical and human pharmacokinetic studies (including maximal use trials, developmental and reproductive toxicity studies, and carcinogenicity studies); (2) data to characterize potential hormonal effects; and (3) data to evaluate the development of resistance. These data requirements are the minimum data necessary to establish the safety of long-term, daily, repeated exposure to antiseptic active ingredients used in consumer wash products (81 FR 61106 at 61107).']",0.0,0.5333333333333333
2,"With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?","['--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?\n--------------------\nContext: Under what circumstances may QAU audit reports be inspected by FDA? Is there any requirement to maintain these reports or can they be discarded?\n\nQU audit reports as a matter of administrative policy are exempt from routine FDA inspection. FDA\'s access to QAU audit reports would be through the Courts should the subject matter of those reports be litigated. Since there is no FDA requirement that these reports be maintained, the disposition of these reports is up to the firm\'s management. FDA advises that such records not be destroyed without the firm seeking advice from its legal counsel.\n4. What are the quality assurance unit inspection requirements for acute and short-term studies?\n\nFor studies lasting less than 4 weeks, each final report should be reviewed by the quality assurance unit for accuracy. With regard to the in process phases (dose preparation, dose administration, in vivo observation and measurement, necropsy, etc.), a random sampling approach could be used so that over a series of studies each critical phase has been monitored. The random sampling approach should be statistically designed so that it is adequate for revealing GLP deviations. The approach and its justification should be made a part of the standard operating procedures of the quality assurance unit.\n5. What constitutes proper quality assurance unit inspection of each phase of a nonclinical laboratory study?A variety of procedures are acceptable for performing a quality assurance unit inspection. The GLPs do not mandate specific procedures. The development of an acceptable procedure should not necessarily be limited to but should consider the following:\n\n(a) nonclinical laboratory studies lasting longer than 6 months should be inspected every 3 months; whereas, studies lasting less than 6 months should be inspected at suitable intervals,\n\n(b) each phase of the study should be inspected,\n\n(c) inspection reports are to be submitted to management and to the study director, and\n\n(d) the purpose of the inspections is to identify significant problems, which may affect study integrity, and to determine that no changes from approved protocols or standard operating procedures were made without proper authorization.\n\nThe phases of a particular study will be determined by the nature of the study. For example, the phases of a typical feeding study include the following:\n\nprotocol development and approval\n\ntest article characterization\n\ntest article stability determination\n\ntest article-carrier mixture preparation\n\ntest article-carrier mixture sampling\n\ntest article-carrier mixture homogeneity determination\n\ntest system quarantine\n\ntest system allocation to housing\n\ntest article carrier mixture distribution to test system\n\nperiodic measurements\n\nanimal observations\n\nfood consumption\n\nbody weights\n\nblood sampling -- hematology and clinical chemistry\n\nnecropsy -- histopathology\n\nstatistical analyses and report preparation\n\nThe type of inspection will depend on the nature of the phase. Each phase must be inspected at least once during the study; the times selected for inspection should be those most likely to reveal problems before the quality of the data generated could be adversely affected.\n\nCould you take a typical subacute 14-day study and define the phases?Phases in a short term study (depending on the type) would include protocol preparation, dose preparation, animal allocation, test system dosage, animal observation, necropsy, data recording, data analysis and final report writing.\n\nBy what authority may the Agency examine master schedule sheets for studies, which may never be used in support of an application for a research or marketing permit?\n\nStudies that are not intended to be used to support an application for a research or marketing permit are not covered by the GLPs and need not appear on the master schedule sheet. If however, the studies are intended to be submitted, then they should be listed and can be inspected by the Agency under its authority to evaluate the results of studies designed to demonstrate product safety.\n\nAre acute studies to be included on the master schedule sheet?\n\nYes, if they fall within the scope of the GLPs.\n\nIn regard to the master schedule sheet, can the ""current status of each study"" be satisfied by listing the starting date and completion date of the study? Can the ""status of the final report"" be satisfied by listing the estimated or actual date of issuance of the final report?\n\nAlthough the GLPs do not specify entries for ""current status of each study,"" dates alone would not be adequate. Suggested entries that are possible include ""study proceeding according to protocol,"" ""study proceeding according to protocol as amended on such-and-such date,"" ""study terminated due to such-and-such,"" etc. Likewise, entries for the status of the final report might include ""awaiting final hematology report,"" ""data in statistical analysis,"" ""first draft prepared,"" ""draft under circulation for review and comment,"" etc.\n\nIn our laboratory, critical operations for all studies are carried out by the same individuals using essentially similar procedures. Would it be adequate for the quality assurance unit to inspect a set of representative operations for GLP and standard operating procedure compliance that would incorporate a good cross-section of studies?\n\nNo, but refer to the answer under question 4 above.\n\nIn reference to the quality assurance unit review of the final report, you have indicated that not all numbers have to be traced. Do you have in mind a standard, which describes an acceptable level of accuracy, e.g., 90%, 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%?The quality assurance unit review is to ensure that the final report accurately reflects the raw data. Inasmuch as final reports of certain long-term studies can encompass several hundred thousand observations, it would be a prodigious exercise for the quality assurance unit to verify and trace all raw data. Further, the Agency did not mean to require that the quality assurance unit review would include a check of the accuracy of the calculations used to arrive at the final report. This activity would be redundant since the contributing scientists would have already done so in preparing their reports. Rather, the review was expected to be of sufficient depth to reveal inaccuracies in the final report. Consequently, the Agency envisioned the development of a statistically based system, whereby; a random sample of the results in the final report is traced. The procedure should be made a part of the standard operating procedures. The Agency has not established an acceptable level of accuracy of the trace.\n\nIs the master schedule sheet intended to be prospective or historical? If it is historical, what is the required retention period?\n\nThe master schedule sheet is intended to include a listing of all nonclinical laboratory studies currently in progress as well as those which have been conducted during the terms specified in section 58.195 of the GLPs.\n* Does the master schedule sheet have to list studies on compounds for which no data has yet been submitted to the Agency?\n\nYes. The GLPs cover all nonclinical laboratory studies of Agency regulated products that support or are intended to support applications for research or marketing permits.\n* The GLPs state that the quality assurance unit should assure that the final report reflects the study results. Is it required that every final report be reviewed by the quality assurance unit?\n\nYes. This procedure helps to ensure the accuracy of the final report.\n* Does the quality assurance unit review of each final study report have to be reported to management?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?\n--------------------\nContext: It is important that the CGMP regulations are harmonized to the extent possible with other widely used quality management systems, including ISO 9000, non-U.S. pharmaceutical quality management requirements, and FDA's own medical device quality system regulations. This guidance serves as a first step to highlight common elements between the CGMP regulations and Quality Management Systems. With the globalization of pharmaceutical manufacturing and the increasing prevalence of drug- and biologic-device combination products, the convergence of quality management principles across different regions and among various product types is very desirable.\n\nThe FDA has concluded that modern quality systems, when coupled with manufacturing process and product knowledge and the use of effective risk management practices, can handle many types of changes to facilities, equipment, and processes without the need for prior approval regulatory submissions. Manufacturers with a robust quality system and appropriate process knowledge can implement many types of improvements. In addition, an effective quality system, by lowering the risk of manufacturing problems, may result in shorter and fewer FDA inspections.\n\nA quality system can provide the necessary framework for implementing quality by design4 (building in quality from the development phase and throughout a product's life cycle), continual improvement, and risk management in the drug manufacturing process. A quality system adopted by a manufacturer can be tailored to fit the specific environment, taking into account factors such as scope of operations, complexity of processes, and appropriate use of finite resources. Footnote 4: See ICH Q8 Pharmaceutical Development.\n\nScope of the Guidance\n\nThis guidance applies to manufacturers of drug products (finished pharmaceuticals), including products regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). It may also be useful to manufacturers of components (including active pharmaceutical ingredients) used in the manufacture of these products.\n\nThis document is not intended to create new requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturing that go beyond those established in the current regulations, nor is the guidance intended to be a guide for the conduct of FDA inspections. Rather, the document explains how implementing comprehensive quality systems can help manufacturers achieve compliance with 21 CFR parts210 and 211. Although the QS working group found that many of the quality system elements correlate with specific CGMP requirements, some do not. The Agency expects compliance with CGMP regulations, and FDA's inspection program will remain focused on compliance with those regulations.\n\nOrganization of this Guidance\n\nTo provide a reference familiar to industry, the quality systems model described in section IV of this guidance is organized -- in its major sections -- according to the structure of international quality standards. Major sections of the model include the following:\n\nManagement Responsibilities\n\nResources\n\nManufacturing Operations\n\nEvaluation Activities\n\nUnder each of these sections the key elements found in modern quality systems are discussed. When an element correlates with a CGMP regulatory requirement, that correlation is noted. In some cases, a specific CGMP regulation is discussed in more detail as it relates to a quality system element. At the end of each section, a table is included listing the quality system elements of that section and the specific CGMP regulations with which they correlate. A glossary is included at the end of the document.\n\nIII CGMPS and the Concepts of Modern Quality Systems\n\nSeveral key concepts are critical for any discussion of modern quality systems. The following concepts are used throughout this guidance as they relate to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.\n\nQuality\n\nEvery pharmaceutical product has established identity, strength, purity, and other quality characteristics designed to ensure the required levels of safety and effectiveness. For the purposes of this guidance document, the phrase achieving quality means achieving these characteristics for a product.\n\nQuality by Design and Product Development\n\nQuality by design means designing and developing a product and associated manufacturing processes that will be used during product development to ensure that the product consistently attains a predefined quality at the end of the manufacturing process.5 Quality by design, in conjunction with a quality system, provides a sound framework for the transfer of product knowledge and process understanding from drug development to the commercial manufacturing processes and for post-development changes and optimization. The CGMP regulations, when viewed in their entirety, incorporate the concept of quality by design. This guidance describes how these elements fit together.\n\nAppendix C Quality Risk Management\n\nQuality risk management is a valuable component of an effective quality systems framework.6 Quality risk management can, for example, help guide the setting of specifications and process parameters for drug manufacturing, assess and mitigate the risk of changing a process or specification, and determine the extent of discrepancy investigations and corrective actions.\n\nFootnote 6: See ICH Q9 Quality Risk Management.\n\nCAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action)\n\nCAPA is a well-known CGMP regulatory concept that focuses on investigating, understanding, and correcting discrepancies while attempting to prevent their recurrence. Quality system models discuss CAPA as three separate concepts, all of which are used in this guidance.\n\nRemedial corrections of an identified problem\n\nRoot cause analysis with corrective action to help understand the cause of the deviation and potentially prevent recurrence of a similar problem\n\nPreventive action to avert recurrence of a similar potential problem\n\nChange Control\n\nChange control is another well-known CGMP concept that focuses on managing change to prevent unintended consequences. The CGMP regulations provide for change control primarily through the assigned responsibilities of the quality control unit. Certain major manufacturing changes (e.g., changes that alter specifications, a critical product attribute or bioavailability) require regulatory filings and prior regulatory approval (21 CFR 314.70, 514.8, and 601.12).\n\nEffective change control activities (e.g., quality planning and control of revisions to specifications, process parameters, procedures) are key components of any quality system. In this guidance, change is discussed in terms of creating a regulatory environment that encourages change towards continual improvement. This means a manufacturer is empowered to make changes subject to the regulations based on the variability of materials used in manufacturing and process improvements resulting from knowledge gained during a product's lifecycle.\n\nAppendix F The Quality Unit\n\nMany of the modern quality system concepts described here correlate very closely with the CGMP regulations (refer to the charts later in the document). Current industry practice generally divides the responsibilities of the quality control unit (QCU), as defined in the CGMP regulations, between quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) functions.\n\nQC usually involves (1) assessing the suitability of incoming components, containers, closures, labeling, in-process materials, and the finished products; (2) evaluating the performance of the manufacturing process to ensure adherence to proper specifications and limits; and (3) determining the acceptability of each batch for release.\n\nQA primarily involves (1) review and approval of all procedures related to production and maintenance, (2) review of associated records, and (3) auditing and performing/evaluating trend analyses.\n\nThis guidance uses the term quality unit7 (QU) to reflect modern practice while remaining consistent with the CGMP definition in SS 210.3(b)(15). The concept of a quality unit is also consistent with modern quality systems in ensuring that the various operations associated with all systems are appropriately planned, approved, conducted, and monitored.\n\nFootnote 7: Generally, the term quality unit is used in this guidance. However, quality control unit is used when directly quoting parts 210 and 211.\n\nThe CGMP regulations specifically assign the QU the authority to create, monitor, and implement a quality system. Such activities do not substitute for, or preclude, the daily responsibility of manufacturing personnel to build quality into the product. The QU should not take on the responsibilities of other units of a manufacturer's organization, such as the responsibilities handled by manufacturing personnel, engineers, and development scientists.8 Manufacturing personnel and the QU are both critical in fulfilling the manufacturer's responsibility to produce quality products.\n\nFootnote 8: See Reference #1, comment 91.\n\nOther CGMP assigned responsibilities of the QU are consistent with modern quality system approaches (SS 211.22):\n\nEnsuring that controls are implemented and completed satisfactorily during manufacturing operations\n\nEnsuring that developed procedures and specifications are appropriate and followed, including those used by a firm under contract to the manufacturer\n\nApproving or rejecting incoming materials, in-process materials, and drug products\n\nReviewing production records and investigating any unexplained discrepancies\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations""

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?\n--------------------\nContext: Pharmaceutical Quality System (4.8)\n\nPQS expectations are the same for batch and CM processes and should follow pertinent ICH guidances. One important operational aspect of CM is that nonconforming materials can be diverted from the rest of the batch when material traceability, process monitoring, and material diversion strategies are well established. Procedures for material diversion, when required, should be established under the PQS (see section IV.B (4.2)). An overarching plan or decision tree that describes how disturbances are managed for various types of material diversion should be maintained under the PQS. Diverted materials resulting from planned events (e.g., system start-up and shutdown) generally do not require investigation when the events meet established process performance criteria. Examples of approaches for managing disturbances are provided in Annex V. As described therein, when unexpected and/or frequent disturbances occur, appropriate investigation, root cause analysis, and corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) should be instituted.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nI.

An independent quality unit/structure with authority to fulfill certain pharmaceutical quality system responsibilities is required by regional regulations. 5. Conduct management reviews of process performance and product quality and of the pharmaceutical quality system. 6. Advocate continual improvement. 7. Commit appropriate resources.\n\nQuality Policy (2.2)\n\nSenior management should establish a quality policy that describes the overall intentions and direction of the company related to quality.\n\nThe quality policy should include an expectation to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and should facilitate continual improvement of the pharmaceutical quality system.\n\nThe quality policy should be communicated to and understood by personnel at all levels in the company.\n\nThe quality policy should be reviewed periodically for continuing effectiveness.\n\nQuality Planning (2.3)\n\nSenior management should ensure the quality objectives to implement the quality policy are defined and communicated.\n\nQuality objectives should be supported by all relevant levels of the company.\n\nQuality objectives should align with the company's strategies and be consistent with the quality policy.\n\nManagement should provide the appropriate resources and training to achieve the quality objectives. 5. Performance indicators that measure progress against quality objectives should be established, monitored, communicated regularly, and acted upon as appropriate as described in section V.A (4.1) of this document.\n\nResource Management (2.4)\n\nManagement should determine and provide adequate and appropriate resources (human, financial, materials, facilities, and equipment) to implement and maintain the pharmaceutical quality system and continually improve its effectiveness. 2. Management should ensure that resources are appropriately applied to a specific product, process, or site.\n\nInternal Communication (2.5)\n\nManagement should ensure appropriate communication processes are established and implemented within the organization. 2. Communications processes should ensure the flow of appropriate information between all levels of the company. 3. Communication processes should ensure the appropriate and timely escalation of certain product quality and pharmaceutical quality system issues.\n\nManagement Review (2.6)\n\nSenior management should be responsible for pharmaceutical quality system governance through management review to ensure its continuing suitability and effectiveness. 2. Management should assess the conclusions of periodic reviews of process performance and product quality and of the pharmaceutical quality system, as described in sections IV (3) and V (4).\n\nManagement of Outsourced Activities and Purchased Materials (2.7)\n\nThe pharmaceutical quality system, including the management responsibilities described in this section, extends to the control and review of any outsourced activities and quality of purchased materials. The pharmaceutical company is ultimately responsible to ensure processes are in place to assure the control of outsourced activities and quality of purchased materials. These processes should incorporate quality risk management and include:\n\nAssessing prior to outsourcing operations or selecting material suppliers, the suitability and competence of the other party to carry out the activity or provide the material using a defined supply chain (e.g., audits, material evaluations, qualification). 2. Defining the responsibilities and communication processes for quality-related activities of the involved parties. For outsourced activities, this should be included in a written agreement between the contract giver and contract acceptor. 3. Monitoring and review of the performance of the contract acceptor or the quality of the material from the provider, and the identification and implementation of any essential improvements. 4. Monitoring incoming ingredients and materials to ensure they are from approved sources using the agreed supply chain.\n\nManagement of Change in Product Ownership (2.8)\n\nWhen product ownership changes (e.g., through acquisitions), management should consider the complexity of this and ensure:\n\nThe ongoing responsibilities are defined for each company involved\n\nThe essential information is transferred\n\nIV Continual Improvement of Process Performance and Product Quality (3)\n\nThis section describes the lifecycle stage goals and the four specific pharmaceutical quality system elements that augment regional requirements to achieve the ICH Q10 objectives, as defined in section II.D (1.5). It does not restate all regional GMP requirements.\n\nLifecycle Stage Goals (3.1)\n\nThe goals of each product lifecycle stage are described below.\n\n1.1 Pharmaceutical Development (3.1.1)\n\nThe goal of pharmaceutical development activities is to design a product and its manufacturing process to consistently deliver the intended performance and meet the needs of patients and healthcare professionals, and regulatory authorities and internal customers' requirements. Approaches to pharmaceutical development are described in ICH Q8. The results of exploratory and clinical development studies, while outside the scope of this guidance, are inputs to pharmaceutical development.\n\n2.2 Technology Transfer (3.1.2)\n\nThe goal of technology transfer activities is to transfer product and process knowledge between development and manufacturing, and within or between manufacturing sites to achieve product realization. This knowledge forms the basis for the manufacturing process, control strategy, process validation approach, and ongoing continual improvement.\n\nCommercial Manufacturing (3.1.3)\n\nThe goals of manufacturing activities include achieving product realization, establishing and maintaining a state of control, and facilitating continual improvement. The pharmaceutical quality system should assure that the desired product quality is routinely met, suitable process performance is achieved, the set of controls are appropriate, improvement opportunities are identified and evaluated, and the body of knowledge is continually expanded.\n\nProduct Discontinuation (3.1.4)\n\nThe goal of product discontinuation activities is to manage the terminal stage of the product lifecycle effectively. For product discontinuation, a predefined approach should be used to manage activities such as retention of documentation and samples and continued product assessment (e.g., complaint handling and stability) and reporting in accordance with regulatory requirements.\n\nPharmaceutical Quality System Elements (3.2)\n\nThe elements described below might be required in part under regional GMP regulations.\n\nHowever, the Q10 model's intent is to enhance these elements to promote the lifecycle approach to product quality. These four elements are:\n\nProcess performance and product quality monitoring system\n\nCorrective action and preventive action (CAPA) system\n\nChange management system\n\nManagement review of process performance and product quality\n\nThese elements should be applied in a manner that is appropriate and proportionate to each of the product lifecycle stages, recognizing the differences among the stages and the different goals of each stage. Throughout the product lifecycle, companies are encouraged to evaluate opportunities for innovative approaches to improve product quality.\n\nEach element is followed by a table of example applications of the element to the stages of the pharmaceutical lifecycle.\n\nProcess Performance and Product Quality Monitoring System 3.2.1\n--------------------\nContext title: Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality System""]","['At the completion of a study, QAU records and inspection reports should be retained in the archives.']",0.0,0.0

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance outlines FDA\'s regulatory approach for approval of Class III in vitro diagnostic devices, as well as certain licensed1 or certain cleared2 in vitro diagnostic devices in cases, when a previously approved, licensed, or cleared assay is migrating (i.e., transitioning) to another system for which assay performance has not been evaluated by FDA.2 In this guidance the term ""new system"" refers to the system (assay, instrument, and software) to which the assay is migrating from a previously approved/licensed/cleared system. The term ""old system"" refers to the system (assay, instrument and software) which was approved/licensed/cleared from which the assay is migrating to a currently unapproved/unlicensed/uncleared system.\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance does not apply to immunohematology tests licensed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance can be used for 510(k) devices where the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy (http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm) does not apply (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests) and devices for which transitioning to a new system presents specific concerns, either because of the nature of the analyte and indications, or because of the specific technology used.\n\nThis guidance is focused on the study designs and performance criteria that should be fulfilled in order for a sponsor to utilize the migration study approach in support of the change. FDA will review information from the sponsor, including results of analytical and comparison studies outlined in this guidance, as well as device descriptions and risk analyses, to determine whether the use of the approved/licensed/cleared assay with the new system may compromise safety and effectiveness of the assay. The guidance document describes information that we recommend you include in a PMA (premarket approval application) supplement, a BLA (Biologicals License Application) supplement, or a 510(k) (premarket notification). For devices regulated by OIR (Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health, within CDRH), sponsors may contact OIR, and for those regulated by CBER, sponsors may contact CBER to obtain feedback concerning study plans.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe FDA believes that the assay migration study paradigm discussed in this guidance provides a least burdensome scientific and regulatory pathway for manufacturers to transfer a previously approved or licensed assay with full clinical data from an old system to a new system (not approved. licensed, or cleared). The paradigm is suitable in cases when sufficient knowledge can be derived from the documentation of design controls, risk analyses, and prior performance studies on an old system.\n\nIf you make further modifications or iterations of the old or new system you should compare back to the original old system that has full clinical data when performing new migration studies. However, if the old system with full clinical data is no longer available please contact the appropriate FDA CDRH or CBER Division for further discussion.\n\nThe migration studies approach is related to the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy that FDA uses for many Class I and Class II diagnostic devices.3 Similar to that policy, migration studies rest on the premise that as platform changes are made throughout the lifetime of an approved, licensed, or cleared assay, smaller and more focused analytical and clinical data sets, along with prior knowledge of device design and performance, could allow for a determination that the safety and effectiveness profile of the modified system has not been compromised.\n\nFootnote 3: http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm.\n\nThe assay migration study paradigm is practical, risk based, and consistent with FDA\'s Critical Path Initiative, which is intended to help bring new medical products to market successfully and efficiently4. FDA believes that with proper control and review, migration studies will meet regulatory thresholds for premarket review in a manner that will be least burdensome for both companies and FDA while protecting public health.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThis guidance is intended to be applied, where appropriate, to licensed donor screening tests5 and approved (Class III) in vitro diagnostic assays, as well as 510(k) cleared assays for which migration to a new system presents concerns. Possible scenarios for assay migration are when the assay is being transferred from a manual system to an automated or semi-automated instrument system or from a semi-automated instrument system to a fully automated instrument system, or from one automated instrument system to another (and vice versa for all scenarios). A broad variety of methodologies may use the migration studies paradigm depending on what is known about the two Systems involved. Assay transfer may be from one approved, licensed, or cleared old system to a new system that has the same technical characteristics. However, if scientific evidence suggests migration studies may not be adequate to predict actual clinical testing performance on the new system, the assay migration paradigm should not apply and FDA will recommend that traditional evaluation studies be performed.\n\nFootnote 5: FDA does not believe that this guidance is suitable for use in its entirety when immunohematology tests (e.g., blood grouping, blood group antibody detection and/or identification, crossmatching) are being migrated because of the differences in assay methodology and results reading and interpretation as compared to the other assays and systems described in this guidance. If you believe that your immunohematology reagents and system can be evaluated using the criteria outlined in this guidance, contact the responsible review division in CBER. Immunohematology products are reviewed in the Devices Review Branch, Division of Blood Applications, Office of Blood Research and Review, CBER.\n\nAssay migration studies are ideally suited for test systems for which the assay output (raw signal) is a numeric result or is expressed as a signal to cutoff (S/CO). Devices for which a numeric output is not available might be more difficult to analyze and may not be suitable candidates for use of this approach.\n\nMigration studies would not be applicable to the following devices or to system changes that are generally considered significant, such as:\n\nsystems intended for over-the-counter use,\n\nsystems intended for prescription home use, or\n\ndevices that do not meet the Critical Considerations criteria stated below.\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: Urgent public health need. Diagnostics with a public health impact can address unmet medical needs for both individual patients through early diagnosis, as well as informing the public health response by providing more detailed, timely information on disease incidence. These types of diagnostic assays can provide information on timing of infections (e.g., whether infection occurred within the last 6 months or further into the past). Individuals in the early stage of disease are at highest risk of transmission to their partners, and treatment and contact tracing can be effective in lowering risk. However, in the past, significant barriers existed for properly evaluating the performance of these tests in clinical cohorts. By allowing postmarket data collection to better confirm these tests\' medical benefits, uncertainties in the timing of infection can be validated while significantly streamlining the review process for devices with such a public health design scope.\n\nMigration. Migration is an approach used for approval of Class III in vitro diagnostic devices when a previously approved, licensed, or cleared assay is migrated to another system for which FDA has not evaluated assay performance. The paradigm is suitable in cases when sufficient knowledge can be derived for the documentation of design controls, risk analyses, and prior performance studies on an already marketed system. This paradigm uses smaller and more focused analytical and clinical data sets, along with prior knowledge of device design and performance. For more information, see Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices: Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff,available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Guidanc eDocuments/ucm092752.pdf. (\\circ) Example: The migration paradigm is often used on Class III devices for hepatitis to support device performance when the previously approved assay is transferred to a new instrument platform.\n\nConfirm mitigation effectiveness for a known risk in a post-approval study. Mitigations may be necessary for known safety risks associated with use of the device. Confirmation of the adequacy of the mitigation may be evaluated post-approval if mitigation of the risk is not fundamental to FDA\'s determination at the time of approval that the probable benefits outweigh the probable risks of the device. (\\circ) Example: After a permanent implant was recalled due to failures that could lead to death, a firm developed a novel software feature aimed at predicting those failures. The firm intends to incorporate that feature into its submission for a permanent implant intended for the same use as the recalled implant, which was marketed by a different company. The ability to predict failures would alert at-risk patients to see their clinician (and address the concern) prior to a life-threatening event. FDA might typically expect clinical data in a PMA to support this type of feature before approval. However, due to the public health need, FDA worked with the firm to use modeling on the novel software feature coupled with evaluation of published data to support premarket approval of the PMA. Clinical data on devices with the software feature were collected postmarket in a post-approval study, which was completed in a timely fashion after approval of the PMA. (\\circ) Example: For pacing and defibrillation leads, the degree of the changes in the products themselves and the potential impact to patient safety of those changes can affect the collection of data premarket and postmarket. For major changes (e.g., a completely new design, including new materials, new arrangement of those materials, and/or new connections) there will likely be more questions about impacts to patient safety, and thus a more rigorous set of premarket data (and a smaller degree of uncertainty) would be required before approval as compared to a lead with only minor changes. For example, even when a lead is new or significantly modified, FDA generally only requires 6 months to 2 years of data with a longer post-approval study to demonstrate long-term performance since the safety risks are well known.\n\nModify warnings, contraindications, precautions in approved labeling. Post-approval studies may be designed to collect further data on specific adverse events or event types for which there was limited knowledge during premarket review (e.g., small number of adverse events that occur within a subpopulation or uncertainty relating to the probability of minor adverse events), and the review of the postmarket data may result in revision of the warning, contraindications and/or precautions in the labeling.\n\nExample: When an in vitro diagnostic device is capable of detecting both common and rare targets (e.g., mutations or pathogens), the rare targets may be challenging to evaluate clinically in a timely manner. Such tests may be approved based on robust pre-clinical and clinical data for the common target(s) with masking of the rare target(s) not adequately supported by the data. Masking involves software programming that prevents the user from viewing results for specific targets, and allows the test to reach the market before adequate data on rare targets are available. Sponsors may continue to evaluate the rare targets postmarket to support unmasking. This process thus allows collection of additional clinical data to support the final approval of the device for all targets.\n\nExample: When quadripolar lead connectors were introduced, FDA worked with sponsors to capture clinical data in both the premarket and postmarket settings in combination with premarket animal study data and bench testing.\n\nWhere the performance of a particular device type is well-studied, documented, and understood. It may be possible to approve a new device or a new indication for an existing device based on safety and effectiveness information already known about the device or device type.\n\nClinical data that may be sufficient in cases like this include Objective Performance Criteria (OPC), Performance Goals (PG), Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs), or other data in lieu of a randomized controlled clinical trial.\n\nExample: A sponsor is seeking approval of a 7-day extended wear lens. The same lens was approved for daily wear and the sponsor has a substantial marketing history in the U.S. for the daily wear lens. If the 7-day lens is made of the same material as the daily wear lens, FDA may consider transferring a clinical study to assess most aspects of device safety to the postmarket setting.\n\nWhere long-term outside the U.S. (OUS) clinical performance data is available but not sufficient. It may be possible to defer to postmarket or otherwise limit the collection of clinical data from patients in the U.S. followed by a post-approval study if data from outside the U.S. is available and provides reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.\n\nFDA\'s Expedited Access for Devices Guidance20 also describes circumstances under which FDA may consider it acceptable to collect certain data in the postmarket setting, rather than premarket, while still ensuring that the statutory standard for premarket approval of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness is met. As part of the Expedited Access Pathway program described in the Expedited Access for Devices Guidance, in order to facilitate earlier patient access to devices that demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need, FDA may accept a higher degree of uncertainty about the benefit-risk profile of the device at the time of approval by collecting certain data in the postmarket setting rather than premarket. Please reference the Expedited Access Pathway guidance for more information about how FDA may be willing to accept greater uncertainty.\n\nFDA believes it is important to routinely reassess whether data that the Agency receives in a premarket submission for a device type may instead be collected postmarket or if the data are no longer necessary for FDA to determine that there is a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the device type. Sponsors who believe that the extent of data FDA previously expected in a premarket submission for the device type for which they plan to submit a PMA should be collected postmarket or should no longer be required, should submit a Pre-Submission (""Pre-Sub""),21 as described in FDA\'s guidance, ""Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff""22 (""Pre-Sub Guidance"").23\n\nFootnote 21: Section 745A(b) of the FD&C Act, added by section 1136 of FDASIA, requires applicants to include an electronic copy of certain submission types, including PMA submissions and Pre-Subs, after issuance of final guidance implementing that provision. FDA issued the guidance eCopy Program for Medical Devices Submissions (available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM313794.pdf), on December 31, 2012. Sponsors are therefore required to include an eCopy for all PMA submission types and Pre-Subs.\n\nFootnote 22: For more information on the Pre-Sub Program, see FDA’s guidance “Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff”\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM311176.pdf). FDA’s draft guidance represents FDA’s proposed approach on this topic.\n\nFootnote 23: As another option, for devices that have been automatically classified into class III under Section 513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, if there is an approved PMA for a device of that type, sponsors may seek reclassification under Section 513(f)(3) of the FD&C Act. If there is no approved PMA for a device of that type, a de novo request may be an appropriate option for such a device.\n\nV Conditions of Approval\n--------------------\nContext title: Balancing Premarket and Postmarket Data Collection for Devices Subject to Premarket Approval Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: Migration Studies for Point Of Care (POC) Assays\n\nBefore preparing to use the migration studies approach for a POC assay, you should determine whether the assay is quantitative, qualitative or semi-quantitative, according to the definitions in this guidance. The migration studies should be conducted in the hands of intended users of the POC assays. You should contact the appropriate FDA CDRH or CBER Division to obtain recommendations about migration studies for a POC device.\n\nVII Other Studies\n\nDepending upon the unique characteristics of the qualitative, quantitative or semi-quantitative assay being migrated to the new system, the following studies may be called for. If not previously conducted for the old system, they should be performed for the new system.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf you determine that a study described below is not applicable for your system, you should describe your reasoning in detail in your application to FDA. FDA will consider such explanations on a case-by-case basis particularly for manual to semi-automated or automated system migrations.\n\nCarry-over or cross-contamination studies: The importance of repeating these studies on a new system can be ascertained by a thorough analysis of the new system. As mentioned in Section V of this document, block diagrams and side-by-side comparison tables would be beneficial in this determination. Changes to specific physical features such as a change in sample pipettor design or the layout of the new system could indicate the need for new carry-over studies. If a carry-over study for the new system is appropriate and the new design is sufficiently similar to the old system, the new study can be the same as previously used for the old system. Samples with high positive concentrations of analyte should be tested alternating with analyte-negative samples in patterns dependent on the operational function of the instrument. The concentration of analyte in the high positive samples should exceed 95%-99% or more of the results normally obtained in clinical samples from diseased patients in the intended use population. This testing should be done over multiple runs (at least 5 runs are recommended by the Commission of European Communities10). Footnote 10: Commission Decision 2002/364/EC of 7 May 2002 on common technical specifications for in vitro-diagnostic medical devices [Official Journal L 131 of 16.05.2002].\n\nMatrix equivalency and recovery studies: Presumptively, because there are no changes to the assay, there should be no new effects on the assay performance due to different matrices unless physical alterations of the new system could create such an effect. Similarly, recovery studies should not be affected by the migration of an assay from an old to a new system.\n\nInterfering substances studies: Presumptively, with no changes to the assay, there should be no new effects on the assay performance due to interfering substances.\n\nOn-board reagent/calibrator and sample stability studies: Unless there are physical or process changes to the new system, presumptively, there should be no effect on assay performance due to on-board reagent or sample stability.\n\nCross-reactivity studies: Presumptively, as there are no changes in assay components, a migration to a new system should have no effect on the existing cross-reactivity.\n\nHook effect studies: Presumptively, because there is no assay change, the parameters of the hook effect should be the same, unless physical alterations in the new system could create such an effect.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nVerification of kit control material and calibrators: Presumptively because there is no change to the assay, the control results and calibration ranges should remain the same, unless physical alterations in the new system could create new effects.\n\nIf new analyte-specific information requires new studies to bring the assay\'s performance characteristics up-to-date, please contact FDA for guidance.\n\nVIII. Molecular Assays\n\nThere are specific criteria that are unique to nucleic acid tests (NAT) and therefore NATs present additional specific concerns over serological and antigen assays:\n\nWhen appropriate, you should provide testing with panels showing a rise in viral titer over time from serial bleeds (viremic profile). Similar to seroconversion panels, they should have a minimum number of days between bleeds and begin with at least one negative bleed. They should be of clinical relevance to the appropriate individual marker.\n\nCarryover studies: Because of the increased risks of carryover due to the amplification methodologies utilized in molecular testing (e.g., PCR, TMA), you should perform carryover studies for all NAT migration studies.\n\nSample stability: Because of the nature of DNA and especially RNA, careful attention should be given to the stability of samples in relation to on-board storage and manipulation.\n\nSample processing: The processes of purification and extraction of DNA or RNA from clinical samples is critical to the success of molecular tests. You should evaluate any additions or modifications associated with the new system that could affect these processes.\n\nValidation of control material and calibrators: You should perform these studies on the new system due to the sensitive nature of molecular assays.\n\nFor molecular assays detecting multiple analytes, please contact FDA for further discussion.\n\nIX. Regulatory Outcomes\n\nShould the acceptance criteria noted in Sections VI.A.4 or VI.B.4 above be met, it would be appropriate for the sponsor to claim that the new system does not compromise the results as compared to the old system. It would not be appropriate to claim improved performance characteristics. It would also not be appropriate to compute clinical performance claims for the new system based on the migrationstudies described here, since these studies are analytical, rather than clinical. Should you wish to develop more extensive claims, the migration studies paradigm would not be an appropriate scientific approach.\n\nIf the acceptance criteria are not met and the aberrant performance could affect clinical management, you will be asked to perform a complete clinical study presenting the clinical performance of the assay on the new system.\n\nX Glossary\n\nFor the purposes of this document the following definitions are used. HTD referenced terms are based on the CLSI Harmonized Terminology Database.\n\nC({}_{\\$}): a concentration at which repeated tests of a sample with this concentration under stipulated conditions are 95% negative (or 5% positive) (see CLSI EP12-A2).\n\nC({}_{\\$}): a concentration at which repeated tests of a sample with this concentration under stipulated conditions are 95% positive (see CLSI EP12-A2).\n\nC({}_{\\$}): a concentration at which repeated tests of a sample with this concentration under stipulated conditions are 50 % positive (or 50% negative). Under ideal circumstances, C({}_{50}) will exactly equal the cutoff established by the manufacturer.\n\nCalibrators: a substance or device that is based on a reference preparation or in which the analyte concentration or other quantity has been determined by an analytical procedure of stated reliability. Calibrators are used to calibrate, graduate, or adjust a measurement [HTD].\n\nCarry-over: amount of analyte carried by the measuring system from one sample reaction into subsequent sample reactions, thereby erroneously affecting the apparent amounts in subsequent samples [HTD].\n\nControl material: a device, solution, or preparation intended for use in the quality control process to monitor the reliability of a test system and to evaluate its performance within established limits.\n\nCross-reactivity: the ability of a drug, metabolite, a structurally similar compound other than the primary analyte, or even unrelated compound to affect the assay [HTD].\n\nCutoff value (CO): for a qualitative test, the threshold above which the result of the test is reported as positive and below which the result is reported as negative.\n\nHigh negative sample (C({}_{\\$})): a sample with a concentration of analyte close to the C({}_{\\$}) as determined by the old system.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 22: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/assay-migration-studies-vitro-diagnostic-devices.\n\nOption 3: As an alternative to comparison study designs, for certain test systems, flex and human factors engineering studies may provide sufficient assurance that the change in user populations and environment of use between non-waived and waived settings will not adversely impact the results provided by the candidate test; i.e., that the likelihood of erroneous results by the users is negligible. Possible study design approaches that may be suitable include flex study designs described in section IV above and human factor study designs described in FDA\'s guidance ""Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineeringto Medical Devices.""23 FDA believes this approach is generally appropriate for test systems for which:\n\nFootnote 23: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/applying-human-factors-and-usability-engineering-medical-devices.\n\ncollection of a specimen is either always performed by a professional (for example, an endocervical swab collected by a doctor) or always by a patient (for example, a urine specimen collected by the patient), and\n\nother pre-analytical steps are very simple (for example, placement of the entire specimen in the analyzer), and\n\nintended use patient populations are sufficiently similar.\n\nAdditionally, another scenario where this option may be appropriate is a CLIA waiver application for a modification of a previously waived test system where the Quick Reference Guide was not modified (or minimally modified). FDA encourages manufacturers considering modification of a test system previously waived by application to contact FDA through a Pre-Submission to discuss planned modifications, as well as study designs and analyses to validate that the modified test system meets the statutory criteria for CLIA waiver.24\n\nFootnote 24: A Pre-Submission is a type of Q-Submission. For information regarding the process for obtaining feedback from the FDA, see the guidance “Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.\n\nOption 4: Comparison study designs in which the results of the candidate test in the hands of untrained operators are directly compared to the results of an appropriate comparative method in the hands of trained operators. This option is also useful for Dual Submissions where a 510(k) and CLIA waiver are being sought concurrently.\n\nFor general recommendations on comparison study design and analysis for Options 1 and 4, we recommend you follow appropriate FDA-recognized consensus standards, such as:\n\nFor quantitative tests: CLSI EP21,25 CLSI EP27.26 Footnote 25: CLSI EP21 Evaluation of Total Analytical Error for Quantitative Medical Laboratory Measurement Procedures.\n\nFor qualitative tests: CLSI EP12.27 Footnote 26: CLSI EP27 How to Construct and Interpret an Error Grid for Quantitative Diagnostic Assays.\n\nFor Options 1, 2, and 4, if sufficient valid scientific evidence on the imprecision of the test and the performance of the test at low levels (limit of detection and limit of quantitation) when performed by untrained operators is not available from the studies described above, additional studies should be performed to allow comparison of the imprecision and limit of detection/limit of quantitation of the test when performed by untrained and trained operators. We recommend following appropriate FDA-recognized consensus standards (e.g., CLSI EP05,28 CLSI EP12, CLSI EP1729) for these studies.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApplicants are strongly encouraged to submit a Pre-Submission to obtain feedback from FDA on planned study designs prior to conducting the study. FDA welcomes discussion of additional study design approaches besides the four options presented in this guidance.30\n\nFootnote 30: For information regarding the process for obtaining feedback from the FDA, see the guidance “Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The O-Submission Program,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.\n\nAppendix B Considerations in Satisfying CLIA Waiver Requirements\n\nOne statutory criteria that a test can meet to obtain a CLIA waiver centers on the simplicity of the test and whether the user can conduct the test with a negligible likelihood of erroneous results.31 All tests have some likelihood of erroneous results, but whether the likelihood of erroneous results in the hands of waived test users is negligible will vary from test to test depending on a number of factors. These factors include intended use, context of use (e.g., patient population, use environment), and the probable benefit(s) and probable risk(s)/harm(s) associated with waived use of the test. FDA intends for its approach to benefit-risk considerations to be consistent with the principles expressed, to the extent applicable, in FDA\'s other guidances.32 Accordingly, the appropriate acceptance criteria for the studies performed using the design options described above will vary from test to test. For example, for a qualitative test performed following study Options 1 or 2, the minimum level of agreement between results of the test in the hands of untrained and trained users for demonstrating comparable performance should generally be higher for a test for which erroneous results in waived settings are associated with a higher extent of probable patient risk/harm than for tests with lower probable risk/harm in waived settings.\n\nFootnote 31: 42 U.S.C. § 263a(d)(3)(A).\n\nFootnote 32: See, for example, “_Benefit-Risk Factors to Consider When Determining Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications (510(k)) with Different Technological Characteristics,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/benefit-risk-factors-consider-when-determining-substantial-equivalence-premarket-notifications-510k, and “_Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/factors-consider-when-making-benefit-risk-determinations-medical-device-premarket-approval-and-de.\n\nAppendix C General Study Design Considerations\n\nFor all study design options, FDA recommends that applicants evaluate test performance in settings designed to replicate, as closely as possible, actual CLIA-waived settings, patients, samples, and test operators. Therefore, study designs should include the following:\n\nTesting sites that are representative of the intended use of the waived test.\n\nSubject populations that are representative of the intended patient population(s).\n\nIntended sample type and matrix.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nUntrained operators representative of those at intended waived settings. We encourage you to enroll operators with the least amount of training that might be encountered at the types of sites for which this device is intended.\n\nTesting should be integrated into the daily workflow of the facility where the operators are often multitasking between patient care, testing, and other duties.\n\nTesting sites\n\nYou should conduct the study to support CLIA waiver at a minimum of three sites that are representative of both the intended use patient population and the intended operators in CLIA-waived settings. Generally, the sites should include different demographic and geographic locations (e.g., outpatient clinic, physician\'s office), since patient populations and intended operators typically vary among different demographic locations. In your CLIA waiver application, you should present a brief description of each site, including its name, address, and the date the study was performed. If there were sites that were included at the beginning, but then did not complete the study, you should provide a brief explanation for why those sites did not complete the study.\n\nFor study Options 1 and 2, trained operators may perform testing at the same sites as the untrained operators, or at a different laboratory site. For study Option 4, trained operators should perform testing with the comparative method at an appropriate laboratory site.\n\nOperators\n\nUntrained operators\n\nThe study should include 1-3 untrained operators at each site and at least nine (9) untrained operators across all sites. You should ensure that the untrained operator study participants enrolled represent anticipated operators of the device you propose for CLIA waiver. Untrained operators should have limited or no training or hands-on experience in conducting laboratory testing and should not have previous training or experience with the candidate test, but may have limited experience with other waived or home use tests. Untrained operators should be personnel currently employed in the selected intended use sites and testing should be integrated into the daily workflow of the facility where the operators are often multitasking between patient care, testing, and other duties. We recommend that you record and tabulate the education (including experience and training) and the occupation of each untrained operator to demonstrate that these participants meet the definition of intended operators and include this in your CLIA waiver application. In addition, for each study site, we recommend you report the same information on other personnel that were available at the testing site but that were not chosen to participate.\n\nTrained operators\n--------------------\nContext title: Recommendations for Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) Waiver Applications for Manufacturers of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: Migration Studies for Qualitative Assays\n\nAnalytical Studies for Qualitative Assays\n\nThe evaluations described below are based on the idea that similar studies were conducted previously for the old system. If the study design of the analytical studies conducted for the old system were different from the design of the studies described in this guidance, please contact the FDA for feedback. If you believe that some of the studies outlined in this document do not apply to your particular device, you should present your justification for FDA review.\n\nWe recommend that you use fresh clinical specimens for all analytical studies. If this is impractical, in some cases you may substitute or supplement fresh clinical specimens with archived samples. If archived samples are not available, spiked or diluted clinical samples may be used. In some instances, use of otherwise contrived matrix-specific samples may also be appropriate; however these should mimic clinical specimens as much as is feasible. We recommend that you contact FDA if you wish to discuss appropriate sample types for these evaluations. The matrix of any of these alternative specimens should be the same as that specified by the intended use of the old system.\n\na) Performance at Low Analyte Levels\n\nYou should evaluate the performance of the assay on the new system compared to the old system at low analyte levels (e.g., with dilution panels and seroconversion panels).\n\nWhere available, assay performance at low positive analyte levels usingdilution panels should be based on international standards (e.g., World Health Organization (WHO) standards, Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) standards) and compared with the old system.\n\nIf available and appropriate, test well-characterized seroconversion panels similar in number and type to the panels originally used to support approval/licensure/clearance. The seroconversion panels should be run on both the old system and the new system.\n\n3.2.2 Precision\n\nThis section describes precision study designs including panel composition.\n\n(i) Composition of Precision Panel\n\nThe categorical result of a qualitative test is determined using the numeric test data and a cutoff(s) (e.g., a numeric threshold), which define numeric ranges that correspond to the final result categories. For a qualitative test with two categorical results, a cutoff (one threshold) is used to define positive and negative results of the test. When the observed numeric test data exceeds the threshold, the final result is considered positive (or ""reactive"", ""detected""). When the observed numeric test result is below the cutoff, it is considered negative (or ""not reactive"", ""not detected"").\n\nQualitative assays discriminating between two classes of subjects (non-diseased vs diseased) can fall into two groups: 1) assays used in situations where non- diseased subject samples have a true zero concentration of the analyte of interest, and 2) assays used in situations where non-diseased subject samples have a detectable analyte concentration. For the latter, the cutoff was chosen to optimize clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity of the assay based on a clinical data set. Appropriate precision panels for these two types of assays, as well as assays that produce equivocal results, and/or have a re-test zone, are discussed in more detail in (a)-(c), below:\n\n(a) When non-diseased subject samples have a detectable amount of analyte.\n\nFor the non-diseased subject samples that have a detectable amount of analyte the cutoff of the assay is higher than the limit of the blank. A useful characteristic of the cutoff is that a sample with a concentration (determined by the mean signal to cutoff value from a large a series of replicate measurements) at the cutoff yields a positive result 50% of the time and a negative result 50% of the time when a large number of replicates of that sample are run under stipulated conditions (see Figure 1 below). We denote this concentration as C({}_{50}).\n\nFor samples with concentrations exceeding C({}{50}), one expects to see positive results more than 50% of the time, and similarly for samples with a concentration below C({}{50}), one expects to see positive results less than 50% of the time. In this guidance we refer to an analyte concentration that yields, upon evaluating many replicates, a positive result 95% of the time (and a negative result 5% of the time) as a Low Positive concentration (C({}{95}) concentration). We refer to a sample concentration which yields a positive result 5% of the time (and negative result 95% of the time) as a High Negative concentration (C({}{5}) concentration). Samples with concentrations of analyte close to C({}{95}) and C({}{5}) as determined by the old system are recommended for the within-laboratory precision (see CLSI8 document EP12). The panel should consist of at least four members, as described below (also, see Figure 2):\n\nFootnote 8: Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute. CLSI documents referenced in this guidance are listed in Section XI of this document.\n\nA True Negative sample: a sample with a true analyte concentration of zero.\n\nA High Negative sample: a sample that repeatedly tests negative approximately 95% of the time and positive 5% of the time by the old system. One should expect that the same concentration tested by the new system will also produce negative results approximately 95% of\n\nFigure 1: Results of a qualitative assay (probability density function) for a sample with a concentration at the cutoff measured multiple times.\n\nthe time (C({}{5}) concentration as determined by the old system).\n* A Low Positive sample: a sample with an analyte concentration around C({}{95}) as determined by the old system. Repeatedly testing this sample by the old system should give a positive result approximately 95% of the time and a negative result 5% of the time. One should expect that the same concentration tested by the new system will also produce positive results approximately 95% of the time. Note that if the LoB is used as a cutoff, then the concentration C({}_{95}) is the same as the LoD.\n* A Moderate Positive sample: a sample with a concentration close to the cutoff, and at which one observes positive results by the old system approximately 100% of the time (e.g., a sample with a signal approximately two to three times the signal at the cutoff if the cutoff=1.0, or a sample with concentration approximately two to three times the 95% LoD if the cutoff is based on LoB).\n\nFor the details of how the C({}{95}) and C({}{5}) concentrations can be evaluated from the previous precision studies of the old system, see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 1. For the precision study of the new system, it is not necessary to have the High Negative and Low Positive samples at exactly C({}{5}) or C({}{95}) of the old system. If the High Negative and Low Positive samples in the precision study of the new system are close enough to the cutoff that the standard\n\nFigure 2: Relationship between percent of positive results and the analyte cutoff concentration.\n\ndeviation (or percent coefficient of variation (CV) is approximately constant over the range around the cutoff, the C({}{5}) and C({}{95}) of the new system can be evaluated from this precision study (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 1).\n\n(b) When non-diseased subject samples have a true zero analyte concentration.\n\nWhen non-diseased subject samples have a true zero analyte concentration there are two types of assays: (1) assays for which samples with zero concentration have a distribution of numeric signals and the cutoff of the assay is the limit of blank (with some type I error, for example, 5%); and (2) ultrasensitive assays for which samples with zero analyte concentration almost always have a negative assay result (type I error is close to zero). These two types of assays are discussed further in the two bullets below.\n\nConsider assays where samples with zero analyte concentration have a distribution of numeric signals and the limit of blank is used as a cutoff. In this case the concentration C({}{95}) is the same as the limit of detection (LoD) and zero concentration (no analyte present in sample) is C({}{5}) as illustrated in Figure 3, below. The precision panel should consist of at least the following three members: True Negative, Low Positive (around LoD) and Moderately Positive.\n\nFigure 3: Relationship between the percent of positive results and the analyte concentration where True Negative samples produce numeric results and the C({}_{95}) concentration is the LoD of the assay.\n\nFor ultrasensitive assays that employ, for example, a signal amplification methodology (e.g., real-time PCR), the following approaches for precision panel members are recommended. For ultrasensitive assays, the concentration range that spans High Negative (around C({}{5})) to Low Positive (around C({}{95})=LoD) is narrow with respect to the observed concentration range of clinical specimens. Due to this narrow range, it may be difficult to prepare a sample with C({}{5}) concentration. If less than 10% of all subjects positive by the old system have an observed concentration less than C({}{95}), then samples at the C({}{5}) concentration could be excluded from the precision panel. In this case, samples which compose the precision panel should include the following concentrations: True Negative, Low Positive (around C({}{95})) and Moderately Positive. If more than 10% of all subjects positive by the old system have an observed concentration less than C({}{95}), then samples which compose the precision panel should include the following concentrations: True Negative, Low Positive (around C({}{95})), samples in the range of C({}{20}) to C({}{80}) and Moderately Positive as illustrated in Figure 4, below.\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: This guidance describes three policies intended to help expand the availability of transport media devices used to transport certain clinical specimens for use with molecular or antigen diagnostic tests for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nIn addition, this guidance includes FDA\'s recommendations concerning how developers may validate transport media intended for use in transporting certain clinical specimens that are known or suspected of including the SARS-CoV-2 virus. FDA encourages transport media developers to discuss any alternative approaches to validation with FDA (see subsection B.4 below).\n\nDevelopers with an EUA-authorized SARS-CoV-2 molecular or antigen assay should refer to FDA\'s ""Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Test During the Public Health Emergency""4 for guidance on certain modifications to their assays and refer to the Conditions of Authorization section in their Letter of Authorization for instructions on how to update their labeling, including Instructions for Use, to incorporate any new transport media.5 Please note that if a laboratory modifies an authorized test (e.g., by using alternative transport media), the modified test may no longer be authorized under the EUA.\n\nFootnote 4: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/policy-coronavirus-disease-2019-tests-during-public-health-emergency-revised\n\nFootnote 5: For a comprehensive list of in vitro diagnostic EUAs that FDA has issued during the COVID-19 public health emergency, see FDA’s website at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/in-vitro-diagnostics-eus.\n\nPolicy for Commercial Manufacturers of VTM\n\nThe policy in this section applies to commercial manufacturers that want to develop and distribute transport media for use transporting clinical specimens for testing with molecular or antigen assays during the COVID-19 public health emergency that are class I (reserved) and subject to premarket notification requirements under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, as identified in Table 1.\n\nTo help foster the availability of transport media that can transport specimens for testing using molecular or antigen diagnostic tests, for the duration of the public health emergency, FDA does not intend to object to the distribution and use of VTM by commercial manufacturers, without submission of a premarket notification to FDA as required by section 510(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360(k)), or compliance with the Unique Device Identification (UDI) requirements in 21 CFR Part 830 and 21 CFR 801.20 where the VTM device is validated as described in subsection B.1, where notification of validation is provided to FDA as described in subsection B.2, and where themanufacturer includes a statement in the labeling that the transport medium has not been reviewed by FDA and other labeling information so that the product does not create an undue risk in light of the public health emergency. (See subsection B.3 below for information on VTM labeling). Additionally, to further help increase availability of commercially manufactured VTM, FDA does not intend to enforce the Quality System Requirements under 21 CFR Part 820 when manufacturers conform to ISO 13485:2016 Medical Devices Quality Management Systems Requirements for Regulatory Purposes. Manufacturers should have documentation demonstrating their compliance with ISO 13485.\n\nThis policy does not apply to compliance with other requirements and manufacturers are responsible for ensuring compliance with those requirements, including Registration and Listing requirements in 21 CFR Part 807, reports of corrections and removals in 21 CFR Part 806, medical device reporting under 21 CFR Part 803, and in vitro diagnostics (IVD) labeling requirements under 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809.\n\n(1) Validation\n\nIt is important that VTM are appropriately designed and validated prior to distribution to ensure that the transport medium will preserve the viral particles without meaningful degradation that could lead to inaccurate test results. To reduce the risk of inaccurate test results, only VTM devices labeled as sterile should be used in the transport of clinical specimens. FDA believes that VTM distributed by commercial manufacturers under this policy should be designed and validated consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\'s (CDC\'s) Standard Operating Procedure (SOP):\n\nPreparation of Viral Transport Media.6 For commercial manufacturers that wish to discuss alternative validation methods or alternative transport media device types, please see subsection B.4 Alternative Approaches or Additional Transport Media Device Types.\n\nFootnote 6: For the current edition of the SOP, see CDC’s website at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/Viral-Transport-Medium.pdf.\n\n(2) FDA Notification\n\nCommercial manufacturers should notify FDA by e-mail to CDRH-EUA-Templates(@fda.hhs.gov) after the transport medium has been validated that the manufacturer intends to distribute the VTM. This notification should include the name of the manufacturer, address, a contact person and e-mail address at which the contact person can be reached, the names of authorized importers and distributors, the name(s) under which the product is sold or distributed, a copy of the instructions for use, a statement and documentation that the device is manufactured in compliance with 21 CFR Part 820 or ISO 13485: Medical Devices - Quality Management Systems - Requirements for Regulatory Purposes, and a statement that the device has been designed and validated consistent with CDC\'s\n\nSOP: Preparation of Viral Transport Media.7 FDA will acknowledge receipt of this email via auto-reply.\n\nFootnote 7: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/Viral-Transport-Medium.pdf.\n\nIt would be helpful to FDA if manufacturers additionally provide information on their expected manufacturing capacity of their transport medium in their notification discussed above. This information will help the Agency and Department monitor the landscape as we work to help ensure adequate testing supplies are available across the country during the COVID-19 public health emergency.8\n\nFootnote 8: In addition to this recommendation, manufacturers should be aware of their notification obligations under section 506J of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 356j). Section 506J of the FD&C Act requires manufacturers to notify FDA “of a permanent discontinuinance in the manufacture of the device” or of “an interruption of the manufacture of the device that is likely to lead to a meaningful disruption in the supply of that device in the United States” during or in advance of a public health emergency. For more information about providing FDA notifications during the COVID-19 public health emergency, see FDA’s guidance entitled “Notifying CDRH of a Permanent Discontinuance or Interruption in Manufacturing of a Device Under Section 506J of the FD&C Act During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (Revised),” including who must notify FDA, what information to include in the notification, and how to notify FDA. (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/notifying-cdrh-permanent-discontinuance-or-interruption-manufacturing-device-under-section-506i-fdc).\n\nFollowing notification, FDA intends to update the list of transport media on its webpage with devices manufactured and distributed under the policy outlined in this section. If a problem is identified, FDA intends to work with the manufacturer to address the problem (e.g., through labeling or analytical studies). If any problems are significant and cannot be addressed in a timely manner, FDA would expect the manufacturer to suspend the distribution and conduct a recall of the transport media devices, including the collection kits and/or tests when they are distributed with the transport media, which should include a notice to customers concerning their transport media. In such circumstances, FDA intends to remove the manufacturer\'s transport medium from the website list of notifications.\n\nLabeling\n\nAs noted above, VTM are devices subject to the labeling requirements in 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809, including the labeling requirements under 21 CFR 809.10(a) for the immediate container of the transport medium (i.e., tube label). The following information is intended to assist manufacturers in complying with 21 CFR 809.10 for transport media devices. Manufacturers should refer to that regulation for the complete list of labeling requirements for in vitro diagnostic devices. The additional labeling recommendations describe circumstances intended to help ensure that the transport media under this policy does not create an undue risk in light of the public health emergency.\n\nVTM labeling must include the following, in addition to other requirements set forth in 21 CFR 809.10:\n\nAn intended use statement that the transport medium is for transport of clinical material and a statement that the transport medium serves as a culture media, non-propagating transport, as appropriate (21 CFR 809.10(a)(2) and 21 CFR 809.10(b)(2));\n\nAppropriate warnings and limitations of the transport medium (21 CFR 809.10(a)(4) and 21 CFR 809.10(b)(5)(ii));\n\nShelf life and stability information (21 CFR 809.10(a)(5)) and storage instructions (21 CFR 809.10(b)(5)(iv));\n\nA list of all materials provided (21 CFR 809.10(b)(8)(i));\n\nResults and specific performance criteria (21 CFR 809.10(b)(9) and 21 CFR 809.10(b)(12));\n\nSpecifications (21 CFR 809.10(b)(12));* Instructions for handling of collected specimens, including storage instructions, and transport conditions instructions, as appropriate (21 CFR 809.10(b)(7));\n\nDetails of kinds of quality control procedures and materials required (21 CFR 809.10(b)(8)(iv)); and\n\nThe name and place of business of manufacturer (21 CFR 809.10(a)(8) and 21 CFR 809.10(b)(14)).\n--------------------\nContext title: Enforcement Policy for Viral Transport Media During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency (Revised) Guidance for Commercial Manufacturers, Clinical Laboratories, and Food and Drug Administration Staff']","['In most studies the sponsor should avoid multiple testings of the same subject because it may skew performance statistics and under-estimate standard deviations.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to applicants on preparing and using comparability protocols for postapproval changes in chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC). The guidance applies to comparability protocols that would be submitted in new animal drug applications (NADAs), abbreviated new animal drug applications (ANADAs), or supplements to these applications. Well-characterized synthetic peptides submitted in these applications are included within the scope of this guidance. This guidance also applies to comparability protocols submitted in investigational new animal drug (INAD), generic investigational new animal drug (JINAD) and veterinary master file (VMF) submissions that are referenced in applications. The FDA is providing this guidance in response to requests from those interested in using comparability protocols.\n\nFDA guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nAs an applicant, you are responsible for assessing, prior to distribution of a product, the effect of any postapproval CMC changes on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the product as these factors relate to the safety or efficacy of the product (section 506A(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act)). Such an assessment often includes demonstration that the pre- and postchange products (i.e., products manufactured prior to and subsequent to a change) are equivalent. Postapproval CMC changes must be reported to FDA in one of four reporting categories (Section 506A of the Act):* Annual Report (AR)1\n\nFootnote 1: The annual report is the Minor Changes and Stability Report (MCSR) according to 21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iii).\n\nThe annual submission to the approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having minimal potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product.\n\nChange-Being-Efficected Supplement (CBE)\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having moderate potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A CBE supplement must be received by FDA before or concurrently with distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nChange-Being-Efficed-in-30-Days Supplement (CBE-30).\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having moderate potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A CBE-30 supplement must be received by FDA at least 30 days before distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nPrior Approval Supplement (PAS)\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having a substantial potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A PAS supplement must be received and approved by FDA prior to distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nIn many cases, using a comparability protocol will facilitate the subsequent implementation and reporting of CMC changes, which could result in moving a product into distribution sooner than if a protocol was not used.\n\nThis guidance describes the general principles and procedures associated with developing and submitting a comparability protocol to the FDA. The guidance also describes the basic elements of a comparability protocol and specific issues to consider when developing comparability protocols for changes in:* the manufacturing process\n* analytical procedures2\n* manufacturing equipment\n* manufacturing facilities\n* container closure systems\n* process analytical technology (PAT)\n\nFootnote 2: The term analytical procedure, as used in this guidance, includes chemical, physical, microbiological, and biological test procedures.\n\nThe guidance also discusses submitting comparability protocols as investigational new animal drug submissions, generic investigational new animal drug submissions and veterinary master file submissions.\n\nAppendix A What is a Comparability Protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: Recommendations for executed (completed) batch records are provided in CVM guidance for industry [42]: Animal Drug Manufacturing Guidelines-Series of Four Guidelines (1994). CVM encourages the submission of executed batch records for lots of drug substance and drug product used in support of the application as they provide valuable detail and insight into the manufacturing process and proposed controls.\n\na.1.1 Pharmaceutical Development Reports\n\nSponsors are encouraged to provide pharmaceutical development reports (PDRs) that describe the scientific rationale for the chosen manufacturing process(es) and controls for fermentation-derived intermediates, drug substances, and related drug products. A sponsor's ability to demonstrate process understanding can be factored into CVM's risk-based decision making (e.g., Pre-Approval Inspection Decision Support System (PAIDSS)). Suggestions for PDRs can be found in ICH Q8: Pharmaceutical Development.\n\na.1.2 Cell Growth (Propagation) and Harvest\n\nA description should be provided that includes a flow diagram illustrating each step in propagation from the original inoculum (e.g., cells from one or more vials of the working cell bank) through the last harvesting operation.\n\nAll steps should be included along with the relevant information, such as the growth conditions and in-process tests performed (e.g., cell concentrations, volumes, pH, cultivation times, temperatures).\n\nCritical steps and intermediates for which specifications are established should be identified, along with sampling plans and testing time points.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe flow diagram can be supplemented with information presented in tabular form, if appropriate.\n\nA narrative describing each manufacturing step in the process should accompany the flow diagram:\n\nIdentify all process controls and the associated numeric ranges, limits, or acceptance criteria\n\nHighlight any process controls that are considered critical\n\nIdentify the intended scale of the process. The amounts indicated should be representative of a maximum-sized production batch.\n\nWe recommend the following be included in the narrative:\n\nA description of the major equipment involved in each step\n\nA description of inoculation and each step in propagation with growth conditions specified\n\nThe composition of the media used at each step, including water quality and additives used\n\nThe sterilization procedures for media (e.g. a batch sterilization process or continuous system)\n\nThe equipment (e.g. fermentation vessel), feeds, and other materials added during the fermentation process\n\nProcess parameters monitored and controls for critical steps and intermediates\n\nProcedures used to transfer material between steps\n\nProcedures used to minimize contamination by adventitious agents\n\nProcess controls to confirm the effectiveness of the specific manufacturing steps used to inactivate and or remove adventitious agents\n\nCriteria for harvesting\n\nCriteria for rejecting/accepting a fermentation batch if contamination occurs\n\nThe determination of yields\n\nCriteria for pooling more than one harvest, if applicable\n\nStorage conditions and time limits if the harvested crude fermentation product is held prior to further processing\n\n3. Purification and Downstream Processing\n\nThe description should include a flow diagram that illustrates and a narrative that describes all the steps involved in isolating and purifying the crude fermentation product to its final form, along with any relevant information (e.g., volumes, pH, temperatures, holding times). Critical steps and intermediates for which specifications are established should be identified, along with testing time points.\n\nThe narrative describing each manufacturing step should accompany the flow diagram and should identify all process controls and the associated numeric ranges, limits, or acceptance criteria and include the following:\n\nMethods used in purification or separation of the crude fermentation product (e.g. precipitation, centrifugation, filtration) including major equipment (e.g. columns, membranes* Process parameters monitored\n\nThe in-process controls and analytical tests used to show identity, purity, and concentration and to evaluate levels of process- and product-related impurities\n\nThe determination of yields\n\nPrecautions taken to prevent or control microbial contamination during purification\n\nConditions for reuse and/or procedures for regeneration of columns, membranes, and adsorbents\n\nStorage conditions and time limits, if the purified fermentation product is held prior to further processing\n\n4. Modification Reactions (If Applicable)\n\nChemical Modifications\n\nWhen a product of fermentation is to be subjected to further molecular change through chemical means, a description of the synthetic steps should be included in the procedural narrative.\n\nAdditionally, a flow diagram of the synthetic process should be provided. For more details, see CVM guidance for industry 169: Drug Substance: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\nEnzymatic Modifications\n\nWhen the fermentation product is further modified using enzyme catalysts, the steps should be included in the flow diagram and detailed in the procedural narrative. Enzymatic reactions are considered chemical reactions since the conversion of substrate product involves breaking and forming chemical bonds. Thus, much of the information submitted in the manufacturing description should be the same as that submitted for chemical processes (drug substance).\n\nHowever, because enzymatic functionality requires carefully controlled conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, osmolarity), the description should contain detailed information on reaction controls and the optimum range of operation. Furthermore, the biological source of the enzyme should be provided along with a description of the enzyme's preparation and information about its purity.\n\n5. Reprocessing, Reworking, Recycling, Regeneration, and Salvaging\n\nWhen appropriate, reprocessing, reworking, recycling, regeneration, and salvaging operations should be described. For more detail, see CVM guidance for industry 169: Drug Substance: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\nAppendix C Control of Materials\n\nA list of materials used in the manufacture of fermentation-derived intermediates, drug substances, and drug products should be provided (i.e., the microorganism, cell bank system, media components, solvents, reagents, auxiliary materials). Information pertaining to the quality and control of these materials should also be provided.\n\n1. _Microorganism_Information about the microorganism used for production (i.e., genus, species, and type strain) and known genotypic and phenotypic characteristics should be provided. Additionally, the origin of the source material (or isolate) should be identified or described.\n\n2. Cell Bank System a. Master Cell Bank\n\nA brief description of the procedures used to generate the master cell bank (MCB) and the criteria used for qualification should be provided. The information should include:\n\nMethod, reagents, and media used in preparation\n\nDate of preparation\n\nProcess controls\n\nStorage conditions\n\nProcedures used in testing for relevant phenotypic and genotypic markers and determining culture purity\n\nProcedures used to ensure the absence of contamination from adventitious agents (e.g., microbial contamination and cross-contamination by other cell types) with tests and acceptance criteria specified\n\nb. Working Cell Bank\n\nPreservation of the microbial purity of the MCB is an important factor in maintaining the production strain. Often a working cell bank (WCB) is created so that the MCB will be less likely to be compromised. Creation of a WCB occurs via the propagation of the MCB through defined culture conditions, and then aliquots of the resultant homogenous culture suspension are partitioned into individual storage containers of appropriate size for routine production purposes.\n\nA brief description of the procedures used to derive a WCB from the MCB and the criteria used for qualification should be provided. Information similar to that submitted for the MCB should also be submitted for the WCB.\n\n3. Media Components\n\nA list of the media components used at each stage of the fermentation process should be included in the submission. Specifications should be provided for each component for verification that the material is of suitable quality for its intended purpose.\n\nIf ruminant-based media components are used in the fermentation process, they should comply with the proposed BSE Medical Products Rule, issued on January 12, 2007 (72 FR 1582).\n\nAll animal-derived components should be identified and appropriate mitigation steps taken to prevent the transmission of adventitious agents.\n\n4. Solvents, Reagents, Auxiliary Materials\n\nA list of solvents, reagents, and other auxiliary materials used in the fermentation process should be provided. Specifications for each material should be included for verification that the material is of suitable quality for its intended purpose. When water is used in the process, it should be of an appropriate quality for its intended use.\n\nControl of Critical Steps and Intermediates\n\nAll critical process controls and their associated numeric ranges, limits, or acceptance criteria should be identified and justified and a brief description of the test provided. Furthermore, any experimental data to support the justification should be included.\n\nGood controls are essential during fermentation to ensure product consistency.\n\nEnd product testing alone is not adequate for demonstrating a fermentation process is under control.\n\nManufacturing processes, including fermentation, should be controlled to ensure that the product meets previously identified quality attributes.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #216 Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) Information - Fermentation-Derived Intermediates, Drug Substances, and Related Drug Products for Veterinary Medicinal Use""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: One aspect of CVM\'s review of proprietary names for new animal drugs focuses on the avoidance of medication errors. Examples of medication errors include incorrect drug selection, incorrect dosage or route of administration, or use in unintended species or classes. These types of errors may cause animal injury or a lack of drug effectiveness, which could contribute to outcomes like complication of a disease and possible death of an animal. Medication errors in food-producing animals may result in drug residues in edible tissues (including milk or eggs) that may cause residue violations for livestock owners, and may result in potentially unsafe food for consumers.\n\nCVM considers whether the name can cause confusion or otherwise contribute to medication errors. The medication use system for animal drugs in the United States (US) generally includes the following phases: selection and procurement, ordering or prescribing, order processing, dispensing, and administration. Opportunities for medication errors arise in each of these phases.\n\nCVM also considers the entire medication  use system when evaluating  the potential  of proprietary names to cause confusion and medication  error. This includes  the specific environment  in which the product  will be used (i.e., clinic,  barn, home, etc.), the veterinary  prescriber population,  and/or the knowledge  and experience of the animal owner or animal caretaker who  will be administering  the drug.  For example,  for a product  expected to be used exclusively  in beef cattle by beef cattle  producers, the proprietary name review will consider  a potential for confusion with other products  used by beef cattle producers.\n\nAdditionally,  CVM will  compare the proposed proprietary name to other proposed proprietary names submitted  to FDA for products  not yet approved.  Such proposed names are often confidential;  therefore, it is possible  that CVM may identify  conflicts with pending products of  which the sponsors  or public  is not aware.5\n\nFootnote 5: Proposed names may be associated with drug products subject to (generic) investigational new animal drug ((J)INAD) files, (abbreviated) new animal drug applications ((A)NADA), investigational new drug applications (INDs), new drug applications (NDAs), biologics license applications (BLAs), or abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs). In those instances when a conflict is identified with a proposed proprietary name of a pending drug application, FDA will generally accept the proposed name of whichever application is approved first and notify the other applicant that they must seek a new name.\n\nCVM may object to a proposed name if it may  the product for reasons not solely  related to medication  error prevention.  Among other things, the FD&C Act provides  that a drug  or device  shall be deemed misbranded  if its labeling  is false or misleading  in any particular  (section 502(a) of the FD&C Act). Labeling  may be misleading,  for example, if it employs  a fanciful proprietary name  that suggests that a drug has some unique  effectiveness or composition  when it does not, or  makes misrepresentations  with  respect to safety or effectiveness (see 21 CFR 201.10(c)(3)).\n\nDistributor  product labeling  is not required to be reviewed and approved by FDA prior  to distribution.  Nevertheless, distributor  products are subject to the provisions  of 21 CFR  514.80(b)(5)(iii),  and so the principles  laid out in this guidance  are applicable  to proprietary names  of distributor  products.  Distributor  products deemed misbranded  are subject to the same sanctions  applicable  to any misbranded  new animal drug.\n\nV Naming Attributes That May Misprand The Product\n\nThis section identifies  attributes of proprietary names that may  misbrand  a new animal  drug product.  We recommend that you  evaluate proposed proprietary names for these attributes.  The  appendix  provides a checklist to aid in the assessment of  proposed proprietary  names and provides  FDA\'s  thinking  with respect to each of these attributes.\n\nSimilarities in Spelling and Pronunciation\n\nProprietary names that look  alike  or  sound alike  can increase the risk of medication  errors  when selecting, prescribing, dispensing,  or administering  the product.  Generally, proprietary names should not be similar  in spelling  or pronunciation  to other proprietary names,established names, or ingredients of other animal or human drug products. FDA may consider a proposed proprietary name to be misleading if it may be confused with the proprietary name or the established name of a different drug or ingredient because of similar spelling or pronunciation (see 21 CFR 201.10(c)(5)).\n\nProprietary names also should not incorporate the sponsor\'s name or a part of the sponsor\'s name across multiple products (e.g., ""SponsorName X,"" ""SponsorName Y,"" ""SponsorName Z""). This practice can result in creating multiple similar proprietary names, which may increase the risk of confusion among the products. Confusion may occur when such products are stored alphabetically in distributor or pharmacy locations or when products are ordered from alphabetized lists.6,7,8\n\nFootnote 6: Lambert, BL, S-J Lin, K-Y Chang et al., 1999, Similarity as a risk factor in drug-name confusion errors: The look-alike (orthographic) and sound-alike (phonetic) model, Medical Care, 37(12):1214–1225.\n\nInert or Inactive Ingredients\n\nProprietary names should not incorporate any reference to an inert or inactive ingredient in a way that creates an impression that the ingredient\'s value is greater than its true functional role in the formulation because such names may be misleading (see 21 CFR 201.10(c)(4)).\n\nProducts with Multiple Active Ingredients\n\nProprietary names of drug products that contain more than one active ingredient should not include or suggest the name of one or more, but not all, of its active ingredients (see 21 CFR 201.6(b)). Such names can mislead the end user by implying that the product contains only the ingredient(s) included in the name. (See section 201(n) of the FD&C Act).\n\nUnited States Adopted Names (USAN) Council Stems\n\nProprietary names should not incorporate United States Adopted Name (USAN) stems in the position that the USAN Council designates for the stem. The USAN Council is generally responsible for selecting simple, informative, and unique established names for drug substances. USAN stems are standardized syllables within established names that relate new chemical entities to existing drug families and are intended to indicate a pharmacological or chemical trait of a drug. For example, the stem -cillin is used for penicillins, such as ampicillin, and the stem -inhib is used for kinase inhibitors, such as ockatinib. A single stem may be applicable to multiple drug products. Stems may appear at the beginning,middle, or the end of the established name. Each stem can emphasize a specific chemical structure type, a pharmacologic property, or a combination of these attributes.\n\nUse of these stems in the position designated by USAN within proprietary names, even when such use is consistent with the USAN meaning, can result in the creation of multiple similar proprietary names and/or proprietary names that are similar to established names, leading to an increased risk of medication errors because of name confusion. You should screen proposed proprietary names against the stem list created by the USAN Council to ensure a USAN stem is not present in the stem position in the proprietary name.9\n\nIn rare circumstances, it might be acceptable to include a USAN stem in the USAN-designated position within the proposed proprietary name. Such circumstances could arise if the proposed name includes a word that can only be spelled in the English language using a stem in the position designated by USAN. For example, if a proposed proprietary name includes the word ""congestion,"" the use of the letters ""gest"", which are the USAN stem, is unavoidable.\n\nFootnote 9: See the list of approved USAN stems, available at http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-science/united-states-adopted-names-council/naming-guidelines/approved-stems.page.\n\nReuse of Proprietary Names\n\nYou should not reuse the proprietary name of a discontinued product when marketing a different drug because there is a risk that users may continue to associate the name with the original discontinued product.10 Proprietary names associated with discontinued drug products also may continue to appear in drug product reference texts for extended periods of time.\n\nFootnote 10: See Tu, CM, Taylor, K, and Chai, G. Use of Proprietary Names by Prescribers for Discontinued Brand Drug Products With Existing Generic Equivalents. Drug Information Journal, published on line August 21, 2012, available at http://dii.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/08/21/0092861512456282.full.pdf+html.\n\nNames That Include Reference to Product-Specific Attributes\n\nWe recommend that you avoid incorporating product-specific attributes, such as manufacturing characteristics (e.g., ""DrugnameLyophyllized""), dosage form (e.g., ""DrugnameTabs""), or route of administration (e.g., ""DrugnameOral"") as part of the proposed proprietary name. Including references to product-specific attributes in the proprietary name might be acceptable if the reference to the product-specific attribute is accurate, consistent with the approved product labeling, and does not pose additional risks for medication error. However, when developing proprietary names that include or make reference to product-specific attributes, you should also consider that future changes in the product, such as changes in dosage form or route of administration or manufacturing characteristics, may render the original proprietary name inaccurate.\n\nDosing Interval\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #240 Proprietary Names for New Animal Drugs'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: Methods validation includes an assessment of the suitability of the analytical procedure. A validation plan would have prespecified acceptance criteria for relevant validation parameters such as precision, range, accuracy, specificity, detection limit, and quantitation limit. The proposed acceptance criteria for these parameters would ensure that the analytical procedure is appropriate for its intended use. The validation plan would assess whether a revised procedure is more susceptible than the original procedure to matrix effects by process buffers/media, product-related contaminants, or other components present in the dosage form. A plan would identify any statistical analyses that will be performed and whether product testing to compare the two procedures is intended. The need and plan for providing product testing to compare the two procedures could vary depending on the extent of the proposed change, type of product, and type of test (e.g., chemical, biological).\n\nWhen used for release or process control, use of the new revised analytical procedure should not result in deletion of a test or relaxation of acceptance criteria that are described in the approved application.\n\nDoes FDA Have Specific Concerns About Changes in Manufacturing Equipment That Should Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?\n\nComparability protocols may be most useful if applicants are planning to change to equipment with a different operating principal. Equipment changes are often made in conjunction with changes to the manufacturing process. We recommend that you evaluate this type of change with respect to its effect on the production process prior to deciding whether or not a comparability protocol would be appropriate.\n\nDoes FDA Have Specific Concerns About Changing Manufacturing Facilities That Should Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?\n\nThe utility of a comparability protocol is often limited due to the scope of the change and the need, in some cases, for an inspection. For example, a move to a new facility can involve many changes (e.g., new equipment, modified manufacturing process) that are difficult to prospectively identify as part of a comparability protocol because the new facility is unknown or not constructed at the time the comparability protocol is being considered. We recommend you consider carefully the appropriateness of a comparability protocol for a facility change that involves many other changes.\n\nWe recommend a statement be included in the comparability protocol for changing manufacturing facilities saying that a move to a different drug substance or drug product manufacturing site will be implemented only when the site has a satisfactory CGMP inspection for the type of operation. Furthermore, in the case of aseptically processed product, the statement would also indicate that a move to a different facility or area (e.g., room or building on a campus) will be made only when the specific facility or area has a satisfactory CGMP inspection (irrespective of the overall CGMP status for the campus). For a move to another type of site (e.g., drug substance intermediate manufacturing site, testing laboratory), a statement would be included that the move to this site would not be implemented if there were an unsatisfactory CGMP inspection for the site.9\n\nFootnote 9: A satisfactory CGMP inspection is an FDA inspection during which (1) no objectionable conditions or practices were found (No Action Indicated (NAI)) or (2) objectionable conditions were found, but corrective action is left to the firm to take voluntarily and the objectionable conditions will not be the subject of further administrative or regulatory actions (Voluntary Action Indicated (VAI)).\n\nCan a Comparability Protocol Be Used for Container Closure System Changes?\n\nIn the past, applicants have used protocols for container closure system changes, and they can continue to use them. A comparability protocol can be particularly useful for repetitive container closure system changes.\n\nG. Can Implementation of or Changes in Process Analytical Technology (PAT) Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?\n\nFDA anticipates that implementation of or changes in PAT could be addressed in a comparability protocol. Early dialogue with FDA is encouraged.10\n\nFootnote 10: See GFI titled “PAT – A Framework for Innovative Pharmaceutical Development, Manufacturing, and Quality Assurance” at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM070305.pdf.\n\nCan a VMF Be Cross-Referenced in an Applicant's Comparability Protocol?\n\nA master file can be cross-referenced in a comparability protocol that provides for CMC changes (e.g., new manufacturer of drug substance, container resin). The protocol would include a commitment to provide a letter authorizing the FDA to review the master file when a postapproval CMC change implemented using the approved comparability protocol is reported to FDA. The comparability protocol would also indicate the type of information (e.g., manufacturing and formulation information for a plastic resin) that will be referenced in the master file and the information that you will provide such as the studies you will perform to demonstrate the suitability of the new material (e.g., conformance to approved specification, compatibility studies, stability studies).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nI. Can a Comparability Protocol Be Included in a VMF?\n\nA comparability protocol can be included in a master file. The protocol can be cross-referenced for CMC changes. Comparability protocols are product specific. Therefore, the applicant's submission would provide a comparability protocol that augments the information provided in the master file by specifying, for example, any additional studies that will be performed to demonstrate suitability of the postchange material (e.g., conformance to approved specification, compatibility studies, and stability studies). The FDA ordinarily neither independently reviews master files nor approves or disapproves submissions to a master file.\n\nJ. Can a Comparability Protocol be Included in a (J)INAD?\n\nComparability protocols may be submitted in a chemistry, manufacturing and controls (J)INAD technical data submission11 or a (J)INAD protocol without substantial data.12\n\nFootnote 11: Technical data submissions are described in GFI #132 - Administrative Applications and the Phased Review Process at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM052\n\n532.pdf\n\nFootnote 12: According to the performance goals and procedures for the ADUFA and AGDUFA reauthorizations for fiscal years 2014 through 2018, comparability protocols as described in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(v) may be submitted as comparability protocols without substantial data in a (J)INAD file. For more complex comparability protocols, for example sterile process validation protocols, the sponsor should discuss and have Agency concurrence regarding the appropriate filing strategy. See\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForIndustry/UserFees/AnimalDrugUserFeActADUFA/UCM343226.pdf and\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForIndustry/UserFees/AnimalGenericDrugUserFeActAGDUFA/UCM343235.pdf\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: A comparability protocol should include a plan for the stability studies that will be performed to demonstrate the equivalence of pre- and postchange product. The comparability protocol would provide (1) information that is typically provided in a stability protocol, such as the number and type of batches that will be studied, test conditions, and test time points or (2) a reference to the currently approved stability protocol. The amount of stability data that will be generated before the product made with the change is distributed would be specified. The plan for evaluating stability could vary depending on the extent of the proposed change, type of product, and available manufacturing information. In some cases, no stability studies may be warranted or a commitment to report results from stability studies in an AR can be sufficient. If no stability studies are planned, we recommend that this be stated clearly.\n\nThe differences, if any, in the tests and studies from those previously reported in the approved application or subsequent updates (i.e., supplements, annual reports) would be described. We recommend you identify the location in your application of any referenced tests or studies.\n\niv.2.3 Analytical Procedures to be Used\n\nA protocol should specify the analytical procedures that you intend to use to assess the effect of the CMC changes on the product or intermediate material. Analytical procedures would be chosen capable of detecting new impurities or other changes in a product that can result from the change.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]\n\nmade under the comparability protocol, the specification can be updated and provided when a postapproval CMC change implemented using the approved comparability protocol is reported to FDA.\n\niv.2.5 Data to Be Reported Under or Included With the Comparability Protocol\n\nYou should identify the type (e.g., release, long-term or accelerated stability data) and amount of data (e.g., 3-months accelerated stability data) that will be submitted at the time a postapproval CMC change implemented using the approved comparability protocol is reported to FDA and, when appropriate, generated prior to your distributing the product made with the change (e.g., when proposed reporting category is a CBE-30, CBE-0, or AR).\n\nIf available, you can include any data from studies performed to assess the feasibility of the proposed change with the proposed comparability protocol. Data obtained from a small-scale process or other studies incorporating the proposed change can provide preliminary evidence that the change is feasible, as well as preliminary information on the effect of the change on the product. Development or feasibility studies can provide insight into the relevance and adequacy of the choice of the battery of tests you have identified to assess the product.\n\niv.2.6 Proposed Reporting Category\n\nThe use of an approved comparability protocol may justify a reduction in the reporting category for the particular CMC change when implemented (see III.A). We recommend you include a proposal for the reporting category that you would use for changes implemented using the approved comparability protocol. FDA will evaluate your proposed reporting category as part of its review of the comparability protocol and communicate any concerns about your proposal. Agreement by the applicant and FDA on the reporting category for the specified CMC changes will be part of the process of approving the comparability protocol.\n\niv.2.7 Equivalence Not Demonstrated Using the Approved Comparability Protocol\n\nIt is anticipated that some changes in the manufacturing process will result in a postchange product that cannot be demonstrated to be equivalent to the prechange product without more extensive physicochemical, biological, pharmacology, PK/PD, efficacy, or safety testing or in a product that does not meet the prespecified acceptance criteria in the protocol. You should identify in the protocol the steps you will take in such circumstances.\n\niv.2.8 Commitment\n\nYou should include a commitment in your comparability protocol that you will update or withdraw your protocol when it becomes obsolete (see section IV.D.)Does FDA Have Specific Concerns About Changes in the Manufacturing Process That Should Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?*\n\nIn addition to the general considerations provided in section V.A, we recommend that you consider the following issues for changes in the manufacturing process, where applicable:\n\nv.2.1 Comparison of Physical Characteristics\n\nA comparability protocol would normally include a plan to compare the physical characteristics (e.g., polymorph forms, particle size distribution) of the product produced using the old and new processes when these characteristics are relevant to the safety and/or efficacy of the product.\n\nv.2.2 Comparison of Impurity Profiles\n\nA comparability protocol would include a plan to determine the impurity profile of the product produced using the new process. The studies would assess product-related impurities and process-related impurities, including, if applicable in-process reagents and catalysts. We recommend that attention be given to demonstrating the absence of any new impurities or contaminants, or that they are removed or inactivated by downstream processing. Any changes in the impurity profile would meet the predefined criteria (see section V.A.4). The predefined criteria would indicate when qualification studies will be warranted to evaluate an increased level of an existing impurity or a new impurity (or an applicant could reference a relevant FDA guidance that recommends qualification levels).\n\nIf during implementation of a change under an approved comparability protocol, the data indicate that nonclinical or clinical qualification studies for impurities are warranted, the change would not be appropriate for implementation under the approved comparability protocol (see III.C and V.A.7)\n\nv.2.3 Effect on Downstream Processes\n\nWe recommend that the effect of the change on downstream processes be examined. Downstream processes such as purification steps can be affected by higher product yields or shifts in impurity profiles when upstream processes are modified. For example, adventitious agent removal or inactivation may have to be reassessed for processes involving materials or reagents derived from a biological source. A comparability protocol would discuss how to ensure that the entire manufacturing process is adequately controlled.\n\nv.2.4 Effect on Process Controls and Controls of Intermediates and/or In-process Materials\n\nWe recommend you identify and justify implementation of new controls or variations from approved controls. We recommend a statement be included that controls, including those that have been validated to inactivate and remove impurities or contaminants, will be revalidated for the new production process, if appropriate.\n\nDoes FDA Have Specific Concerns About Changes in Analytical Procedures That Should Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?\n\nA comparability protocol for changing an analytical procedure would provide the plan for validation of the changed analytical procedure and indicate whether the protocol will be used to modify the existing analytical procedure (i.e., retaining the same principle), or to change from one analytical procedure to another (e.g., normal to reverse phase HPLC). The comparability protocol would be designed to demonstrate that the proposed changes in the analytical procedures improve or do not significantly change characteristics used in methods validation that are relevant to the type of analytical procedure (e.g., accuracy, precision, specificity, detection limit, quantitation limit, linearity, range).8\n\nFootnote 8: Guidance on validation of analytical procedures can be found in the CVM/VICH guidances GFI #63/GL1 Validation of Analytical Procedures: Definition and Terminology and GFI #64/GL2 Validation of Analytical Procedures: Methodology.\n\nMethods validation includes an assessment of the suitability of the analytical procedure. A validation plan would have prespecified acceptance criteria for relevant validation parameters such as precision, range, accuracy, specificity, detection limit, and quantitation limit. The proposed acceptance criteria for these parameters would ensure that the analytical procedure is appropriate for its intended use. The validation plan would assess whether a revised procedure is more susceptible than the original procedure to matrix effects by process buffers/media, product-related contaminants, or other components present in the dosage form. A plan would identify any statistical analyses that will be performed and whether product testing to compare the two procedures is intended. The need and plan for providing product testing to compare the two procedures could vary depending on the extent of the proposed change, type of product, and type of test (e.g., chemical, biological).\n\nWhen used for release or process control, use of the new revised analytical procedure should not result in deletion of a test or relaxation of acceptance criteria that are described in the approved application.\n\nDoes FDA Have Specific Concerns About Changes in Manufacturing Equipment That Should Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?\n\nComparability protocols may be most useful if applicants are planning to change to equipment with a different operating principal. Equipment changes are often made in conjunction with changes to the manufacturing process. We recommend that you evaluate this type of change with respect to its effect on the production process prior to deciding whether or not a comparability protocol would be appropriate.\n\nDoes FDA Have Specific Concerns About Changing Manufacturing Facilities That Should Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes FDA\'s current thinking on defining, establishing, and documenting manufacturing activities of the parties involved in contract drug manufacturing subject to current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements. In particular, we describe how parties involved in contract drug manufacturing can use quality agreements to delineate their manufacturing activities to ensure compliance with CGMP.\n\nFor purposes of this guidance, we use certain terms with the following specific meanings:\n\nCurrent Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) refers to requirements in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), section 501(a)(2)(B), for all drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). For finished human and animal drugs, the term includes applicable requirements under 21 CFR parts 210 and 211. For biologics, the term includes additional applicable requirements under 21 CFR parts 600-680.\n\nCommercial manufacturing refers to manufacturing processes that result in a drug or drugs intended to be marketed, distributed, or sold.\n\nCommercial manufacturing does not include research and development activities, manufacturing of material for investigational new drug studies (e.g., clinical trials, expanded access), or manufacturing of material for veterinary investigational drugs. Although this guidance does not explicitly apply to the manufacture of investigational, developmental, or clinical trial materials, FDA believes that quality agreements can be extremely valuable in delineating the activities of all parties involved in contract research and development arrangements. Many of the principles described in this guidance could be applied in pre-commercial stages of the pharmaceutical life cycle.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nManufacturing includes processing, packing, holding, labeling operations, testing, and quality unit operations.\n\nA manufacturer is an entity that engages in CGMP activities, including implementation of oversight and controls over the manufacture of drugs to ensure quality.2 Footnote 2: See section 501 of the FD&C Act, as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (Public Law 112-144, title VII, section 711).\n\nQuality unit is defined as synonymous with the term quality control unit.3\n\nFootnote 3: For quality control unit, see 21 CFR 210.3.\n\nThis guidance covers commercial manufacturing of the following categories of drugs: human drugs, veterinary drugs, certain combination products, biological and biotechnology products, finished products, APIs, drug substances, in-process materials, and drug constituents of combination drug/device products.4 This guidance does not cover the following types of products: Type A predicated articles and medicated feed, medical devices, dietary supplements, or human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR part 1271.\n\nFootnote 4: Combination product manufacturers can apply this guidance to their quality agreements because they are subject to requirements under 21 CFR part 211 and/or 21 CFR part 820 (see 21 CFR 4.3). In addition to facilitating compliance with requirements under 21 CFR part 211, manufacturers can use quality agreements with contract facilities to demonstrate compliance, in part, with 21 CFR 820.50 (purchasing controls) and with 21 CFR 820.80(b) (receiving acceptance activities) for combination products.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Defining the Who and What of Contract Manufacturing\n\nThis guidance describes how contract manufacturing operations fit within the larger scheme of pharmaceutical quality systems. It also presents the Agency\'s current thinking on the roles and manufacturing activities of the parties involved in contract manufacturing arrangements.\n\nSpecifically, this guidance addresses the relationship between owners and contract facilities. For purposes of this guidance, we define owners as manufacturers of APIs, drug substances, in-process materials, finished drug products, including biological products, and combination products. The term owner does not apply to retail pharmacies, drug stores, supermarkets, discount warehouse stores, or other retailers who purchase finished drug products to sell over the counter as a store brand. For purposes of this guidance, we define contract facilities as parties that perform one or more manufacturing operations on behalf of an owner or owners.5\n\n2.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nDrug manufacturing encompasses many discrete operations and activities. One manufacturer may perform all operations and activities or may engage an outside party or parties to perform some or all of the operations and activities under contract. Contract facilities perform a variety of manufacturing operations and activities, including but not limited to:\n\nFormulation\n\nFill and finish\n\nChemical synthesis\n\nCell culture and fermentation, including for biological products\n\nAnalytical testing and other laboratory services\n\nPackaging and labeling\n\nSterilization or terminal sterilization\n\nHowever, agreements between owners and contract facilities sometimes do not clearly define the CGMP-related roles and manufacturing operations and activities of each of the parties. When all parties clearly understand their CGMP-related roles and manufacturing responsibilities, the owners who use contract facilities, contract facilities that provide services to owners, and, ultimately, patients who take the drugs manufactured under these arrangements may benefit in many ways. Contracting can enhance speed and efficiency, provide technological expertise, and expand capacity.\n\nWe encourage entities that engage in manufacturing related solely to drug distribution (e.g., distributors, brokers, private label distributors, own label distributors) to follow the recommendations in this guidance document, as appropriate. Our focus here, however, is on the roles and manufacturing activities of the owner and contract facility.\n\nIII Responsibilities of parties involved in contract manufacturing\n\nEach party engaged in the manufacture of a drug is responsible for ensuring compliance with CGMP for the manufacturing activities it performs.6 For both owners and contract facilities that conduct manufacturing operations, CGMP ""includes the implementation of oversight and controls over the manufacture of drugs to ensure quality, including managing the risk of and establishing the safety of raw materials, materials used in the manufacturing of drugs, and finished drug products.""7 Drugs not manufactured in compliance with CGMP are adulterated.8\n\nFootnote 6: Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act; 21 CFR parts 210 and 211; and 21 CFR part 600.\n\nFootnote 7: Section 501 of the FD&C Act as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (Public Law 112-144, Title VII, section 711).\n\nFootnote 8: Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe FD&C Act also prohibits any person from introducing or delivering for introduction an adulterated or misbranded drug into interstate commerce.9 In addition, it prohibits anyone from the ""doing of any... act with respect to, a... drug... if such act is done while such article is heldfor sale... after shipment in interstate commerce and results in such article being adulterated or misbranded.""10\n\nFDA\'s regulations recognize that owners commonly use contract facilities to perform some drug manufacturing activities.11 When an owner uses a contract facility, the owner\'s quality unit is legally responsible for approving or rejecting drug products manufactured by the contract facility, including for final release.12 The regulations require that the quality unit\'s responsibilities and procedures be in writing and that they be followed.13\n\nFootnote 10: Section 301(k) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR 200.10(b) and 211.22(a).\n--------------------\nContext title: Contract Manufacturing Arrangements for Drugs- Quality Agreements Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry']","['For some changes, the rationale may be as simple as ""due to larger batch size a larger bin blender was required,"" whereas, more complex changes (e.g., change in operating parameters) should be supported by data (reference to the Pharmaceutical Development Report is acceptable).']",0.499999999975,0.2

References to FDA regulations and Federal Register documents, as well as cross-references within this guidance document, are hyperlinked for your convenience. FDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n1.2 What is the purpose of the MDR regulation?\n\nThe MDR regulation provides a mechanism that allows us (the FDA), as well as you (the device manufacturer), to identify and monitor adverse events (deaths and serious injuries) and certain malfunctions involving your medical devices. The goal is to detect and correct problems in a timely manner. The requirements of the MDR regulation are enforced under the authority of the FD&C Act. The enforcement mechanisms include seizure, injunction, civil money penalties, and criminal prosecution.\n\nThe MDR regulation also includes adverse event reporting and recordkeeping requirements for medical device user facilities (e.g., a hospital, ambulatory surgical facility, nursing home, outpatient diagnostic facility, outpatient treatment facility), importers of medical devices, and medical device distributors.\n\n1.3 What are the basic requirements of the MDR regulation that apply to me?\n\nManufacturers, including foreign manufacturers, of legally marketed medical devices in the United States are required to:\n\nSubmit to us reports of MDR reportable events2 involving their medical devices [21 CFR 803.10(c) and 803.50];\n\nFootnote 2: The MDR regulation published on December 11, 1995 (60 FR 63578) also included requirements for manufacturers to submit Annual Certification using FDA Form 3381 and Baseline Reports using FDA Form 3417. The Annual Certification requirement was revoked by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 and removed from the regulation as published on January 26, 2000 (65 FR 4112). The Baseline Reporting requirement was removed from the regulation effective October 27, 2008 (73 FR 33692 and 73 FR 53686).\n* Develop, maintain, and implement written procedures for the identification and evaluation of all medical device events (e.g., malfunctions, serious injuries and deaths) to determine whether the event is an MDR reportable event [21 CFR 803.17] (for related information, see sections 2.10 and 3.1 of this guidance); and\n* Establish and maintain complete files for all complaints concerning medical device events [21 CFR 803.18] (for related information, see section 3.2 of this guidance).\n\n1.4 What are ""MDR reportable events""?\n--------------------\nContext title: Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, How long does FDA estimate it will take firms to compile and provide communications of follow-up information regarding previously communicated information to payors about their unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved/cleared products?\n--------------------\nContext: Repackages or otherwise changes the container, wrapper, or labeling of a device in furtherance of the distribution of the device from the original place of manufacture;\n\nInitiates specifications for devices manufactured by a second party for subsequent distribution by the person initiating the specifications; or\n\nManufactures components or accessories that are medical devices and that are (1) ready to be used and are intended to be commercially distributed and intended to be used as is, or (2) processed by a licensed practitioner or other qualified person to meet the needs of a particular patient.\n\nAll manufacturers of legally marketed medical devices in the US, including foreign manufacturers who export devices to the US, are subject to the MDR regulation and must submit required reports. US manufacturers of medical devices that are not cleared or approved in the US, but are exported to foreign locations, are also subject to the MDR regulation. Failure to submit required reports is a prohibited act [section 301(q) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(q)] (however, see Section 4.11.1 of this guidance for the circumstances under which FDA generally does not intend to enforce MDR reporting requirements for those devices exported under sections 801(e) or 802 of the FD&C Act).\n\nAny person who reprocesses a single use device for reuse in human beings becomes the manufacturer of the device and is subject to all the requirements applicable to the original manufacturer, including the requirements of the MDR regulation [69 FR 7490].\n\nWhen do I ""become aware"" that an MDR reportable event has occurred?\n\nAs a manufacturer, you are considered to have ""become aware"" of an event whenever [21 CFR 803.3]:\n\nAny of your employees becomes aware of information that reasonably suggests that an event is required to be reported in a 30-day report or in a 5-day report that we have requested from you; or\n\nAny of your employees with management or supervisory responsibilities over persons with regulatory, scientific or technical responsibilities (including consultants or contractors) or whose duties relate to the collection and reporting of adverse events, becomes aware from any information (including any trend analysis) that an MDR reportable event(s) necessitates remedial action to prevent an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health. In this case, you must submit a report no later than 5 work days after the day that you become aware.\n\nYour MDR procedures should identify the roles and responsibilities of contractors or consultants that work for you or on your behalf to review and process complaints.\n\nPlease note: The Quality System (QS) regulation requires you to have a formally designated unit to receive, review and evaluate complaints [21 CFR 820.198(a)]. Manufacturers who are subject to the QS regulation should ask all of their employees to forward device-related complaints to that unit in a timely manner (see also sections 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 3.1 of this guidance). Complaints should be evaluated in order to determine if they represent a reportable event in accordance with 21 CFR 803.3(o).\n\nWhat is ""information that reasonably suggests"" that an MDR reportable event has occurred?\n\nThis means any information, including professional, scientific, or medical facts, observations, or opinions that would cause you to come to a reasonable conclusion that a device has caused or may have caused or contributed to an MDR reportable event [21 CFR 803.20(c)]. For guidance on when an adverse event does not have to be reported to us, see section 2.16 of this guidance.\nThis means that a death or serious injury was or may have been attributed to a medical device or that a medical device was or may have been a factor in a death or serious injury, including events occurring as a result of [21 CFR 803.3]:\n\nFailure;\n\nMalfunction;\n\nImproper or inadequate design;\n\nManufacture;\n\nLabeling; or\n\nUser error.\n\nWhat is device ""user error"" and why do you want to know about events involving user error?\n\nWe consider a device ""user error"" (or ""use error"") to mean a device-related error or mistake made by the person using the device. The error could be the sole cause of an MDR reportable event, or merely a contributing factor. Such errors often reflect problems with device labeling, the user interface, or other aspects of device design. Thus, FDA believes that these events should be reported in the same way as other adverse events which are caused or contributed to by the device. This is especially important for devices used in non-health care facility settings. If you determine that an event is solely the result of user error with no other performance issue, and there has been no device-related death or serious injury, you are not required to submit an MDR report, but you should retain the supporting information in your complaint files.\n\nWhat form must I use to submit an MDR reportable event?\n\nYour submission must use an electronic equivalent of Form 3500A which is approved by FDA [21 CFR 803.11 and 803.14]. We have identified mandatory adverse event and reportable malfunction event reports as types of documents that must be submitted electronically.4 You must submit reports of individual adverse events to FDA in an electronic format in accordance with [21 CFR 803.12(a)] and [21 CFR 803.20], unless granted an exemption under [21 CFR 803.19]. (See also section 2.31 of this guidance for information about the electronic submission of MDR events).\n\nFootnote 4: The CDRH May 8, 2008 notification is posted on the Part 11 Docket at FDA-1992-S-0039-0054.\n\nWhat information must be included in my report?\n\nYour report must contain all the information required by 21 CFR 803.52 that is known, or reasonably known to you. Information we consider reasonably known to you includes any information [21 CFR 803.50(b)]:\n\nThat you can obtain by contacting a user facility, importer, or other initial reporter;That is in your possession; or\n\nThat you can obtain by analysis, testing or other evaluation of the device.\n\nInstructions for completing the Form 3500A, and information regarding codes to be used for specific sections of the form may be accessed via the following links:\n\nInstructions for completing Form 3500A:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/DownloadForms/UCM\n\n387002.pdf.\n\nInformation on the current Event Problem Code Hierarchy:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/PostmarketRequire\n\nments/ReportingAdverseEvents/EventProblemCodes/ucm134751.htm.\n\nInstructions for electronic reporting: electronic Medical Device Reporting (eMDR) -\n\nHome Page\n\n2.9 Can I include multiple devices in the same report?\n\nAlthough a user facility may submit one report for an adverse event that involves multiple suspect devices, a manufacturer should submit a separate report for each device involved in the MDR reportable event.5 For example, if you receive a report from a user facility which indicates that more than one of your devices may have contributed to one MDR reportable event, and you cannot determine which device actually caused or contributed to the event or which device malfunctioned, you should submit a separate report for each device potentially involved in the event.\n\nFootnote 5: See http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/DownloadForms/UCM387002.pdf.\n\n2.10 What do you consider to be a device-related complaint and do I have to evaluate the complaint?\n\nFor the purposes of this guidance document, we recommend that you use the definition of a complaint found in the QS regulation, which defines a complaint as:\n\n[A]ny written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of a device after it is released for distribution [21 CFR 820.3(b)].\n\nYou are required to review and evaluate all device-related complaints to determine whether the complaint represents an MDR reportable event [21 CFR 803.18(e) and 820.198].\nYou may receive complaint information from many different sources, including telephone calls or other verbal communication, FAX transmissions, written correspondence, e-mail notification, sales representative reports, service representative reports, scientific articles (literature), internal analyses, and legal documents. You may receive reports directly from user facilities, importers, or voluntary reporters. We may also send you a communication, such as a copy of a user facility or voluntary report.\n\nFDA believes that manufacturers have a responsibility to inform all employees, including marketing, sales, engineering, manufacturing, regulatory, legal, installation, and service personnel, to immediately forward adverse event information to the appropriate person appointed by those entities to submit MDR reports. Thus, FDA generally considers that a manufacturer becomes aware of an adverse event whenever any employee becomes aware of an adverse event (see section 2.20 of this guidance for the specific employees FDA expects to be able to recognize that an adverse event requiring ""remedial action"" to prevent a risk of substantial harm to the public has occurred). Employees should be trained to properly identify, collect, and report complaints to your formally designated complaint handling unit [see 21 CFR 820.198(a) for requirements related to complaint files].\n\nUser facilities and importers have specific mandatory reporting requirements [e.g., 21 CFR 803.10, 803.11, 803.20, 803.30, and 803.40]. If a user facility notifies you of a death or serious injury and has not submitted a completed Form 3500A, we suggest that you remind the user facility of their obligation to do so within 10 work days after the day that it becomes aware of a reportable event. If the report involves a death, the user facility must also send the report to us.\n--------------------\nContext title: Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA or ""we"") developed this guidance to clarify our position regarding manufacturers appropriately and responsibly sharing ""patient-specific information"" - information unique to an individual patient or unique to that patient\'s treatment or diagnosis that has been recorded, stored, processed, retrieved, and/or derived from a legally marketed medical device - with that patient at that patient\'s request. This guidance provides information and recommendations to industry, healthcare providers, and FDA staff about the mechanisms and considerations for device manufacturers sharing such information with individual patients when they request it.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nIncreasingly, patients seek to play an active role in their own healthcare. FDA is aware that sometimes a patient will request that a manufacturer share with her information about herself that has been recorded, stored, processed, retrieved, and/or derived from a legally marketed medical device. FDA is issuing this guidance to clarify our position regarding manufacturers appropriately and responsibly sharing ""patient-specific information"" - information unique to an individual patient or unique to that patient\'s treatment or diagnosis that has been recorded, stored, processed, retrieved, and/or derived from a legally marketed medical device - with that patient at that patient\'s request. FDA believes that sharing ""patient-specific information"" with patients upon their request may assist them in being more engaged with their healthcare providers in making sound medical decisions.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nFor purposes of this guidance, ""patient-specific information"" is information unique to an individual patient or unique to that patient\'s treatment or diagnosis that has been recorded, stored, processed, retrieved, and/or derived from a legally marketed medical device. This information may include, but is not limited to, recorded patient data, device usage/output statistics, healthcare provider inputs, incidence of alarms, and/or records of device malfunctions or failures. For the purposes of this guidance, patient-specific information does not include any interpretations of data by the manufacturer aside from those interpretations of data normally reported by the device to the patient or the patient\'s healthcare provider. For example, results of individual component tests for specific analytes that comprise or are utilized in a cleared assay but have not been individually approved or cleared to test for those specific analytes are not ""patient-specific information"" for purposes of this guidance and so fall outside the scope of the guidance.\n\nGenerally, categories of patient-specific information may include, but are not limited to: (1) data a healthcare provider inputs in the device to record the status and ongoing treatment of an individual patient or (2) information stored by the device to record usage, alarms, or outputs (e.g., pulse oximetry data, heart electrical activity, and rhythms as monitored by a pacemaker). Patient-specific case logs entered into a medical device by a healthcare provider may be included under this definition. This information may be used to facilitate continuity of care, to create an adequate patient treatment history and current treatment profile, and to record information relating to medical device functionality.\n\nIV. Patient-Specific Information Sharing Policy\n\nIn many cases, patient-specific information from a medical device is accessible by the patient\'s healthcare provider and patients can contact their healthcare provider to obtain such information. Alternatively, patients may contact the manufacturer directly and request access to their patient-specific information. In general, although not required under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), manufacturers may share patient-specific information about a patient with that patient at that patient\'s request. In general, manufacturers may do so without undergoing additional premarket review in advance. FDA generally would not consider patient-specific information to be ""labeling,"" as defined in section 201(m) of the FD&C Act. FDA is aware that when manufacturers share patient-specific information with patients, manufacturers also may provide them with supplemental information or other materials (e.g., descriptions of intended use, benefit and risk information, instructions for use) that may be considered labeling. Any labeling is subject to applicable requirements in the FD&C Act and FDA regulations.\n\nWe are aware that some devices are designed to record or transmit information in a format that is not easily provided to the patient. Other devices record and retain information in a closed system that is not accessible by the manufacturer. In such circumstances, it may not be feasible for manufacturers to share patient-specific information with patients as doing so would require manufacturers to redesign devices or gain access to information they do not have.\n\nGenerally, if patient-specific information is shared with patients by manufacturers, it should be comprehensive and contemporary. For example, if a patient requests from a manufacturer a history of her own blood pressure measurements from a device, the data should include all available data up through the most recent measurement. Manufacturers may also format the patient-specific information to facilitate its usability by the patient.\n\nFDA recognizes the important role healthcare providers play in providing interpretation of and context to patient-specific information. FDA recommends that manufacturers advise patients to contact their healthcare providers should they have any questions about their patient-specific information.\n\nFinally, this guidance does not affect any federal, state or local laws or regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) (42 U.S.C. SS 300gg; 29 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. SS 1320d et seq.) and the associated HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164), which may otherwise be applicable to the provision of patient-specific information. Moreover, the guidance does not change FDA\'s policy and is not intended to supersede any other relevant policies and guidances regarding manufacturers\' communications about their devices.\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturers Sharing Patient-Specific Information from Medical Devices with Patients Upon Request Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) encourages the collection, analysis, and integration of patient perspectives in the development, evaluation, and surveillance of medical devices. Patients\' perspectives on living with their health condition and its treatment or management are most useful in medical device evaluation when they are relevant to the regulatory decision and reliably measured.1Patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments facilitate the systematic collection of how patients feel, function, and survive as valid scientific evidence to support the regulatory and healthcare decision-making process.2 By integrating patients\' voices throughout the total product life cycle (TPLC), concepts important to patients can be considered in the evaluation and surveillance of medical devices.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\nFDA has produced several resources to assist the sponsor in selecting, modifying or developing a PRO instrument. These include the guidance entitled, ""Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims;""7 the series of guidance documents and other resources related to Patient-Focused Drug Development;8 and the following resources that were posted to FDA\'s website as part of CDRH\'s 2016-2017 Strategic Priorities: ""Value and Use of Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) in Assessing Effects of Medical Devices,""9 ""COA Case Studies,""10 and ""PRO Compendium.""11 The COA Case Studies include examples of PRO instruments used to support medical device regulatory submissions and the PRO Compendium lists some, but not all, of the PRO instruments that have been used and publicly reported in medical device premarket clinical investigations across a wide variety of devices and indications.\n\nFootnote 7: See Footnote 2.\n\nFootnote 8: For more information see FDA’s Patient Focused Drug Development website on the guidance and discussion guide series https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-approval-process-drugs/fda-patient-focused-drug-development-guidance-series-enhancing-incorporation-patients-voice-medical.\n\nFootnote 9: https://www.fda.gov/media/109626/download\n\nFootnote 10: https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/cdh-patient-science-and-engagement-program/clinical-outcome-assessments-coas-medical-device-decision-making\n\nFootnote 11: https://www.fda.gov/media/109629/download\n\nFootnote 12: See FDA’s guidance “Qualification of Medical Device Development Tools,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/qualification-medical-device-development-tools. See also FDA’s website for a listing of qualified MDDT: https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/science-and-research-medical-devices/medical-device-development-tools-mddt.\n\nIn addition, PRO instruments have been qualified under the Medical Device Development Tools (MDDT) program as tools that medical device sponsors can use in the development and evaluation of medical devices. Qualification under the MDDT program means CDRH has evaluated the tool and concurs with available supporting evidence that the tool produces scientifically-plausible measurements and works as intended within the specified context of use.12\n\nFootnote 12: See FDA’s guidance “Qualification of Medical Device Development Tools,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/qualification-medical-device-development-tools. See also FDA’s website for a listing of qualified MDDT: https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/science-and-research-medical-devices/medical-device-development-tools-mddt.\n\nWith the development of novel technologies and novel uses for existing technologies, it is important that outcomes important to patients are measured and included in medical device submissions, when appropriate. As part of providing valid scientific evidence to assess the safety and/or effectiveness of medical devices, PRO instruments can measure the impact of medical devices on patient well-being and other concepts that may influence healthcare providers and patients when making decisions about potential treatments or management options.\n\nFDA believes that information from well-defined and reliable PRO instruments13 can provide valuable evidence for benefit-risk assessments, and can be used in medical device labeling to communicate the effect of a treatment on patient symptoms, functioning or HRQoL, when the use is consistent with the PRO instrument\'s documented and supported measurement properties. The Agency recognizes there are many ways PRO instruments can be used across the TPLC,including early feasibility, feasibilty, pivotal, and postmarket clinical studies. For example, PRO instruments may be used to help determine a patient\'s eligibility for inclusion within a study, to measure primary or secondary safety and/or effectiveness endpoints, either as a stand-alone or as a component of a composite endpoint. PRO instruments also may be valuable early in the design and development of a device and in postmarket surveillance efforts such as registries. When data from a PRO instrument is used in the evaluation of a medical device, FDA determines the validity evidence needed to support the PRO instrument\'s specified use for a regulatory purpose. FDA uses the term ""fit-for-purpose"" to describe this flexible approach.14\n\nFootnote 14: See Section VII for glossary. BEST Glossary, _FDA-NIH Biomarker Working Group.

This guidance is intended to supplement the aforementioned resources by outlining recommended best practices for developing relevant, reliable, and sufficiently robust PRO instruments using the least burdensome approach. This guidance document does not detail the methods and steps of developing, modifying, or adapting a PRO instrument. Instead, it communicates what FDA believes are some of the best practices for selecting, developing, and modifying PRO instruments for use in medical device evaluation. A glossary is also included as an Appendix to clarify terminology.\n\n4 General Considerations for PRO Instrument use in Medical Device Evaluation\n\nKey Principles\n\nFDA believes the following principles are important to consider when incorporating PRO instruments into the evaluation of the TPLC of medical devices:\n\nEstablish and define the concept of interest (COI) the PRO instrument is intended to capture;\n\nClearly identify the role of the PRO (e.g., primary, secondary, ancillary, effectiveness, safety) in the clinical study protocol and statistical analysis plan;\n\nProvide evidence showing that the PRO instrument reliably assesses the COI; and\n--------------------\nContext title: Principles for Selecting, Developing, Modifying, and Adapting Patient-Reported Outcome Instruments for Use in Medical Device Evaluation Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, And Other Stakeholders'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed this document to provide guidance to industry and FDA staff about the appropriate use of national and international voluntary consensus standards (referred to as consensus standards) in the preparation and evaluation of premarket submissions for medical devices.\n\nFor the current edition of the FDA-recognized standard(s) referenced in this document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database Web site at\n\nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nVoluntary consensus standards can be a valuable resource for industry and FDA staff. The use of consensus standards can increase predictability, streamline premarket review, provide clearer regulatory expectations, and facilitate market entry for safe and effective medical products. Consensus standards provide a consensus approach to certain aspects of the evaluation of device safety and effectiveness, such as testing methods, acceptance criteria, and processes to address areas such as risk management and usability. The use of consensus standards can also promote international harmonization. For decades, FDA has supported and relied on the development anduse of consensus standards to support the Agency\'s mission in protecting and promoting the public health.\n\n1 The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA)\n\nIn 1996, Congress passed the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) (Pub. L. No. 104-113), codifying an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directive, Circular A-119, Federal Participation in the Development and Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards and in Conformity Assessment Activities, that had previously been issued several times, dating back to the late 1970s.1 The NTTAA and OMB Circular A-119 established Federal government policies to improve the internal management of the Executive Branch by directing agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in lieu of government-unique standards except where voluntary consensus standards are inconsistent with law or otherwise impractical.2\n\nFootnote 1: See more information at https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/what-we-do/federal-policy-standards/key-federal-directives.\n\nFootnote 2: Pub. L. No. 104-113, 110 Stat. 775, 783, § 12(d) (March 7, 1996).\n\n2 The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act and 21st Century Cures Act\n\nCongress also enacted the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) (Pub. L. No. 105-115) and the 21st Century Cures Act (Pub. L. 114-255), which amended section 514(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). Section 514(c) states, in part, that FDA ""shall, by publication in the Federal Register... recognize all or part of an appropriate standard established by a nationally or internationally recognized standard development organization for which a person may submit a declaration of conformity in order to meet a premarket submission requirement or other requirement,"" 21 U.S.C. 360d(c)(1)(A).\n\nThe term ""recognize"" in section 514(c) of the FD&C Act refers to FDA\'s formal identification of a standard after a determination that it is appropriate for manufacturers of products to declare conformance to meet relevant requirements in the FD&C Act, including premarket submission requirements.\n\nThis guidance refers to voluntary consensus standards recognized by FDA in the Federal Register in accordance with section 514(c) of the FD&C Act as ""FDA-recognized consensus standards."" A list of consensus standards that FDA has recognized or decided to recognize is available on the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database Web site.3 See section 4 for more information about standards that FDA has decided to recognize but for which recognition is still pending.\n\nFootnote 3: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm\n\nUse of consensus standards to meet premarket submission requirements can help facilitate the premarket review process and is not limited to use in Abbreviated Premarket Notifications (510(k)s), but can also be used for any 510(k), De Novo request, Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application, Premarket Approval (PMA) application, Product Development Protocol (PDP), Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application, Investigational New Drug(IND) Application, or Biologics License Application (BLA) for those devices that are regulated by CBER as biological products under section 351 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. However, in most cases the standards would only satisfy part of the submission requirements. In addition, submitters may choose to conform to applicable consensus standards or address issues relevant to approval or clearance in another manner.4 Regardless of the decision a submitter ultimately makes about the use of consensus standards, submitters should make sure their premarket submissions contain all necessary information, as required by the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations.5\n\nFootnote 4: In the context of this guidance, “submitter” may refer to the holder of a premarket submission, manufacturer, sponsor, or applicant.\n\nFootnote 5: In the case of a device regulated as a biologic under a BLA by CBER, additional information may be required under the PHS Act.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThis guidance describes the appropriate use and documentation of both FDA-recognized and non-recognized consensus standards for premarket submissions and how FDA staff intends to rely on consensus standards during the review process. This guidance provides further clarity and explanation about the regulatory framework, policies, and practices regarding the appropriate utilization of consensus standards for premarket submissions. This guidance is applicable to all articles that meet the definition of a device under section 201(h) of the FD&C Act.\n\nUnder section 514(c) of the FD&C Act, conformity with consensus standards can fulfill requirements other than premarket submission requirements; this use is not discussed in this guidance. This guidance also does not address the specific content required in a particular premarket submission. Additionally, this guidance does not address consensus standards that are incorporated by reference (IBR) into regulations (e.g., 21 CFR 830.10, Incorporation by reference regarding requirements for a Unique Device Identifier).

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe FDA is issuing this guidance to assist industry in preparing premarket notification (510(k)) submissions for display devices intended for use in diagnostic radiology.\n\nThis guidance is intended to apply to current technologies; however, FDA may request new or alternative test methods to fully evaluate the safety and effectiveness of future display technologies. In such instances, we recommend that you contact FDA to determine the appropriate regulatory pathway and testing for your device prior to submitting a 510(k). Please see Section III. Scope for more details on the types of devices covered by this guidance document.\n\nFor the current edition of the FDA-recognized consensus standards referenced in this document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database.1 For more information regarding use of consensus standards in regulatory submissions, please refer to the FDA guidance titled ""Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices.""2\n\nFootnote 1: Available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm.\n\nFootnote 2: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/appropriate-use-voluntary-consensus-standards-premarket-submissions-medical-devices.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThis guidance applies to display devices intended for diagnostic radiology as identified in Section III. Scope, and currently classified under 21 CFR 892.2050 as class II devices.\n\nThis guidance document provides recommendations for the types of information you should provide in your 510(k) submission for display devices intended for diagnostic radiology. This information supplements the requirements for a 510(k) submission found in 21 CFR 807 Subpart E, as well as recommendations provided in other FDA documents concerning the specific content of a 510(k) submission, including FDA\'s guidance entitled, ""Format for Traditional and Abbreviated 510(k)s""3 and FDA\'s guidance entitled, ""Refuse to Accept Policy for 510(k)s.""4\n\nFootnote 3: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/format-traditional-and-abbreviated-510ks.\n\nFootnote 4: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/refuse-accept-policy-510ks.\n\nThis guidance supersedes a previously issued final guidance entitled ""Display Accessories for Full-Field Digital Mammography Systems-Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions"" issued on May 30, 2008.\n\nThis guidance was revised with minor updates to reflect the issuance of the final rule, ""Medical Devices; Medical Device Classification Regulations To Conform to Medical Software Provisions in the 21st Century Cures Act"" (86 FR 20278).5\n\nFootnote 5: See 86 FR 20278 at https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/04/19/2021-07860/medical-devices-medical-device-classification-regulations-to-conform-to-medical-software-provisions.\n\nIII Scope\n\nThis document recommends what to include in a 510(k) submission for display devices in diagnostic radiology as identified by their classification regulation (21 CFR 892.2050) and product code (PGY). These devices are classified as class II devices that are intended to be used in controlled viewing conditions to display and view digital images for primary image interpretation. Display devices for diagnostic radiology may also be referred to as soft-copy displays or medical grade monitors. The classification regulation for these devices reads as follows:\n\n21 CFR 892.2050 Medical image management and processing system\n\nIdentification. A medical image management and processing system is a device that provides one or more capabilities relating to the review and digital processing of medical images for the purposes of interpretation by a trained practitioner of disease detection, diagnosis, or patient management. The software components may provide advanced or complex image processing functions for image manipulation, enhancement, or quantification that are intended for use in the interpretation and analysis of medical images. Advanced image manipulation functions may include image segmentation, multimodality image registration, or 3D visualization. Complex quantitative functionsmay include semi-automated measurements or time-series measurements.\n\nDigital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Std., Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) Std., Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) Test Pattern).\n\nTypically, the 510(k) submission for display devices is separate from the 510(k) submissions of other image acquisition or management devices (e.g., hardware/software for image acquisition or image analysis). However, this guidance may apply when displays intended for diagnostic interpretation classified under 892.2050 (product code PGY) are included as part of a 510(k) submission along with other software and/or hardware.\n\nThis guidance does not apply to real-time displays that are part of the image acquisition device classified under other regulations (e.g., the display on a fluoroscopy system classified under 21 CFR 892.1650 (e.g., product codes JAA, OWB, OXO, QHY, and RCC) or the display on an ultrasonic pulsed Doppler imaging system classified under 21 CFR 892.1550 (e.g., product codes PSV, IYN, and NCS)).\n\nThis guidance does not apply to medical image hardcopy devices under 21 CFR 892.2040.\n\nThis guidance does not apply to imaging software and software applications. For information on these types of devices, please see FDA\'s guidance entitled ""Medical Device Data Systems. Medical Image Storage Devices, and Medical Image Communications Devices.""6\n\nFootnote 6: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/medical-device-data-systems-medical-image-storage-devices-and-medical-image-communications-devices.\n\nThis guidance does not apply to ophthalmic image management systems (product code NFJ) classified under 21 CFR 892.2050; medical cathode-ray tube (product code DXJ) classified under 21 CFR 870.2450; displays intended for whole-slide imaging and digital surgical or anatomical pathology; or displays for non-diagnostic applications in radiology (e.g., displays at the image acquisition workstation that are used by the technologist and not intended for diagnostic image review).\n--------------------\nContext title: Display Devices for Diagnostic Radiology Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff']",['FDA estimates it will take about 2 hours for firms to compile and provide communications of follow-up information regarding previously communicated information to payors about their unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved/cleared products.'],0.0,0.0
6,"Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?","['--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: The Product Identifier Requirement of the DSCSA and the Linear Barcode Requirement Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nIs my product package required to have both a linear barcode and a 2D data matrix barcode?\n\nIt depends. There will be instances when a product package is required to have both a linear barcode, pursuant to SS 201.25, and a 2D data matrix barcode, pursuant to the DSCSA. For a product for which a manufacturer, under the DSCSA, has identified the smallest individual saleable unit intended for ultimate sale to a dispenser--which is a ""package"" under FD&C Act section 581(11)--the package would generally require a 2D data matrix barcode to comply with the DSCSA48 in addition to the requisite linear barcode under SS 201.25. See Section E of this guidance for examples of when a 2D data matrix barcode may not be required.\n\nFootnote 48: See FD&C Act sections 582(b)(2)(A) and 582(a)(9).\n\nWith the enactment of the DSCSA, is the guidance for industry ""Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers"" (August 2011) still applicable for the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25?\n\nYes. The guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers remains applicable to the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25 unless or until such time the guidance is revised, replaced, or withdrawn. This guidance should be consulted for questions specific to the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.49\n\nFootnote 49: See guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers (August 2011), available at https://www.fda.gov/files/vaccines%2C%20blood%20%26%20biologies/published/Guidance-for-Industry–Bar-Code-Label-Requirements.pdf).\n\nCan I put only a 2D data matrix barcode on my product as required under the DSCSA in lieu of the linear barcode that is required under SS 201.25, since it also includes the NDC number?\n\nNo. At this time, a 2D data matrix barcode may not be used as a substitution for a linear barcode when one is required under SS 201.25 for packages of product.\n\nCan a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n\nYes. A manufacturer or repackager may voluntarily put the 2D data matrix barcode on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container, if the product remains compliant with all other labeling requirements, including the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.\n\nExamples of When the Product Identifier Is Required Under the DSCSA and the Linear Barcode Is Required Under SS 201.25\n\nFor each of their products, manufacturers and repackagers are responsible for determining the smallest individual saleable unit that they intend for ultimate sale to a dispenser. Under the DSCSA, both a 2D data matrix barcode and the human-readable portion of the product identifier are required to be affixed or imprinted on each such individual saleable unit. While other levels of product packaging may exist that do not require a 2D data matrix barcode, as noted in Question and Answer #19, manufacturers and repackagers may voluntarily affix or imprint a 2D data matrix barcode if the product remains compliant with all other labeling requirements, including the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.\n\nThe following table provides examples of different units of a package or case and what barcode would be required under the DSCSA and under SS 201.25. It is not an exhaustive list because the information required will depend on the specific details of particular product packaging.\n--------------------\nContext title: Product Identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: IV SCOPE OF GUIDANCE\n\nThis guidance is intended to help manufacturers and repackagers understand and satisfy the requirements of section 582(b)(2) and (e)(2) of the FD&C Act, respectively, to affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product that they intend to introduce in a transaction into commerce. The recommendations in this guidance are intended to assist manufacturers and repackagers in developing standardized formats for the human- and machine-readable information that is contained in the product identifier. The requirements set forth in the DSCSA do not change the linear barcode requirements under 21 CFR 201.25.\n\nV Product Identifiers under the DSCSA\n\nAs noted in Section II of this guidance, a product identifier is defined under section 581(14) of the FD&C Act as a standardized graphic that includes the product\'s standardized numerical identifier (composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number), lot number, and expiration date, in both human- and machine-readable formats. The machine-readable format must be on a data carrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization.10 The product identifier data is specifically required under section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act to be in a ""2-dimensional data matrix barcode"" for packages and in a ""linear or 2-dimensional data matrix barcode"" for homogenous cases, which can be verified using ""human-readable or machine-readable methods.""11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 581(14) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act. As described in section 582(a)(9)(A), FDA may decide in the future to allow the use of other technologies for data instead of, or in addition to, the 2-dimensional data matrix barcode or linear barcode.\n\nUnder section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act, manufacturers are required to ""affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce"" beginning no later than November 27, 2017. Under section 582(e)(2) of the FD&C Act, repackagers are required to ""affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction in commerce"" beginning no later than November 27, 2018. Therefore, each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce must include the NDC, unique serial number, lot number, and expiration date in both human- and machine-readable formats.\n\nVI Compliance Policy for Product Identifier Requirements\n\nIn the guidance titled ""Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Compliance Policy,"" FDA stated that it did not intend to take enforcement action against manufacturers who did not, prior to November 27, 2018, affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction intocommerce as required by section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.12 As the time frame described in this compliance policy has since ended, it no longer represents the Agency\'s thinking in terms of enforcement policy.\n\nFootnote 12: See guidance for industry Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy (September 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance web page at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nVII Products that are subject to the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA\n\nThe product identifier requirements of section 582(b)(2)(A) and (e)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act apply to packages and homogenous cases of product intended to be introduced into commerce via a transaction.13 A ""product"" under section 581(13) of the FD&C Act is a ""prescription drug in finished dosage form for administration to a patient without substantial further manufacturing.""\n\nFootnote 13: There are exemptions to the definition of “transaction” (see section 581(24)(B) of the FD&C Act).\n\nThe following prescription drug products are excluded from the definition of a ""product"" under the DSCSA, and thus are not subject to the product identifier requirements:14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 581(13) of the FD&C Act, defining “product.”\n\nblood or blood components intended for transfusion\n\ncertain radioactive drugs or radioactive biological products15\n\nimaging drugs\n\ncertain intravenous products16\n\nFootnote 15: Radioactive drugs and radioactive biological products excepted from the definition of “product” under the DSCSA are defined in 21 CFR 600.3(ee) and regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or by a state, pursuant to an agreement with such Commission under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2021).\n\nhave noted that the following rule is not applicable to the FD&C Act.\n\nhave noted that the following rule is not applicable to the FD&C Act.\n\ndrug compounds compounded in compliance with sections 503A or 503B of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353a or 353b).\n\nVIII Linear Barcode Requirements Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nConsidering the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA, manufacturers and repackagers have asked FDA whether some of their products are still required under 21 CFR 201.25 to include a linear barcode. The linear barcode requirements were established for different purposes than the DSCSA requirements and apply to additional FDA-regulated products and packaging in some instances, and are still in effect. In the Federal Register of February 26, 2004 (69 FR 9120), FDA published a final rule requiring certain human drug and biological product labels to have a linear barcode that contains, at a minimum, the drug\'s NDC number (SS 201.25).18 Manufacturers, repackers (also known as ""repackagers""), relabelers, and private label distributors of human prescription drug products, biological products, and over-the-counter (OTC) drug products dispensed pursuant to an order and commonly used in hospitals, are subject to the linear barcode requirement. The linear barcode must appear on the drug\'s label as defined by section 201(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(k)). FDA has interpreted that requirement to mean the linear barcode should be on the outside container or wrapper, as well as on the immediate container unless the barcode is readily visible and machine-readable through the outside container or wrapper.19\n\nFootnote 18: See 69 FR 9120 at 9140 (Feb. 26, 2004), https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2004-02-26/pdf/04-4249.pdf.\n\nAs stated in the preamble to the final rule:\n\nBar codes can help reduce or detect potential medication errors by enabling health care professionals to check whether they are giving the right drug via the right dose and right route of administration to the right patient at the right time.20\n\nFootnote 20: Id. at 9120.\n\nThe preamble contemplated that linear barcodes, the use of scanning equipment, and computerized databases would be part of a system that could help reduce the number of medication errors that occur in hospitals and other health care settings.21\n\nFootnote 21: Id. at 9120.\n\nManufacturers, repackers, relabelers, and private label distributors of drug products who are subject to the establishment registration and drug listing requirements in section 510 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360) are responsible for placing the appropriate barcode on the product.22 The following prescription drug products, however, are exempted under SS 201.25 from the linear barcode requirements:\n\nFootnote 22: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products. Private label distributors who do not also manufacture, repack, relabel, or salvage drugs are not required to register under part 207.\n\nFootnote 23: For the purposes of the linear barcode requirements, radiopharmaceuticals are considered “radioactive drugs” or “radioactive biological products”, as defined in 21 CFR 310.3(n) and 21 CFR 600.3(ce), respectively.\n\nFootnote 24: § 201.25(b)(1)(ii).\n\nprescription drug samples\n\nallergenic extracts\n\nintrauterine contraceptive devices regulated as drugs\n\nmedical gases\n\nradiopharmaceuticals23\n\nlow-density polyethylene form fill and seal containers that are not packaged with an overwrap.\n\nFootnote 23: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products. Private label distributors who do not also manufacture, repack, relabel, or salvage drugs are not required to register under part 207.\n\nIn addition, the linear bar code requirement does not apply to prescription drugs that are sold by a manufacturer, repacker, relabeler, or private label distributor directly to patients, unless versions of that same drug are also sold to or used in hospitals.24\n\nIX Questions and Answers\n\nAgency Contacts\n\nWho should be contacted for questions related to barcode requirements for drug packages and homogenous cases under the DSCSA?\n\nFor CDER-regulated products, inquiries should be emailed to:\n\nCDER BarcodeQuestions(@fda.hhs.gov.

Although third-party logistics providers are also considered trading partners under section 581(23)(B) of the FD&C Act, they are not subject to the same product tracing requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nThe Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public Law 113-54) was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier, authorized trading partner, and verification requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers, and dispensersto facilitate the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act is prohibited under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nOne requirement of the verification scheme outlined in the DSCSA is the verification of saleable returned product. Under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act, wholesale distributors must have systems in place that will enable them to verify the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, on each sealed homogeneous case of saleable returned product, or, if such product is not in a sealed homogeneous case, on each package of saleable returned product. A saleable returned product may not be further distributed until the product identifier is verified.13 The product should be handled as suspect product if the product identifier is not successfully verified (i.e., it should be quarantined and investigated).14. 15 FDA published the 2019 Compliance Policy on September 24, 2019, announcing a 1-year delay in enforcement against wholesale distributors who do not verify the product identifier of saleable returned product prior to further distributing such product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 14: See Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs (October 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIn addition, section 582 of the FD&C Act requires certain trading partners (manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers) to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and a transaction statement when engaging in transactions involving certain prescription drugs.16({}^{,})17 A transaction statement must include a statement that the entity transferring ownership in a transaction had systems and processes in place to comply with verification requirements under section 582 of the FD&C Act.18 In the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA acknowledged that wholesale distributors may not have systems in place by November 27, 2019, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, the 2019 Compliance Policy indicated FDA\'s intent to take no enforcement action prior to November 27, 2020, against a wholesale distributor that provided a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor did not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(c)(4)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act details how wholesale distributors must handle suspect product.\n\nFootnote 17: Transaction, transaction history, transaction information, and transaction statement are defined under sections 581(24), (25), (26), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582 also includes requirements for dispensers to verify product identifiers when investigating suspect or illegitimate product. Specifically, section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act provides that, effective November 27, 2020, dispensers must verify ""the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, of at least 3 packages or 10 percent of such suspect product, whichever is greater, or all packages, if there are fewer than 3, corresponds with the product identifier for such product [in the dispenser\'s possession or control]"".19 Section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act requires dispensers to verify product as described in 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act when they have received a notification of illegitimate product from FDA or a trading partner.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIII Compliance Policy for Wholesale Distributor Verification of Saleable Returned Product\n\nAfter publishing the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA has received comments and feedback from wholesale distributors, as well as other trading partners and stakeholders, expressing additional concern with industry-wide readiness for implementation of the verification of saleable returned product requirement for wholesale distributors. Stakeholders have explained that the primary factors FDA considered when issuing the 2019 Compliance Policy still exist: (1) the very large volume of saleable returned products requiring verification; (2) the need to refine and test verification systems during actual production using real-time volumes of saleable returned product rather than simply in pilots; and (3) the complexities of building an interoperable, electronic system with the capabilities to timely and efficiently verify the large volume of saleable returned products amid immature technologies.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some wholesale distributors may still need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, when the delay in enforcement set forth in the 2019 Compliance Policy expires, before they can begin verifying returned products prior to resale or other further distribution as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act in an efficient, secure, and timely manner. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against wholesale distributors who do not verify a product identifier prior to resale or other further distribution of a package or sealed homogenous case of product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAdditionally, FDA recognizes that wholesale distributors may still not have systems in place by November 27, 2020, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, prior to November 27, 2023, FDA does not intend to take action against a wholesale distributor for providing a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor does not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.20\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPolicy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (September 2018), addresses such returns.28_\n\nFootnote 28: For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page.\n\nIV Compliance Policy for the Dispenser Verification Requirements\n\nIn the years since the passage of the DSCSA, FDA has received comments and feedback from dispensers expressing concern with readiness for implementation of certain requirements under section 582(d) of the FD&C Act, including the verification requirements addressed in this compliance policy. Specifically, dispensers have described challenges with implementation of these provisions in the DSCSA due to the time necessary to develop technologies and processes that would support a robust verification system.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some dispensers may need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, before they can begin to verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect and illegitimate products as described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect product as required by section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act. In addition, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify, as required by section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act, the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of product that is the subject of an illegitimate product notification by FDA or a trading partner.\n--------------------\nContext title: Wholesale Distributor Verification Requirement for Saleable Returned Drug Product and Dispenser Verification Requirements When Investigating a Suspect or Illegitimate Product—Compliance Policies'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 18: See section 582(b)(2) of the FD&C Act. Product Identifier is defined in section 581(14) and includes the product’s standardized numerical identifier, which is composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number (see section 581(20)).\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(b)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 20: See section 582(b)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nProduct Tracing and Verification\n\nUnder section 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act, trading partners are required to provide the subsequent purchaser with product tracing information22 for each transaction23 involving a DSCSA-covered MMA product. For example, if the manufacturer transfers ownership of a DSCSA-covered MMA product to a wholesale distributor, the wholesale distributor generally shall not accept ownership of a product unless the manufacturer has, prior to or at the time of the transaction, provided the transaction history, transaction information, and a transaction statement for the product.24\n\nFootnote 21: See FDA Guidance for Industry Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (Sept. 2018). This guidance and other guidance documents on the DSCSA are available on FDA’s website at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nFootnote 22: For purposes of this guidance, the term product tracing information refers to the transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statement defined in section 581(26), (25), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nTrading partners also are required to have verification systems in place for the DSCSA-covered MMA products to comply with the requirements under section 582(b)(4), (c)(4), (d)(4), and (e)(4) of the FD&C Act. These requirements include steps to handle suspect and illegitimate product.25\n\nFootnote 23: Suspect product is defined in section 581(21), and illegitimate product is defined in section 581(8), of the FD&C Act.\n\nVIII. Importation of MMA Products\n\nThis section sets forth recommendations intended to assist importers of MMA products by facilitating an efficient and effective admissibility review. Following the procedures in this section will also assist FDA in determining that the importation is authorized and not, for example, a counterfeit.\n\nImportant Entries for MMA Products\n\nTo help FDA verify that a shipment that purports to contain an MMA product is one in which the manufacturer26 has, in fact, authorized the drug to be marketed in the United States and has caused the drug to be labeled to be marketed in the United States, we strongly encourage the filing of an electronic entry in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). If a manufacturer plans to use or authorize another process for making entry of an MMA product other than ACE, such as a paper entry, we strongly encourage the manufacturer to inform FDA in advance. FDA\'s view is that international mail is not appropriate for the importation of MMA products.\n\nFootnote 26: As noted in footnote 5, above, for purposes of this guidance, the manufacturer is the NDA or BLA holder for the MMA product.\n\nACE is currently the sole Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system authorized by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to process electronic entry and entry summary filings for FDA-regulated products. Submitting complete, accurate information in ACE facilitates effective and efficient admissibility review by FDA. FDA regulations set forth the required data elements that must be submitted in an electronic entry in ACE, or any other EDI system authorized by CBP, for any entry that includes FDA-regulated products (21 CFR Part 1, Subpart D).27\n\nFootnote 27: FDA published its final rule, “Submission of Food and Drug Administration Import Data in the Automated Commercial Environment,” on November 29, 2016 (81 FR 85854), and the rule was effective December 29, 2016.\n\nAt the time of filing entry in ACE, a filer must submit, among other elements, a Drug Listing Number, which is currently the NDC for drugs, including biological products and combination products, regulated by CDER (21 CFR 1.74). For drugs, biological products and combination products, regulated by CBER, the Drug Listing Number is not required. Although not required, FDA strongly encourages filers to submit the Drug Listing Number for CBER-regulated MMA products in ACE at the time of entry because this information will assist FDA\'s initial screening and further review of the entry, which can significantly increase the likelihood that the entry line will receive an automated ""May Proceed"" from FDA.\n\nManufacturer Authorization for MMA Products\n\nAs stated above, section 801(d)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act provides that, with limited exceptions:\n\n[N]o drug that is subject to section 503(b)(1) [of the FD&C Act] may be imported into the United States for commercial use if such drug is manufactured outside the United States, unless the manufacturer has authorized the drug to be marketed in the United States and has caused the drug to be labeled to be marketed in the United States.\n\nUnder this provision, any shipment of a purported MMA product that is offered for importation would be subject to refusal unless the manufacturer has authorized the MMA product to be marketed in the United States. It is essential that FDA be provided the information needed to confirm that each shipment of a purported MMA product offered for importation has been authorized for marketing in the United States by the manufacturer. To help ensure that a particular shipment is authorized, and to help mitigate the potential for counterfeiting, the manufacturer should provide information that is sufficient for FDA to verify that each shipmentof an MMA product has, in fact, been authorized by the manufacturer to be marketed in the United States. This information is described in the following paragraph.\n\nFDA strongly encourages manufacturers to submit a report via the Electronic Submissions Gateway (ESG) (or to an alternative transmission point identified by FDA) notifying the Agency of the importation of an MMA product 10 business days in advance of the first import entry of an MMA product covered by the report, which will facilitate FDA\'s timely admissibility review when the MMA product is offered for import. This report should include: the MMA product name, dosage form, and quantity of the MMA product; the name, address, and telephone number of the authorized importer; and any temporal or other limitations the manufacturer has placed on the authorized importation. For example, a report could authorize multiple shipments of an MMA product for a specified period of time. An updated report should be timely submitted by the manufacturer each time there is a change to the material information in the report; this updated report would be submitted before any additional imports affected by the changes are entered into ACE. Manufacturers who choose to submit this report must do so electronically in Portable Document Format (PDF) using the Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) format and the ESG (or to an alternative transmission point identified by FDA).28 The report should be referenced and placed in Module 1. For further information regarding eCTD, please refer to FDA\'s website at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/Electr\n\nonicSubmissions/ucm153574.htm.\n\nFootnote 28: FDA Guidance for Industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format — Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specifications (Jan. 2019). For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIX Other Requirements applicable to an MMA product\n\nAn MMA product is subject to all relevant requirements of applicable statutes, including those implemented by FDA such as the FD&C Act and the PHS Act; applicable implementing regulations under those authorities; and other relevant statutes, including the Social Security Act, the Poison Prevention Packaging Act, and the Controlled Substances Act. The provisions implemented by FDA include, but are not limited to, provisions related to adulteration and misbranding, and requirements related to adverse event reporting (or postmarketing safety reporting for combination products under 21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B), recalls, and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAppendix A: Dear Healthcare Provider Letter\n\nDear Healthcare Provider\n\nMonth Year\n\nIMPORTED PRODUCT FOLLOWING PROCEDURES IN: ""Importation of Certain FDA-\n\nApproved Human Prescription Drugs, Including Biological Products, and Combination Products\n\nunder Section 801(d)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act: Guidance for\n\nIndustry"" - MODEL LETTER\n\nSubject: Importation of TRADENAME (nonproprietary name for drugs/proper name for\n\nbiological products) (NDC #1, NDC #2): Availability of an FDA-approved prescription drug/biological product/combination product that was originally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and authorized for sale in that foreign country.\n\nDear Health Care Provider:\n\nThe purpose of this letter is to inform you that TRADENAME (NDC #1, NDC #2), an FDA-\n\napproved prescription drug(s)/biological product(s)/combination product(s) that was/were\n\noriginally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and authorized for sale in that foreign\n\ncountry, will be available in the United States.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 7: The materials of construction used in the labeling are a concern from a packaging perspective if they affect the protection and/or safety of the drug product.\n\nQuality refers to the physical, chemical, microbiological, biological, bioavailability, and stability attributes that a drug product should maintain if it is to be deemed suitable for therapeutic or diagnostic use. In this guidance, the term is also understood to convey the properties of safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity (see 21 CFR 211.94(a)).\n\nAn extraction profile refers to the analysis (usually by chromatographic means) of extracts obtained from a packaging component. A quantitative extraction profile is one in which the amount of each detected substance is determined.\n\nCGMP, CPSC and USP Requirements on Containers and Closures\n\nCurrent good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements for the control of drug product containers and closures are included in 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211. A listing of the relevant sections is provided in Attachment A. In addition, a listing of Compliance Policy Guides that deal with packaging issues is provided in Attachment B. References in this guidance to CGMP regulations are provided for completeness. For additional information, refer to the FDA Compliance Program Guidance Manual for Pre-Approval Inspections/Investigations (7346.832) which describes specific responsibilities for CDER scientists and for field investigators.\n\nThe FDA requirement for tamper-resistant closures is included in 21 CFR 211.132 and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) requirements for child-resistant closures are included in 16 CFR 1700. An outline of these and other applicable regulatory requirements is provided in Attachment A.\n\nThe United States Pharmacopeial Convention has established requirements for containers which are described in many of the drug product monographs in The United States Pharmacopeia/National Formulary (USP/NF). For capsules and tablets, these requirements generally relate to the design characteristics of the container (e.g., tight, well-closed or light-resistant). For injectable products, materials of construction are also addressed (e.g., ""Preserve in single-dose or in multiple-dose containers, preferably of Type I glass, protected from light""). These requirements are defined in the ""General Notices and Requirements"" (Preservation, Packaging, Storage, and Labeling) section of the USP. The requirements for materials of construction are defined in the ""General Chapters"" of the USP (see Attachment A).\n\nAdditional Considerations\n\n1.1.1 Submissions of INDs\n\nThe packaging information in the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls section of an IND usually includes a brief description of the components, the assembled packaging system and any precautions needed to ensure the protection and preservation of the drug substance and drug product during their use in the clinical trials.\n\nFor general guidance regarding the container closure system information to be submitted for phase 1 studies, refer to the FDA guidance for industry Content and Format of investigational New Drug Applications(INDs) for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-derived Products (November 1995).\n\nGeneral guidance regarding the container closure system information to be submitted for phase 2 or phase 3 studies will be provided in the FDA guidance for industry INDs for Phase 2 and 3 Studies of Drugs, Including Specified Therapeutic Biotechnology-Derived Products, Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Content and Format, when finalized (draft guidance published April 21, 1999).\n\n1.2 Submissions on Packaging of a Drug Product by Another Firm\n\nContract Packager\n\nA contract packager is a firm retained by the applicant to package a drug product. The applicant remains responsible for the quality of the drug product during shipping, storage, and packaging.\n\nThe information regarding the container closure system used by a contract packager that should be submitted in the CMC section of an application (NDA, ANDA, or BLA), or in a DMF which is referenced in the application, is no different from that which would be submitted if the applicant performed its own packaging operations. If the information is provided in a DMF, then a copy of the letter of authorization (LOA) for the DMF should be provided in the application (see section V.A).\n\nB. Repackager8\n\nFootnote 8: This discussion does not apply to the repackaging of drug products for dispensing under the practice of pharmacy.\n\nA repackager is a firm that buys drug product from the drug product manufacturer or distributor and repackages it for sale under a label different from that of the manufacturer. The repackager is responsible for ensuring the quality and stability of the repackaged drug prpoduct. The repackaging operation is required to e in compliance with CGMPs (21 CFR Part 211), and there are limits to the expiration period that may be used with the repackaged product unless the repackager conducts stability studies.9 Packaging qualification information is not required if the repackager uses the same container closure system approved in the original application.\n\nAll significant phases of the manufacturing and processing of a drug product (including packaging) should be described as part of the CMC section of an application (NDA, ANDA or BLA), or in a DMF referenced in the application. The only exception is the repackaging of solid oral drug products for which an approved application already exists.10 For biologics, repackaging is considered a step in the manufacturing process for which licensing is required (21 CFR 600.3(u) and 601).\n\nFootnote 9: FDA Compliance Policy Guides, “Expiration Dating of Unit Repackaged Drugs,” 480.200, February 1, 1984, rev. March 1995 (CPG 7132b.11).\n\nFootnote 10: FDA Compliance Policy Guides, “Regulatory Action Regarding Approved New Drugs and Antibiotic Drug Products Subjected to Additional Processing or Other Manipulation,” 446.100, January 18, 1991 (CPG 7132c.06).\n\n3 Qualification and Quality Control of Packaging Components\n\nIntroduction\n\nCDER and CBER approve a container closure system to be used in the packaging of a human drug or biologic as part of the application (NDA, ANDA or BLA) for the drug or biologic. A packaging system found acceptable for one drug product is not automatically assumed to be appropriate for another. Each application should contain enough information to show that each proposed container closure system and its components are suitable for its intended use.\n\nThe type and extent of information that should be provided in an application will depend on the dosage form and the route of administration. For example, the kind of information that should be provided about a packaging system for an injectable dosage form or a drug\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]\n\nIII.G); and Other Dosage Forms (section III.H).\n\nAppendix B General Considerations\n\nSuitability refers to the tests and studies used and accepted for the initial qualification of a component or a container closure system for its intended use. Quality control (QC) refers to the tests typically used and accepted to establish that, after the application is approved, the components and the container closure system continue to possess the characteristics established in the suitability studies. The subsections on associated components and secondary components describe the tests and studies for establishing suitability and quality control for these types of components. However, the ultimate proof of the suitability of the container closure system and the packaging process is established by full shelf life stability studies.\n\n(\\quad) Suitability for the Intended Use Every proposed packaging system should be shown to be suitable for its intended use: it should adequately protect the dosage form; it should be compatible with the dosage form; and it should be composed of materials that are considered safe for use with the dosage form and the route of administration. If the packaging system has a performance feature in addition to containing the product, the assembled container closure system should be shown to function properly.\n\nInformation intended to establish suitability may be generated by the applicant, by the supplier of the material of construction or the component, or by a laboratory under contract to either the applicant or the firm. An adequately detailed description of the tests, methods, acceptance criteria, reference standards, and validation information for the studies should be provided. The information may be submitted directly in the application or indirectly by reference to a DMF. If a DMF is used, a letter authorizing reference (i.e., letter of authorization (LOA)) to the DMF must be included in the application (see section V.A).\n\nGeneral issues concerning protection, compatibility, safety and performance of packaging components and/or systems are discussed below. In this guidance, component functionality and drug delivery will also be addressed in connection with specific dosage forms and routes of administration (see sections III.D, III.E, III.F, III.G, and III.H).\n\n(\\quad) Protection A container closure system should provide the dosage form with adequate protection from factors (e.g., temperature, light) that can cause a degradation in the quality of that dosage form over its shelf life. Common causes of such degradation are: exposure to light, loss of solvent, exposure to reactive gases (e.g., oxygen), absorption of water vapor, and microbial contamination. A drug product can also suffer an unacceptable loss in quality if it is contaminated by filth.\n--------------------\nContext title: Container Closure Systems for Packaging Human Drugs and Biologics Guidance for Industry']","['Yes.

For additional information on 45 CFR Part 46\n\nsubpart A refer to the Office for Human Research Protections at\n\nhttp://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.htm.\nYes, in many cases an investigational IVD study is eligible for IRB expedited review (see 21 CFR 56.110), for both initial approval and continuing review. The categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure are described in the Federal Register notice on expedited review, found at http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/Guida ncesInformationSheetsandNotices/ucm118099.htm. As stated in a Federal Register notice, however, sponsors and investigators may not use the expedited review procedure where identification of the subjects and/or their responses would reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects\' financial standing, employability, insurability, reputation, or be stigmatizing, unless reasonable and appropriate protections will be implemented so that risks related to invasion of privacy and breach of confidentiality are no greater than minimal. (63 FR 60353, November 9, 1998).\n\n6. Can leftover specimens be used in IVD studies without informed consent?\n\nThe document entitled, ""Guidance for Industry, Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Food and Drug Administration: Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies using Leftover Human Specimens that are not Individually Identifiable,"" http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo currents/ucm078384.htm, describes the limited circumstances in which FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion regarding requirements for informed consent. (See Glossary for definition of ""leftover specimens"".)\n\n7. Can those who routinely conduct studies with IVDs (e.g., research hospitals) use a general informed consent to address future studies using samples collected in their own facility?\n\nTo fulfill FDA informed consent requirements for studies of IVDs, a site may develop an informed consent process to address the use of samples collected at the facility (see the Glossary for definition) in a specific study or for a broader category of future studies. This general informed consent process may be used for subjects seen at and/or admitted to a specific facility. The informed consent document must contain all of the required elements found in 21 CFR 50.25.\n\n8. Can a human specimen that was initially collected in a study with the informed consent of the subject be used in a later study without a new consent process?\n\nIf the original informed consent document contains a statement that excess specimen(s) will be stored for future use in specified types of studies and the new study meets the criteria stated in that consent document, it is possible that no further consent is necessary. This assumes that the original informed consent document contains all of the other essential elements, including notice to the subject that FDA may review their files and an explanation of the purposes and benefits of the research. (See 21 CFR 50.25.) We recommend sponsors and investigators consult with the IRB regarding the need for a new informed consent process in such a case. The IRB decision should include consideration of any state and/or local requirements regarding informed consent and patient rights. If new testing could expose the subject to previously unanticipated risks (e.g., privacy concerns for the subject and/or his family related to testing for a genetic marker), a new consent may be needed. In addition, if the original informed consent did not address future research use at all, or did not cover the type of study now under consideration, it is likely a new consent will be needed.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, for human specimens leftover from specimens originally collected for a previous study, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion regarding informed consent requirements. See ""Guidance for Industry, Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Food and Drug Administration: Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies using Leftover Human Specimens that are not Individually Identifiable,"" http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo\n\ncuments/ucm078384.htm.\n\nVI. Data Considerations\n\n1. What information should the protocol include to ensure that the investigational IVD study will be scientifically sound?\n\nWe recommend that the protocol include a clear description of study design; objectives, estimation of performance goals (e.g., desired confidence interval widths) that are directly related to the intended claims for the IVD device, or hypotheses; and a statistical plan to be applied to the data. (See the Glossary for definitions of protocol, statistical hypothesis, and confidence interval.)\n\n2. Is it acceptable to develop new or to revise existing study hypotheses as the study progresses?\n\nWe generally believe it would be inappropriate to draw conclusions from after-the-fact hypotheses. We recommend that changes in study protocols be carefully documented and explained. FDA encourages sponsors to contact the appropriate review division to discuss studies before they are initiated and to consult FDA before changes in protocols are made mid-study. (For the FDA divisions responsible for review of IVD products, see Introduction, Section II, of this guidance.)\n\n3. How should I determine appropriate sample size for a study?\n\nThe sponsor should formulate sample size based on standard statistical techniques and the sample size should account for any unique issues related to intended use(s), device technologies, and/or the biology of the condition being studied.\n\nWhat guidance is available for sponsors to determine how to estimate IVD performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity, how to handle discrepant results, and what to do when a study is performed without a truth standard (""gold standard"") (see the Glossary for definitions)?\n\nFDA has recognized a number of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [(CLSI), formerly National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS)] standards related to these issues. A list of these standards, but not the standards themselves, can be found through the database on the CDRH web page http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scrlpts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards\n\nThe agency\'s guidance entitled ""Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests"" can be viewed at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo currents/ucm071148.htm\n\nHow much leeway is there in deciding on the populations from which human specimens are collected and under what conditions are data on simulated specimens (see the Glossary for definition) acceptable?\n\nStudies should be performed in a representative sample of the intended use population (i.e., representation of both diseased and non-diseased cases, and controlling for subject demographics and morbidity factors that may affect the level of device performance). When a disease is rare or samples are needed specifically to challenge cut-off points, sponsors may use enriched samples, panels of credentialed samples (e.g., Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) panels), and/or spiked or contrived samples. The acceptance of simulated specimens depends on how well they represent specimens from the intended-use population and whether their performance accurately reflects what the IVD device user can expect.\n\nIs it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., ""outliers"")?\n\nAn outlier, an observation that lies an unexpected distance from other values, does not in itself prove that an error or violation has occurred. Therefore, the primary data analysis should include all such observations, including ""outliers"". A sponsor may perform some specific supplemental analyses on subsets of the data, if clinically and scientifically justified, that may exclude outlying data points. Excluding large amounts of data, regardless of the reasons for exclusion, will seriously bias the results.\n\nCan I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?In most studies the sponsor should avoid multiple testings of the same subject because it may skew performance statistics and under-estimate standard deviations. When multiple testing is done, the sponsor should explain why it is necessary and choose methods of statistical analysis that allow adjustment for within-subject correlation. It is appropriate to conduct repeated testing of the same sample to evaluate test reproducibility - i.e., the ability of the test to yield the same or similar readings when expected.\n\n8. How much precision (see the Glossary for definition) is needed for measurement data, e.g., in terms of decimal places?\n\nStudy data should contain no more decimal places than the precision of the instrument allows, i.e., if the instrument is only precise to the second decimal place the sponsor should not analyze the data using three decimal places.\n\n9. What records should help to ensure scientific soundness of an IVD investigational study?\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: The requirement in section 505(i) of the FD&C Act for informed consent for investigational use of drugs (including biologics) provided that FDA regulations must ensure informed consent is obtained ""except where it is not feasible or it is contrary to the best interest of such human beings."" In order to promote consistency across medical products, FDA adopted regulations reflecting the device standard for all medical product research.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s regulations governing the protection of human subjects conform to the requirements in the ""Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects"" (the Common Rule), with a few exceptions because of differences in FDA\'s mission or statutory authority. The Common Rule, originally promulgated in 19913, sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (see 45 CFR 46, Subpart A) and 15 other Federal departments and agencies. The purpose of the Common Rule is to promote uniformity, understanding, and compliance with human subject protections as well as to create a uniform body of regulations across the Federal departments and agencies.4 FDA regulations and the Common Rule share the same definition for ""minimal risk,"" but the Common Rule allows a waiver of informed consent for minimal risk research if specific criteria are met. As stated above, FDA\'s regulations currently do not include an exception from informed consent for minimal risk clinical investigations.5\n\nFootnote 4: 80 FR 53931 at 53935, September 8, 2015.\n\nFootnote 5: Note that this exception from the requirement to obtain informed consent differs from the waiver from the requirement for documentation of informed consent permitted under both the Common Rule and FDA regulations (45 CFR 46.117(c); 21 CFR 56.109(c)).\n\nIII Discussion\n\nThe Common Rule standard has been adopted and successfully employed for decades by numerous other Federal agencies. The Common Rule permits an IRB to waive the requirements to obtain informed consent, or to allow changes to, or omission of, some or all elements of informed consent if the IRB finds and documents that: (1) the research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects; (2) the waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; (3) the research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration; and (4) whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation. (45 CFR 46.116(d)).6\n\nFootnote 6: The final rule that recently revised the Common Rule (82 FR 7149, January 19, 2017) adds a fifth criterion (i.e., “if the research involves using identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, the research could not practicably be carried out without using such information or biospecimens in an identifiable format” (new 2018 requirement at 45 CFR 46.116(f)(3)(iii)). As FDA revises its regulations to harmonize to the extent appropriate and permissible with the Common Rule, we will consider including this new criterion in any waiver provision.\n\nThe Secretary\'s Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections (SACHRP) provided input on the issue of whether waiver of informed consent provisions for certain minimal risk clinical investigations would be appropriate and helpful to FDA-regulated research. On March 13, 2014, SACHRP considered this issue. Recognizing that harmonization with the Common Rule would promote consistency and help to reduce confusion in the research community about when a waiver of informed consent may be permitted, while also facilitating certain FDA-regulated research, SACHRP recommended to the Secretary of HHS that FDA adopt the provisions for waiver of informed consent that exist under the Common Rule at 45 CRF 46.116(d). On October 26, 2016, SACHRP reiterated that recommendation to the Secretary.7_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nIV IRB waiver or Alteration of Informed Consent\n\nWaiver of informed consent for certain FDA-regulated minimal risk clinical investigations will facilitate investigators\' ability to conduct studies that may contribute substantially to the development of products to diagnose or treat diseases or conditions, or address unmet medical needs. In light of the Cures Act amendment to the FD&C Act described above, FDA intends to revise its informed consent regulations to add this waiver or alteration under appropriate human subject protection safeguards to the two existing exceptions from informed consent (i.e., in life-threatening situations and for emergency research). However, until FDA promulgates these regulations, we do not intend to object to an IRB8 approving a consent procedure that does not include, or that alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set forth in 21 CFR 50.25, or waiving the requirements to obtain informed consent when the IRB finds and documents9 that:\n\nFootnote 8: An institutional review board (IRB) is defined in 21 CFR 56.102(g) and is subject to the requirements of 21 CFR part 56.\n\nFootnote 9: An IRB is required to prepare and maintain adequate documentation of its activities, including actions taken by the IRB, under 21 CFR 56.115.\n\nThe clinical investigation involves no more than minimal risk (as defined in 21 CFR 50.3(k) or 56.102(i)) to the subjects;\n\nThe waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects;\n\nThe clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration; and\n\nWhenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation.\n\nFDA does not intend to object to a sponsor initiating, or an investigator conducting, a minimal risk clinical investigation for which an IRB waives or alters the informed consent requirements as described above. FDA intends to withdraw this guidance after we promulgate regulations to permit a waiver or alteration of informed consent under appropriate human subject protection safeguards consistent with section 3024 of the Cures Act.\n\nV Inquiries about Specific Clinical Investigations\n\nSponsors, investigators and IRBs may contact FDA for questions about implementing the recommendations in this guidance for a specific clinical investigation.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance outlines FDA\'s regulatory approach for approval of Class III in vitro diagnostic devices, as well as certain licensed1 or certain cleared2 in vitro diagnostic devices in cases, when a previously approved, licensed, or cleared assay is migrating (i.e., transitioning) to another system for which assay performance has not been evaluated by FDA.2 In this guidance the term ""new system"" refers to the system (assay, instrument, and software) to which the assay is migrating from a previously approved/licensed/cleared system. The term ""old system"" refers to the system (assay, instrument and software) which was approved/licensed/cleared from which the assay is migrating to a currently unapproved/unlicensed/uncleared system.\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance does not apply to immunohematology tests licensed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance can be used for 510(k) devices where the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy (http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm) does not apply (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests) and devices for which transitioning to a new system presents specific concerns, either because of the nature of the analyte and indications, or because of the specific technology used.\n\nThis guidance is focused on the study designs and performance criteria that should be fulfilled in order for a sponsor to utilize the migration study approach in support of the change. FDA will review information from the sponsor, including results of analytical and comparison studies outlined in this guidance, as well as device descriptions and risk analyses, to determine whether the use of the approved/licensed/cleared assay with the new system may compromise safety and effectiveness of the assay. The guidance document describes information that we recommend you include in a PMA (premarket approval application) supplement, a BLA (Biologicals License Application) supplement, or a 510(k) (premarket notification). For devices regulated by OIR (Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health, within CDRH), sponsors may contact OIR, and for those regulated by CBER, sponsors may contact CBER to obtain feedback concerning study plans.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe FDA believes that the assay migration study paradigm discussed in this guidance provides a least burdensome scientific and regulatory pathway for manufacturers to transfer a previously approved or licensed assay with full clinical data from an old system to a new system (not approved. licensed, or cleared). The paradigm is suitable in cases when sufficient knowledge can be derived from the documentation of design controls, risk analyses, and prior performance studies on an old system.\n\nIf you make further modifications or iterations of the old or new system you should compare back to the original old system that has full clinical data when performing new migration studies. However, if the old system with full clinical data is no longer available please contact the appropriate FDA CDRH or CBER Division for further discussion.\n\nThe migration studies approach is related to the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy that FDA uses for many Class I and Class II diagnostic devices.3 Similar to that policy, migration studies rest on the premise that as platform changes are made throughout the lifetime of an approved, licensed, or cleared assay, smaller and more focused analytical and clinical data sets, along with prior knowledge of device design and performance, could allow for a determination that the safety and effectiveness profile of the modified system has not been compromised.\n\nFootnote 3: http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm.\n\nThe assay migration study paradigm is practical, risk based, and consistent with FDA\'s Critical Path Initiative, which is intended to help bring new medical products to market successfully and efficiently4. FDA believes that with proper control and review, migration studies will meet regulatory thresholds for premarket review in a manner that will be least burdensome for both companies and FDA while protecting public health.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThis guidance is intended to be applied, where appropriate, to licensed donor screening tests5 and approved (Class III) in vitro diagnostic assays, as well as 510(k) cleared assays for which migration to a new system presents concerns. Possible scenarios for assay migration are when the assay is being transferred from a manual system to an automated or semi-automated instrument system or from a semi-automated instrument system to a fully automated instrument system, or from one automated instrument system to another (and vice versa for all scenarios). A broad variety of methodologies may use the migration studies paradigm depending on what is known about the two Systems involved. Assay transfer may be from one approved, licensed, or cleared old system to a new system that has the same technical characteristics. However, if scientific evidence suggests migration studies may not be adequate to predict actual clinical testing performance on the new system, the assay migration paradigm should not apply and FDA will recommend that traditional evaluation studies be performed.\n\nFootnote 5: FDA does not believe that this guidance is suitable for use in its entirety when immunohematology tests (e.g., blood grouping, blood group antibody detection and/or identification, crossmatching) are being migrated because of the differences in assay methodology and results reading and interpretation as compared to the other assays and systems described in this guidance. If you believe that your immunohematology reagents and system can be evaluated using the criteria outlined in this guidance, contact the responsible review division in CBER. Immunohematology products are reviewed in the Devices Review Branch, Division of Blood Applications, Office of Blood Research and Review, CBER.\n\nAssay migration studies are ideally suited for test systems for which the assay output (raw signal) is a numeric result or is expressed as a signal to cutoff (S/CO). Devices for which a numeric output is not available might be more difficult to analyze and may not be suitable candidates for use of this approach.\n\nMigration studies would not be applicable to the following devices or to system changes that are generally considered significant, such as:\n\nsystems intended for over-the-counter use,\n\nsystems intended for prescription home use, or\n\ndevices that do not meet the Critical Considerations criteria stated below.\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 22: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/assay-migration-studies-vitro-diagnostic-devices.\n\nOption 3: As an alternative to comparison study designs, for certain test systems, flex and human factors engineering studies may provide sufficient assurance that the change in user populations and environment of use between non-waived and waived settings will not adversely impact the results provided by the candidate test; i.e., that the likelihood of erroneous results by the users is negligible. Possible study design approaches that may be suitable include flex study designs described in section IV above and human factor study designs described in FDA\'s guidance ""Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineeringto Medical Devices.""23 FDA believes this approach is generally appropriate for test systems for which:\n\nFootnote 23: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/applying-human-factors-and-usability-engineering-medical-devices.\n\ncollection of a specimen is either always performed by a professional (for example, an endocervical swab collected by a doctor) or always by a patient (for example, a urine specimen collected by the patient), and\n\nother pre-analytical steps are very simple (for example, placement of the entire specimen in the analyzer), and\n\nintended use patient populations are sufficiently similar.\n\nAdditionally, another scenario where this option may be appropriate is a CLIA waiver application for a modification of a previously waived test system where the Quick Reference Guide was not modified (or minimally modified). FDA encourages manufacturers considering modification of a test system previously waived by application to contact FDA through a Pre-Submission to discuss planned modifications, as well as study designs and analyses to validate that the modified test system meets the statutory criteria for CLIA waiver.24\n\nFootnote 24: A Pre-Submission is a type of Q-Submission. For information regarding the process for obtaining feedback from the FDA, see the guidance “Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.\n\nOption 4: Comparison study designs in which the results of the candidate test in the hands of untrained operators are directly compared to the results of an appropriate comparative method in the hands of trained operators. This option is also useful for Dual Submissions where a 510(k) and CLIA waiver are being sought concurrently.\n\nFor general recommendations on comparison study design and analysis for Options 1 and 4, we recommend you follow appropriate FDA-recognized consensus standards, such as:\n\nFor quantitative tests: CLSI EP21,25 CLSI EP27.26 Footnote 25: CLSI EP21 Evaluation of Total Analytical Error for Quantitative Medical Laboratory Measurement Procedures.\n\nFor qualitative tests: CLSI EP12.27 Footnote 26: CLSI EP27 How to Construct and Interpret an Error Grid for Quantitative Diagnostic Assays.\n\nFor Options 1, 2, and 4, if sufficient valid scientific evidence on the imprecision of the test and the performance of the test at low levels (limit of detection and limit of quantitation) when performed by untrained operators is not available from the studies described above, additional studies should be performed to allow comparison of the imprecision and limit of detection/limit of quantitation of the test when performed by untrained and trained operators. We recommend following appropriate FDA-recognized consensus standards (e.g., CLSI EP05,28 CLSI EP12, CLSI EP1729) for these studies.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApplicants are strongly encouraged to submit a Pre-Submission to obtain feedback from FDA on planned study designs prior to conducting the study. FDA welcomes discussion of additional study design approaches besides the four options presented in this guidance.30\n\nFootnote 30: For information regarding the process for obtaining feedback from the FDA, see the guidance “Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The O-Submission Program,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.\n\nAppendix B Considerations in Satisfying CLIA Waiver Requirements\n\nOne statutory criteria that a test can meet to obtain a CLIA waiver centers on the simplicity of the test and whether the user can conduct the test with a negligible likelihood of erroneous results.31 All tests have some likelihood of erroneous results, but whether the likelihood of erroneous results in the hands of waived test users is negligible will vary from test to test depending on a number of factors. These factors include intended use, context of use (e.g., patient population, use environment), and the probable benefit(s) and probable risk(s)/harm(s) associated with waived use of the test. FDA intends for its approach to benefit-risk considerations to be consistent with the principles expressed, to the extent applicable, in FDA\'s other guidances.32 Accordingly, the appropriate acceptance criteria for the studies performed using the design options described above will vary from test to test. For example, for a qualitative test performed following study Options 1 or 2, the minimum level of agreement between results of the test in the hands of untrained and trained users for demonstrating comparable performance should generally be higher for a test for which erroneous results in waived settings are associated with a higher extent of probable patient risk/harm than for tests with lower probable risk/harm in waived settings.\n\nFootnote 31: 42 U.S.C. § 263a(d)(3)(A).\n\nFootnote 32: See, for example, “_Benefit-Risk Factors to Consider When Determining Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications (510(k)) with Different Technological Characteristics,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/benefit-risk-factors-consider-when-determining-substantial-equivalence-premarket-notifications-510k, and “_Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/factors-consider-when-making-benefit-risk-determinations-medical-device-premarket-approval-and-de.\n\nAppendix C General Study Design Considerations\n\nFor all study design options, FDA recommends that applicants evaluate test performance in settings designed to replicate, as closely as possible, actual CLIA-waived settings, patients, samples, and test operators. Therefore, study designs should include the following:\n\nTesting sites that are representative of the intended use of the waived test.\n\nSubject populations that are representative of the intended patient population(s).\n\nIntended sample type and matrix.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nUntrained operators representative of those at intended waived settings. We encourage you to enroll operators with the least amount of training that might be encountered at the types of sites for which this device is intended.\n\nTesting should be integrated into the daily workflow of the facility where the operators are often multitasking between patient care, testing, and other duties.\n\nTesting sites\n\nYou should conduct the study to support CLIA waiver at a minimum of three sites that are representative of both the intended use patient population and the intended operators in CLIA-waived settings. Generally, the sites should include different demographic and geographic locations (e.g., outpatient clinic, physician\'s office), since patient populations and intended operators typically vary among different demographic locations. In your CLIA waiver application, you should present a brief description of each site, including its name, address, and the date the study was performed. If there were sites that were included at the beginning, but then did not complete the study, you should provide a brief explanation for why those sites did not complete the study.\n\nFor study Options 1 and 2, trained operators may perform testing at the same sites as the untrained operators, or at a different laboratory site. For study Option 4, trained operators should perform testing with the comparative method at an appropriate laboratory site.\n\nOperators\n\nUntrained operators\n\nThe study should include 1-3 untrained operators at each site and at least nine (9) untrained operators across all sites. You should ensure that the untrained operator study participants enrolled represent anticipated operators of the device you propose for CLIA waiver. Untrained operators should have limited or no training or hands-on experience in conducting laboratory testing and should not have previous training or experience with the candidate test, but may have limited experience with other waived or home use tests. Untrained operators should be personnel currently employed in the selected intended use sites and testing should be integrated into the daily workflow of the facility where the operators are often multitasking between patient care, testing, and other duties. We recommend that you record and tabulate the education (including experience and training) and the occupation of each untrained operator to demonstrate that these participants meet the definition of intended operators and include this in your CLIA waiver application. In addition, for each study site, we recommend you report the same information on other personnel that were available at the testing site but that were not chosen to participate.\n\nTrained operators\n--------------------\nContext title: Recommendations for Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) Waiver Applications for Manufacturers of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed this document to provide guidance to industry and FDA staff about the appropriate use of national and international voluntary consensus standards (referred to as consensus standards) in the preparation and evaluation of premarket submissions for medical devices.\n\nFor the current edition of the FDA-recognized standard(s) referenced in this document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database Web site at\n\nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nVoluntary consensus standards can be a valuable resource for industry and FDA staff. The use of consensus standards can increase predictability, streamline premarket review, provide clearer regulatory expectations, and facilitate market entry for safe and effective medical products. Consensus standards provide a consensus approach to certain aspects of the evaluation of device safety and effectiveness, such as testing methods, acceptance criteria, and processes to address areas such as risk management and usability. The use of consensus standards can also promote international harmonization. For decades, FDA has supported and relied on the development anduse of consensus standards to support the Agency\'s mission in protecting and promoting the public health.\n\n1 The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA)\n\nIn 1996, Congress passed the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) (Pub. L. No. 104-113), codifying an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directive, Circular A-119, Federal Participation in the Development and Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards and in Conformity Assessment Activities, that had previously been issued several times, dating back to the late 1970s.1 The NTTAA and OMB Circular A-119 established Federal government policies to improve the internal management of the Executive Branch by directing agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in lieu of government-unique standards except where voluntary consensus standards are inconsistent with law or otherwise impractical.2\n\nFootnote 1: See more information at https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/what-we-do/federal-policy-standards/key-federal-directives.\n\nFootnote 2: Pub. L. No. 104-113, 110 Stat. 775, 783, § 12(d) (March 7, 1996).\n\n2 The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act and 21st Century Cures Act\n\nCongress also enacted the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) (Pub. L. No. 105-115) and the 21st Century Cures Act (Pub. L. 114-255), which amended section 514(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). Section 514(c) states, in part, that FDA ""shall, by publication in the Federal Register... recognize all or part of an appropriate standard established by a nationally or internationally recognized standard development organization for which a person may submit a declaration of conformity in order to meet a premarket submission requirement or other requirement,"" 21 U.S.C. 360d(c)(1)(A).\n\nThe term ""recognize"" in section 514(c) of the FD&C Act refers to FDA\'s formal identification of a standard after a determination that it is appropriate for manufacturers of products to declare conformance to meet relevant requirements in the FD&C Act, including premarket submission requirements.\n\nThis guidance refers to voluntary consensus standards recognized by FDA in the Federal Register in accordance with section 514(c) of the FD&C Act as ""FDA-recognized consensus standards."" A list of consensus standards that FDA has recognized or decided to recognize is available on the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database Web site.3 See section 4 for more information about standards that FDA has decided to recognize but for which recognition is still pending.\n\nFootnote 3: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm\n\nUse of consensus standards to meet premarket submission requirements can help facilitate the premarket review process and is not limited to use in Abbreviated Premarket Notifications (510(k)s), but can also be used for any 510(k), De Novo request, Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application, Premarket Approval (PMA) application, Product Development Protocol (PDP), Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application, Investigational New Drug(IND) Application, or Biologics License Application (BLA) for those devices that are regulated by CBER as biological products under section 351 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. However, in most cases the standards would only satisfy part of the submission requirements. In addition, submitters may choose to conform to applicable consensus standards or address issues relevant to approval or clearance in another manner.4 Regardless of the decision a submitter ultimately makes about the use of consensus standards, submitters should make sure their premarket submissions contain all necessary information, as required by the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations.5\n\nFootnote 4: In the context of this guidance, “submitter” may refer to the holder of a premarket submission, manufacturer, sponsor, or applicant.\n\nFootnote 5: In the case of a device regulated as a biologic under a BLA by CBER, additional information may be required under the PHS Act.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThis guidance describes the appropriate use and documentation of both FDA-recognized and non-recognized consensus standards for premarket submissions and how FDA staff intends to rely on consensus standards during the review process. This guidance provides further clarity and explanation about the regulatory framework, policies, and practices regarding the appropriate utilization of consensus standards for premarket submissions. This guidance is applicable to all articles that meet the definition of a device under section 201(h) of the FD&C Act.\n\nUnder section 514(c) of the FD&C Act, conformity with consensus standards can fulfill requirements other than premarket submission requirements; this use is not discussed in this guidance. This guidance also does not address the specific content required in a particular premarket submission. Additionally, this guidance does not address consensus standards that are incorporated by reference (IBR) into regulations (e.g., 21 CFR 830.10, Incorporation by reference regarding requirements for a Unique Device Identifier). For additional information, see the Standards Incorporated by Reference Database Website.6\n\nFootnote 6: https://standards.gov/sibr/query/index.cfm\n\nIV.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: Summary of the Final Rule that Implements Section 506B\n\n1.1.1 Human Drug Products\n\nThe final rule amended 21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(vii) to implement section 506B. Under this section, you must provide the FDA with annual 506B reports on each 506B study annually until we notify you, in writing, that the FDA concurs with your determination that the study commitment has been fulfilled, or that the study is either no longer feasible or would no longer provide useful information. This provision will apply in rare cases to the holder of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nUnder 21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(viii), the final rule requires you to provide the FDA with annual status reports on voluntary studies that are being performed by you or on your behalf, CMC commitments that you have agreed to perform, and for all stability studies.\n\nUnder 21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(ix), you may list any open regulatory business with the FDA concerning the drug product subject to the application (e.g., a list of the applicant\'s unanswered correspondence with the Agency, a list of the Agency\'s unanswered correspondence with the applicant).\n\nThe FDA provides in its annual Federal Register report and on its Web site information submitted in annual status reports under 21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(vii). The FDA does not disclose under the public disclosure provisions of 506B information about voluntary studies, CMC commitments, stability studies, or any open regulatory business submitted in NDA annual reports under 21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(viii) or 314.81(b)(2)(ix).\n\nA summary of the requirements for postmarketing study commitment status reports of human drug products, as stated in the rule, is depicted in the following flow chart.\n\nii.1.2 Licensed Biological Products\n\nTo implement section 506B of the Act, the final rule required annual 506B reports, and revised existing requirements for reports of postmarket pediatric studies to require 506B reports to be filed under 21 CFR 601.70.\n\nUnder new 21 CFR 601.70, you must provide the FDA with 506B reports on each 506B study annually until we notify you, in writing, that the FDA concurs with your determination that the study commitment has been fulfilled, or that the study is either no longer feasible or would no longer provide useful information. Status reports on voluntary studies, CMC commitments, and stability studies should not be reported under 21 CFR 601.70. The status of these studies should be reported according to your agreement, if any, with the FDA, and you may report them voluntarily.\n\nA summary of the requirements for postmarketing study commitment status reports of licensed biological products, as stated in the rule, is depicted in the following flow chart.\n\nIII Procedures concerning Postmarketing Study Commitments\n\nSubmitting Postmarketing Study Commitment Protocols\n\nThe type of study and the agreements you reached with the Agency before product approval -- or post-approval, in some cases -- will influence when the protocol for a postmarketing study commitment should be submitted. The time frame for submitting the study protocol should be negotiated between you and the review division as a part of your commitment. However, it is generally expected that you will submit the protocol for required studies (e.g., accelerated approval clinical benefit studies, animal efficacy clinical benefit and safety studies) before approval of your application. The FDA intends to undertake timely review of the submitted protocol.\n\nProtocols for clinical studies requiring an investigational new drug application (IND) should be submitted to the appropriate IND with a copy of the cover letter to the NDA, ANDA, or biologics license application (BLA). Protocols for studies not requiring an IND (e.g., toxicology or CMC studies) should be submitted to the NDA, ANDA, or BLA. If you have specific questions for the FDA regarding the protocol design, study conduct, study goals, and/or data analysis, you should include those focused questions as part of the cover letter in the submission. All submissions should be clearly labeled Postmarketing Study Commitment Protocol.\n\nEstablishing a Study Schedule\n\nFor each 506B study, you must develop a schedule for completing that commitment (21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(vii)((a))(7) and 601.70(b)(7)). Often, the study schedule is established at the time of approval and documented in the Agency\'s approval letter for the application, and you would report that schedule in your initial 506B report. Otherwise, you must establish that schedule in your initial 506B report. The study schedule included in your 506B report should provide, for each commitment, dates for submission of the study protocol to the FDA, dates for completion of patient accrual (or initiation of an animal study, if applicable), dates for completion of the study, dates for submission of the final study report to the FDA, and any additional dates, if the commitment specifies projected dates for any additional milestones or submissions.\n\nStudy schedules are sometimes developed with reference to the date that you and the FDA agree on the protocol (protocol agreement date). If you request and obtain FDA review of and agreement to a proposed study protocol, establish subsequent dates in your schedule with reference to the protocol agreement date. In most cases, you and the FDA will have concurred on a protocol before you are required to file your first annual postmarketing study commitment status report for that commitment, and you will be able to use actual dates for each entry in the schedule (e.g., Projected Final Study Report Submission Date: June 1, 2006). For instances when you and the FDA have not reached concurrence on a protocol before you file your first annual postmarketing study commitment status report (e.g., your annual report for a drug is due shortly after you entered into a commitment), you can describe your schedule dates by reference to a period of time from a protocol agreement date (e.g., completion of patient accrual: 6 months after protocol agreement; completion of the study: 12 months after protocol agreement).\n\nIf you choose not to request FDA review of and agreement to the study protocol, you should establish a schedule for study completion, including dates for completing all study milestones, without reference to a protocol agreement date. We note that if you proceed without Agency review of the study protocol, it is possible that, when the study is concluded, the FDA may not agree that the completed study satisfies your commitment.\n\nYou do not need to provide schedules for studies conducted on your own initiative (e.g., without a commitment to, or requirement by, the FDA).\n\nRevising a Study Schedule\n\nIf it becomes necessary for any reason to revise the projected dates for study milestones, submit a revised study schedule, along with the reasons for the revision, in your next 506B report (21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(vii)((a))(9) and 601.70(b)(9)). Although schedule revisions are sometimes necessary, we will use the original study schedule to determine the study progress and to designate its status as pending, ongoing, or delayed (21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(vii)((a))((\\delta)) and 601.70(b)(8)). If the schedule has been previously revised, you must include a copy of the original study schedule and the most recently revised schedule in your annual status report (21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(vii)((a))(7),(9) and 601.70(b)(7),(9)) (see section IV).\n\nWhen to Submit Postmarketing Study Commitment Status Reports\n\nYou must submit 506B reports for both human drugs and biological products annually until we notify you, in writing, that the FDA concurs with your determination that the study commitment has been fulfilled, or that the study is either no longer feasible or would no longer provide useful information (21 CFR 314.81 (b)(2)(vii) and 601.70(b)) (see section III.G.). Your 506B report must be submitted to the FDA each year within 60 days of the anniversary of the FDA\'s approval of your NDA, ANDA, or BLA (21 CFR 314.81(b)(2) and 601.70(c)).\n\nHow to Submit Annual Postmarketing Study Commitment Status Reports\n\niii.4.1 Human Drug Products\n\nYour annual report should clearly distinguish 506B reports from reports on the status of voluntary studies, CMC commitments, and stability studies, with separate headings for each section. However, it is useful to list or cross-reference the CMC study commitments that you have agreed, in writing, to conduct and whose statuses are reported under 21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(viii) in the ""Status Reports of Postmarketing Study Commitments"" section of the annual report. The cover letter should clearly identify the annual report submission as including an Annual Status Report of Postmarketing Study Commitments. The annual report must be accompanied by one copy of Form FDA-2252 (Transmittal of Annual Reports for Drugs and Biologics for Human Use) (21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)).\n\nTwo copies of your annual reports for human drug products must be sent to the review division responsible for reviewing the application (21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)). We encourage the electronic submission of annual reports, including 506B reports, submitted according to the electronic records requirements described under 21 CFR part 11.\n\niii.4.2 Licensed Biological Products\n--------------------\nContext title: Reports on the Status of Postmarketing Study Commitments — Implementation of Section 130 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997']","[""A general comparison appears in the FDA's Good Clinical Practice program website, Comparison of FDA and HHS Human Subject Protection Regulations found at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/EducaionalMaterials/ucm112910.htm.

8,"After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?","[""--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: The definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n\nThe determination of the amount of added sugars contributed by a powdered fruit or vegetable juice that is added as an ingredient to a product and that is not reconstituted to single strength juice during processing (e.g., that is added to a pureed fruit or to a yogurt) would be the same as the determination of the sugars contributed by a liquid or frozen fruit or vegetable juice concentrate. In our response to question 11, we have suggested that when calculating the added sugars declaration for a product containing concentrated fruit or vegetable juice, the total moisture content of the finished product can be considered to go towards reconstitution of the fruit juice concentrate in the formulation. Thus, the total moisture content of a finished product formulated with powdered fruit or vegetable juice concentrates can be considered to contribute towards the dilution of the powdered fruit or vegetable juice. Further, the sugars contributed by the powdered fruit or vegetable juice that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type must be declared as added sugars on the label, as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule.\n8. Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates? We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12). We require that, when a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)). If you use Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 to calculate the amount of added sugars in a product containing juice concentrate, you must document this information in the records regarding the amount of added sugars added to the food during processing (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). If you use the amount of sugars present in a single strength juice and/or a juice concentrate, that is determined through chemical analysis or other available information, when calculating the amount of added sugars in a product containing fruit juice concentrate, you must document the source of the information and/or the amount of sugars determined through chemical analysis in the records that you make and keep (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). If a diluted juice concentrate slightly exceeds the amount of sugar that would be found in the same volume of the same type of 100 percent fruit juice, manufacturers should document the average and consistency with cGMPs in the records that they make and keep.\n9. Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis? The amount of added sugars declared on the label must be in grams (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The added sugars definition includes sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. For juice, the serving size is based on volume (e.g., 8 oz. or 240 ml) while the amount of added sugars per serving is based on weight. Therefore, when calculating the weight of added sugars per serving, you may need to consider the densities of both the finished juice product and the single strength juice of the same type. You may choose to arrive at the gram amount of added sugars in different ways. Please see our responses to questions 11 and 12 for examples of how to calculate the amount of added sugars in products containing concentrated fruit juices on both a volume and weight basis.\n10. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit or vegetable juice (juice made from a single type of fruit or vegetable) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength juice where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)? In the hypothetical example below, we provide three general steps to calculate the amount of added sugars (in grams) for an apple juice product (240 ml serving size) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength apple juice. The product in this hypothetical example is reconstituted to have juice soluble solids above the minimum Brixrequirement in 21 CFR 101.30 where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9). Therefore, all sugars in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice must be declared as added sugars. The apple juice example here uses the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration. This example is provided solely to demonstrate one method of calculating the added sugars content of the product. You can use alternate methods.\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals""

It specifically explains how FDA intends to consider exercising enforcement discretion when a conflict occurs between compliance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), section 101.9(c), and compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(g) such that compliance with both sections is not possible.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nFDA\'s regulations in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 describe requirements for nutrition labeling in conventional foods and dietary supplements, respectively. The requirements for declaring the nutrient value in a serving of conventional food are in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8). Certain dietary ingredients in dietary supplements are also required to be declared in accordance with these requirements (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)). These dietary ingredients are listed in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2) and are referred to as ""(b)(2)-dietary ingredients."" Unlike nutrients in conventional food, the (b)(2)-dietary ingredients can only be declared when they are present in dietary supplements in amounts that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling according to 21 CFR 101.9(c) (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nFDA\'s regulations under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and (5) describe compliance requirements for declaring nutrients and dietary ingredients2 in nutrition labeling. A conventional food or dietary supplement declaring the amount of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in its labeling is misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)] if:\n\nFootnote 2: See 21 CFR 101.36(f)(1).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber is below 80 percent of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).3 Footnote 3: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of calories, total sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).4 Footnote 4: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).\n\nFor the remainder of this document, we refer to 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) as ""the compliance requirements.""\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nIn many cases, the amount of a nutrient or (b)(2)-dietary ingredient declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) will not conflict with the compliance requirements. However, certain small amounts of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients cannot be declared in accordance with both 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) and the compliance requirements. In these cases, the amount declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) is below or above the level provided by the compliance requirements.\n\nExample 1 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(iv), monounsaturated fat content must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams. Therefore, if the analyzed value of monounsaturated fat is 0.75 to 1.00 grams, the amount of monounsaturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 1.00 gram (or 1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value is 0.80 gram or greater. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value of monounsaturatedfat is 0.75 to 0.79 gram because values in this range are not at least equal to 80 percent of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 1 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are below 80 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are greater than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable excesses of nutrients, such as monounsaturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nExample 2 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i), saturated fat must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams, unless the amount is less than 0.5 gram. Therefore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.50 to 0.74 gram, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 0.50 gram (0.5g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 0.50 to 0.60 gram. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.61 to 0.74 gram because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 0.50 gram.\n\nFurthermore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 1.00 to 1.24 grams, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i) is 1.00 gram (1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.20 grams or less. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.21 to 1.24 grams because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 2 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are above 20 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are less than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable deficiencies of nutrients, such as saturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nFor certain nutrients, such as total fat and its components (including monounsaturated fat and saturated fat), if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the amount must be expressed as zero in nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(c)). Unlike nutrients in conventional food, (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in dietary supplements must not be declared in nutrition labeling when the amount is zero (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nIV FDA\'s Policy\n\nAs discussed, when the analyzed value of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients present in small amounts is declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8), the declared amount may conflict with the compliance requirements. In such cases, we intend to consider the use of our enforcement discretion with respect to the compliance requirements and recommend that manufacturers declare nutrients and (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines includes a recommendation for healthy eating patterns that limit added sugars (including honey, syrups, and other caloric sweeteners) to less than 10 percent of calories per day (Ref. 3).\n\nNutrition Facts Label Final Rule\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016, we issued a final rule updating the Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods to reflect new scientific information (see 81 FR 33742). The Nutrition Facts label final rule includes changes in the individual nutrients that must be declared and also changes some of the DVs. The science underlying the Nutrition Facts label final rule, referenced above, is also reflected in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires that added sugars be included in the Nutrition Facts label and established a DV for added sugars. The Nutrition Facts label final rule defines ""added sugars,"" in part, to include sugars that are either added during the processing of foods or are packaged as such (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The term includes free sugars (free mono- and disaccharides), sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The Nutrition Facts label final rule requires added sugars to be declared on the food label by stating ""Includes Xg Added Sugars"" indented directly below ""Total Sugars"" (see 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(ii)).\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires a declaration for added sugars, in part, because excess consumption of added sugars makes it difficult to meet nutrient needs within the calorie limits generally needed to maintain a healthy weight and can lead to an increase in overall caloric intake. Further, healthy dietary patterns characterized, in part, by lower amounts of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, as compared to less healthy dietary patterns, are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary_Guidelines demonstrates that meeting nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits is difficult with more than 10 percent of total daily calories from added sugars (50 grams of added sugars based on a 2,000 calorie diet). Based on this science, the Nutrition Facts label final rule establishes a DV for added sugars, 50 grams based on a 2,000 calorie diet for adults and children 4 years of age and older and 25 grams based on a 1,000 calorie diet for children 1 through 3 years of age (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(vii)).\n\nPure (100%) honey, pure (100%) maple syrup, other single-ingredient sugars and syrups, and certain cranberry products sweetened with added sugars contribute to the DV of added sugars, regardless of whether they are added by consumers to foods (e.g., maple syrup poured over pancakes; sugar added to dried cranberries to increase palatability) or consumed in isolation (e.g., a spoonful of honey). FDA\'s definition encompasses the types of added sugars that were evaluated in the science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommendation that no more than 10 percent of calories be from added sugars. These sugars were considered ""empty calories"" or ""calories for other uses"" in the USDA Food Patterns.\n\nDraft Guidance\n\nIn the Federal Register of March 2, 2018 (83 FR 8953), we made available a draft guidance for industry entitled ""The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, and Certain Cranberry Products; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availability"" (hereafter referred to as ""the draft guidance"") and asked interested parties to submit comments by May 1, 2018. In the Federal Register of April 25, 2018 (83 FR 17961), we extended the comment period to June 15, 2018. We have considered comments to the draft guidance, and we have made modifications, where appropriate, that are now reflected in this final guidance.\n\nFarm Bill\n\nAfter we published the Nutrition Facts label final rule and the Serving Size final rule, and draft guidance, the President signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (""the Farm Bill""). Section 12516 of the Farm Bill states that the food labeling requirements under section 403(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)) shall not require that the Nutrition Facts label of any single-ingredient sugar, honey, agave, or syrup, including maple syrup, that is packaged and offered for sale as a single-ingredient food bear the declaration ""Includes Xg Added Sugars."" Therefore, single-ingredient sugars, honey, agave, and syrups, including maple syrup, do not need to have this statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving of their product on their label. At the same time, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nAlthough the gram amount of added sugars in a serving of pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups does not need to be declared on the label, these single-ingredient sugars and syrups are required under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV that they contribute to added sugars in the diet. The percent DV on pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups provides important information to consumers about how the addition of sugar from these products contributes to their total daily diet. In the absence of the declaration of the amount of added sugars in a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product, a statement that includes information about the amount of sugars in a serving, as well as how that amount contributes to the consumer\'s diet and the percent DV for added sugars, provides information that can assist consumers in constructing a diet that is consistent with recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nTherefore, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the use of a ""(\\dagger)"" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV and, per the Farm Bill, the term ""Includes Xg Added Sugars"" would not need to appear on the line on the Nutrition Facts label disclosing the added sugars percent DV. The ""(\\dagger)"" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading within a footnote in the Nutrition Facts label box that includes a description of the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent DV for added sugars in the diet. The footnote containing this factual statement should be placed beneath the required footnote that states, ""The % Daily Value (DV) tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice"" (see illustration below).5 Our intent to exercise enforcement discretion is limited to any pure, single-ingredient honey and maple syrup, and other pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups.\n\nFootnote 5: Note that the illustration provides an example of a truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet. FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for the use of any truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet.\n\nWe also intend to exercise our enforcement discretion for certain cranberry products described here (dried cranberries without added flavorings and cranberry beverages made up of cranberry juice that is sweetened with added sugars that provide an amount of total sugars in a serving that does not exceed the level of total sugars in a serving of a comparable product with no added sugars) to allow for the use of a ""(\\dagger)"" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV. The ""(\\dagger)"" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nManufacturers could explain, through the use of such statements, that the sugars added to dried cranberries or the cranberry beverage product are meant to increase the palatability of the naturally tart fruit and that the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. We have provided illustrations of such statements that we consider to be truthful and not misleading below.\n\nAt this time, we are not aware of products, other than the dried cranberry and cranberry beverage products previously discussed, for which the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. Therefore, at this time we only intend to exercise enforcement discretion for cranberry products previously discussed with respect to the use of the ""(\\uparrow)"" that would direct consumers to truthful and not misleading statements on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label, and do not intend to exercise enforcement discretion on other products (e.g., a granola bar or trail mix containing dried sugar-sweetened cranberries). We note that we would consider whether the same type of enforcement discretion discussed with respect to the cranberry products previously described might be warranted for other products where the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, such as naturally tart fruits, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: 3. Do I need to take into consideration sugars from ingredients that are used in formulating my product when determining the added sugars declaration for a serving of my product?\n\nIngredients containing free mono- and disaccharides that meet our definition of added sugars need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (e.g. sugars from cane sugar and concentrated fruit juice added to sweeten an apple sauce). Manufacturers may need to work with ingredient suppliers to determine the amount of added sugars provided by ingredients used in formulating food products.\n\n4. Do the sugars in dried fruits meet the definition of added sugars?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we responded to comments on dried fruits (see response to comment 212, 81 FR 33742 at 33837). We said that dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them should not be considered to contain added sugars because they are essentially a dehydrated whole fruit and still retain the nutrients and other components of a whole fruit (e.g. diced dried apples). However, if additional sugar is added to a dried fruit, the sugar added to the dried fruit must be declared on the label as added sugars (81 FR 33742 at 33837).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5. Are the sugars used in the production of vinegar added sugars?\n\nIn the production of vinegar, naturally occurring sugars are first fermented into alcohol and then a secondary fermentation occurs in which alcohol is converted to vinegar. For most vinegar products, no sugars remain in the final product. Vinegars that do not contain any sugars in the finished food would not need an added sugars declaration. However, we are aware of some vinegars (e.g., balsamic vinegar) that are made using ingredients that are often used as sweeteners in foods, and that are similar to concentrated fruit juices (e.g., grape must). According to the definition of added sugars, sugars found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type are added sugars. Therefore, fruit juices that are concentrated before or during processing of some vinegars contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars. To the extent that sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are present in the finished product, the added sugars must be declared on the label and in labeling, as required in our Nutrition Facts label final rule. We understand that the manufacturing of vinegar involves several steps, and manufacturers need to consider the impact of these steps (e.g. potential concentration due to water loss when aged in wooden barrels) on the final added sugars declaration.\n\n6. The definition of added sugars excludes the ""fruit component of fruit spreads."" What constitutes the ""fruit component"" of a non-standardized fruit spread?\n\nPlease see our response to question 1 above. The fruit component of a non-standardized fruit spread would include whole fruits, pieces of fruit, dried fruit, fruit or vegetable pures (single strength or concentrated), fruit pulps, single strength juices, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders that are not made from fruit or vegetable juices.\n\n7. Do sugars found in fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the form of the fruit or vegetable (e.g., concentrated fruit and vegetable pures, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders) need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833), we explained that we excluded from the definition of ""added sugars"" whole fruit, fruit pieces, dried fruit, pulps, and pures because they are nutrient rich and maintain the basic properties of a fruit when added to foods and are not considered to contain added sugars (see response to comment 208, 81 FR 33742 at33835). We also explained that sugars from 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, and sugars from certain fruit and vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under certain regulations, fruit juice concentrates used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, and preserves under our standards of identity, and 100 percent juice concentrate sold directly to consumers (e.g. frozen orange juice concentrate) are excluded from the definition of ""added sugars.""\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833 through 33834), we explained that, while foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices can be a part of a healthful diet, the sugars added to the foods by the concentrated fruit or vegetable juice provide additional calories. Over the course of the day, small amounts of calories in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages can add up and make it difficult to balance the amount of calories expended (81 FR 33742 at 33834). For these reasons, we consider foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices to be sugar-sweetened foods (id).\n\nWe also explained that in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report (Ref. 1) (81 FR 33742 at 33835).\n\nWe are applying these same guiding principles when determining when the sugars in an ingredient are added sugars. Concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes, and some fruit and vegetable powders are essentially whole fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the physical form of the fruit or vegetable and to remove moisture. They maintain the basic properties of a whole fruit or vegetable, even if the peel and seeds may be removed. Their composition and use is more consistent with that of whole fruits or vegetables, dried fruits or vegetables, pulps and pureses than that of concentrated fruit juices, which are commonly used by industry in place of sugars. Therefore, the sugars in concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes and some fruit and vegetable powders contribute to the diet the same way that sugars found in whole fruits or vegetables do, and do not have to be declared as added sugars on the label. However, we consider sugars in powders made from fruit and vegetable juices to be the same as those found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices because such powders are essentially concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that have all moisture removed. Therefore, some or all sugars contributed by a powder made from fruit or vegetable juices must be declared as added sugars on the label as required by the Nutrition Facts label final rule, depending on the degree of reconstitution in the finished food.\n\nThe definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: A food that already contains some endogenous sugar and additional added sugars, either directly or as a component in an ingredient, such as sweetened fruit added to yogurt, would be misbranded if the actual ""Total Sugars"" amount is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label, or the records requirements for ""Added Sugars"" are not met (see SS 101.9(g)(11)).\n\nDo sugars present in a sweet fermented beverage after fermentation need to be declared as total or added sugars on the label?\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains only sugars that meet our definition of added sugars (e.g. table sugar), then the amount of sugars present in a serving of the product after fermentation must be declared as both total and added sugars (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains both sugars that do and do not meet our definition of added sugars, you may determine the amount of total sugars in the finished food analytically. You have the following options related to the added sugars declaration:\n\nDetermine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in the finished product and make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information you relied upon that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation; or\n\nDeclare the amount of added sugars added prior to fermentation and make and keep records to verify the amount (21 CFR 101.9(g)). The amount of added sugars declared should not exceed the amount of total sugars on the label; or\n\nIf you have no way to determine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in the finished food, but have reason to believe that a significant reduction of added sugars took place during fermentation, you may submit a petition, under 21 CFR 10.30, to request an alternative means of compliance. The petition should provide scientific data or other information for why the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product is likely to be significantly reduced compared to the amount added prior to fermentation. A significant reduction would be where reduction in added sugars after fermentation may be significant enough to impact the label declaration for added sugars by an amount that exceeds the reasonable deficiency acceptable within good manufacturing practice under SS 101.9(g)(6). In addition, the scientific data or other information should include the reason why you are unable to determine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in a serving of the finished product and a description of the process that you used to come to that conclusion.\n\nIngredients made primarily from sugar and created through non-enzymatic browning are added to some products for coloring and flavoring purposes (e.g. caramel color). After non-enzymatic browning occurs, the sugar is reduced in the ingredient. In such a case, how much sugar must be declared as added sugars on the label? If the remaining amount of the sugar contributed by an ingredient that undergoes non-enzymatic browning is detectable by testing in the finished product, you may declare that amount of sugar that is detectible by analytical testing in the finished product as the added sugars declaration. When such an ingredient is added to a product that contains other sugars that do not meet the definition of added sugars, you must make and keep records, which should include records of the results of the analytical testing that is used to demonstrate the amount of added sugars contributed by the ingredient in the finished product after non-enzymatic browning occurs, and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(v)(A)).\n\n20. If sugar is added for fermentation during the leavening process of a baked good and some of the sugars are consumed by yeast, should the reduction in the amount of sugars be accounted for the declaration of added sugars?\n\nAs described in our response to question 19, you may declare the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation. If you do so, you must make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information relied upon by the manufacturer that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(v)(A)).\n21. There is a chance that added sugars content prior to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation may be higher than the total sugars content of the finished food determined through chemical analysis. How do I approximate the added sugars value in this case?\n\nThe added sugars declaration should not exceed the total sugars declaration. In a case where sugars added prior to or during processing are reduced through non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation, and the manufacturer chooses to declare the amount of sugars added prior to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation, the added sugars declaration could conceivably exceed the amount of total sugars determined through chemical analysis. In such a case, you should declare the same amount for added sugars as the amount of total sugars obtained through analytical testing for a serving of the food.\n\nV Question and Answer on Format Issues\n\n1. What are the specifications for thickness of lines and leading (i.e., space between lines) on the Nutrition Facts label?\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(ii)(C) and (d)(1)(v) establish certain format requirements with respect to leading and the use of hairline rules.\n\nAdditionally, Appendix B to Part 101 in Title 21 provides examples of graphic enhancements (i.e., illustrations) that FDA uses. For more examples of graphic enhancements that FDA uses, please see our webpage at: https://www.fda.gov/media/99151/download.\n\nQuestion and Answer on the Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals\n\n1. What are the requirements (e.g. for rounding) for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals declared on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels? What does ""levels of significance"" mean in this context?\n\nWe require, under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii), that the quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals, excluding sodium, be the amount of the vitamin or mineral included in a serving of the product using the units of measurement and the levels of significance given in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) (which refers to the Reference Daily Intakes (RDI) table). However, zeros following decimal points may be dropped, and additional levels of significance may be used when the number of decimal places indicated is not sufficient to express lower amounts (e.g., the RDI for zinc is given in whole milligrams, but the quantitative amount may be declared in tenths of a milligram). This is consistent with the requirements for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the Supplement Facts label (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B)).\n\nIn addition, regarding conventional foods, quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals present at less than 2 percent of the RDI are not required to be declared on the Nutrition Facts label. However, they may be declared by a zero or by the use of an asterisk (or other symbol) that refers to another asterisk (or symbol) that is placed at the bottom of the table that is followed by the statement ""Contains less than 2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients)"" or ""Contains (<)2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients)."" Alternatively, if vitamin D, calcium, iron or potassium is present in amounts less than 2 percent of the RDI, label declaration of the nutrient(s) is not required if the statement ""Not a significant source of _(listing the vitamins or minerals omitted)"" is placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii)).\n\nRegarding dietary supplements, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium must be declared when they are present in a dietary supplement in quantitative amounts by weight that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling of foods in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c). (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAs for the phrase ""levels of significance,"" as used in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii) and 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and whether the phrase refers to statistical testing of hypotheses or mathematical concepts related to the degree of accuracy starting with the first nonzero digit, the phrase ""levels of significance"" refers to the degree of accuracy when rounding nutrients for purposes of declaring quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the label.\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c), provide specific rounding requirements for nutrients such as sodium. Before we issued the Nutrition Facts label final rule, sodium and potassium content was to be expressed as zero when the serving contained less than 5 milligrams (mg), to the nearest 5 mg increment when the serving contained less than or equal to 140 mg, and to the nearest 10 mg increment when the serving contained more than 140 mg.

Each class or subclass of food is to be given a common or usual name that states, in clear terms, what it is in a way that distinguishes it from different foods. The common or usual name, which may be a coined term, must accurately describe, in as simple and direct terms as possible, the basic nature of the food or its characterizing properties or ingredients; must be uniform among all identical or similar products; and may not be ""confusingly similar to the name of any other food that is not reasonably encompassed within the same name"" (21 CFR 102.5(a)).\n\nSugar cane products exist in many different forms, ranging from raw sugars and syrups to refined sugar and molasses. These products are differentiated by their moisture, molasses, and sucrose content as well as by crystal size and any special treatments (e.g., treatment with sulfur).2 Sugar cane products with common or usual names established by regulation are sugar (21 CFR 101.4(b)(20)) and cane sirup (alternatively spelled ""syrup"") (21 CFR 168.130). Several other sugar cane products have common or usual names established by common usage (e.g., molasses, brown sugar, turbinado sugar, muscovado sugar, and demerara sugar). For purposes of ingredient labeling, ""sugar"" is defined to mean sucrose obtained from sugar cane or sugar beets in accordance with 21 CFR 184.1854, the regulation affirming that sucrose is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in food when used under specified conditions. The GRAS regulation describes sucrose as the substance ""obtained by crystallization from sugar cane or sugar beet juice that has been extracted by pressing or diffusion, then clarified and evaporated"" (21 CFR 184.1854(a)). To be GRAS for use in food, sucrose must be of a purity suitable for its intended use (21 CFR 184.1854(b)).\n\nFootnote 2: Honig, P. Principles of Sugar Technology. Elsevier Publishing Company. 1953.\n\nOn October 7, 2009, FDA published a draft guidance entitled ""Guidance for Industry:\n\nIngredients Declared as Evaporated Cane Juice"" in the Federal Register (74 FR 51610) to advise industry of FDA\'s view that the common or usual name for the solid or dried form of sugar cane syrup is ""dried cane syrup,"" and that sweeteners derived from sugar cane syrup should not be declared on food labels as ""evaporated cane juice"" because that term falsely suggests the sweeteners are juice. On March 5, 2014, we reopened the comment period (79 FR 12507) for the draft guidance seeking further comments, data, and information about how the ingredient sometimes declared as ""evaporated cane juice"" is produced, what its basic nature and characterizing properties are, and how it compares with other sweeteners made from sugar cane. We received numerous comments on the draft guidance. The majority of comments objected to the term ""dried cane syrup."" Several comments from sugar producers asserted that this term does not accurately describe the ingredient they produce, mostly because the standardized food ""cane syrup"" is not the starting material or an intermediate step for the ingredient they refer to as ""evaporated cane juice."" Based on comments stating that the ingredient sometimes declared as evaporated cane juice is not made from cane syrup as defined in 21 CFR 168.130, FDA is no longer recommending that this ingredient be labeled as ""dried cane syrup.""\n\nMany comments described the process used to manufacture the ingredient described as ""evaporated cane juice,"" and some comments also described the manufacturing process for other products derived from sugar cane. The initial processing steps are generally the same for all products produced from sugar cane. After sugar cane is harvested, it is cut or shredded and then crushed to extract the fluid. The extracted fluid is clarified and then evaporated to concentrate the solids. To make the product ""evaporated cane juice,"" the concentrated cane extract is filtered and undergoes a single crystallization process. The crystals are then separated from the molasses using centrifugation. From the comments, the method of filtering the ""evaporated cane juice""\n\nfluid varies from producer to producer, as does the method used for single crystallization.\n\nMost other common types of cane sugar (e.g., white sugar, brown sugar) are not filtered prior to the first crystallization. After the crystals are separated from the molasses using centrifugation, as part of the refining process, the sugar is melted and re-crystallized. Most cane-based sweeteners, including white sugar, undergo multiple crystallization steps.\n\nSome comments stated that ""evaporated cane juice"" has essentially the same composition as white sugar and other sweeteners derived from sugar cane. As support for this point, one comment provided a specification sheet for ""evaporated cane juice"" indicating that the ingredient contains between 99.0 and 99.8% sucrose. The comment also included a specification sheet for another product identified as ""certified organic sugar"" and pointed out that the composition of the two products was identical except that the organic ingredient was made with organic sugar cane. Other comments focused on the differences between ""evaporated cane juice"" and other cane-based sweeteners. For example, some of these comments stated that ""evaporated cane juice"" has a different composition from white sugar because it retains traces of molasses and minerals. A few comments said that ""evaporated cane juice"" is different than other less refined, ""alternative"" sugars because it contains less molasses and can be substituted for white sugar in processed foods without affecting the taste or appearance of the finished product.\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nThis guidance is intended to help consumers make informed choices among sweeteners by promoting accurate and consistent labeling. To that end, we are advising the regulated industry of our view that the term ""evaporated cane juice"" is not the common or usual name of any type of sweetener and that this ingredient should instead be declared on food labels as ""sugar,"" preceded by one or more truthful, non-misleading descriptors if the manufacturer so chooses (e.g., ""cane sugar"").\n\nIn developing this guidance, FDA reviewed the Codex Alimentarius Commission\'s (Codex\'s) Standard for Sugars, Codex Stan. 212-1999 (Ref. 4), which provides standards for certain sugars intended for human consumption without further processing, to determine whether Codex had established a standard for a product similar to that described on some U.S. food labels as ""evaporated cane juice."" The Codex Standard for Sugars contains no product identified as ""evaporated cane juice."" However, the Codex standard does define ""raw cane sugar""3 as ""[p]artially purified sucrose, which is crystallised from partially purified cane juice, without further purification, but which does not preclude centrifugation or drying, and which is characterised by sucrose crystals covered with a film of cane molasses."" This standard appears to describe the same sweetener referred to in many of the comments as ""evaporated cane juice."" We agree that the common or usual name used to describe this ingredient on food labels should include the term ""sugar"" because that term describes the basic nature and characterizing properties of the food.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Ingredients Declared as Evaporated Cane Juice']","['Concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes, and some fruit and vegetable powders are essentially whole fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the physical form of the fruit or vegetable and to remove moisture.

It is not the purpose of the thorough QT study to assess the risk of torsade de pointes (TdP) in the target population, but rather to determine whether further data are warranted to assess risk. A finding of QT prolongation above the regulatory threshold of interest (a positive thorough QT study) might call for further electrocardiographic follow-up in late phase studies. The extent of the follow-up would be affected by the magnitude of the estimated prolongation at doses and concentrations at which this occurs. If prolongation is substantial at concentrations expected to occur in clinical studies, it is important to protect patients in later trials and to obtain further information on the frequency of marked QT prolongation.

These could be modified by other factors such as A through F above.\n\n4.2.3 Examples of ECG monitoring in late stage:\n\nThe thorough QT study results in a negative finding, as defined by the E14 criteria,2 at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose (relative to phase 3 dose) shows mean QTc effects between 10 and 20 ms. If there is reasonable assurance that the higher dose represents drug exposures that are unlikely to be seen in the patient population, only routine ECG monitoring is recommended in late phase trials. This approach provides reassurance for safety because patients are unlikely to experience a clinically significant QTc effect.\n\nThe thorough QT study results in a positive finding, as defined by the E14 criteria,3 at the therapeutic dose, with a mean prolongation (<20) ms. For drugs with this magnitude of effect on the QTc interval, intensive monitoring of phase 3 patients is called for. Footnote 2: A negative study, as defined by the ICH E14 criteria, is an upper one-sided 95% CI of QTc prolongation effect (<10) ms.\n\nIntensive ECG monitoring in clinical trials has two main objectives.

A second objective is identifying the frequency of marked QT increases (e.g., prolonged QT (>500) ms or increases in QTc (>60) ms).\n\nGiven the limitations of collecting ECGs in late stage trials, the focus of the analysis is on outliers, not on central tendency. Other than descriptive statistics, detailed statistical analysis is not expected. This monitoring is intended to be performed locally, without the involvement of a central core laboratory.\n\nThe timing of ECG collection should be based on the known properties of the drug.

The thorough QT study results in a negative finding, as defined by the E14 criteria,4 at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms. If supratherapeutic exposure is anticipated at the clinical dose only in a well-characterized subgroup, intensive monitoring as described in Example 2 above could becarried out in this subset of the phase 3 population. In this case, there should be reasonable assurance that the higher exposure is unlikely to be seen in the general patient population. In contrast, if people in the general patient population (who cannot be readily identified in advance) will in some cases achieve this higher exposure, intensive ECG monitoring in the phase 3 population is expected, as in Example 2.\n4. The therapeutic dose results in a mean QTc prolongation of (>20) ms. For drugs with large QTc prolongation effects, intensive ECG assessment would be appropriate in all patients in phase 2/3. Because of the risk of TdP, another important use of ECG monitoring in late phase trials would be to assess any risk mitigation strategies (e.g., electrolyte monitoring, dose reduction strategies).

While increases in QT/QTc to >500 ms or of >60 ms over baseline are commonly used as thresholds forpotential discontinuation, the exact criteria chosen for a given trial will depend on the risk-tolerance level considered appropriate for the indication and patient group in question.\n\nThe Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nThe 'thorough QT/QTc study' is intended to determine whether the drug has a threshold pharmacologic effect on cardiac repolarization, as detected by QT/QTc prolongation. The threshold level of regulatory concern, discussed further below, is around 5 ms as evidenced by an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval around the mean effect on QTc of 10 ms. The study is typically carried out in healthy volunteers (as opposed to individuals at increased risk of arrhythmias) and is used to determine whether or not the effect of a drug on the QT/QTc interval in target patient populations should be studied intensively during later stages of drug development. It is not intended to identify drugs as being pro-arrhythmic. Although data are limited, it is not expected that the results of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' would be affected by ethnic factors.\n\nThe 'thorough QT/QTc study' would typically be conducted early in clinical development to provide maximum guidance for later trials, although the precise timing will depend on the specifics of the drug under development. It would usually not be the first study, as it is important to have basic clinical data for its design and conduct, including tolerability and pharmacokinetics. Some drugs might not be suitable for study in healthy volunteers because of issues related to tolerability (e.g., neuroleptic agents, chemotherapeutics).\n\nThe results of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' will influence the amount of information collected in later stages of development:\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline""

Examples include evaluating the relationship between concentration and QT/QTc effects or more intensively evaluating ECGs, based on data collected during early phase clinical studies.\n\nClinical Trial Evaluation After the 'Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nIf the 'thorough QT/QTc study' is negative (see section 2.2), the collection of baseline and periodic on-therapy ECGs in accordance with the current investigational practices in each therapeutic field is almost always sufficient evaluation during subsequent stages of drug development.\n\nIf the 'thorough QT/QTc study' is positive, additional evaluation in subsequent clinical studies should be performed. One objective of this evaluation should be to fully describe the effect of the drug on the QT/QTc interval in the target patient population with particular attention to dose- and concentration-related effects. It is important to include patients in these analyses exposed to the full range of potential doses and patients with additional risk factors for TdP. These analyses would ordinarily focus on outliers as well as on changes in mean QT/QTc. Depending on the size of the effect seen in the 'thorough QT/QTc study', more intense monitoring of patients with additional risk factors for TdP might be needed.\n\nWhile what constitutes adequate ECG assessment to accomplish this is not fully established, additional ECGs collected appropriately in substantial numbers of patients in late phase clinical trials could provide this information. In this case, it would be important to collect ECGs at the anticipated time of peak drug effects, as determined in the 'thorough QT/QTc study' and pharmacokinetic information about the patient population.\n\nAnother objective of this evaluation should be to collect information on the adverse events that occur in the trials following the positive 'thorough QT/QTc study'. This would include patients who develop marked QT/QTc prolongation (e.g., >500 ms) or experience a serious cardiovascular adverse event that suggests an arrhythmia (e.g., TdP). Such patients should be evaluated closely for risk factors that might have contributed to this event (e.g., genotyping for Long QT Syndromes, see section 4.3).\n\nIf the 'thorough QT/QTc study' is positive, analyses of the ECG and adverse event data from certain patient sub-groups are of particular interest, such as:\n\nPatients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia);\n\nPatients with congestive heart failure;\n\nPatients with impaired drug metabolizing capacity or clearance (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment, drug interactions);\n\nFemale patients;\n\nPatients aged <16 and over 65 years.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline""

For drugs with short half-lives and no metabolites, a single dose study might be sufficient. Studies should characterize the effect of a drug on the QT/QTc throughout the dosing interval. While the peak serum concentration does not always correspond to the peak effect on QT/QTc interval, care should be taken to perform ECG recordings at time points around the Cmax. As one intent of a positive control is to establish assay sensitivity, in multiple dose studies of new drugs a positive control needs to be used only long enough to have its expected effect.\n\n2.2.4 Interpretation of the 'Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nIt is difficult to determine whether there is an effect on the mean QT/QTc interval that is so small as to be of no consequence. However, drugs that prolong the mean QT/QTc interval by around 5 ms or less do not appear to cause TdP. On that basis, the positive control (whether pharmacological or non-pharmacogical) should be well-characterized and consistently produce an effect on the QT/QTc interval that is around the threshold of regulatory concern (5 ms, section 2.2).\n\nBased on similar considerations, a negative 'thorough QT/QTc study' is one in which the upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval for the largest time-matched mean effect of the drug on the QTc interval excludes 10 ms. This definition is chosen to provide reasonable assurance that the mean effect of the study drug on the QT/QTc interval is not greater than around 5 ms. When the largest time-matched difference exceeds the threshold, the study is termed 'positive'. A positive study influences the evaluations carried out during later stages of drug development, but does not imply that the drug is pro-arrhythmic.\n\nAs with other data, the presence of outliers (see section 3.2.2) should also be explored.\n\n2.2.5 Alternative Strategies to Assess QT/QTc Interval Effects\n\nAlternatives to the use of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' are under active investigation. Examples include evaluating the relationship between concentration and QT/QTc effects or more intensively evaluating ECGs, based on data collected during early phase clinical studies.\n\nClinical Trial Evaluation After the 'Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nIf the 'thorough QT/QTc study' is negative (see section 2.2), the collection of baseline and periodic on-therapy ECGs in accordance with the current investigational practices in each therapeutic field is almost always sufficient evaluation during subsequent stages of drug development.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline""

If this discrepancy cannot be explained by other data, and the drug is in a class of pharmacological concern, expanded ECG safety evaluation during later stages of drug development might be appropriate (section 2.3).\n\n2.2.1 Design of the Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nThe 'thorough QT/QTc study' should be adequate and well-controlled, with mechanisms to deal with potential bias, including use of randomization, appropriate blinding, and concurrent placebo control group. As this study has a critical role in determining the intensity of ECG data collection during later stages of drug development, it is important to have a high degree of confidence in the ability of the study to detect differences of clinical significance. The confidence in the ability of the study to detect QT/QTc prolongation can be greatly enhanced by the use of a concurrent positive control group (pharmacological or non-pharmacological) to establish assay sensitivity. The positive control should have an effect on the mean QT/QTc interval of about 5 ms (i.e., an effect that is close to the QT/QTc effect that represents the threshold of regulatory concern, around 5 ms). Detecting the positive control's effect will establish the ability of the study to detect such an effect of the study drug. Absence of a positive control should be justified and alternative methods to establish assay sensitivity provided.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline""]","['If supratherapeutic exposure is anticipated at the clinical dose only in a well-characterized subgroup, intensive monitoring as described in Example 2 above could becarried out in this subset of the phase 3 population.

This document has been endorsed by the ICH Assembly at Step 4 of the ICH process, April 2023. At Step 4 of the process, the final draft is recommended for adoption to the regulatory bodies of the ICH regions.\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction (1)2\n\nFootnote 2: The numbers in parentheses reflect the organizational breakdown of the document endorsed by the ICH Assembly at Step 4 of the ICH process, April 2023.\n\nThe synthesis of drug substances involves the use of reactive chemicals, reagents, solvents, catalysts, and other processing aids. As a result of chemical synthesis or subsequent degradation, impurities reside in all drug substances and associated drug products. Although the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidances for industry Q3A Impurities in New Drug Substances (Revision 2) (ICH Q3A) (June 2008) and Q3B(R2) Impurities in New Drug Products (ICH Q3B(R2)) (August 2006) (Reference (Ref.) 1, 2) provide guidance for qualification and control for the majority of the impurities,3 limited guidance is provided for those impurities that are DNA reactive. The purpose of this guidance is to provide a practical framework that is applicable to the identification, categorization, qualification, and control of these mutagenic impurities to limit potential carcinogenic risk. This guidance is intended to complement ICH Q3A, ICH Q3B(R2) (Note 1), and the ICH guidance for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorizations for Pharmaceuticals (January 2010) (Ref. 3).\n\nFootnote 3: We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nThis guidance emphasizes considerations of both safety and quality risk management in establishing levels of mutagenic impurities that are expected to pose negligible carcinogenic risk. It outlines recommendations for assessment and control of mutagenic impurities that reside or are reasonably expected to reside in final drug substance or product, taking into consideration the intended conditions of human use.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. Theuse of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII SCOPE OF GUIDANCE (2)\n\nThis document is intended to provide guidance for new drug substances and new drug products during their clinical development and subsequent applications for marketing. It also applies to postapproval submissions of marketed products, and to new marketing applications for products with a drug substance that is present in a previously approved product, in both cases only where:\n\nChanges to the drug substance synthesis result in new impurities or increased acceptance criteria for existing impurities\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.1)\n--------------------\nContext: The approaches outlined in this Q&A are consistent with the principles in ICH M7 concerning hazard assessment, risk characterisation of mutagenic impurities, and their control. However, ICH M7 does not provide specific guidance on how mutagenic impurity assessment can be used to justify selection of appropriate starting materials. This Q&A addresses the application of the principles in ICH M7 to the selection and justification of starting materials, based on the ICH Q11 concept of impact to the impurity profile of the drug substance.\n\nThis Q&A is not intended for the types of drug substances and indications for which ICH M7 does not apply (e.g., genotoxic drug substances, advanced cancer indications per ICH S9).\n\n[5.10] Do all steps that involve mutagenic reagents, impurities, or establish people- or stereochemical configurations, need to be included in the process description in Section 3.2.S.2.2. Similarly, the general principles do not include a reaction- or stereochemical configurations, need to be included in the process description in the process description in Section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application?\n\n[5.11] ICH Q11 states that ""enough of the drug substance 3.2.S.2.2 of the application, the following considerations should be applied.\n\n[5.12] The applicant should first evaluate which chemical transformation steps in the manufacturing process should be described in the application....."" 3.2.S.2.2 (see Q&As 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9).\n\n[5.13] What considerations should an applicent apply in the selection of the proposed starting materials to assure that enough of the drug substance substance\n\n[5.14] The applicant should first evaluate which chemical transformation steps in the manufacturing process should be described in the application....."" 3.2.S.2.2 (see Q&As 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9).\n\n[5.15] Next, the applicant should examine the steps immediately upstream of those steps that impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. These steps should normally also be included in Section 3.2.S.2.2 if:\n\n[5.16] They need to be carefully controlled (e.g., within narrow parameter ranges) to prevent generation of impurities that would otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance.\n\n[5.17] They include a unit operation that has been added to the manufacturing process to control specific impurities that would otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. While starting material manufacturing processes typically contain purification operations, addition of purification steps prior to a proposed starting material in order to avoid defining an earlier, upstream compound as the starting material would not be considered appropriate.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11_Q&As_Q&As'

Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nNo. The terms mutagenic potential and genotoxic potential are not interchangeable. Mutagenic potential refers to the ability of a compound to induce point mutations (i.e., bacterial reverse mutation assay), and genotoxic potential refers to mutagenic, clastogenic, or aneugenic potential. ICH M7(R2) focuses specifically on mutagenicity.\n\nQ2. What are the expectations for evaluation of the mutagenic potential for an impurity where the amount of impurity is less than or equal to 1 milligram (mg) daily dose? (1.2)\n\nIn the context of ICH M7(R2), (quantitative) structure-activity relationships ((Q)SARs) are considered an appropriate initial evaluation of mutagenic potential of an impurity at a daily dose of less than or equal to 1 mg. When a structural alert is identified, a follow-up in vitro evaluation (e.g., bacterial reverse mutation assay) could be conducted, or the impurity could be controlled by threshold of toxicological concern (TTC). Negative results in either evaluation would classify the impurity under Class 5. The result of the bacterial reverse mutation assay overrules the (Q)SAR prediction.\n\nAdditionally, impurities should not be assigned to Class 5 based solely on the absence of structural alerts by visual evaluation alone. There is an expectation that structural alert assessment will be conducted using (Q)SAR prediction.\n\nQ3. What are the expectations for evaluation of the genotoxic potential for an impurity where the amount of impurity exceeds 1 mg daily dose? (1.3)\n\nIn the context of Note 1 of ICH M7(R2), 1 mg refers to an absolute amount of an impurity, irrespective of the identification or qualification thresholds outlined in ICH Q3A and Q3B(R2).\n\nIn cases where the amount of impurity is less than 1 mg daily dose for chronic administration, and an impurity generated negative predictions in two appropriate (Q)SAR systems, a minimum screen of genotoxicity studies (point mutation and chromosomal aberration) could be considered.\n\nQ4.: If an impurity generates negative predictions in two appropriate (Q)SAR systems and is present at a level less than or equal to 1 mg daily dose, is further genetic toxicity testing warranted? (1.4)\n\nNo. If an impurity generates negative predictions in two appropriate (Q)SAR systems and is present at a level less than or equal to 1 mg/day, further genetic toxicity testing is not warranted.\n\nII SCOPE OF GUIDANCE (2)\n\nQ5.: Are semisynthetic drug substances and drug products included in the scope of ICH M7(R2)?

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.1)\n--------------------\nContext: For mutagenic impurities introduced or generated in the last synthetic step, given the proximity to the final product, Option 1 control approach is preferred. However, Option 2 and Option 3 control approaches may be possible when appropriately justified. The control strategy may be influenced by the presence of a subsequent recrystallization step, a highly effective purification operation (e.g., chromatography, well-defined crystallization), the reactivity (e.g., highly reactive reagents such as thionyl chloride) and physical characteristics of the impurity (e.g., low boiling point such as methyl chloride), and the availability of data (analytical data supporting the purge assessment). In most cases, for mutagenic impurities introduced or generated in the last synthetic step, the justification of an Option 4 control approach solely based on prediction is not sufficient and supporting analytical data should be provided (see Question Q19 (8.1)).\n\nIs periodic verification testing (i.e., skip testing) allowed for Option 2 and Option 3 control approaches? (8.4)\n\nNo. Periodic verification testing is not appropriate for Option 2 and Option 3 control approaches. In ICH M7(R2) section VIII.A (8.1), periodic verification testing is only discussed as a control strategy when using Option 1 control approach.\n\nThe Option 1 periodic verification testing strategy references the ICH guidance for industry Q6A Specifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Chemical Substances (ICH Q6A) (December 2000). The Option 1 periodic verification testing concept (per ICH Q6A) should generally be implemented after approval and applies to testing in the final drug substance.\n\nIf batch analysis data on the drug substance for a mutagenic impurity is consistently less than 30 percent TTC or AI in multiple batches, is that sufficient to justify no specification of that impurity in the control strategy? (8.5)\n\nNo. Batch data alone demonstrating that a mutagenic impurity is consistently less than 30 percent TTC or AI is not sufficient to apply an Option 4 control strategy.\n\nHowever, if there is negligible risk of the impurity to be present in the drug substance, an Option 4 control strategy may be considered with appropriate justification. See Questions Q19 and Q20 (8.1 and 8.2) for recommendations on supporting an Option 4 control strategy.\n\nWhat scale considerations are relevant when generating analytical data in support of control Options 3 and 4? (8.6)\n\nLab scale experiments are typically sufficient when generating measured purge factors or when defining in-process control points. These studies should employ conditions representative of the final process as described in the application and should consider the potential impact of scale and equipment-related differences between the laboratory and production environment (e.g., the effects of mixing on impurity levels in heterogeneous systems, the quality of liquid-liquid phase separations). In the case of observed scale dependencies, confirmatory testing on batches manufactured at pilot or commercial scale may be advisable. There is no expectation to perform spiking studies at pilot or commercial scale.\n\nIX Documentation (9)\n\nIf (Q)SAR predictions are made during drug development, should they be repeated for the marketing application? (9.1)*\n\n(Q)SAR models developed for use under ICH M7(R2) are generally updated regularly with new bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay data and more refined structural alerts. A Sponsor is not expected to update its (Q)SAR assessment during drug development unless there is a safety concern such as when newly available bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay data and/or mechanistic knowledge suggest that the prediction is incorrect. As an example, in cases where there is reason to question the outcome of a negative prediction (e.g., an aromatic amine is present, but the model gave a negative prediction), a reassessment is recommended. It is recommended that the sponsor rerun (Q)SAR predictions before the initial marketing application to ensure predictions reflect the most current data available. If the marketing application is later submitted in other regulatory jurisdictions, reassessment may be considered. Reassessment may also be considered if the predictions made for the initial global marketing application did not use a recent version of the software.\n\nIn general, predictions generated with models developed before ICH M7's publication in 2014 are considered unacceptable.\n\nFor marketing applications, what content and common technical document (CTD) placement recommendations could improve the clarity of an ICH M7(R2) risk assessment and control strategy? (9.2)*\n\nIn Module 2, a brief summary of the ICH M7(R2) risk assessment and control strategy should be included (sections 2.3 and 2.6).\n\nIn Module 3, the ICH M7(R2) risk assessment and control strategy should be provided in detail. This type of information is recommended to be placed in the CTD locations per the ICH guidances for industry M4Q: The CTD -- Quality (August 2001) and related M4: The CTD -- Quality: Questions and Answers/Location Issues (June 2004)(e.g., 3.2.S.3.2 Impurities or 3.2.S.4.5 Justification of Specification for drug substance; 3.2.P.5.5 Characterization of Impurities or 3.2.P.5.6 Justification of Specification for drug product). A table summary of the ICH M7(R2) hazard assessment and ICH M7(R2) impurity control strategy is recommended to improve clarity.\n\nInformation recommended for an ICH M7(R2) hazard assessment table includes impurity chemical structure, individual (Q)SAR results (positive/negative predictions, out of domain), bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay results (positive/negative, if available),ICH M7(R2) impurity class (1 to 5) assignment, and supporting information (e.g., information/links for bacterial reverse mutagenicity assays, literature reports, (Q)SAR expert analysis). The in silico systems used (name, version, endpoint) can also be noted.\n\nInformation recommended for an ICH M7(R2) impurity control strategy table includes impurity origin (e.g., synthetic step introduced, degradant), ICH M7(R2) class, purge factors (e.g., measured or predicted), ICH M7(R2) control option (1 to 4), control strategy (i.e., including in-process or compound testing rationale), and supporting information (e.g., information/links for justifications, calculations). The maximum daily dose, TTC, and proposed duration of treatment can also be noted.\n\nAdditionally, it is recommended that compound code names be cross-referenced, if Module 3 and Module 4 (including toxicity study reports) use different compound naming conventions.\n\nIn Module 4, full safety study-related information on impurities (e.g., bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay reports, (Q)SAR reports, other genotoxicity test reports, additional testing) should be included to support the risk assessment and control strategy. This information is often placed in section 4.2.3.7.6 Impurities (see the ICH guidance for industry M4S: The CTD -- Safety(August 2001) for additional information) and can be cross-referenced to Module 3 by hyperlinks.\n\nX Illustrative Examples (10)\n\nNo Q&A drafted on this section.\n\nXI Glossary (11)\n\nNo Q&A drafted on this section.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]\n\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidance Documents\n\nOECD Validation, 2007, Test No. 69: Guidance Document on the Validation of (Quantitative) Structure-Activity Relationship ((Q)SAR) Models (available at\n\nhttp://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf?cote=env/jm/mono(2007)2&doclang usage=en)\n\nOECD (Q)SAR Model Reporting Format (QMRF), 2017, Joint Research Center QSAR Model Database: User Support and Tutorial (available at\n\nhttps://publications.irc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC107491/kina28713enn.pdf)\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk Guidance for Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.1)\n--------------------\nContext: Mutagenic substances that are impurities in commercially available chemicals or synthetic intermediates, or that are formed as the result of side reactions during the synthesis, could also be present in the drug substance at levels relevant to safety. However, such mutagenic impurities and by-products are usually present at much lower concentrations than reagents, solvents, and intermediates. Therefore, the risk that such impurities will carry over significantly into the drug substance from early reaction steps is lower than for reagents, solvents, or intermediates from the same steps. The applicant should use risk-based reasoning to determine which steps to include in the hazard assessment for this category of potential impurity, and include a discussion of the risk assessment when identifying the point in the synthesis where these impurities and by-products are included in the assessment.\n\nInformation collected during the evaluation of potential mutagenic impurities can be submitted in an application and could be valuable for multiple purposes. For example, the justification for a proposed starting material should include information demonstrating that none of the steps immediately upstream (i.e., earlier in the synthesis) of the proposed starting material impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. Also, the suitability of the proposed control strategy can be supported with information about any mutagenic impurities formed or purged in the manufacturing steps between the proposed starting material and the drug substance, or that are controlled in the specification of the proposed starting material. The ICH Q11 exception for impurities that ""persist"" is also applicable to mutagenic impurities (see Q&A 5.8). In addition, steps involving mutagenic reagents or impurities may be upstream of the starting material if they do not impact the impurity profile of the drug substance (see Q&A 5.10).\n\nThe approaches outlined in this Q&A are consistent with the principles in ICH M7 concerning hazard assessment, risk characterisation of mutagenic impurities, and their control. However, ICH M7 does not provide specific guidance on how mutagenic impurity assessment can be used to justify selection of appropriate starting materials. This Q&A addresses the application of the principles in ICH M7 to the selection and justification of starting materials, based on the ICH Q11 concept of impact to the impurity profile of the drug substance.\n\nThis Q&A is not intended for the types of drug substances and indications for which ICH M7 does not apply (e.g., genotoxic drug substances, advanced cancer indications per ICH S9).\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11_Q&As_Q&As']","['No. Carcinogens that are negative in the bacterial reverse mutation assay do not have a DNA reactive mechanism of carcinogenicity and, therefore, are not in the scope of ICH M7(R2) (e.g., acetamide, hydroxylamine).']",0.3333333333,1.0

This guidance represents the Agency’s current thinking on modified release solid oral dosage forms scale-up and postapproval changes. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirement of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.\n\nSUPAC-MR: Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms\n\nScale-Up and Postapproval Changes:\n\nChemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls;\n\nIn Vitro Dissolution Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to pharmaceutical sponsors of new drug applications (NDAs), abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), and abbreviated antibiotic drug applications (AADAs) who intend to change (1) the components or composition, (2) the site of manufacture, (3) the scale-up/scale-down of manufacture, and/or (4) the manufacturing (process and equipment) of a modified release solid oral dosage form during the postapproval period.\n\nThe guidance defines (1) levels of change, (2) recommended chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) tests for each level of change, (3) recommended in vitro dissolution tests and/or in vivo bioequivalence tests for each level of change; and (4) documentation that should support the change. This guidance specifies application information that should be provided to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) to ensure continuing product quality and performance characteristics of a modified release solid oral dose formulation for specified postapproval changes.\n\nThis guidance does not comment on or otherwise affect compliance/inspection documentation that has been defined by CDER's Office of Compliance or FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs. This guidance does not affect any postapproval changes other than the ones specified. For those changes filed in a Changes Being Effected (CBE) supplement (21 CFR 314.70(c)), the FDA may, after a review of the supplemental information, decide that the changes are not approvable. For changes not addressed in this guidance, or for multiple changes submitted at one time or over a short period of time, sponsors should contact the appropriate CDER review division or consult other CDER guidances to obtain information about tests and application documentation.\n\nFDA regulations at 21 CFR 314.70(a) provide that applicants may make changes to an approved application in accordance with a guidance, notice, or regulation published in the Federal Register that provides for a less burdensome notification of the change (for example, by notification at the time a supplement is submitted or in the next annual report). This guidance permits less burdensome notice of certain postapproval changes within the meaning of SS 314.70(a).\n\nFor postapproval changes for modified release solid oral dosage forms that affect components and composition, scale-up/scale-down, site change, and manufacturing process or equipment changes, this guidance supersedes the recommendations in section 4.G of the Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) Policy and Procedure Guide 22-90 (September 11, 1990). For all other dosage forms and changes, this guidance does not affect the recommendations in Guide 22-90.\n\nII General stability considerations\n\nThe effect SUPAC-type changes have on the stability of the drug product should be evaluated. For general guidance on conducting stability studies, applicants are referred to the FDA Guideline for Submitting Documentation for the Stability of Human Drugs and Biologics (02/87). For SUPAC submissions, the following points also should be considered:\n\nIn most cases (except those involving scale up), stability data from pilot scale batches will be acceptable to support the proposed change.\n\nWhere stability data show a trend toward potency loss or degradant increase under accelerated conditions, it is recommended that historical accelerated stability data from a representative prechange batch be submitted for comparison. It is also recommended that under these circumstances, all available long-term data on test batches from ongoing studies be provided in the supplement. Submission of historical accelerated and available long-term data would facilitate review and approval of the supplement.\n\nA commitment should be included to conduct long-term stability studies through the expiration dating period, according to the approved protocol, on the first or first three (see text for details) production batches and to report the results in the annual reports.\n\nIII Components and composition -- nonrelease controlling excipient\n\nThis section of the guidance focuses on changes in nonrelease controlling excipients in the drug product. For modified release solid oral dosage forms, consideration should be given as to whether the excipient is critical or not critical to drug release. The sponsor should provide appropriate justifications for claiming any excipient(s) as a nonrelease controlling excipient in the formulation of the modified release solid oral dosage form. The functionality of each excipient should be identified. Changes in the amount of the drug substance are not addressed by this guidance. Changes in components or composition that have the effect of adding a new excipient or deleting an excipient are defined at level 3 (defined below), except as described below in Section III.A.1.a. Waiver of bioequivalence testing for a change in composition which involves only a different color, flavor or preservative may be permissible as described in 21 CFR 320.22(d)(4).\n\nA.: Level 1 Change\n\nDefinition of Level\n\nLevel 1 changes are those that are unlikely to have any detectable impact on formulation quality and performance.\n\nExamples:\n\nDeletion or partial deletion of an ingredient intended to affect the color or flavor of the drug product; or change in the ingredient of the printing ink to another approved ingredient.\n\nChanges in nonrelease controlling excipients, expressed as percentage (w/w) of total formulation, less than or equal to the following percent ranges:\n\nFiller (\\pm)5\n\nDisintegrant (\\pm)3\n\nStarch Other (\\pm)1\n\nBinder (\\pm)0.5\n\nLubricant Ca or Mg Stearate (\\pm)0.25\n\nOther (\\pm)1\n\nGlidant\n\nTalc (\\pm)1\n\nOther (\\pm)0.1\n\nFilm Coat (\\pm)1\n\nThese percentages are based on the assumption that the drug substance in the product is formulated to 100% of label/potency. The total additive effect of all nonrelease controlling excipient changes should not be more than 5%.2 The total weight of the dosage form should still be within the original approved application range.\n\nFootnote 2: Example: In a product consisting of active ingredient A, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, and magnesium stearate, the lactose and microcrystalline cellulose should not vary by more than an absolute total of 5% (e.g., lactose increases by 2.5% and microcrystalline cellulose decreases by 2.5%) relative to the target dosage form weight if it is to stay within the level 1 range.\n\nThe components (active and excipients) in the formulation should have numerical targets that represent the nominal composition of the drug product on which any future changes in the composition of the product are to be based. Allowable changes in the composition should be based on the original approved target composition and not on previous level 1 changes in the composition. For products approved with only a range for excipients, the target value may be assumed to be the midpoint of the original approved application range.\n\nTest Documentation\n\na.

Level 2 Change\n\nDefinition of Level Changes in batch size beyond a factor of ten times the size of the pilot/biobatch where (1) the equipment used to produce the test batch(es) is of the same design and operating principles; (2) the batch(es) is manufactured in full compliance with cGMPs; and (3) the same SOPs and controls as well as the same formulation and manufacturing procedures are used on the test batch(es) and on the full-scale production batch(es).\n\nTest Documentation\n\nChemistry documentation Application/compential product release requirements.\n\nNotification of change and submission of updated batch records.\n\nStability: One batch with three months' accelerated stability data reported in Changes Being Effected supplement and long-term stability data of first production batch reported in annual report.\n\nDissolution documentation Extended release: In addition to application/compential release requirements, multipoint dissolution profiles should be obtained in three other media, for example, in water, 0.1N HCl, and USP buffer media at pH 4.5, and 6.8 for the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product). Adequate sampling should be performed, for example, at 1, 2, and 4 hours, and every two hours thereafter until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached. A surfactant may be used with appropriate justification.\n\nDelayed release: In addition to application/compential release requirements, dissolution tests should be performed in 0.1 N HCl for 2hours (acid stage) followed by testing in USP buffer media in the range of pH 4.5-7.5 (buffer stage) under standard (application/compential) test conditions and two additional agitation speeds using the application/compential test apparatus (three additional test conditions). If the application/compential test apparatus is the rotating basket method (Apparatus 1), a rotation speed of 50, 100, and 150 rpm may be used, and if the application/compential test apparatus is the rotating paddle method (Apparatus 2), a rotation speed of 50, 75, and 100 rpm may be used. Multipoint dissolution profiles should be obtained during the buffer stage of testing. Adequate sampling should be performed, for example, at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 minutes (following the time from which the dosage form is placed in the buffer) until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached. The above dissolution testing should be performed using the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product).\n\nAll modified release solid oral dosage forms: In the presence of an established in vitro/in vivo correlation (6), only application/compential dissolution testing should be performed (i.e., only in vitro release data by the correlating method should be submitted). The dissolution profiles of the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product) should be similar. The sponsor should apply appropriate statistical testing with justifications (e.g., the f({}_{2}) equation) for comparing dissolution profiles (5).

If a manufacturer wishes to use manufacturing equipment that is not identical in every respect to the original manufacturing equipment used in the approved application, appropriate validation studies should be conducted to demonstrate that the new equipment is similar to the original equipment. For modified release solid oral dosage forms, consideration should be given as to whether or not the change in manufacturing equipment is critical to drug release (critical equipment variable).\n\nA.: Level 1 Change\n\nDefinition of Level\n\nThis category consists of (1) change from nonautomated or nonmechanical equipment to automated or mechanical equipment to move ingredients and (2) change to alternative equipment of the same design and operating principles of the same or of a different capacity.\n\nTest documentation\n\na.

If a manufacturer wishes to use a manufacturing process that is not identical in every respect to the original manufacturing process used in the approved application, appropriate validation studies should be conducted to demonstrate that the new process is similar to the original process. For modified release solid oral dosage forms, consideration should be given as to whether or not the change in manufacturing process is critical to drug release (critical processing variable). For purposes of categorizing the level of changes, process change may be considered only to affect a release controlling excipient when both types of excipients (i.e., nonrelease and release controlling) are present during the unit operation undergoing a change.\n\nLevel 1 Change\n\nDefinition of Level\n\nProcess changes involving adjustment of equipment operating conditions such as mixing times and operating speeds within original approved application ranges affecting the nonrelease controlling and/or release controlling excipient(s).

 '--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , Are scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n--------------------\nContext: Q: When going from equipment of one scale to one which is 2 or 1/10 the scale, the operating parameters will always change (e.g., airflows will decrease, spray rates will decrease). It is unlikely that the parameters will have been previously validated. Therefore, it would appear that any such change will be a level 2 change. Please comment. A: If a scale-down of the production batch to 2 or 1/10 the size is needed, operating parameters that would fall within the range established for manufacture of the test batch and the first three production batches (i.e., validation batches) will be regarded as a level 1 change. If they fall outside the validation ranges the change would be permitted under SUPAC IR as a level 2 change. Regardless, SUPAC IR does not address scale-down below 100,000 units. 2. Q: Is a change in mill screen size (to improve flow during formulation) a level 1 change?A: A screen size change to an alternate screen of the same design (holes) and operating principle (sifting) but different diameters to facilitate flow of powder will be regarded as a level 1 change, provided the alternate screen has not altered the particle size distribution of the screened material. Under such conditions, the information can be filed in the annual report.3. Q: Must the equipment be moved from the old site to the new one when the manufacturing site is changed? A: A company need not move equipment for a SUPAC-IR site change. However, any equipment should be of the same design and operating principle as the old equipment, and the SOPs and formulation should be the same.\n\n3.1. In vitro dissolution\n\nQ: Can the equation for profile dissolution be used for comparing a generic product with the reference listed drug product?A: Yes. The equation can be used in this situation. However, under SUPAC-IR, dissolution testing is generally conducted on the applicant\'s product before and after a particular change is made.2. Q: For Case C testing, specific media are cited. Can other media or other pH\'s be used?A: The five media indicated for Case C dissolution testing are presented as examples only. Other media, as appropriate for a particular drug product, if properly justified, may be used. Such a situation could involve using different solution compositions to attain a certain pH, as well as some at different pH conditions.3. Q: For SUPAC-IR changes which require multi-point dissolution in several media, is this required of AA drug products? A: For AA drugs (i.e., those drugs identified in the Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations or the ""Orange Book"" as not presenting bioequivalence problems) when the original application only required multi-point single medium dissolution testing for approval, then a multi-point single medium dissolution will be satisfactory where Case C is specified in the SUPAC-IR guidance.4. Q: The inclusion of ""n"" in the f2 formula implies that the number and time of the pulls is left to the discretion of the FDA investigator. Choosing points late in the curve could insure a high f2. How will this be avoided?A: It is recommended that only one point past the plateau of the profiles be used.5. Q: Are the points for dissolution profiles listed in the document just guides, or do you expect to see those specific points? For a quickly dissolving drug, points at 10, 20, 30, and 40 may be more appropriate.A: The points listed should be considered to be examples. Others points can be used with justification. It is suggested that at least 4 points (other than zero), equally spaced, be utilized.6. Q: What options are available if f2 fails?A: If an applicant believes the profiles are similar even if dissolution profiles fail f2, the firm may present a scientific justification as to why the observed difference is not due to the proposed change, and could not have significant impact beyond what is normally seen for batches prepared without the change.7. Q: For case C testing, if all of the media are not ones typically used, must the dissolution procedure be validated using these media?A: Yes. All of the methods used should be validated.8. Q: What methods, other than Dr. Amidon\'s are acceptable?A: This is an evolving area or research. ""Extent of absorption"" may be an appropriate alternative, as indicated in the guidance. Full documentation of permeability may require special clinical testing. Physicochemical and in vitro predictors of permeability are being assessed at the FDA. Pending availability of these methods, firms may rely on literature data from pharmacokinetic/mass balance studies that suggest high extent of absorption of a drug across the gastrointestinal mucosa. Absent this information, firms should assume that a drug substance has low permeability and follow the recommendations in the SUPAC-IR guidance accordingly. 9. Q: How exactly is the industry expected to determine or know the permeability of their drug?A: One source of permeability information is the current research being conducted and sponsored by FDA. This information, for other drugs, could be experimentally determined by an applicant. Other alternative methods, related to permeability, may also be useful.10. Q: Are we allowed to monitor the metabolites and sum all the components?A: For determination of extent of absorption related to permeability, it may be appropriate to consider the sum of all components. As described in the guidance, this is ""in the absence of documented instability in the gastro-intestinal tract."" In general, it is appropriate to sum all of the components if the formation of the metabolite occurs following permeation through the gastrointestinal mucosa.11. Q: What constitutes an acceptable in vivo/in vitro correlation? Does ""verified"" mean validated? A: Verified may be thought of as synonymous with validated. The Biopharmaceutics Coordinating Committee in CDER is developing guidance that addresses the general question. Pending availability of this guidance, firms should refer to published literature for information on establishing in vitro/in vivo correlations.\n\n11 IN Vivo Bio Studies\n\nQ: If the highest strength was the biobatch strength, and waivers were used for the other strengths, does supporting documentation for SUPAC-IR changes refer to all strengths? Does the answer differ depending on whether the strengths are dose/weight proportional?A: For SUPAC-IR bioequivalence recommendations, the recommended tests apply to all strengths. Regarding bio-requirements, the supporting documentation normally is needed for all strengths. If a bioequivalence study is recommended, then the compositional proportionality of the various strengths may determine if all strengths need to be tested for bioequivalence, or if a strength can be waived. However, this is not the standard comparison that is in the SUPAC-IR Guidance.2. Q: Will many small changes prompt the Agency to require a biostudy?A: Generally, a biostudy will not be requested simply because many changes which individually would not normally require a biostudy, are performed.3. Q: For SUPAC-IR changes which require an in-vivo bioequivalence test, is this requirement also intended for AA drugs which were exempt from bioequivalence testing when originally approved?A: The Center did not intend for SUPAC-IR to impose additional bioequivalence requirements for AA drugs beyond those in an original application. (AA drugs are those identified in the Orange Book as not presenting bioequivalence problems.) Therefore, if bioequivalence testing was not required originally, it will not be required under SUPAC-IR for AA drugs.\n\nQ: Would an in vivo bioequivalence study be needed for an AAA@ or non-bioequivalence problem DESI drug even if it one would be needed according to SUPAC?\n\nA: No, since that would conflict with the agency\'s current bioequivalence policy. 5. Q: When a bio study is required under SUPAC-IR, to what product should a generic product be compared - the Reference Listed Drug or the generic product approved prior to the SUPAC change.\n\nA: An innovator product should be compared to itself. A generic should be compared to the reference listed drug for that drug product.\n\nStability/change in batch size\n\nQ: When the documentation for a change is one batch on long term stability, is there a time limit between implementation of the change and initiation of the stability study?A: No. But the stability study should start as soon as possible after the drug product is prepared in the market container.2. Q: What is the stability requirement for a level 3 change involving a product with multiple strengths packaged in bottles and blisters? SUPAC-IR states one batch. Can we bracket?A: Testing and data collection involving the use of product bracketing are not the subject of SUPAC-IR. Bracketing may be used with prior approval of the Agency. The amount of data required depends on the type of change and whether or not there is a significant body of data available. If an applicant plans to bracket, the proposed protocol should be submitted to the Agency. This plan should include a protocol for each product. It should indicate all of the approved packaging configurations, and what strengths are approved for each of these. It also should include the approved stability test protocol.3. Q: Who determines how many batches are required for stability when the documentation requests 1-3?A: The answer will be dependent on the specific drug product and the amount of data already available. The appropriate review division should be contacted for further guidance.4. Q: When accelerated stability data are required, is that comparative data?\n\nA: Yes. Historical data may be used for comparison.\n\n7 Miscellaneous Issues\n--------------------\nContext title: SUPAC-IR Questions and Answers about SUPAC-IR Guidance'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , Are scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n--------------------\nContext: GUIDANCE DOCUMENT\n\nSUPAC-IR Questions and Answers about SUPAC-IR\n\nGuidance\n\nFEBRUARY 1997\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/supac-ir-questions-and-answers-about-supac-ir-guidance)\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\n(February 18, 1997)\n\nAll NDA, ANDA, and AADA Holders\n\nDear Sponsors:\n\nOn November 30, 1995, the Scale-up and Post-Approval Changes Guidance for Immediate Release Products (SUPAC-IR) was published. Since then a number of questions have arisen in interpreting the Guidance as it applies to specific situations encountered or that could be encountered in the pharmaceutical industry. The purpose of this letter is primarily to share with you the questions that have been asked most frequently or that we consider the most significant. Also included are the Center\'s responses to these questions. The responses were developed and concurred with by the Office of New Drug Chemistry and Office of Generic Drugs, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). We believe the sharing of the information will result in furthering the use of the Guidance to increase regulatory flexibility for industry.\n\nIn addition, the Center\'s Chemistry and Manufacturing Controls Coordinating Committee (CMC CC) has met and reconsidered two SUPAC-IR issues which have been of great concern and interest to industry. The following information on stand alone packaging operation site changes and stand alone analytical site changes represents a re-assessment of how SUPAC-IR should be interpreted on these issues.\n\n7 Stand alone packaging operations site changes\n\nFor immediate release solid oral dosage forms, a stand alone packaging operations site change, utilizing container(s)/closure(s) in the approved application, may be submitted as a Changes Being Effected supplement. The facility should also have a current and satisfactory cGMP compliance profile with FDA for the type of packaging operation in question before submitting the supplement. The supplement should contain written certification from the packaging facility stating that it is in conformance with cGMP\'s. If the facility has not received a satisfactory cGMP inspection within the previous two years for the type of packaging operation involved, a prior-approval supplement with the same commitment for stability is recommended.\n\nThe supplement should also contain a commitment to place the first production batch of the product on long-term stability studies using the approved protocol in the application and to submit the resulting data in annual reports. Where the product is available in more than one strength, size, or container/closure system, one batch of each combination should be placed on long-term stability studies. Bracketing or matrixing is allowed only if it has been approved previously by FDA. Any changes to an approved stability protocol should have a supplemental approval prior to the initiation of the stability study. Batches should be tested annually as per the stability commitments in the approved application.\n\n3 Stand Alone Analytical Testing Lab Site Changes\n\nFor immediate release solid oral dosage forms, a stand alone analytical testing laboratory site change may be submitted as a Changes Being Effected supplement, if the new facility has a current and satisfactory cGMP compliance profile with FDA for the type of testing operation in question. The supplement should contain a commitment to use the same SOP\'s and test methods employed in the approved application, written certification from the testing laboratory stating that they are in conformance with cGMP\'s, and a full description of the testing to be performed by the testing lab. If the facility has not received a satisfactory GMP inspection within the previous 2 years for the type of testing involved, a prior-approval supplement is recommended.\n\nThe CMC CC and the Center intend that the SUPAC-IR Guidance will be revised to further clarify and update its recommendations and to assure good correspondence between these recommendations and those of other SUPAC documents in preparation. In the meantime, we hope these questions and answers will help clarify the application of the Guidance.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n/s /\n\nRoger L. Williams, M. D.\n\nDeputy Center Director for Pharmaceutical Science\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and ResearchEnclosure\n\nSUPAC-IR: Questions and Answers\n\n(To the extent these questions and answers provide guidance, that guidance was prepared by the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Coordinating Committee in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the Food and Drug Administration. Although this guidance does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind the FDA or the industry, it does represent the Agency\'s current thinking on questions related to the Scale-Up and Post-Approval Changes Guidance for Immediate Release Products (SUPAC-IR). An electronic version of these questions and answers are also available via Internet using the World Wide Web (WWW). To access the document on the WWW, connect to the CDER Home Page (http://wcms-prod-cntr-app2.fda.gov/sites/default/files/ucm2018538.xcsr) and go to the ""Regulatory Guidance (/guidances-drugs)"" section.)\n\nComponent and Composition Changes\n\nQ: May one color be replaced with another by placing the batch on concurrent stability and reporting it in the annual report?A: A change from one color to another should be submitted as a prior approval supplement.2. Q: Can color be changed under SUPAC-IR?A: Yes. A change in color, either in amount or from one color to another, is a level 3 component and composition change which calls for a prior approval supplement. However, if the color is merely being removed, it is a level 1 change and can be reported in the next annual report.3. Q: What is the full definition of a change in \'technical grade"" of an excipient? Does this only mean a change in excipient specifications that may impact functionality or does it include a change in supplier even if all applicable specifications remain the same? A: Technical grades of excipients differ in their specifications and intended use. Technical grades may differ in: 1) specifications and/or functionality; 2) impurities; and 3) impurity profiles. If a supplier of an excipient changes but its technical grade AND specifications remain the same, the agency should be notified in an annual report.4. Q: How does one apply SUPAC-IR to multifunctional excipients, e.g., starch?A: SUPER-IR composition changes are based on being able to define the use or action of the particular excipient in the product. This rationale should be included by the applicants as part of their original applications. Not all multifunctional excipients are listed in the guidance. However, if an excipient was utilized to provide multiple functions such as pregelatinized starch as a filler, starch as a disintegrant, starch paste as a binder, then the most conservative recommended change should be followed (e.g., for an excipient that is a filler, disintegration and binder, the recommended limit for a Level 2 change is "" 0.5 percent, see page 7, SUPAC-IR). An applicant may wish to add an explanation of how the change will affect other functions of the excipient in the product. If this information was not included in the original application, the review division should be consulted before filing such a SUPAC change, either through a CBE or annual report.\n--------------------\nContext title: SUPAC-IR Questions and Answers about SUPAC-IR Guidance'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , Are scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n--------------------\nContext: ii.1.3 Selection of Batches (2.1.3)\n\nData from formal stability studies should be provided on at least three primary batches of the drug substance. The batches should be manufactured to a minimum of pilot scale by the same synthetic route as production batches and using a method of manufacture and procedure that simulates the final process to be used for production batches. The overall quality of the batches of drug substance placed on formal stability studies should be representative of the quality of the material to be made on a production scale.\n\nOther supporting data can be provided.\n\nii.1.4 Container Closure System (2.1.4)\n\nThe stability studies should be conducted on the drug substance packaged in a container closure system that is the same as or simulates the packaging proposed for storage and distribution.\n\nii.1.5 Specification (2.1.5)\n\nSpecification, which is a list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and proposed acceptance criteria, is addressed in ICH Q6A Specifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Chemical Substances and Q6B__Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSpecifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Biotechnological/Biological Products. In addition, specification for degradation products in a drug substance is discussed in ICH Q3A Impurities in New Drug Substances.\n\nStability studies should include testing of those attributes of the drug substance that are susceptible to change during storage and are likely to influence quality, safety, and/or efficacy. The testing should cover, as appropriate, the physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological attributes. Validated stability-indicating analytical procedures should be applied. Whether and to what extent replication should be performed should depend on the results from validation studies.\n\nTesting Frequency (2.1.6)\n\nFor long-term studies, frequency of testing should be sufficient to establish the stability profile of the drug substance. For drug substances with a proposed retest period of at least 12 months, the frequency of testing at the long-term storage condition should normally be every 3 months over the first year, every 6 months over the second year, and annually thereafter through the proposed retest period.\n\nAt the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of three time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g., 0, 3, and 6 months), from a 6-month study is recommended. Where an expectation (based on development experience) exists that the results from accelerated studies are likely to approach significant change criteria, increased testing should be conducted either by adding samples at the final time point or including a fourth time point in the study design.\n\nWhen testing at the intermediate storage condition is called for as a result of significant change at the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of four time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g., 0, 6, 9, 12 months), from a 12-month study is recommended.\n\nStorage Conditions (2.1.7)\n\nIn general, a drug substance should be evaluated under storage conditions (with appropriate tolerances) that test its thermal stability and, if applicable, its sensitivity to moisture. The storage conditions and the lengths of studies chosen should be sufficient to cover storage, shipment, and subsequent use.\n\nThe long-term testing should cover a minimum of 12 months' duration on at least three primary batches at the time of submission and should be continued for a period of time sufficient to cover the proposed retest period. Additional data accumulated during the assessment period of the registration application should be submitted to the authorities if requested. Data from the accelerated storage condition and, if appropriate, from the intermediate storage condition can be used to evaluate the effect of short-term excursions outside the label storage conditions (such as might occur during shipping).\n\nLong-term, accelerated, and, where appropriate, intermediate storage conditions for drug substances are detailed in the sections below. The general case should apply if the drug substance is not specifically covered by a subsequent section. Alternative storage conditions can be used if justified.\n\nIt is up to the applicant to decide whether long-term stability studies are performed at (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/60\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) or (30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/65\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}).\n\n** If (30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/65\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) is the long-term condition, there is no intermediate condition.\n\nIf long-term studies are conducted at (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/60\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) and significant change occurs at any time during 6 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, additional testing at the intermediate storage condition should be conducted and evaluated against significant change criteria. Testing at the intermediate storage condition should include all tests, unless otherwise justified. The initial application should include a minimum of 6 months' data from a 12-month study at the intermediate storage condition.\n\nSignificant change for a drug substance is defined as failure to meet its specification.\n\nData from refrigerated storage should be assessed according to the evaluation section of this guidance, except where explicitly noted below.\n\nIf significant change occurs between 3 and 6 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, the proposed retest period should be based on the real time data available at the long-term storage condition.\n\nIf significant change occurs within the first 3 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, a discussion should be provided to address the effect of short-term excursions outside the label storage condition (e.g., during shipping or handling). This discussion can be supported, if appropriate, by further testing on a single batch of the drug substance for a period shorter than 3 months but with more frequent testing than usual. It is considered unnecessary to continue to test a drug substance through 6 months when a significant change has occurred within the first 3 months.\n\nFor drug substances intended for storage in a freezer, the retest period should be based on the real time data obtained at the long-term storage condition. In the absence of an accelerated storage condition for drug substances intended to be stored in a freezer, testing on a single batch at an elevated temperature (e.g., (5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 3^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) or (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})) for an appropriate time period should be conducted to address the effect of short-term excursions outside the proposed label storage condition (e.g., during shipping or handling).\n\nDrug substances intended for storage below -20({}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) (2.1.7.4)\n\nDrug substances intended for storage below -20({}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) should be treated on a case-by-case basis.\n\n8 Stability Commitment (2.1.8)\n\nWhen available long-term stability data on primary batches do not cover the proposed retest period granted at the time of approval, a commitment should be made to continue the stability studies postapproval to firmly establish the retest period.\n\nWhere the submission includes long-term stability data on three production batches covering the proposed retest period, a postapproval commitment is considered unnecessary. Otherwise, one of the following commitments should be made:\n\nIf the submission includes data from stability studies on at least three production batches, a commitment should be made to continue these studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nIf the submission includes data from stability studies on fewer than three production batches, a commitment should be made to continue these studies through the proposed retest period and to place additional production batches, to a total of at least three, on long-term stability studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nIf the submission does not include stability data on production batches, a commitment should be made to place the first three production batches on long-term stability studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nThe stability protocol used for long-term studies for the stability commitment should be the same as that for the primary batches, unless otherwise scientifically justified.\n\n9.1.9 Evaluation (2.1.9)\n\nThe purpose of the stability study is to establish, based on testing a minimum of three batches of the drug substance and evaluating the stability information (including, as appropriate, results of the physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological tests), a retest period applicable to all future batches of the drug substance manufactured under similar circumstances. The degree of variability of individual batches affects the confidence that a future production batch will remain within specification throughout the assigned retest period.\n\nThe data may show so little degradation and so little variability that it is apparent from looking at the data that the requested retest period will be granted. Under these circumstances, it is normally unnecessary to go through the formal statistical analysis; providing a justification for the omission should be sufficient.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1A(R2) Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , Are scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n--------------------\nContext: Q: What is the reference source for defining the action of an inactive ingredient, for example, lubricant versus glidant? What if the action is defined differently in two sources?A: An applicant should be able to justify the choice and the basis for the selection of a particular excipient, i.e., its expected function in the drug product. It may be useful to cite a source. The action may depend on the specific product.6. Q: Does SUPAC-IR cover changes in granulating solution volume outside the range in an application?A: Changes in granulating solution volume are not covered under SUPAC-IR. Minor changes are considered as normal operating procedure and should be included in the executed batch record. However, if this represents a permanent change, such a change may be described in the annual report along with the data to justify that the formulation quality and performance (i.e., drug product is within the approved specifications) was not altered.7. Q: To what category does a change in granulation solvent in a wet granulation process belong?A: A change in granulating solvent (e.g., alcohol to water) would alter the composition of the drug product, both qualitatively and quantitatively, even though it may be removed during manufacture of the drug product. Because such a change may have significant impact on formulation quality and performance, it is a level 3 composition change that needs a prior approval supplement.8. Q: The NDA includes validated/approved ranges for excipients in the formulation. We would like to move the target formula amount of one of the fillers to the upper value in the range. Will this be a level 1 change in composition?A: All changes are predicated on the target approved in the original application or through a prior approval supplement for a formulation change. For products approved with only a range for an excipient, the target may be assumed to be the mid-point of the approved range. If the new target is within the validated range, the change will be a level 1 or 2 change depending on the specific excipient changed and the percent change (see the SUPAC-IR guidance document). The target originally approved remains the target of record; i.e., Level 1 or Level 2 component changes made under SUPAC- IR do not change the target. If the new target is not within the validated range, the proposed target will need a prior approval supplement.9. Q: When microcrystalline cellulose is increased by 5%, the tablet weight increases. Can this still be a level 1 change?A: After the SUPAC-IR change, if the new target weight is still within the range in the approved original application, it is a level 1 change. Otherwise, it is a Level 2 or 3 change, both of which are to be submitted as a prior approval supplement.10. Q: If one component in a formulation is decreased, must another be increased so that the final weight can remain the same?A: No. The amount of a single component in the formulation may be changed independent of any other changes. (See 9 above)\n\n11. Q: It is my understanding that the development report should cover ranges of processing parameters. Further, the validation report should cover the target parameters for production. If this is true, when level 1 changes are made, how can the validation cover ranges? For future validation reports, is it acceptable to vary processing parameters to prepare for future SUPAC changes?\n\nA: The validation report should cover the target production parameters; however, it is not restricted to these only. If a range is specific, it needs to be validated. This can involve manufacturing batches of product at the extremes of the desired range(s), with appropriate testing to assure that the extreme range batches continue to meet all quality attributes, including dissolution and possibly in vivo bioequivalence tests. For future validation reports, it is acceptable to vary processing parameters. However, it should be understood that the Center's chemists do not review validation data collected by applicants, post-approval, on the first three production batches, because such information is checked by the Field investigators as part of the cGMP requirements. Thus, a summary of validation data on the test (bioavailability/bioequivalence) batch(es) submitted in the original application for approval is the basis for setting acceptable ranges of processing parameters for manufacture of the IR dosage form. These data may include parameters such as mixing time, mixing speed, and blend assays. Thus, for future level 1 SUPAC-IR changes, applicants should use the approved validation ranges as described in the application.12. Q: What is the guidance to determine if a new drug falls into the category of narrow therapeutic range?\n\nA: Appendix A of the SUPAC-IR guidance lists a number of such drugs. In addition, 21 CFR 320.338 describes how to determine if a drug falls into this category.\n\nQ: Is a change in gelatin capsule size considered a SUPAC-IR component and composition change?A: Issues related to empty gelatin capsules are not covered in the SUPAC-IR guidance. Only the component categories discussed in the document are covered. Changes for other components should be submitted in accordance with the provisions of 21 CFR 314.70.14. Q: When making a component or composition change according to SUPAC-IR, and the approved application has a range and target for a specific component, does the range move when the target changes?A: No. The range remains the same even when the target changes. Such changes are predicated on the target approved in the original application or through prior approval supplement for a formulation change. Changes to the approved range should be made by prior approval supplements in accordance with the provisions of 21 CFR 314.70.15. Q: Are wetting agents covered under SUPAC-IR?A: No. Only components included in categories spelled out in the guidance qualify as SUPAC-IR changes. Thus, wetting agents are not covered.16. Q: Can inks be changed under SUPAC-IR? If so, how?A: If the new ink has been used in other approved products the change is allowed under SUPAC-IR as a level one change. Alternatively, if all of the components of the ink have been used in approved drug products, the switch also can be made under SUPAC-IR. A justification should be given; reference should be made to the approved product(s) where the ink and/or the components are already used.17. Q: Can inks be eliminated under SUPAC-IR?\n\nA: Ink can be eliminated as a level 1 change.\n\nManufacturing Site Changes\n--------------------\nContext title: SUPAC-IR Questions and Answers about SUPAC-IR Guidance""]",['No. The three ANDA submission batches should maintain the chosen formula based on product development studies for components and composition.'],0.91666666664375,0.0

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe objective of this document is to provide guidance to other Federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and to state and local governments regarding the safe and effective use of potassium iodide (KI) as an adjunct to other public health protective measures in the event that radioactive iodine is released into the environment. The adoption and implementation of these recommendations are at the discretion of the state and local governments responsible for developing regional emergency-response plans related to radiation emergencies.\n\nThis guidance updates the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 1982 recommendations for the use of KI to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer in radiation emergencies involving the release of radioactive iodine. The recommendations in this guidance address KI dosage and the projected radiation exposure at which the drug should be used.\n\nThese recommendations were prepared by the Potassium Iodide Working Group, comprising scientists from the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) in collaboration with experts in the field from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although they differ in two respects (as discussed in Section IV.2), these revised recommendations are in general accordance with those of the World Health Organization (WHO), as expressed in its Guidelines for Iodine Prophylaxis Following Nuclear Accidents: Update 1999 (WHO 1999).\n\nII Background\n\nUnder 44 CFR 351, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established roles and responsibilities for Federal agencies in assisting state and local governments in their radiological emergency planning and preparedness activities. The Federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), are to carry out these roles and responsibilities as members of the Federal Radiological Preparedness Coordinating Committee(FRPCC). Under 44 CFR 351.23(f), HHS is directed to provide guidance to state and local governments on the use of radioprotective substances and the prophylactic use of drugs (e.g., KI) to reduce the radiation dose to specific organs. This guidance includes information about dosage and projected radiation exposures at which such drugs should be used.\n\nThe FDA has provided guidance previously on the use of KI as a thyroid blocking agent. In the Federal Register of December 15, 1978, FDA announced its conclusion that KI is a safe and effective means by which to block uptake of radioiodines by the thyroid gland in a radiation emergency under certain specified conditions of use. In the Federal Register of June 29, 1982, FDA announced final recommendations on the administration of KI to the general public in a radiation emergency. Those recommendations were formulated after reviewing studies relating radiation dose to thyroid disease risk that relied on estimates of external thyroid irradiation after the nuclear detonations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki and analogous studies among children who received therapeutic radiation to the head and neck. Those recommendations concluded that at a projected dose to the thyroid gland of 25 cGy or greater from ingested or inhaled radioiodines, the risks of short-term use of small quantities of KI were outweighed by the benefits of suppressing radioiodine-induced thyroid cancer.1 The amount of KI recommended at that time was 130 mg per day for adults and children above 1 year of age and 65 mg per day for children below 1 year of age. The guidance that follows revises our 1982 recommendations on the use of KI for thyroid cancer prophylaxis based on a comprehensive review of the data relating radioioidine exposure to thyroid cancer risk accumulated in the aftermath of the 1986 Chernobyl reactor accident.\n\nFootnote 1: For the radiation emitted by ({}^{131}) I (electrons and photons), the radiation-weighting factor is equal to one, so that the absorbed dose to the thyroid gland expressed in centigrays (cGy) is numerically equal to the thyroid equivalent dose expressed in rem (1 cGy = 1 rem).\n\n3 Data Sources\n\nReliance on Data from Chernobyl\n\nIn epidemiological studies investigating the relationship between thyroidal radioiodine exposure and risk of thyroid cancer, the estimation of thyroid radiation doses is a critical and complex aspect of the analyses. Estimates of exposure, both for individuals and across populations, have been reached in different studies by the variable combination of (1) direct thyroid measurements in a segment of the exposed population; (2) measurements of ({}^{131})I (iodine isotope) concentrations in the milk consumed by different groups (e.g., communities) and of the quantity of milk consumed; (3) inference from ground deposition of long-lived radioisotopes released coincidentally and presumably in fixed ratios with radioiodines; and (4) reconstruction of the nature and extent of the actual radiation release.\n\nAll estimates of individual and population exposure contain some degree of uncertainty. The uncertainty is least for estimates of individual exposure based on direct thyroid measurements.\n\nUncertainty increases with reliance on milk consumption estimates; is still greater with estimates derived from ground deposition of long-lived radioisotopes, and is highest for estimates that rely heavily on release reconstruction.\n\nDirect measurements of thyroid radioactivity are unavailable from the Hanford, Nevada Test Site, and Marshall Islands exposures. Indeed, the estimates of thyroid radiation doses related to these releases rely heavily on release reconstructions and, in the former two cases, on recall of the extent of milk consumption 40 to 50 years after the fact. In the Marshall Islands cohort, urinary radioiodine excretion data were obtained and used in calculating exposure estimates.\n\nBecause of the great uncertainty in the dose estimates from the Hanford and Nevada Test Site exposures and due to the small numbers of thyroid cancers occurring in the populations potentially exposed, the epidemiological studies of the excess thyroid cancer risk related to these radioiodine releases are, at best, inconclusive. As explained below, the dosimetric data derived in the studies of individual and population exposures following the Chernobyl accident, although not perfect, are unquestionably superior to data from previous releases. In addition, the results of the earlier studies are inadequate to refute cogent case control study evidence from Chernobyl of a cause-effect relationship between thyroid radioiodine deposition and thyroid cancer risk.2\n\nFootnote 2: We have included in this guidance an extensive bibliography of the sources used in developing these revised recommendations.\n\nThe Chernobyl reactor accident of April 1986 provides the best-documented example of a massive radionuclide release in which large numbers of people across a broad geographical area were exposed acutely to radioiodines released into the atmosphere. Therefore, the recommendations contained in this guidance are derived from our review of the Chernobyl data as they pertain to the large number of thyroid cancers that occurred. These are the most comprehensive and reliable data available describing the relationship between thyroid radiation dose and risk for thyroid cancer following an environmental release of ({}^{131})I. In contrast, the exposures resulting from radiation releases at the Hanford Site in Washington State in the mid-1940s and in association with the nuclear detonations at the Nevada Test Site in the 1950s were extended over years, rather than days to weeks, contributing to the difficulty in estimating radioactive dose in those potentially exposed (Davis et al., 1999; Gilbert et al., 1998). The exposure of Marshall Islanders to fallout from the nuclear detonation on Bikini in 1954 involved relatively few people, and although the high rate of subsequent thyroid nodules and cancers in the exposed population was likely caused in large part by radioiodines, the Marshall Islands data provide little insight into the dose-response relationship between radioactive iodine exposure and thyroid cancer risk (Robbins and Adams 1989).\n--------------------\nContext title: Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n--------------------\nContext: The FDA recommendations for KI intervention encompass different threshold thyroid radioactive exposures for different groups within the population. Several factors were involved in this approach:\n\nDuring the Chernobyl accident, younger people exposed to radioactive iodine (especially children 0 to 4 years old) were most sensitive to its carcinogenic effects.\nIn the years following the accident, most children who subsequently developed thyroid cancer apparently received internal thyroid radioactive exposures of less than 30 cGy, and the best dose-response information supports increased risk in children receiving 5 cGy or more.\n\nAs age increases, the risk of thyroidal side effects following excess (i.e., nonradioactive) iodine ingestion increases. This is due to the increasing prevalence of underlying thyroidal illness with older age (e.g., Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, Hashimoto's thyroiditis).\n\nThyroid irradiation in older adults (e.g., over 40 years of age) is associated with an extremely low incidence of cancer. Therefore, KI is only recommended if a very large internal radioactive dose to the thyroid is projected. In such a situation, KI would be ingested to prevent destruction of the thyroid gland, which, if it occurred, would lead to lifelong dependence on thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\n\nIn short, the recommended stepped intervention approach to KI use during radiation emergencies is based on differences in overall benefit versus risk in different population groups. Specifically, the benefits from thyroid blockade with KI predominate in the young in whom the risks of thyroid cancer from radioiodine are the greatest. The risks of KI take on more prominence in older adults in whom the risks of thyroid cancer are very small.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, it is important to note that among 7 million adults who took stable iodine in Poland following Chernobyl, only two severe adverse reactions were reported, both in persons with known allergy to iodine. Based on these data, we have concluded that even if the risks associated with excess stable iodine are greater in adults than in children, the risk of serious adverse reactions overall is exceedingly small.\n\nIn summary, FDA understands that a KI administration program that sets different projected thyroid radioactive exposure thresholds for treatment of different population groups may be logistically impractical to implement during a radiological emergency. If emergency planners reach this conclusion, FDA recommends that KI be administered to both children and adults at the lowest intervention threshold (i.e., (\\geq 5) cGy projected internal thyroid exposure in children).\n\nAs a rule, however, individuals with known allergy to KI or with pre-existing thyroid disease (e.g., Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, Hashimoto's thyroiditis) that might predispose them to adverse reactions should avoid KI. Most likely these will be adults, who have little or no risk of developing thyroid cancer from radioactive exposure to the thyroid and who may, in these cases, incur substantial risks from taking KI.\n\nQ8: Does the FDA guidance apply to residents outside of the 10-mile emergency planning zone for nuclear poset plants?\n\nYes. KI administered in advance of an exposure will successfully block thyroidal uptake of radioiodine, wherever one may reside.\n--------------------\nContext title: (Potassium Iodide) KI in Radiation Emergencies-Questions and Answers""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n--------------------\nContext: For optimal protection against inhaled radioiodines, KI should be administered before or immediately coincident with passage of the radioactive cloud, though KI may still have a substantial protective effect even if taken 3 or 4 hours after exposure. Furthermore, if the release of radioiodines into the atmosphere is protracted, then, of course, even delayed administration may reap benefits by reducing, if incompletely, the total radiation dose to the thyroid.\n\nPrevention of thyroid uptake of ingested radioiodines, once the plume has passed and radiation protection measures (including KI) are in place, is best accomplished by food control measures and not by repeated administration of KI. Because of radioactive decay, grain products and canned milk or vegetables from sources affected by radioactive fallout, if stored for weeks to months after production, pose no radiation risk. Thus, late KI prophylaxis at the time of consumption is not required.\n\nAs time is of the essence in optimal prophylaxis with KI, timely administration to the public is a critical consideration in planning the emergency response to a radiation accident and requires a ready supply of KI. State and local governments choosing to incorporate KI into their emergency response plans may consider the option of predistribution of KI to those individuals who do not have a medical condition precluding its use.\n\nVI Summary\n\nFDA maintains that KI is a safe and effective means by which to prevent radioiodine uptake by the thyroid gland, under certain specified conditions of use, and thereby obviate the risk of thyroid cancer in the event of a radiation emergency. Based upon review of the literature, we have proposed lower radioactive exposure thresholds for KI prophylaxis as well as lower doses of KI for neonates, infants, and children than we recommended in 1982. As in our 1982 notice in the Federal Register, FDA continues to recommend that radiation emergency response plans include provisions, in the event of a radiation emergency, for informing the public about the magnitude of the radiation hazard, about the manner of use of KI and its potential benefits and risks, and for medical contact, reporting, and assistance systems. FDA also emphasizes that emergency response plans and any systems for ensuring availability of KI to the public should recognize the critical importance of KI administration in advance of exposure to radioiodine. As in the past, FDA continues to work in an ongoing fashion with manufacturers of KI to ensure that high-quality, safe, and effective KI products are available for purchase by consumers as well as by state and local governments wishing to establish stores for emergency distribution.\n\nKI provides protection only for the thyroid from radioiodines. It has no impact on the uptake by the body of other radioactive materials and provides no protection against external irradiation of any kind. FDA emphasizes that the use of KI should be as an adjunct to evacuation (itself not always feasible), sheltering, and control of foodstuffs.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe KI Taskforce would like to extend special thanks to our members from the NIH: Jacob Robbins, M.D., and Jan Wolff, Ph.D., M.D., of the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases and Andre Bouville, Ph.D., of the National Cancer Institute.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides answers to questions that FDA has received as state and local governments develop emergency response plans involving the use of potassium iodide (KI) to protect against the effects of radioactive iodine accidentally or intentionally released into the atmosphere. KI is recommended for use as an adjunct to other emergency measures, such as evacuation and control of the food supply to avoid ingestion of contaminated foodstuffs. When used correctly, KI can prevent or reduce the uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid gland. KI provides optimal protection when administered immediately prior to or in conjunction with passage of a radioactive cloud. The incorporation of KI into radiation emergency response plans is at the discretion of state and local governments.\n\nThis is a revision of the question and answer guidance published in April 2002. The revision incorporates two additional questions (question 4 and question 7) raised about KI intervention and makes minor editorial changes to the previous questions and answers.\n\nII Background\n\nIn a guidance entitled Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies (December 2001), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated its 1982 recommendations for the safe and effective use of KI to prevent or reduce the uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid gland. The current recommendations are based on conclusions reached after reviewing data on radioiodine exposure and thyroid cancer risk gathered after the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in 1986. The data suggest that the risk of thyroid cancer is inversely related to age. Fetuses, infants, and young children are at greatest risk and may be harmed by small amounts of radioiodine.\n\nAlthough special precautions should be taken when administering KI to pregnant women and newborns within the first month of life (adherence to the recommended dose, avoidance of repeat dosing, and monitoring of thyroid function in neonates), the benefits of short-term administration of KI as a thyroid blocking agent far exceed the risks of administration to any age group. For complete information, please refer to FDA\'s December 2001 guidance.\n\nIII Questions and Answers\n\nQ1:: Does FDA have specific recommendations about radiation emergency preparedness plans and the use of KI?\n\nNo. Decisions about the details of their preparedness plans are up to state and local authorities. FDA\'s guidance provides general recommendations about the use of KI prophylaxis in the event of a radiological emergency. These recommendations are discussed in Section V. of the guidance.\n\nQ2:: Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n\nNo. FDA has made recommendations on the lowest effective dose. Higher doses (e.g., up to 130 mg) would be equally effective and, particularly among school-age children, extremely safe (see also question 9).\n\nQ3:: If a graded dosing approach is considered, how does FDA suggest that fractional doses (i.e., 65, 32, 16 mg) be administered?\n\nKI tablets can be dissolved in liquids and the appropriate volume administered. For example, if a 130 mg tablet were dissolved in 8 ounces of liquid, one ounce would contain about 16 mg of KI. FDA has conducted studies of the palatability, solubility, and stability of KI dissolved in a number of different liquids, including juice and formula. (See the Home Preparation Procedure for Emergency Administration of Potassium Iodide Tablets to Infants and Small Children.2) Emergency planners and others should understand that absolute precision in dosing is generally not critical to safety or efficacy (see also question 4).\n\nFootnote 2: This is available at http://www.fda.gov/cder/drugprepare/default.htm.\n\nQ4.: FDA guidance recommends graded dosing by age, with neonates receiving the lowest dose (16 mg daily) and adults receiving the highest (130 mg). FDA approved KI tablets are available in two dosage strengths: 65 and 130 mg. At a minimum, dosing based on FDA guidance would require either splitting tablets or dissolving tablets in liquids. This may be impractical while responding to a radiological emergency. In this context, what is the impact of uniform dosing across all age groups eligible for KI prophylaxis?* The FDA\'s guidance on dosing KI in radiation emergencies adheres to principles of minimum effective dose and therefore recommends graded dosing according to age (and thus, in effect, body size). There is ample evidence that the recommended doses, as well as higher doses (e.g., up to 130 mg), will effectively block thyroidal uptake of radioactive iodine if taken in advance of exposure. Furthermore, particularly among school-age children, higher milligram doses are extremely safe. We also realize that a scheme of graded dosing may be difficult to implement during a radiological emergency involving large numbers of people. However, we continue to emphasize attention to KI dosing in infants. Excess iodine intake can lead to transient iodine-induced hypothyroidism. As we have said in our guidance, individuals who are intolerant of KI at protective doses, as well as neonates, pregnant, and lactating women, should be given priority with regard to other protective measures (i.e., sheltering, evacuation, and control of the food supply).\n\nIn summary, if local emergency planners conclude that graded dosing is logistically impractical, FDA believes that for populations at risk for radioiodine exposure, the overall benefits of taking up to 130 mg of KI instead of the lower doses recommended for certain age groups far exceed the small risks of overdosing. However, where feasible, adherence to FDA guidance should be attempted when dosing infants.\n\nWill dosage strengths of KI below 130 mg be available in the United States?\n\nYes. An FDA approved 65-mg KI tablet is being marketed now in the United States.\n\nAre there plans to update the labeling for marketed KI products to conform to the revised FDA recommendations on dosing?\n\nYes. FDA is working with manufacturers to amend the ""Drug Facts"" labeling for KI products, which are sold over the counter, to incorporate the new dosing recommendations.\n\nHow critical to public health is adherence to FDA\'s recommendations with regard to projected thyroid radioactive exposure thresholds for intervention by risk category? Specifically, the existence of different thresholds for neonates, children through age 18, and pregnant or lactating women ((\\geq) 5 cGy) versus adults aged 18 through 40 years ((\\geq) 10 cGy) versus adults over age 40 ((\\geq) 500 cGy) are confusing and logistically complex to follow in responding to a radiological emergency.\n\nThe FDA recommendations for KI intervention encompass different threshold thyroid radioactive exposures for different groups within the population. Several factors were involved in this approach:\n\nDuring the Chernobyl accident, younger people exposed to radioactive iodine (especially children 0 to 4 years old) were most sensitive to its carcinogenic effects.\nIn the years following the accident, most children who subsequently developed thyroid cancer apparently received internal thyroid radioactive exposures of less than 30 cGy, and the best dose-response information supports increased risk in children receiving 5 cGy or more.\n\nAs age increases, the risk of thyroidal side effects following excess (i.e., nonradioactive) iodine ingestion increases. This is due to the increasing prevalence of underlying thyroidal illness with older age (e.g., Graves\' disease, thyroid nodules, Hashimoto\'s thyroiditis).\n\nThyroid irradiation in older adults (e.g., over 40 years of age) is associated with an extremely low incidence of cancer. Therefore, KI is only recommended if a very large internal radioactive dose to the thyroid is projected. In such a situation, KI would be ingested to prevent destruction of the thyroid gland, which, if it occurred, would lead to lifelong dependence on thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\n\nIn short, the recommended stepped intervention approach to KI use during radiation emergencies is based on differences in overall benefit versus risk in different population groups. Specifically, the benefits from thyroid blockade with KI predominate in the young in whom the risks of thyroid cancer from radioiodine are the greatest. The risks of KI take on more prominence in older adults in whom the risks of thyroid cancer are very small.\n--------------------\nContext title: (Potassium Iodide) KI in Radiation Emergencies-Questions and Answers']","['No. FDA has made recommendations on the lowest effective dose.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to provide industry and agency staff with recommendations regarding the technical performance assessment data that should be provided for regulatory evaluation of a digital whole slide imaging (WSI) system. This document does not cover the clinical submission data that may be necessary to support approval or clearance. This document provides our suggestions on how to best characterize the technical aspects that are relevant to WSI performance for their intended use and determine any possible limitations that might affect their safety and effectiveness.\n\nRecent technological advances in digital microscopy, in particular the development of whole slide scanning systems, have accelerated the adoption of digital imaging in pathology, similar to the digital transformation that radiology departments have experienced over the last decade. FDA regulates WSI system manufacturers to help ensure that the images intended for clinical uses are reasonably safe and effective for such purposes. Essential to the regulation of these systems is the understanding of the technical performance of the WSI system and the components in the imaging chain, from image acquisition to image display and their effect on pathologist\'s diagnostic performance and workflow. Prior to performing non-technical analytical studies (i.e., those using clinical samples) and clinical studies to evaluate a digital imaging system\'s performance, the manufacturer should first determine the technical characteristics that are relevant to such performance for its intended use and determine any possible limitations\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:9]\n\n(\\bullet) Condenser\n\n(\\circ) Illumination format (e.g., Kohler, critical)\n\n(\\circ) Manufacturer and model\n\n(\\circ) Numerical aperture\n\n(\\circ) Focal length\n\n(\\circ) Working distance\n\n(\\bullet) Auxiliary lens(es)\n\n(\\circ) Manufacturer\n\n(\\circ) Lens type\n\n(\\circ) Focal length\n\n(\\bullet) Magnification of imaging optics: ISO 8039:2014 Optics and optical instruments\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]\n\n352IV(A)(6).

Image Composition\n\n377IV(A)(7)(a). Description\n\n378(\\bullet) Image composition is a step present in systems that produce whole slide images as\n\n380opposed to individual fields of view. Whole slide scanning is typically performed in\n\n381accordance with the positioning of a stage that moves in submicron steps. At each\n\n382location of the stage movement, an image of the field of view is acquired. Images can be\n\n383acquired with a degree of overlapping (redundancy) between them to avoid gaps in data\n\n384collection. Images can also be acquired at different depths of focus followed by the\n\n385application of focusing algorithms. At the end of this process, all acquired images are\n\n386combined (stitched) together to create a composite high resolution image. There are a\n\n387number of features that can affect this process, and they are listed below. Sponsors\n\n388should provide a description of these features, if applicable:\n\n389(\\bullet) Scanning method\n\n390(\\circ) Single objective or multiple miniature objectives in an array pattern\n\n391(\\circ) Scanning pattern: square matrix acquisition (tiling), line scanning, etc.\n\n392(\\circ) Overlap between scanned regions\n\n393(\\circ) Merging algorithms that stitch the aligned images together into a\n\n394composite image file. Such algorithms may employ functions to align\n\n395adjacent fields of view in accordance to the scanning pattern, overlap, etc.\n\n396(\\circ) Automatic background correction functions to eliminate the effect of non-uniformities in the microscope\'s illumination and image merging procedure. These non-uniformities if not corrected might create visible borders (seams and stitch lines) between the adjacent fields of view.\n\n400(\\bullet) Scanning speed: time to scan the whole slide. This time is dependent on selected magnification, and the amount of tissue on the glass slide.\n\n402(\\bullet) Number of planes at the Z-axis to be digitized (stack depth)\n\n403(\\bullet) 404(\\bullet) 405(\\bullet) Testing for image composition can be performed on a system level using special calibration slides (such as grid patterns) that can test for line uniformity and focus quality. Sponsors should provide the following outputs for these tests, if applicable:\n\n409(\\bullet) Images of digitized calibration slides\n\n410(\\bullet) Analysis of focus quality metrics\n\n411(\\bullet) Analysis of coverage of the image acquisition for the entire tissue slide\n--------------------\nContext title: Technical Performance Assessment of Digital Pathology Whole Slide Imaging Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'

It\n\ndoes not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public.\n\nYou can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes\n\nand regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for\n\nimplementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate\n\nnumber listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis document provides guidance concerning development of safety profiles to support use of\n\nnew excipients as components of drug or biological products. It is intended for use by reviewers\n\nwithin both the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics\n\nEvaluation and Research (CBER) and by interested individuals in industry. It is also intended to\n\nfoster and expedite the development of new excipients, communicate to pharmaceutical and\n\nexcipient manufacturers current CDER and CBER recommendations on the nonclinical safety\n\ndata that should be generated to support excipient development, and increase uniformity within\n\nCDER and CBER as to expectations for the nonclinical safety evaluation of excipients.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable\n\nresponsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should\n\nbe viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are\n\ncited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or\n\nrecommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nIn this guidance, the phrase new excipients means any inactive ingredients that are intentionally\n\nadded to therapeutic and diagnostic products, but that: (1) we believe are not intended to exert\n\ntherapeutic effects at the intended dosage, although they may act to improve product delivery\n\n(e.g., enhance absorption or control release of the drug substance); and (2) are not fully qualified\n\nby existing safety data with respect to the currently proposed level of exposure, duration of\n\nexposure, or route of administration. Examples of excipients include fillers, extenders, diluents,wetting agents, solvents, emulsifiers, preservatives, flavors, absorption enhancers, sustained-release matrices, and coloring agents. Within the context of this guidance, the term excipient applies to macromolecular substances such as albumin, or substances such as amino acids and sugars that are used in drug and biological products. It does not, however, apply to process or product-related impurities (e.g., degradation products, leachates, residual solvents) or extraneous contaminants.\n\nNot all excipients are inert substances; some have been shown to be potential toxicants. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (the Act) was enacted after the tragedy of the elixir of sulfanilamide in 1937 in which an untested excipient was responsible for the death of many children who consumed the pharmaceutical. The Act required manufacturers to perform safety testing of pharmaceuticals and submit new drug applications (NDAs) demonstrating safety before marketing. Since that time, the Agency has become aware that certain other excipients used in commerce can cause serious toxicities in consumers of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drug products in the United States and other countries.\n\nThis guidance describes the types of toxicity data that the Agency uses in determining whether a potential new excipient is safe for use in human pharmaceuticals. It discusses recommended safety evaluations for excipients proposed for use in OTC and generic drug products, and describes testing strategies for pharmaceuticals proposed for short-term, intermediate, and long-term use. It also describes recommended excipient toxicity testing for pulmonary, injectable, and topical pharmaceuticals.\n\nIII Submission of safety data\n\nMost, if not all, drug products could not be made without the use of excipients. Tablets, capsules, suspensions, and others all require one or more excipients in their formulations. Excipients may also have functions, for example, in sustained release preparations or in enhancing drug penetration through the skin.\n\nIt is important to perform risk-benefit assessments on proposed new excipients in drug products and to establish permissible and safe limits for these substances. This requires evaluation of a safety database. With proper planning, however, it is often possible to assess the toxicology of an excipient in a relatively efficient manner. For example, sponsors can develop new excipients concurrently with safety evaluation of new drug and biological products by adding groups of animals that receive the excipient to studies that would have been conducted anyway to develop a drug substance. The Centers recognize that existing human data for some excipients can substitute for certain nonclinical safety data, and an excipient with documented prior human exposure under circumstances relevant to the proposed use may not require evaluation in the full battery of toxicology studies outlined in this guidance. For example, the Centers will continue to consider factors such as use in previously approved products or GRAS status as a direct food additive. Under some circumstances (e.g., similar route of administration, level of exposure, patient population, and duration of exposure) experience associated with the prior use may adequately qualify an excipient. However, it may be necessary for the safety database associated with that excipient to be brought up to current standards (e.g., submission of additional genetic toxicology data). The available information that supported the prior use will be considered in light of any proposed new use by the appropriate review division. It is important to note that the inclusion of an excipient in a USP/NF monograph or other non-FDA document is not an indication that the substance has been reviewed by the FDA and found safe for use.\n\nOver-the-Counter Products\n\nFor products marketed under OTC drug monographs, 21 CFR 330.1(e) requires: ""The product contains only suitable inactive ingredients which are safe in the amounts administered and do not interfere with the effectiveness of the preparation or with suitable tests or assays to determine if the product meets its professed standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity. Color additives may be used only in accordance with section 721 of the act and subchapter A of this chapter."" It is the manufacturer\'s responsibility to comply with these requirements and to have appropriate supporting data in its files. The provisions of SS 330.1(e) do not apply to OTC products marketed under NDAs or abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs). Some excipients used in NDA-approved drug products may not be safe for use in OTC products (e.g., some toxic excipients used in cancer chemotherapeutics).\n\nGeneric Products\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonclinical Studies for the Safety Evaluation of Pharmaceutical Excipients'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n--------------------\nContext: 1 Introduction\n\nThis document discusses several nonclinical pharmacology/toxicology issues that are inherent with the development of topical drugs that are intended to prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STD) or with the development of drugs proposed to act as vaginal contraceptives. It is not meant to replace existing guidance concerning the nonclinical pharmacology/toxicology safety data required to support the submission of Investigational New Drug (IND) applications. Rather, it offers insight into some aspects of these classes of drugs that make them unique from systemically administered drugs, namely, the topical sites of their administration and action and the prophylactic nature of the indications. The publication of this document is a joint effort of three independent review divisions in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research of the FDA, and represents their best harmonized view of the issues at this time. However, all the recommendations contained herein may be subject to modification and sponsors are encouraged to discuss the content of their nonclinical submissions with the review division appropriate to each individual application\n\n2 Toxicology Studies\n\nTo support the safety of the individual phases of clinical development, studies in at least two animal species (one being a non-rodent) should be used to assess acute, subchronic and chronic toxicity at the proposed site of exposure. Potential sites of exposure to topical microbicides for the prevention of STDs include vaginal, cervical, penile, oral and rectal mucosal areas. For the purpose of this document, contraceptives are considered to expose vaginal and penile tissue. All toxicology studies should use at least three dose levels of the drug and an appropriate control, with the high dose showing frank toxicity (it is understood that there may be limits to the ability to achieve a toxic dose), and the low dose showing little or no toxicity. With the exception of the varying concentrations of the active product, the drug to be applied should be in its final formulation and the study duration should be equal to, or longer than, the proposed duration of treatment in the clinical trial. However, if in an early trial, the duration of treatment is for less than two weeks, a nonclinical study duration of two weeks should generally be used. All nonclinical studies carried out to assess safety of a drug should be performed according to Good Laboratory Practices as outlined in 21 CFR. 58. Sponsors should consult with the FDA reviewing pharmacologist concerning approaches and protocols regarding these issues.\n\nBecause the topical microbicides are intended for intermittent use during periods in which the individual will be at risk of contracting a STD and contraceptives are intended for intermittent use over long periods of reproductive competence, they are, for regulatory purposes, considered to be chronically administered drugs. Thus, in the latter stages of clinical development, six month studies in a rodent and one year toxicity studies in a non-rodent will be necessary to support phase 2/3 human trials. Carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice should be performed during the late stages of the drug development program.\n\nPharmacokine/Toxicokinetic Studies\n\nDuring the conduct of subchronic and chronic toxicity studies, concurrent pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic analyses should be performed to evaluate the drug\'s ADME (absorption, disposition, metabolism and excretion) profile and to determine if the drug is systemically absorbed. Appropriate analytical methodology should be established as early as possible to provide for precise, consistent and reliable pharmacokinetic data. Major pharmacokinetic endpoints such as maximum plasma concentration, time to maximum plasma concentration, area under the concentration time curve, volume of distribution, bioavailability and clearance should be determined. To better assess margins of safety, the animal pharmacokinetic data should be compared with data in humans. For instance, a drug might be absorbed in humans and the vaginal route of delivery in animals cannot achieve much higher systemic drug levels than those seen in humans. In that case, a one to three-month toxicology study in one species, with parenteral or oral administration of the drug, may be requested to produce sufficiently high blood levels to identify all potential toxicities. If the drug is absorbed, histopathology should be carried out on the full spectrum of organs and tissues.\n\nIrritation\n\nThe likelihood of drug-induced irritation (adverse reactions such as inflammatory responses) to drug exposed tissues should be evaluated in animals at both the macroscopic and microscopic levels. Vaginal irritation tests should be carried out in rabbits with daily applications for ten days. If rabbits are adequately tested by the vaginal route for adverse effects in toxicology studies, no separate vaginal irritation study is required.\n\nIf the drug is found to be irritating to mucosal tissues and the sponsor decides to pursue further development, additional pharmacokinetics should be carried out to compare the extent of penetration of the drug across the inflamed tissue with that occurring in intact tissue. These data will help to determine whether the absorption kinetics of the drug is facilitated when the mucosa is compromised.\n\n4 Hypersensitivity and Photosensitivity\n\nIf appropriate, the potential to produce hypersensitivity and photosensitivity of the drug should be evaluated. Examples of animal models and protocols for tests related to these toxicities can be found in references such as Marzulli and Maibach\'s ""Dermatotoxicology"" or Burleson, Dean and Munson\'s ""Methods in Immunotoxicology.""\n\n5 Genotoxicity\n\nA standard battery of tests should be carried out to evaluate all new molecular entities for the potential to induce genotoxic effects. A drug should be evaluated for potential genetic toxicity prior to the submission of the IND. The standard battery consists of the three following tests:\n\n1) A gene mutation test in bacteria;\n\n2) An in vitro mouse lymphoma tk assay or a mammalian cell in vitro cytogenetic test for chromosomal aberrations;\n\n3) An in vivo test for chromosomal damage to rodent bone marrow cells or a mouse micronucle test.\n\nIf the three tests chosen indicate that the drug is devoid of genetic toxicity, no additional studies need to be carried out. If one or more of the battery is positive, the sponsor will be expected to carry out additional genotoxicity tests in consultation with the appropriate review division. For detailed information regarding genotoxicity, sponsors should refer to the document entitled ""Guidance on Specific Aspects of Regulatory Genotoxicity Tests for Pharmacoeticals."" Copies of the Guideline are available from the CDER Consumer Affairs Branch, HFD-210, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.\n\n6 Reproductive Toxicology\n\nReproductive toxicology studies should be carried out to explore the possible effects of the drug on fertility and reproductive performance. Additional studies should be performed to examine whether the drug is teratogenic or has an affect on perinatal/postnatal development. Studies designed to assess the teratogenic potential should be carried out in two species, usually in rats and rabbits. It is expected that reproductive toxicology studies will be completed prior to Phase 2/3 trials. For detailed information regarding reproductive toxicology, sponsors should refer to the document entitled, ""Guideline for Industry, Detection of Toxicity to Reproduction for Medicinal Products."" Copies of the Guideline are available from the CDER Consumer Affairs Branch, HFD-210, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.\n\n5 Carcinogenicity\n\nCarcinogenicity information is usually obtained during the final phase of the clinical development program. For a vaginal contraceptive, carcinogenicity tests in rats and mice should be submitted with the NDA. For a microbicide, carcinogenicity studies are also required, but the expected date of completion of the studies in relation to the filing of the NDA may vary. The drug should be administered for two years and the doses used should be chosen according to the principles outlined in the document entitled, ""Guideline for Industry, Dose Selection for Carcinogenicity Studies of Pharmaceuticals."" Copies of the Guideline are available from the CDER Consumer Affairs Branch, HFD-210, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. Sponsors should consult with the appropriate reviewing division for the current position and strategic approaches to these issues. Currently, it is recommended that sponsors request that the Executive Committee of the Carcinogenicity Assessment Committee of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research review the protocols for the carcinogenicity studies prior to their initiation and concur on their content.\n\n6 Already Marketed Drugs\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Development of Topical Drugs Intended to Prevent the Transmission of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) and:or for the Development of Drugs Intended to Act as Vaginal Contraceptives'

Increased availability of these devices may help to facilitate continuity of patient care by preventing disruptions to critical pathology services rendered by clinical laboratories, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities, and by reducing healthcare personnel contact and risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIII Scope\n\nThe enforcement policy described in this guidance applies to the following devices (""digital pathology devices""), which may be used during the COVID-19 public health emergency, when they are intended for use in remote reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides:\n\nTable 1\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \\hline\nClassification Regulation & Device Type & Product Code3 & Class \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.1860 & Automated Digital Image Manual Interpretation Microscope & OEO & II \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Whole Slide Imaging System & PSY & II \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Digital Pathology Image Viewing and Management & QKQ & II \\  & Software & & \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Digital Pathology Display & PZZ & II \\ \\hline \\end{tabular} Although the digital pathology devices listed above are typically used in clinical laboratories, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities, as further discussed in Section IV below, many of these devices possess the capability for reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides from remote locations.\n\nIV Policy\n\nOverview\n\nIn the context of the COVID-19 public health emergency, expanding the availability of remote digital pathology devices may help facilitate pathology services while reducing healthcare personnel contact and risk of potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) (42 U.S.C. 263a) require that clinical laboratories, including those within hospitals and other healthcare settings, obtain a certificate before accepting materials derived from the human body for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or the impairment of, or assessment of the health of human beings.4 Digital pathology devices have not been cleared for home use or categorized as waived by FDA and as a result, these devices have been limited to use in clinical laboratories, hospitals, and other healthcare settings that are CLIA-certified to perform nonwaived testing. However, in light of the COVID-19 public health emergency, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a memorandum on March 26, 2020, describing its exercise of enforcement discretion to ensure pathologists may review pathology slides and images remotely. The CMS memorandum states that laboratories that choose to utilize temporary testing sites (e.g., for remote review and reporting of slides/images) may do so if certain criteria outlined in the memorandum are met.5\n\nFootnote 4: For more information, see FDA’s guidance “Administrative Procedures for CLIA Categorization: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff”, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/administrative-procedures-clia-categorization.\n\nFootnote 5: See the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Memorandum, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Laboratory Guidance During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, March 26, 2020, https://www.cms.gov/medicareprovider-enrollment-and-certificationsurveycertificationgeninfopolicy-and-memos-states-and/clinical-laboratory-improvement-amendments-clia-laboratory-guidance-during-covid-19-public-health.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \\hline\nClassification Regulation & Device Type & Product Code3 & Class \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.1860 & Automated Digital Image Manual Interpretation Microscope & OEO & II \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Whole Slide Imaging System & PSY & II \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Digital Pathology Image Viewing and Management & QKQ & II \\  & Software & & \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Digital Pathology Display & PZZ & II \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1:\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn general, manufacturers of the digital pathology devices listed in Table 1 are required to submit a premarket notification under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act and receive FDA clearance prior to marketing these devices in the United States, as well as comply with post-marketing requirements.\n\nFDA recognizes that greater access to remote digital pathology devices may help facilitate the remote reviewing and reporting of pathology slides during this public health emergency which, in turn, may help facilitate continuity of patient care and reduce healthcare personnel contact and risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. For that reason, for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency, FDA does not intend to object to:\n\nmodifications to the FDA-cleared indications, functionality, hardware and/or software, of digital pathology devices identified in Table 1 above to provide for use in a remote setting, or\n\nthe marketing of new digital pathology devices of the types identified in Table 1 that are intended for use in remote settings and that are not currently 510(k) cleared for any use,\n\nwithout compliance with the following regulatory requirements, where such devices do not create an undue risk in light of the public health emergency: submission of a premarket notification under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 807.81,6 Good Manufacturing Practice requirements in 21 CFR Part 820, and Unique Device Identification (UDI) requirements in 21 CFR Part 830 and 21 CFR 801.20.\n\nFootnote 6: For further guidance on modifications that trigger the requirement that a manufacturer submit a new premarket notification (510(k)) to FDA, refer to “Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,” https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/deciding-when-submit-510k-change-existing-device.\n\nAdditionally, for remote digital pathology devices subject to this policy, FDA does not intend to enforce compliance with the special controls identified in 21 CFR 864.1860 (which are described in a special controls document for the submission of immunohistochemistry applications to the FDA7) and 21 CFR 864.3700 (83 FR 22), which includes requirements for the content of a premarket notification submission for a whole slide imaging system, where such devices or modifications do not create an undue risk in light of the public health emergency.\n\nFootnote 7: For more information, see “Guidance for Submission of Immunohistochemistry Applications to the Food and Drug Administration,” https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/guidance-documents-medical-devices-and-radiation-emitting-products/guidance-submission-immunohistochemistry-applications-food-and-drug-administration-final-guidance.\n\nFDA believes such devices will not create such an undue risk where the performance and labeling elements in Section 2.2.2 are met.\n\nAppendix B Labeling and Performance\n\nFDA believes such devices will not create such an undue risk when the following circumstances related to the performance of the device and the product labeling, including instructions specific to remote use, are present. FDA encourages firms to discuss any alternatives to these recommendations with FDA (CDRH-COVID19-DigitalPathology/fda.hhs.gov).\n\nFDA recommends that remote digital pathology devices use labeling that helps users better understand the device or device modifications, including instructions specific for remote use, such as:\n\nInstructions for clinical laboratories, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities to help them determine if remote reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides is feasible and appropriate based on an evaluation of their own information technology (IT) infrastructure and remote use environment for individual pathologists. FDA recommends that laboratories and hospitals consider performing a validation study where they deem necessary before remote reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides at a remote location.\n\nInstructions recommending that pathologists using such devices during the COVID-19 public health emergency use their clinical judgment to determine whether the quality of the images from the remote digital pathology devices are sufficient for interpretation of the pathological images.\n\nFDA recommends that manufacturers consider evaluating the performance of the device in accordance with the following FDA recognized standards, including (as applicable):\n\n_Medical Electrical Equipment\n\nPart 1: General Requirements for Basic Safety and Essential Performance_\n\n_Medical Electrical Equipment Part 1-2: General Requirements for Basic Safety and Essential Performance\n\nCollateral Standard: Electromagnetic Disturbances\n\nRequirements and Tests_\n\nAdditionally, while no device-specific performance recommendations are included in this enforcement policy, CLIA regulations and State law (including those related to performance) apply, although some CLIA regulations may be subject to CMS enforcement policies during this public health emergency.8\n\nFootnote 8: See the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Memorandum, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Laboratory Guidance During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, March 26, 2020, https://www.cms.gov/medicareprovider-enrollment-and-cerificationsurveycertificationgeninfopolicy-and-memos-states-and/clinical-laboratory-improvement-amendments-clia-laboratory-guidance-during-covid-19-public-health.\n--------------------\nContext title: Enforcement Policy for Remote Digital Pathology Devices During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry, Clinical Laboratories, Healthcare Facilities, Pathologists, and Food and Drug Administration Staff'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist sponsors of microdose radiopharmaceutical diagnostic drugs on the nonclinical studies recommended to support human clinical trials and marketing applications.2 This guidance addresses the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking regarding regulation of this class of drugs and provides complementary recommendations to the guidance for industry, investigators, and reviewers Exploratory IND (Investigational New Drug Application) Studies (exploratory IND guidance) and the ICH guidance for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals (ICH M3(R2)).\n\nFootnote 2: As defined by the guidance for industry, investigators, and reviewers Exploratory IND (Investigational New Drug Application) Studies, a microdose is less than 1/100 of the dose of a test substance calculated (based on animal data) to yield a pharmacologic effect of the test substance with a maximum dose of less than or equal to 100 micrograms ((\\upmu)g). The maximum dose for protein products is less than or equal to 30 nanomoles (nmol). This definition corresponds to approach 1 in Table 3: Recommended Nonclinical Studies to Support Exploratory Clinical Trials in the ICH guidance for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nThis guidance discusses how to refine nonclinical study recommendations for this class of drug given its unique characteristics (e.g., microdose, radiolabeled, single (or infrequent) use, clinical use setting, the Agency's nonclinical and clinical safety experience with these drugs).\n\nThis guidance also is intended to help sponsors facilitate the timely conduct of clinical trials, reduce the use of animals with the 3R (reduce/refine/replace) principles, and reduce the use of drug development resources. While both the exploratory IND and the ICH M3(R2) guidancesdescribe recommended nonclinical studies intended to be conducted early in phase 1 exploratory studies of microdose radiopharmaceutical diagnostic drugs, the guidances do not address what additional nonclinical studies are recommended for marketing approval. This guidance is intended to provide recommendations for a pathway to full drug development (marketing authorization) for microdose radiopharmaceutical diagnostic drugs.\n\nAs used in this guidance, a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical drug is (1) a drug that is intended for use in the diagnosis or monitoring of a disease or a manifestation of a disease in humans and that exhibits spontaneous disintegration of unstable nuclei with the emission of nuclear particles or photons or (2) any nonradioactive kit or nuclide generator that is intended to be used in the preparation of such a drug.3 These drugs are used in nuclear medicine procedures, including planar imaging, single photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and in combination with other radiation detection probes. As technology advances, microdose drugs that use new modalities may emerge. Although this guidance describes recommendations for current radiopharmaceutical diagnostic drugs, the general principles discussed could apply to new diagnostic drugs.\n\nFootnote 3: 21 CFR 315 and 601.31.\n\nThis guidance does not apply to radioactive drugs for research that are used in accordance with 21 CFR 361.1.4 These issues are addressed in the guidance for industry and researchers The Radioactive Drug Research Committee: Human Research Without an Investigational New Drug Application.\n\nFootnote 4: A radiolabeled compound without an IND can be administered at doses that are known to have no pharmacologic effect in humans when the compound has been studied in humans and the results of the studies have been published in the literature. These basic research studies should be conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board and a radioactive research committee (21 CFR 361.1).\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nFor radiopharmaceutical diagnostic drugs, the microdose evaluated during early clinical trials does not differ significantly from the microdose intended for marketing approval and is less than or equal to 100 micrograms ((\\upmu)g). Because these diagnostic drugs are administered using a dose at the low end of the dose-response curve, dose-related adverse events are unlikely to occur. The Agency recommends that sponsors tailor the amount and type of nonclinical supporting data to account for the low potential for adverse events.\n\nBecause each drug is unique, the Agency encourages sponsors to consult the Division of Medical Imaging Products in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research before submitting an IND and during drug development. If, at any stage of development, a sponsor determines that particular nonclinical pharmacology or toxicology studies are not needed and provides adequate justification in a waiver request, the Agency may grant a waiver for specific studies.5\n\nFootnote 5: 21 CFR 312.10.\n\nIII Recommendations for Nonclinical Studies\n\nThe Agency recommends that the sponsor schedule the nonclinical studies to facilitate the timely conduct of clinical trials (including appropriate safety monitoring based on findings in nonclinical studies) and to reduce unnecessary use of animals and other resources. Nonclinical recommendations for microdose diagnostic radiopharmaceutical diagnostic drugs are listed in Table 1 below.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{56.9pt}|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \\hline\nStudy Type & Phase & Comments \\ \\hline Pharmacology & Before phase 1 & These studies can include in vivo and in vitro pharmacologic characterizations (e.g., receptor/target/off-target profiling, imaging/radiation dosimetry studies). These studies should provide evidence that radiolabeling of an unlabeled moiety does not significantly alter pharmacologic characterizations. The studies should be of sufficient sensitivity to rule out pharmacologic effects at the anticipated clinical dose. \\ \\hline Extended single-dose toxicity in one species (usually a rodent) & Before phase 1 & FDA accepts the use of extended single-dose toxicity studies in animals to support single-dose clinical trials in humans. When a toxicity study is recommended, a sponsor can use a single mammalian species (both sexes). The route of exposure in animals should be the intended clinical route. To establish safety margins, the sponsor should use a formulation that is as similar as possible to the formulation intended for use in clinical trials for marketing approval.* \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nIn extended single-dose studies, animals should be observed for 14 days after dosing with an interim necropsy, typically on day 2, and evaluated endpoints should include body weights, clinical signs, clinical chemistries, hematology, and histopathology (high dose and control only if no pathology is seen at the high dose). The sponsor should design the study to establish a dose inducing a minimal toxic effect or, alternatively, establishing a margin of safety. To establish a margin of safety, the sponsor should demonstrate that a large multiple of the proposed human dose (e.g., 100 times the human dose) does not induce adverse effects in the experimental animals. Scaling from animals to humans based on milligram per kilogram for IV or milligram per square meter for oral administration can be used to select the dose for use in the clinical trial. Scaling based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodeling would also be appropriate if such data are available and the suggested dose does not exceed the dose determined from milligram per kilogram or milligram per square meter scaling.\n--------------------\nContext title: Microdose Radiopharmaceutical Diagnostic Drugs- Nonclinical Study Recommendations Guidance for Industry""

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe purpose of this guidance is to inform industry and the review staff in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) on how CDER views positive findings in genetic toxicology assays during drug development. The guidance provides recommendations on how to proceed with clinical studies while ensuring the safety of study participants when results in genotoxicity studies suggest a potential cancer or genetic hazard. This guidance pertains to pharmaceuticals administered through oral, intravenous, topical, and other routes, as appropriate.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe timing and conduct of genetic toxicology studies have been described in the ICH guidelines M3, S2A, and S2B.2 We recommend that these guidances be consulted and that this document be considered an adjunct guidance.\n\nRisk for carcinogenesis is usually determined in rodent assays, either 2-year studies or shorter-term studies using alternative models.3 A core battery of genetic toxicology studies has been accepted by industry and regulators through the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) consultative process. These studies, which are designed to identify genotoxic hazard, include:\n\nFootnote 3: ICH guidance for industry S1B Testing for Carcinogenicity of Pharmaceuticals.\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm)\n\n(\\bullet) A test for gene mutation in bacteria;\n\n(\\bullet) An in vitro assessment of chromosomal damage using mammalian cells or an in vitro mouse lymphoma (\\mathrm{tk}^{+/*}) assay; and\n\n(\\bullet) An in vivo test for chromosomal damage using rodent hematopoietic cells.\n\nThe following discussion is based on current guidance documents.4 We recommend that results from in vitro genetic toxicology studies be available before the initiation of phase 1 trials.\n\nFootnote 4: We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the CDER guidance Web page at http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm.\n\nIII Integration of Genetic Toxicology Study Results\n\nThe Agency takes into account the totality of safety data when considering whether it is safe to proceed with a clinical trial when there are positive genetic toxicology study results. This consideration includes a thorough evaluation of all the genetic toxicology data and the nature of the proposed trial. If the results of the genetic toxicology tests indicate a lack of genotoxic potential, then clinical trials can generally be undertaken in healthy subjects or patient populations with the proposed medical indication.\n\nPharmaceuticals that give positive results in genetic toxicology assays but do not directly interact with DNA do not always present a significant in vivo risk. In such cases, we recommend providing evidence of the mechanism of genotoxicity and relevance of the mechanism to anticipated in vivo exposure. Alternatively, it is also appropriate to rule out mechanisms involving direct interaction with DNA (e.g., demonstration that a drug does not cause DNA alkylation or DNA strand breakage).\n\nDrugs known to directly damage DNA may be permitted to be used in patients with debilitating or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, but should not be administered to healthy subjects.5\n\nFootnote 5: ICH guidance for industry S2A Specific Aspects of Regulatory Genotoxicity Tests for Pharmaceuticals.\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm)\n\nIf any of the three assays in the ICH genotoxicity standard battery are positive, then we recommend completing the fourth test in the ICH battery. Equivocal studies should be repeated to determine the reproducibility of the results. If a positive response is seen in one or more assays, sponsors should consider choosing from one or more of the following options.\n\nWeight-of-Evidence Approach\n\nIn some instances, after evaluation of all available data, the weight of evidence (WOE) suggests a lack of genotoxic hazard. For example, a positive response is observed in one exposure regimen of an in vitro cytogenetics assay. The positive result is seen only at the high dose, and the increase is within or just outside the range for historical control values for the solvent and cell line employed. The WOE approach could indicate that although a small increase in the frequency of chromosomal aberrations is statistically significant, it lacks biological relevance. Contributing considerations could include (1) the level of cytotoxicity at which the response was seen, and (2) corroborating data from the same or complementary assays. For example, a positive response seen with a short-term exposure without metabolic activation but not corroborated with the longer exposure at comparable levels of cytotoxicities would argue against the biological significance of the positive result. Similarly, such a positive finding in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay that is not corroborated by the matching exposure regimen of the mouse lymphoma assay could also call into question the significance of the positive finding. If the WOE approach indicates a lack of genotoxic hazard, clinical studies could proceed provided the positive response is described in the investigator's brochure and the informed consent form.\n\nMechanism of Action\n\nPositive results are sometimes satisfactorily explained by knowledge of the mechanism of action. For example, it has been demonstrated that in vitro clastogenic effects can result from excessively high osmolarity or low pH. Positive responses elicited under such nonphysiologic exposure conditions are not relevant to human risk. In addition, certain genotoxic responses are thought to have thresholds below which a hazard does not exist. Agents that induce effects by indirect mechanisms (e.g., interference with metabolism of nucleotides and their precursors, damage to spindle proteins, inhibition of DNA synthesis, or inhibition of topoisomerase) can have thresholds for genotoxic effects. In such cases, we recommend presenting evidence of the existence of a threshold that would not be attained during the proposed clinical exposure or presenting evidence of a mechanism not expected to be operative in vivo. Positive responses that are satisfactorily explained by an MOA may allow clinical studies in normal volunteers or in patients to proceed without additional studies.\n\nAdditional Supportive Studies\n\nOn occasion, results from in vitro studies demonstrate a reproducible positive dose-response. Results from bone marrow cytogenetic studies are frequently negative, even for those compounds giving positive results in in vitro genetic toxicology assays. This discrepancy can result from a number of differences between cultured cells and intact animals: differing metabolic pathways occurring in vitro and in vivo, metabolic inactivation in the intact animal, failure of the parent compound or active metabolite to reach the target cell, or simply, an inability to achieve plasma levels in vivo comparable to concentrations that generated positive responses in the in vitro assays.\n\nAdditional in vivo assays can be useful in clarifying in vitro positive results. For example, peripheral blood smears from repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice can be evaluated formicronucleus induction, and peripheral blood lymphocytes from repeat-dose studies in rats or monkeys can be cultured and assessed for chromosome damage in metaphase spreads. DNA damage can be assessed in potential target tissues (e.g., DNA adducts or DNA strand breakage using the Comet or alkaline elution assay), or transgenic rats or mice can be used to assess mutagenicity in potential target tissues.6\n--------------------\nContext title: Recommended Approaches to Integration of Genetic Toxicology Study Results""]","['If the whole slide images are used to generate raw data, they should be protected to prevent loss or alteration of data, maintain chain of custody, control access, and secure data systems and data transmission.

This Question and Answer (Q&A) document is intended to respond to those requests.\n\nThe ICH Q7 document should be read in its entirety regardless of the nature of the manufacturing activities being conducted to fully understand the linkages between certain sections and successfully implement appropriate Good Manufacturing practices (GMPs) at all stages of the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) supply chain, including distribution. A table is provided as an Annex of this document showing the link between each Q&A and the relevant Sections of ICH Q7 and other ICH Quality guidance.\n\nICH would like to acknowledge the work undertaken by the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S). PIC/S contributed to this document by selecting and reviewing relevant Q&As that had been collected from training sessions since the implementation of Q7 and transferred the output of these reviews to the ICH Q7 IWG for consideration and consolidation, as appropriate. Additional questions were developed based on responses from an ICH survey. PIC/S further contributed to the development of the document as an ICH Interested Party.\n\nPlease note that ICH Q7 should be applied in combination with the principles laid down for development and manufacturing in ICH Q11 (see definition of API starting material; see also ICH Q8(R2) Part II), Quality Risk Management (ICH Q9), and Pharmaceutical Quality Systems (ICH Q10). GMP principles as described in ICH Q7 should be applied regardless which approach is taken in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing.\n\nICH Q7 also describes principles of GMPs to be applied in the manufacture of APIs for use in clinical trials (Section 19) and for APIs manufactured by cell culture/fermentation (Section 18).\n\nDated: 10 June 2015\n\n1 INTRODUCTION - SCOPE\n\n1.2 & June 2015 & Does ICH Q7 apply to manufacturing Steps for the addition of substance(s) to an API (e.g., to stabilise the API)? & When a mixture is classified in the regulatory filing as an API in a region or country in which it is used in a drug product, ICH Q7 should be applied to the manufacturing of these mixtures [ICH Q7, Section 1.2, 20 - see Glossary for definition of 'API'].\n\n2 QUALITY MANAGEMENT\n\n3.

However, experience gained with the implementation of ICH Q7 since the approval in November 2000 shows that uncertainties related to the interpretation of some sections exist. Furthermore, the importance of the application of the life-cycle approach addressed in the new ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, Q10 Guidelines to API manufacturing procedures is emphasized by the ICH Quality Implementation Working Group (Quality IWG). Technical issues with regard to GMP of APIs - also in context with new ICH Guidelines - need to be addressed in order to harmonize expectations during inspections.\n\nA document would be helpful in removing these ambiguities and uncertainties and also in harmonizing the inspections of both small molecules and biotech APIs.\n\nIssues to be resolved\n\nThe following issues have so far been identified by practical experience and will need to be addressed in a Q&A document on Q7:\n\nOutput from the review of existing Q&As (e.g., from PIC/S Expert Circle on APIs, from initial Regulatory/PDA training 2002) currently underway by PIC/S teams will be considered for endorsement.\n\nTechnical issues for clarification such as application in the supply chain control, contractor/supplier management (outsourcing), monitoring of impurity profiles, quality systems, applicability to biologicals/biotech and relationship with Q5D, and GMP expectations in the development phase (manufacturing for clinical trials).\n\nImpact of the implementation of ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, and Q10 on Q7 (see also Quality IWG Q&As and Points to Consider).\n\nBackground to the Proposal\n\nIt has become apparent, based on the approval and implementation of ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11 principles into GMP of APIs that certain individual implementation approaches are leading to non harmonized interpretation and new expectations beyond the intention of ICH Q7. The Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme (PIC/S) launched the 'International Collaboration on APIs - Training programme on ICH Q7'. This training programme includes a basic training, an advanced training and a Q&A document on interpretation of ICH Q7. This provides a feedback by the global knowledge of its network of inspectors. PIC/S will be supportive of the Q7 IWG work.\n\nType of Implementation Working Group and Resources\n\nThe Q7 IWG should comprise of the Six ICH Parties (2 experts per Party), Observers to ICH (1 expert per Observer), RHIs, DRAs and DoH (1 expert per RHI/DRA/DoH), and Interested Parties (WSNI, IGPA, Biotechnology Industry, PIC/S, API Industry and CEP programme of EDQM, 1 expert per Interested Party).\n\nTiming\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Q&As Concept Paper""

It is also intended to help ensure that APIs meet the requirements for quality and purity that they purport or are represented to possess.\n\nIn this Guide ""manufacturing"" is defined to include all operations of receipt of materials, production, packaging, repackaging, labelling, relabelling, quality control, release, storage and distribution of APIs and the related controls. In this Guide the term ""should"" indicates recommendations that are expected to apply unless shown to be inapplicable or replaced by an alternative demonstrated to provide at least an equivalent level of quality assurance. For the purposes of this Guide, the terms ""current good manufacturing practices"" and ""good manufacturing practices"" are equivalent.\n\nThe Guide as a whole does not cover safety aspects for the personnel engaged in the manufacture, nor aspects of protection of the environment. These controls are inherent responsibilities of the manufacturer and are governed by national laws.\n\nThis Guide is not intended to define registration/filing requirements or modify pharmacopoeial requirements. This Guide does not affect the ability of the responsible regulatory agency to establish specific registration/filing requirements regarding APIs within the context of marketing/manufacturing authorizations or drug applications. All commitments in registration/filing documents must be met.\n\nRegulatory Applicability\n\nWithin the world community, materials may vary as to the legal classification as an API. When a material is classified as an API in the region or country in which it is manufactured or used in a drug product, it should be manufactured according to this Guide.\n\nScope\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline'

The guidance discusses some of the considerations for the noninferiority trial to ensure the appropriate demonstration of efficacy when compared to an active-controlled drug.\n\nEffective treatment of some NTDs includes the use of combinations of antimicrobial drugs to enhance efficacy or prevent the development of resistant pathogens. Some development programs may include two or more new investigational drugs. The guidance for industry Codevelopment of Two or More New Investigational Drugs for Use in Combination covers this area.\n\nSome NTDs have known effective treatment, and clinical trials designed to demonstrate noninferiority of an investigational drug to the control drug can be used in this situation. The noninferiority clinical trial design poses some unique scientific and regulatory challenges, which focus on an ability to describe a reliable treatment effect of the control drug. Two guidances in this area include the draft guidance for industry Non-Inferiority Clinical Trials25 and the guidance for industry Antibacterial Drug Products: Use of Noninferiority Trials to Support Approval.

It does not create any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist institutional review boards (IRBs), clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA\'s informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. This guidance supersedes FDA\'s guidance entitled ""A Guide to Informed Consent,"" issued in September 1998, and finalizes FDA\'s draft guidance entitled ""Informed Consent Information Sheet,"" issued in July 2014. This document is structured to first present general guidance on FDA\'s regulatory requirements for informed consent and a discussion of the roles of IRBs, clinical investigators, sponsors, and FDA related to informed consent, followed by a series of frequently asked questions.\n\nIn a final rule published on January 19, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal departments and agencies revised the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects. The final rule became effective in 2018 (codified for HHS at 45 CFR 46, subpart A; ""the 2018 Common Rule"").2,3 The 2018 Common Rule sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by federal departments or agencies that have adopted the Common Rule. The revisions include significant changes to the provisions regarding informed consent. FDA is currently engaged in notice and comment rulemaking to harmonize its human subject protection\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nof the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Summary of the Consent process\n\nTo many, the term informed consent is mistakenly viewed as synonymous with obtaining a subject\'s signature on the consent form;9 however, obtaining documentation of a subject\'s informed consent is only part of the consent process. Informed consent involves providing a prospective subject, or their legally authorized representative (LAR), with adequate information to allow for an informed decision about participation in the clinical investigation prior to enrollment. Informed consent also involves facilitating the prospective subject\'s understanding of the information, providing adequate opportunity for the prospective subject to ask questions and to consider whether to participate, obtaining the prospective subject\'s voluntary agreement to participate prior to enrollment, and continuing to provide information as the clinical investigation progresses or as the enrolled subject or situation requires.10\n\nFootnote 9: In this guidance document, the terms informed consent form and informed consent document are used interchangeably.\n\nExcept as provided in 21 CFR 50.23 and 50.24,11 (see section III.A.1, ""Exceptions to Informed Consent""), no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in FDA-regulated research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s LAR (21CFR 50.20).12 To be legally effective, the informed consent process must satisfy the general requirements under 21 CFR 50.20 and include the relevant elements of informed consent described at 21 CFR 50.25 (see section3), ""FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion"").\n\nFootnote 12: As described in guidance, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances, with respect to its current regulations governing the requirement for informed consent when human specimens are used for FDA-regulated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device investigations. See “Guidance on Informed Consent for in Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable: Guidance for Sponsors, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff”, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-informed- Consent-vitro-diagnostic-device-studies-using-leftover-human-specimens-are-not\n\nFDA considers advertising used to recruit subjects into the clinical trial to be the start of the ongoing consent process, and the information provided in any online or hard copy recruitment materials should be consistent with the informed consent document. Generally, FDA recommends that any advertisement to recruit subjects be limited to the information the prospective subjects need to determine their interest and potential eligibility. The FDA information sheet ""Recruiting Study Subjects"" includes information regarding scripts for those who will interface with subjects to determine basic eligibility.13\n\nFootnote 13: See the FDA Information Sheet “Recruiting Study Subjects,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects, for further information.\n\nOnce a prospective subject is identified, and before research activities requiring prior consent occur, a person knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and capable of answering questions raised by the prospective subject should conduct a consent discussion. The consent discussion and the consent form must contain information to allow prospective subjects to make an informed decision about participation in a clinical investigation and provide an opportunity for prospective subjects to ask questions about the clinical investigation and the information in the consent document (see section3), ""FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion"") (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25).14 The consent form serves several purposes, including helping to ensure that prospective subjects receive the required information, providing a ""take home"" reminder of the elements of the clinical investigation, providing contact information in case additional questions or concerns arise, and documenting prospective subjects\' voluntary agreement to participate as well as the date of their agreement.\n\nFootnote 14: The regulations allow use of a “short form” consent form when the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For a discussion of the short form written consent, see section3.5.4.2, “Short Form.”\n\nThe informed consent process is an ongoing exchange of information throughout a subject\'s participation in a clinical trial and does not end after the consent form is signed. For example, if new safety information or protocol changes occur during the conduct of the study, additional information may need to be given to the subject, and/or the subject may need additional opportunities to ask questions and receive answers throughout the clinical investigation (see sectionIII.3.5, ""Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects,"" and Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nIII FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b ""Short Form"" for more details). If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For ""applicable clinical trials"" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, “Element of Informed Consent for ‘Applicable Clinical Trials.”\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 64: See section IV.A.4 for guidance regarding identification of the most up-to-date version of the informed consent form.\n\niv.2.4 Identification of Revised Consent Forms\n\nThe IRB should ensure that there is a way to identify a revised consent form so that continued use of a previously approved version does not occur. While not required by FDA regulations, the use of date stamps is one possible mechanism for ensuring use of the most recently approved version of the consent form.\n\nThe Clinical Investigator\n\nThe clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects during a clinical investigation, and for ensuring that, unless an exception applies, legally effective informed consent is obtained from each subject or the subject\'s LAR before that subject takes part in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.20(a), 312.60, and 812.100). Legally effective informed consent includes meeting all applicable Federal, State, and local laws that require additional information in the informed consent form beyond what FDA regulations require. Sponsors and investigators may wish to seek legal guidance regarding specific local consent requirements applicable to their research.\n\nThe clinical investigator should notify the IRB regarding the consent process, including who (e.g., the investigator or another study team member) will conduct the consent discussion. Any information that will be given to subjects to review and discuss as part of informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)). An investigator may not begin the informed consent process with prospective subjects until the IRB reviews and approves the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process (21 CFR 50.20, 50.27, and 56.109).\n\nThe clinical investigator\'s institution may have standard language or a standard format for consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation). FDA recognizes that investigators may also need to identify and meet institutional requirements and incorporate them into the consent form for the IRB\'s initial review of the clinical investigation.\n\nDuring the clinical investigation, the investigator may need to revise the consent form to address new information that might arise during the conduct of the trial, such as a change to the protocol or new safety information. The investigator will need to obtain IRB review and approval of the revised consent form (21 CFR 50.27 and 56.109). In addition, because the consent form is being modified to reflect new information that might affect the willingness of already enrolled and actively participating subjects to continue in the clinical investigation, the IRB should determine the need to inform the previously enrolled subjects of the new information and determine their willingness to continue in the research (see\n\nFrequently Asked Questions #16).\n\nAny new information that is part of the consent process must be reviewed and approved by the IRB as a change in approved research before it is initiated, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject (see 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)). In the rare event that urgent safety information is provided to the subject prior to IRB approval, the IRB should promptly be notified of both the safety issue and the notification of subjects.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the clinical investigator:\n\niv.2.1 Delegation of Consent Discussion\n\nFDA regulations require that the investigator obtain the legally effective informed consent of subjects (21 CFR 50.20, 312.60 and 812.100). If the investigator delegates this responsibility, FDA expects that the individual to whom the responsibility is delegated be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform this activity. The individual obtaining informed consent should be knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and have the appropriate training and credentials to be able to address any questions or concerns the subject may have about the study and/or alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject. The investigator should have a detailed plan for the supervision and training of staff, and oversight of the clinical investigation, including the informed consent process.65 Even when a task is delegated to another individual, the investigator remains responsible for ensuring that legally effective informed consent is obtained for all subjects in accordance with 21 CFR part 50.\n\niv.2.2 Financial Relationships and Interests\n\nThe clinical investigator should consider whether information related to financial relationships or interests should be provided to subjects.66 Clinical investigators should consider the potential effects that a financial relationship might have on the clinical investigation or on interactions with subjects. When there are financial relationships or interests, clinical investigators should consider the following actions:\n\nFootnote 66: See the HHS guidance document, “Financial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidance for Human Subject Protection,” available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/financial-conflict-of-interest/index.html#.\n\nIncluding information in the informed consent form, such as:\n\nThe source of funding and funding arrangements for the conduct and review of the clinical investigation, or\n\nInformation about a financial arrangement or interest (e.g., stock in the study sponsor, patent on the investigational product) of an institution or an investigator and how it is being managed.\n\nUsing special measures to modify the informed consent process when a potential or actual financial conflict exists, such as:\n\nHaving another individual who does not have a potential or actual conflict of interest involved in the consent process, especially when a potential or actual conflict of interest could influence the tone, presentation, or type of information presented during the consent process.\n\nUsing independent monitoring of the consent process.\n\nAlthough the clinical investigator should consider these issues regarding financial relationships and interests, IRBs have the final responsibility of determining whether subjects should be provided with information regarding the source of funding, funding arrangements, or financial interests of parties involved in the clinical investigation as part of the informed consent process (see 21 CFR 56.109 and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).\n\nThe Sponsor\n\nSponsors often provide clinical investigators with a model consent form that may be adapted by the clinical investigator to meet local needs. When the consent form for studies that require an IND or IDE application is submitted to FDA for review, FDA\'s comments are generally directed to the sponsor (see sectionIV.4.1, ""Investigational New Drugs and Biologics,"" and sectionIV.4.2, ""Investigational Medical Devices""). The sponsor should promptly provide the clinical investigator with any necessary modifications required to satisfy the regulations at 21 CFR 50.25 so that changes can be made to the consent forms. A modified model consent form reflecting the changes may be used to convey the necessary edits. Because the clinical investigator must receive IRB approval before starting the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 312.66 and 21 CFR 812.110(a)), the sponsor should work closely with the clinical investigator to make certain the modified consent form is reviewed and approved by the IRB. The clinical investigator should provide the sponsor with a copy of the consent form approved by the IRB.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the sponsor:\n\niv.3.1 Considerations for Multicenter Clinical Investigations\n\nFor multicenter clinical investigations, changes may need to be made to the consent form to address local and institutional requirements. For multicenter clinical investigations reviewed by more than one IRB, when local IRB review results in substantive modifications to the consent form, i.e., changes that affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects, FDA expects the sponsor to share the revisions with all investigators and their IRBs. In this situation it may be more efficient to share the changes with the sites using a modified model consent form, when appropriate. If the multicenter clinical investigation has a central IRB cooperating with local IRBs or human research protection offices, the revisions should be forwarded to the central IRB.67 Alternatively, local issues may be addressed by the central IRB depending on the review agreement between the local IRB(s) and central IRB. Note that for medicaldevice studies that require submission of an IDE application, such changes must be submitted to FDA.68\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 812.35(a).\n\nFootnote 69: The 2018 Common Rule requires that any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States, unless the research is not subject to the provision (45 CFR 46.114(b)). The compliance date for research subject to this provision was January 20, 2020. On September 28, 2022, FDA issued a proposed rule to harmonize with this requirement to the extent practicable and consistent with statutory provisions (see https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/28/2022-21089/institutional-review-boards-cooperative-research). The January 19, 2017, final rule revising the Common Rule is available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/finalized-revisions-common-rule/index.html.\n\n.4.2 Sponsor Personnel\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: In the event that an IRB waives the requirement for documentation of informed consent (under 21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)), FDA recommends that the elements of informed consent be reviewed verbally with the subject or the subject\'s LAR. Additionally, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects with a written statement regarding the clinical investigation (21 CFR 56.109(d)). See section III. E.2, ""Alternative Methods of Obtaining Informed Consent"" below for additional information regarding documentation of consent. FDA recommends that when an IRB waives the documentation requirement for informed consent in circumstances where there is minimal risk of harm under 21 CFR 56.109(c)(1), the consent process and discussion be described and noted in subject case histories required to be maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3).46\n\nFootnote 46: Documentation requirements related to emergency research, as mentioned in 21 CFR 56.109(c)(2), can be found in 21 CFR 50.24. Discussion of these studies is in a separate guidance, “Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors; Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/exception-informed-consent-requirements-emergency-research.\n\nFootnote 47: For additional information on alternative methods of obtaining informed consent, please see “Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Investigators, and Sponsors, Use of Electronic Informed Consent in Clinical Investigations,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-electronic-informed-consent-clinical-investigations-questions-and-answers, and FDA’s MyStudies Application (App) at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/science-and-research-drugs/covid-mystudies-application-app.\n\n2.2.2 Alternative Methods of Obtaining Informed Consent\n\nTraditionally, informed consent has been obtained and documented in a face-to-face interview using paper consent forms. Technologies are available that may serve as an alternative to the paper consent form in the informed consent process.47 Parties interested in pursuing alternative methods of obtaining informed consent should discuss their plan with their IRB and are welcome to contact FDA as needed for advice.48\n\nFootnote 48: Questions related to alternative methods of obtaining informed consent can be directed to the Office of Clinical Policy at gcpaquestions@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nEven in the context of paper consent forms, there may be certain circumstances when an alternative to a face-to-face consent discussion may be appropriate. For example, such an alternative may be appropriate\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:31]\n\nbe described and noted in subject case histories required to maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3).\n\niv.1.3 Requirement for Dating Consent Form\n\nIn addition to signing the consent form, the subject or the subject\'s LAR must enter the date of signature on the form (21 CFR 50.27(a)) to allow confirmation that the subject or the subject\'s LAR provided consent prior to participation in the clinical investigation, as required by 21 CFR 50.20. In those cases where the subject provides consent on the same day51 that they begin participation in the clinical investigation, the subject\'s case history must document that the subject provided consent prior to participation in the research for studies conducted under an IND or IDE, (312.62(b) and 812.140(a)(3)), and the subject\'s case history should contain the signed and dated consent form. Although FDA regulations do not require the subject\'s copy to be a signed copy, FDA recommends that a copy of the signed consent form be provided.\n\nFootnote 51: Prospective subjects should have sufficient opportunity and time to consider enrollment in the research, such that coercion and undue influence are minimized. See sectionIII.A.2, “Coercion and Undue Influence”.\n\niv.1.4 Forms for Documentation of Informed Consent\n\nUnder 21 CFR 50.27:\n\n(b) Except as provided in SS 56.109(c), the consent form may be either of the following:\n\nA written consent document that embodies the elements of informed consent required by SS 50.25_. This form may be read to the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative, but, in any event, the investigator shall give either the subject or the representative adequate opportunity to read it before it is signed._\n\nA short form written consent document stating that the elements of informed consent required by SS 50.25 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Also, the IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the representative. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining the consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.\n\nThe regulations provide for obtaining written informed consent by two different methods: a long form that embodies all the elements of informed consent (see 21 CFR 50.25), or a short form that states that the elements of informed consent have been presented orally to the subject\'s LAR.\n\nLong Form\n\nAs stated above, the long form must incorporate all the elements of informed consent as required under 21 CFR 50.25. When the long form is used, a copy must be provided to the person signing the form, that is, the subject or the subject\'s LAR (21 CFR 50.27(a)).\n\nShort Form\n\nAn IRB may approve a short form to be used in appropriate situations where the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 are presented orally to the subject or the subject\'s LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For example, IRBs may consider approving the use of a short form in situations where the subject or the subject\'s LAR is unable to read due to low literacy or visual impairment.52\n\nFootnote 52: For additional information see Frequently Asked Question #6, “What should be considered when enrolling subjects with low literacy and numeracy?” and Frequently Asked Question #7, “What should be considered when enrolling subjects with physical or sensory disabilities?” In addition, for information on enrolling individuals with limited English proficiency see Frequently Asked Question #3, “What are some considerations for enrolling non-English speaking subjects?”, Frequently Asked Question #4, “What process should be followed when it is expected that subjects who do not understand English will be enrolled?”, and Frequently Asked Question #5, “What process should be followed when the enrollment of subjects who do not understand English, or who are limited English proficient, is not expected?”\n\nWhen the short form is used, the IRB is required to approve a written summary of the information to be presented orally (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The information presented orally should be as thorough as the information contained in the long form.53 A copy of the short form and the written summary must be given to the person signing the form (that is, the subject or the subject\'s LAR) (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)).\n\nFootnote 53: See the response to Comment 52 in the preamble to the 1981 final rule issuing regulations for the protection of human subjects (46 FR 8942, January 27, 1981); https://www.fda.gov/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/protection-human-subjects-informed-consent: “The fact that a short form is used to document informed consent does not mean that the subject will get less information than if handed a long, detailed written document...All the ‘form’ provides [whether long or short] is evidence that the information required by 50.25 has been provided to a prospective subject.”\n\nUse of the short form requires that there be a witness to the oral presentation of information to the subject or the subject\'s LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). FDA recommends that an impartial third party not otherwise connected with the clinical investigation (for example, clinical staff not involved in the research, a patient advocate or an independent interpreter) serve as the witness. The witness must be present physically or by some other means, for example, by phone or video conference, during the oral presentation, not just the signing of the consent form (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The purpose of the witness is generally to attest to the voluntariness of the subject\'s consent and the adequacy of the consent process by ensuring that the information was accurately conveyed and that the subject\'s questions were answered.\n\nThe subject or the subject\'s LAR signs and dates only the short form (21 CFR 50.27(a) and (b)(2)). The witness must sign both the short form and the summary, and the person obtaining consent must sign the summary (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). Due to the additional requirements of having a witness and providing a written summary of the consent discussion, use of the short form may not ease or expedite the consent process.\n\nIV Responsibilities for informed consent\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 58: See 21 CFR 56.109(b).\n\nInvestigators must use an IRB-approved written consent form when documenting informed consent, in accordance with 21 CFR 50.27, except as provided in 21 CFR 56.109(c). Thus, the IRB should review the adequacy and appropriateness of all wording in the consent materials, as well as the overall length and presentation of information. Consent forms that are long, complex, legalistic, and have a high reading level may overwhelm prospective subjects and may inhibit reading of the full document and understanding of the relevant information.\n\nThe IRB should ensure that technical and scientific concepts and terms are explained, or common terms substituted, so that the anticipated subject population can understand all provided information (see 21 CFR 50.20).59 Pictures, diagrams, or other visual aids may be used to improve understanding of medical terms or how an investigational product functions. IRBs may wish to evaluate, through subject discussions, how well the consent materials communicate critical information. Additional guidance on the requirements at 21 CFR 50.20 can be found in section 1.1.2, ""General Requirements for Informed Consent"" above.\n\nFootnote 59: Various strategies exist to improve communication with patients, for example, see Doak CC, Doak LG, Friedell GH, Meade CD. Improving comprehension for cancer patients with low literacy skills: strategies for clinicians. CA Cancer J Clin. 1998 May-Jun;48(3):151-62. doi: 10.3322/canjclin.48.3.151. PMID: 9594918.\n\n1.1.2 Use of Standardized Language\n\nInstitutions may develop standard language or a standard format to use in portions of all consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation) to meet certain FDA regulatory requirements, as well as institutional and other Federal, State, or local requirements.\n\n5.3.2 Review of the Consent Process\n\nThe investigator should notify the IRB of the consent process to be used. The process may be described in the protocol, or the investigator may provide a brief document describing the process to be used. The materials and procedures used for subject recruitment, which typically include advertisements, must be reviewed and approved by the IRB to ensure that these materials are appropriate, as described in section4.1, ""Review of All Informed Consent Materials"" (see 21 CFR 56.109(b) and 56.111(a)(4)).60 The IRB must determine that investigators will seek consent from prospective subjects under circumstances that minimize the possibility of coercion and undue influence (21 CFR 50.20 and 56.111(a)(4)). FDA considers this to include ensuring that the consent process described by the investigator allows sufficient time for prospective subjects to consider the information, provides time and opportunity for the subjects to ask questions and have those questions answered, and allows time and opportunity for the subjects to consider fully whether to participate.\n\nFootnote 60: For further information, see the FDA Information Sheet “Recruiting Study Subjects,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects.\n\nTo approve a clinical investigation, the IRB must find that informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject\'s LAR and that informed consent will be appropriately documented, in accordance with and to the extent required by 21 CFR part 50 (21 CFR 56.111(a)(4) and (5)). FDA recommends that the IRB inquire as to who will conduct the consent discussion and what procedures will be followed. If procedures other than a face-to-face consent discussion are proposed, such as by telephone, the IRB should consider whether the procedures will provide effective communication and accomplish the goals of the informed consent process. Alternative procedures may be of special concern when the clinical investigation involves complex procedures or when risks may be difficult to comprehend.\n\nFDA regulations authorize the IRB to observe or have a third party observe the consent process, as well as the research (21 CFR 56.109(f)). IRBs should consider using this authority when it may be appropriate61 or enhance the protection provided to subjects (for example, when the investigator is alsothe treating physician for a prospective subject, when the person conducting the consent interview is relatively inexperienced, or when the clinical investigation involves vulnerable subjects). In addition to observing a sample of consent discussions, the IRB could interview subjects to assess the consent process and evaluate the subjects\' understanding of the clinical investigation.\n\n3.3.3 IRB Review of Updated Informed Consent Documents\n\nAll information given to subjects as part of the consent process is to be reviewed and approved by the IRB (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).62 During the clinical investigation, new information about the research or changes to the clinical investigation may arise that affect the rights or welfare of subjects. FDA recommends that IRBs have procedures in place for the timely, efficient, and effective review of such new information or changes. This would include procedures for the clinical investigator and/or sponsor to notify the IRB of any significant new findings that arise during the clinical investigation relevant to a subject\'s decision to continue participation (see section3.3.5, ""Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects"", and (\\mathtt{Frequently\\ Asked\\ Question}#16)). When new information or changes in the clinical investigation warrant revisions of the consent form (and any accompanying changes to the protocol), such revisions must be reviewed and approved by the IRB before the revisions are initiated, except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to subjects (21 CFR 56.108(a)(3)-(4)).\n\nFootnote 62: This would include all addenda to the consent form and other materials used in the consent process.\n\nSome changes may be reviewed and approved by expedited means, as provided for by 21 CFR 56.110. For example, an IRB may decide expedited review is appropriate for changes to the consent form that reflect minor changes in the protocol or recruitment plan (e.g., new advertising for subjects following initiation of the clinical investigation when the advertisement incorporates wording from the approved consent form). When expedited review is used, if the IRB reviewer is unsure whether the change qualifies for expedited review under 21 CFR 56.110(b), FDA recommends that the reviewer (if other than the IRB chair) consult with the IRB chair. If doubts persist as to whether the change qualifies for expedited review, then the change should be reviewed at a convened meeting of the IRB.63\n\nFootnote 63: As indicated at section4.2, when new information is added to the consent form that might affect the willingness of already enrolled and actively participating subjects to continue in the clinical investigation, the IRB should determine the need to inform the previously enrolled subjects of the new information and determine their willingness to continue in the research.\n\nAdministrative changes, such as the correction of typographical and spelling errors, and changes in telephone numbers, may be submitted to the IRB at any time, including during continuing review, and do not require formal review and approval. Although such changes do not need IRB review, updatedversions of the consent form should be sent to the IRB so that they have current copies of the informed consent form on file.64\n\nFootnote 64: See section IV.A.4 for guidance regarding identification of the most up-to-date version of the informed consent form.\n\niv.2.4 Identification of Revised Consent Forms\n\nThe IRB should ensure that there is a way to identify a revised consent form so that continued use of a previously approved version does not occur. While not required by FDA regulations, the use of date stamps is one possible mechanism for ensuring use of the most recently approved version of the consent form.\n\nThe Clinical Investigator\n\nThe clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects during a clinical investigation, and for ensuring that, unless an exception applies, legally effective informed consent is obtained from each subject or the subject\'s LAR before that subject takes part in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.20(a), 312.60, and 812.100). Legally effective informed consent includes meeting all applicable Federal, State, and local laws that require additional information in the informed consent form beyond what FDA regulations require. Sponsors and investigators may wish to seek legal guidance regarding specific local consent requirements applicable to their research.\n\nThe clinical investigator should notify the IRB regarding the consent process, including who (e.g., the investigator or another study team member) will conduct the consent discussion. Any information that will be given to subjects to review and discuss as part of informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)). An investigator may not begin the informed consent process with prospective subjects until the IRB reviews and approves the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process (21 CFR 50.20, 50.27, and 56.109).\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: In response to stakeholder inquiries, we are clarifying that the provisions of the 2018 Requirements related to the content, organization, and presentation of information included in the consent form and process as well as the basic and additional elements of informed consent are not inconsistent with FDA\'s current policies and guidances. This may avoid the need for sponsors or investigators to develop, and IRBs to review, two separate informed consent forms. See Appendix for a subset of the new informed consent provisions from the 2018 Requirements.\n\n4 Expedited Review Procedures and List\n\nFDA\'s regulation at 21 CFR 56.110 sets forth expedited IRB review procedures for certain kinds of research involving no more than minimal risk. Section 56.110(a) describes a list of categories of research that may be reviewed by an IRB through an expedited review procedure that may be established through a Federal Register Notice. FDA established and published this list in the Federal Register on November 9, 1998 (the 1998 list).8 Section 56.110(b) makes clear that, as appropriate, IRB ""reviewer(s)"" must find that the research on the list involves no more than minimal risk in order for the IRB to use the expedited review procedure.\n\nFootnote 8: 63 FR 60353, November 9, 1998; https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1998-11-09/pdf/98-29748.pdf.\n\nFDA recognizes that under the 2018 Requirements at 45 CFR 46.110(b), an IRB may use the expedited procedures for research appearing on the expedited review list, unless the IRB reviewer determines that the study involves more than minimal risk. Because FDA has not revised its regulations, IRBs must continue to comply with FDA\'s regulation at 21 CFR 56.110(b) and use the 1998 list for FDA-regulated clinical investigations, including those that are subject to both HHS and FDA regulations.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nV IRB Continuing Review\n\nThe 2018 Requirements eliminated the requirement to conduct continuing review in certain circumstances (see 45 CFR 46.109(f)(1)). Under 45 CFR 46.109(f)(1)(i) and (iii), continuing review will not be required for research that is either eligible for expedited review in accordance with 45 CFR 46.110, or for research that has progressed to the point that the only remaining activities are data analysis, and/or accessing follow-up clinical data from procedures that subjects would undergo as part of clinical care, unless the IRB determines otherwise.\n\nBecause FDA has not revised its regulations, IRBs must continue to comply with our current requirements for IRB continuing review at 21 CFR 56.109(f), including for clinical investigations that are subject to both HHS and FDA jurisdiction. IRBs are required to conduct continuing review of research at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once per year (21 CFR 56.109(f)).9\n\nFootnote 9: For further information, see FDA’s “Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors; IRB Continuing Review after Clinical Investigation Approval,” (February 2012),\n\n(https://www.fda.gov/downloads/regulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm294558.pdf).\n\nVI Further Clarification\n\nFDA is actively working to harmonize its human subject protection regulations consistent with the Cures Act. We recognize there may be questions regarding the application of other provisions of the 2018 Requirements to FDA-regulated clinical investigations during this interim period. Questions and/or comments requesting further clarification may be submitted at any time to the public docket for this guidance, and FDA will consider issuing additional guidance, if necessary, to address other provisions.\n\nAppendix: Selected Informed Consent provisions from the 2018 requirements\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\nThe 2018 Requirements contain new general requirements for informed consent related to the content, organization, and presentation of information in the consent form and process to facilitate a prospective subject\'s decision about whether to participate in the research.\n\nThe provisions which are new or include new information are as follows:\n\n46.116(a)(4) The prospective subject or the legally authorized representative must be provided with the information that a reasonable person would want to have in order to make an informed decision about whether to participate, and an opportunity to discuss that information.\n\n46.116(a)(5)(i) Informed consent must begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a prospective subject or legally authorized representative in understanding the reasons why one might or might not want to participate in the research. This part of the informed consent must be organized and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension.\n\n46.116(a)(5)(ii) Informed consent as a whole must present information in sufficient detail relating to the research, and must be organized and presented in a way that does not merely provide lists of isolated facts, but rather facilitates the prospective subject\'s or legally authorized representative\'s understanding of the reasons why one might or might not want to participate.\n\n46.117(b)(2) A short form written informed consent form stating that the required elements of informed consent required by 45 CFR 46.116 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative and that the key information required by 45 CFR 46.116(a)(5)(i) was presented first to the subject, before other information, if any, was provided.\n\nBasic and Additional Elements of Informed Consent\n\nThe 2018 Requirements contain a new basic element and three additional elements of informed consent, as follows:Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNew Basic Element at 45 CFR 46.116(b)(9)\n\nOne of the following statements about any research that involves the collection of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecicmens:10\n\nFootnote 10: Private information includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information that has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and that the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (e.g., a medical record). (45 CFR 46.102(e)(4)).\n\n(i) A statement that identifiers might be removed from the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecicmens and that, after such removal, the information or biospecicmens could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without additional informed consent from the subject or the legally authorized representative, if this might be a possibility; or (ii) A statement that the subject\'s information or biospecicmens collected as part of the research, even if identifiers are removed, will not be used or distributed for future research studies.\n\nNew Additional Elements at 45 CFR 46.116(c)(7) - (9)\n\n46.116(c)(7) A statement that the subject\'s biospecicmens (even if identifiers are removed) may be used for commercial profit and whether the subject will or will not share in this commercial profit; 46.116(c)(8) A statement regarding whether clinically relevant research results, including individual research results, will be disclosed to subjects, and if so, under what conditions; and 46.116(c)(9) For research involving biospecicmens, whether the research will (if known) or might include whole genome sequencing (i.e., sequencing of a human germline or somatic specimen with the intent to generate the genome or exome sequence of that specimen).\n--------------------\nContext title: Impact of Certain Provisions of the Revised Common Rule on FDA-Regulated Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Investigators, and Institutional Review Boards'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: For multicenter clinical investigations, changes may need to be made to the consent form to address local and institutional requirements. For multicenter clinical investigations reviewed by more than one IRB, when local IRB review results in substantive modifications to the consent form, i.e., changes that affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects, FDA expects the sponsor to share the revisions with all investigators and their IRBs. In this situation it may be more efficient to share the changes with the sites using a modified model consent form, when appropriate. If the multicenter clinical investigation has a central IRB cooperating with local IRBs or human research protection offices, the revisions should be forwarded to the central IRB.67 Alternatively, local issues may be addressed by the central IRB depending on the review agreement between the local IRB(s) and central IRB. Note that for medicaldevice studies that require submission of an IDE application, such changes must be submitted to FDA.68\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 812.35(a).\n\nFootnote 69: The 2018 Common Rule requires that any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States, unless the research is not subject to the provision (45 CFR 46.114(b)). The compliance date for research subject to this provision was January 20, 2020. On September 28, 2022, FDA issued a proposed rule to harmonize with this requirement to the extent practicable and consistent with statutory provisions (see https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/28/2022-21089/institutional-review-boards-cooperative-research). The January 19, 2017, final rule revising the Common Rule is available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/finalized-revisions-common-rule/index.html.\n\n.4.2 Sponsor Personnel\n\nSponsor personnel (usually a field engineer) may be present during the procedure and/or follow-up visits for some medical device studies. These individuals may provide technical support and/or record study-related information for the test article. If sponsor personnel will be present during the procedure or follow-up, or if the activities of the sponsor personnel directly affect the subject, those activities should also be described in the informed consent form.70\n\nFootnote 70: See “Guidance for Industry: Investigator Responsibilities – Protecting the Rights, Safety, and Welfare of Study Subjects,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/investigator-responsibilities-protecting-rights-safety-and-welfare-study-subjects.\n\nThe FDA\n\nFDA\'s regulations for drug (including biologic) and device investigations have different requirements for the submission of informed consent materials (see sections IV.D.1, ""Investigational New Drugs and Biologics,"" and IV.D.2, ""Investigational Medical Devices,"" for additional information). Sponsors are not required to submit informed consent materials to FDA for all clinical investigations (see, for example, 21 CFR 312.2(b) and 21 CFR 812.2(b) and (c)); however, FDA may require that they be submitted in some cases as discussed below.\n\nGenerally, when informed consent materials are submitted, FDA reviewers assess the adequacy of the consent form by considering its communication of reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject and other elements required by 21 CFR 50.25. In some situations, FDA may find a consent form to be misleading, inaccurate, or incomplete in a way that would make informed consent inadequate and noncompliant with 21 CFR part 50. In these cases, FDA may require that specific revisions be made to address the concern(s) before the clinical investigation can proceed (21 CFR 312.42 and 812.30).\n\nFDA\'s review of the consent form as part of an IND or IDE application submission does not substitute for the responsibility or authority of the IRB to review and approve the consent form and consent process as a condition for the clinical investigation to begin (21 CFR 56.103(a)). IRBs are responsible for ensuring the adequacy of the information in the consent form and may require modification as appropriate (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b)).\n\nBelow are specific areas FDA considers in its review of the consent form:\n\nvi.2.1 Investigational New Drugs and Biologics71\n\nFootnote 71: For the purposes of this document, unless otherwise specified, all references to “drugs” or “drug products” include human drug products and biological products that are also drugs.\n\nThe IND regulations (21 CFR part 312) do not specifically require submission to FDA of the consent form with the IND. However, if FDA determines that review of the consent form is necessary to make the determination of whether the clinical investigation may safely proceed, the Agency will request that the sponsor submit the consent form for review under 21 CFR 312.23(a)(11).\n\nAs a general matter, FDA will review the informed consent form for treatment INDs and treatment protocols (21 CFR part 312, subpart I) and INDs for studies conducted under the Exception From Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research (21 CFR 50.24) for consistency with 21 CFR 50.25 (see 21 CFR 50.24(a)(6)).\n\nFor other clinical investigations of drugs, FDA often considers the following factors in determining whether to require submission and review of the consent form:\n\nNonclinical studies submitted in support of the first administration of a drug in humans have identified an unusual toxicity.\n\nUnusual known toxicity is associated with the investigational drug, the drug class to which the drug belongs, or with a different drug with characteristics similar to those of the study drug.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:46]\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nThis section of the guidance document is intended to provide answers to frequently asked questions about FDA\'s regulations for the protection of human subjects. The numbers assigned to the questions are intended for ease of reference and do not represent the frequency with which these questions are asked.\n\niv.4.1 What are some considerations for enrolling a child?2 into a clinical investigation?\n\nFDA regulations provide additional safeguards for children enrolled in clinical investigations, as described in 21 CFR part 50, subpart D.73 If a child is to be enrolled in a clinical investigation, parental or guardian permission must be obtained in accordance with the requirements for informed consent in 21 CFR part 50 (21 CFR 50.55(e))74 and be documented in accordance with 21 CFR 50.27 (21 CFR 50.55(f)). When appropriate, the assent of the child also must be obtained (see 21 CFR 50.55(a)-(d)). As with informed consent for adult subjects, the exceptions to informed consent requirements described in section III.A.1, ""Exceptions to Informed Consent"", apply to research involving children.\n\nFootnote 72: For purposes of 21 CFR part 50, the term children means “persons who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures involved in clinical investigations, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the clinical investigation will be conducted.” See 21 CFR 50.3(o).\n\nFootnote 73: FDA promulgated 21 CFR part 50, subpart D, “Additional Safeguards for Children in Clinical Investigations,” as an interim rule in April 2001 (see 66 FR 20589, April 24, 2001; https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2001-04-24/pdf/01-10008.pdf), and issued a final rule in February 2013 (see 78 FR 12937, February 26, 2013; https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2013-02-26/pdf/2013-04387.pdf).\n\nThe IRB may determine that the permission of one parent is sufficient for clinical investigations involving no greater than minimal risk to children to be conducted under 21 CFR 50.51, or clinical investigations involving greater than minimal risk to children but presenting the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects in accordance with 21 CFR 50.52 (21 CFR 50.55(e)(1)).\n\nFor clinical investigations to be conducted in accordance with either 21 CFR 50.53 or 21 CFR 50.54,75 where permission is to be obtained from parents, the permission of both parents is required unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child (21 CFR 50.55(e)(2)).76\n\nFootnote 76: For additional discussion on what is meant by “not reasonably available,” see the Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections (SACHRP) recommendations at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/sachrp-committee/recommendations/attachment-d-november-13-2018/indes.html.\n\nThe general requirements for informed consent, found in 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 50.25 and 21 CFR 50.27, apply to parental permission (21 CFR 50.55(e)-(f)). When obtaining parental permission, in the event the parents of a child do not understand English, the parental permission must be obtained and documented in language that is understandable to the parents (21 CFR 50.20). The child who will be participating in the research should not be used as an interpreter for the parent, even if the child is fluent in English and may be able to assent. Similarly, if child assent is required, the information given to the child should be in language that is understandable to the child.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors']","[""For applicable clinical trials initiated on or after March 7, 2012, informed consent documents must be in compliance with the new requirement in 21 CFR SS 50.25(c) and include a specific statement that refers to the trial's description on\n\nwww.ClinicalTrials.gov.""]",0.99999999998,0.3333333333333333

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA\n\nor the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the\n\napplicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff\n\nresponsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes FDA\'s interpretation of the provision of the Biologic\'s Price Competition\n\nand Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) under which an application for a biological product\n\napproved under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21\n\nU.S.C. 355) as of March 23, 2020, will be deemed to be a license for the biological product\n\nunder section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262) on March 23, 2020. Specifically, this guidance describes FDA\'s interpretation of the ""deemed to be a license""\n\nprovision in section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act for biological products that are approved under\n\nsection 505 of the FD&C Act as of March 23, 2020 (the transition date). This guidance also\n\nprovides recommendations to sponsors of proposed protein products intended for submission in\n\nan application that may not receive final approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or\n\nbefore March 23, 2020, to facilitate alignment of product development plans with FDA\'s\n\ninterpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.\n\nAlthough the majority of therapeutic biological products have been licensed under section 351 of\n\nthe PHS Act, some protein products historically have been approved under section 505 of the\n\nFD&C Act (see the Appendix to this guidance for examples of such products). On March 23,\n\n2010, the BPCI Act was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n\n(Public Law 111-148). The BPCI Act clarified the statutory authority under which certain\n\nprotein products will be regulated by amending the definition of a ""biological product""2 in\n\nsection 351(i) of the PHS Act to include a ""protein (except any chemically synthesizedpolypeptide),""3 and describing procedures for submission of a marketing application for certain biological products.\n\nFootnote 3: FDA has described its interpretation of the statutory terms “protein” and “chemically synthesized polypeptide” in the amended definition of “biological product” in guidance. See draft guidance for industry New and Revised Draft Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act (Revision 2). When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic. FDA’s guidances for industry are available on the FDA Drugs guidance web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs web guidance page. In addition, in the Federal Register of December 12, 2018, FDA also has issued a proposed rule to amend its regulation that defines “biological product” to incorporate changes made by the BPCI Act, and to provide its interpretation of the statutory terms “protein” and “chemically synthesized polypeptide.” When final, this regulation will codify FDA’s interpretation of these terms.\n\nThe BPCI Act requires that a marketing application for a ""biological product"" (that previously could have been submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act) must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act; this requirement is subject to certain exceptions during a 10-year transition period ending on March 23, 2020 (see section 7002(e)(1)-(3) and (e)(5) of the BPCI Act and section II of this guidance). On March 23, 2020 (i.e., the transition date), an approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act (see section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act). This guidance sets forth FDA\'s current interpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nBPCI Act\n\nThe BPCI Act amended the PHS Act and other statutes to create an abbreviated licensure pathway in section 351(k) of the PHS Act for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product (see sections 7001 through 7003 of the BPCI Act). The objectives of the BPCI Act are conceptually similar to those of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417) (commonly referred to as the ""Hatch-Waxman Amendments""), which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of drug products under section 505(b)(2) and 505(j) of the FD&C Act. An abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products can present challenges given the scientific and technical complexities that may be associated with the generally larger and typically more complex structure of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured. Most biological products are produced in a living system such as a microorganism, or plant or animal cells, whereas small molecule drugs are typically manufactured through chemical synthesis.\n\nSection 351(k) of the PHS Act, added by the BPCI Act, sets forth, among other things, the requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product and an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product. Section 351(i) defines ""biosimilarity"" to mean that ""the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components"" and that ""there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product"" (section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act). A 351(k) application must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based upon data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies, unless FDA determines, in its discretion, that certain studies are unnecessary in a 351(k) application (see section 351(k)(2) of the PHS Act). To meet the standard for ""interchangeability,"" an applicant must provide sufficient information to demonstrate biosimilarity, and also to demonstrate that the biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, if the biological product is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch (see section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act). Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nThe BPCI Act also includes, among other provisions:\n\nA 12-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which approval of a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be made effective (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nA 4-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be submitted (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 4: See 21 CFR 201.100 and 201.56(a)(1).\n\nFootnote 5: The standard for licensure of a biological product as potent under section 351(a) of the PHS Act has long been interpreted to include effectiveness (see 21 CFR 600.3(s) and the guidance for industry Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nFootnote 6: In this guidance, we use the terms safety and effectiveness and safety, purity, and potency interchangeably in the discussions pertaining to biosimilar products.\n\nIII General principles for draft labeling of proposed biosimilar products (biosimilar product labeling)\n\nThe goal of a biosimilar product development program is to demonstrate biosimilarity between the proposed product and the reference product -- not to independently establish safety and effectiveness of the proposed product. A demonstration of biosimilarity means, among other things, that FDA has determined that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.7 Thus, FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness for the reference product, as reflected in its FDA-approved prescribing information, may be relied upon to provide health care providers with the essential scientific information needed to facilitate prescribing decisions for the proposed biosimilar product's labeled conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)). Accordingly, FDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, such as those described in sections V and VI of this guidance.8\n\nFootnote 7: Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act.\n\nInformation and data from a clinical study of a proposed biosimilar product should be described in its labeling only when necessary to inform safe and effective use by a health care provider. As a general matter, it is FDA's view that biosimilar product labeling should not include a description of or data from clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.9 Generally, clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarityare not designed to support an independent demonstration of safety or effectiveness of the proposed biosimilar product and thus would generally not be expected to facilitate an understanding of product safety and effectiveness. For example, the endpoints used in a clinical study conducted to support a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences may not be the same endpoints evaluated to support licensure of the reference product and thus may not inform prescribing decisions regarding safety and effectiveness. Similarly, the patient population may differ from the patient population studied in the clinical trials that supported the determination of safety and effectiveness of the reference product. For example, subjects in a study conducted to support a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product may be healthy volunteers, or the condition of use studied may be one for which the reference product is not licensed or for which the applicant of the biosimilar product is not seeking licensure but for which sufficient data indicate that the population or condition of use is adequately sensitive to detect clinically meaningful differences between the products, should they exist.\n\nBecause clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarity generally are not designed to support an independent demonstration of safety or effectiveness, such studies may be misinterpreted in the context of drug labeling, resulting in an inaccurate understanding of the risk-benefit profile of the biosimilar product. Therefore, studies conducted to support biosimilarity generally should not be included in biosimilar product labeling. Biosimilar product labeling should incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, including clinical data that supported FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness of the reference product.\n\nAs required under 21 CFR 201.56(c)(1), biosimilar product labeling must meet the content and format requirements of the physician labeling rule (PLR) as described in 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57, regardless of the format of the reference product labeling.10 In addition, biosimilar product labeling must meet the content and format requirements of the pregnancy and lactation labeling final rule (PLLR) as described in 21 CFR 201.57(c)(9)(i) through (iii), regardless of whether the reference product must meet these requirements.11\n\nFootnote 10: See the final rule “Requirements on Content and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products” (71 FR 3922, January 24, 2006). This rule is commonly referred to as the physician labeling rule because it addresses prescription drug labeling that is used by prescribing physicians and other health care providers. Also see additional labeling guidances at https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm.\n\nFootnote 11: See the final rule “Content and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products; Requirements for Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling” (79 FR 72064, December 4, 2014). The final rule describes the implementation schedule for applications submitted on or after the effective date of the rule, applications pending at the time the rule became effective, and applications approved before the rule became effective (79 FR 72064 at 72095–96).\n\nIV Specific Recommendations on Content of Biosimilar Product Labeling\n\nFDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, as explained in sections V and VI of this guidance. The relevant data and information from the reference product labeling that should be incorporated into the biosimilar product labeling will depend on whether the applicant is seeking licensure for all conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)) or fewer than all conditions of use of the reference product for the biosimilar product.12\n\nFootnote 12: A biosimilar product applicant generally may seek licensure for fewer than all conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed. The 351(k) application must include information demonstrating that the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling submitted for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously licensed for the reference product (see section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act).\n\nIn sections of the biosimilar product labeling that are based on the reference product labeling, it is anticipated that the text will be similar to the corresponding text in the reference product labeling. Text based on the reference product labeling need not be identical to the reference product labeling and should reflect currently available information necessary for the safe and effective use of the biosimilar product. Certain differences between the biosimilar and reference product labeling may be appropriate. For example, biosimilar product labeling conforming to PLR and/or PLLR may differ from reference product labeling because the reference product labeling may not be required to conform to those requirements at the time of licensure of the biosimilar product. In addition, biosimilar product labeling may include information specific to the biosimilar product that is necessary to inform safe and effective use of the product, including administration, preparation, storage, or safety information. This information may differ from that of the reference product labeling when it reflects differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product that do not preclude licensure of the biosimilar product.\n\nAppendix A Approaches to Product Identification\n\nIn biosimilar product labeling, the approach to product identification depends on the context of the information being presented. FDA acknowledges that there will be variations on the general concepts outlined in this section because the approach to product identification will depend on the specific statements. The illustrative examples in this section use a fictional reference product JUNEXANT (replicamab-hyxf) and a fictional biosimilar product NEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen use of the biosimilar product name is recommended:\n\nThe biosimilar product name should be used in labeling text that is specific to the biosimilar product or that refers solely to the biosimilar product. If a biosimilar product has a proprietary name, the proprietary name (e.g., NEXSYMEO) should be used in the appropriate sections. However, if a proprietary name is not available, or if referring to the drug substance (as discussed below), the biosimilar product's proper name (e.g., replicamab-cznm) should be used.13\n\nFootnote 13: The proper name is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (see section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)).\n\nThe biosimilar product's proprietary name (or, if a proprietary name is not available, the biosimilar product's proper name) should be used in circumstances such as the following:\n\nIn sections where the information described is specific to the biosimilar product -- This includes, but is not limited to, the following sections: INDICATIONS AND USAGE, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, DESCRIPTION, and HOW SUPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING.\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: III Scope\n\nThis guidance applies to certain biological products licensed under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act). This guidance applies to all manufacturing locations, including contract locations. Licensed biological products that are within the scope of this guidance include:\n\nVaccines;\n\nAllergenic products;\n\nPlasma-derived products e.g., albumin, immunoglobulins, clotting factors, fibrin sealants, proteinase inhibitors, etc.); and their recombinant analogs;\n\nAntitoxins, antivenins, and venoms;\n\nNaturally-derived (i.e., not recombinant) protein products (e.g., naturally-derived enzymes and certain toxins);\n\nCellular and gene therapy products;3 Footnote 3: For purposes of this guidance, the term “gene therapy products” includes cell-based gene therapies. Cellular therapy products include tissue-engineered products regulated under section 351 of the PHS Act.\n\nIn vitro diagnostics (IVDs) regulated under the PHS Act (e.g., blood donor screening assays, etc.); and\n\nOther biological products licensed under the PHS Act subject to exceptions listed below.\n\nThis guidance also applies to combination products licensed under a BLA, unless the biological product constituent part is a specified biological product described in 21 CFR 601.2(a) or is otherwise outside the scope of this guidance, as described below. Biological products that are not within the scope of this guidance include:\n\nWhole Blood, blood components (including Source Plasma) and Source Leukocytes (Ref. 4);\n\nSpecified biological products described in 21 CFR 601.2(a);4 and\n\nBiosimilar and interchangeable products subject to licensure under section 351(k) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)).\n\nThis guidance also does not apply to human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) regulated solely under section 361 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 264) and the regulations in 21 CFR Part 1271.\n\nThis guidance does not apply to changes to an applicant's name. Such submissions are handled separately as product correspondence, in accordance with established procedures. For example, see CBER's Standard Operating Policy and Procedure (SOPP) 8403: Issuance and Reissuance of Licenses for Biological Products for further information on name changes.5\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSome manufacturing changes discussed in this guidance may also require revision of the approved labeling (Ref. [6]). Such changes are outside the scope of this guidance. In general, under 21 CFR 601.12(f):\n\nLabeling changes requiring supplement submission and FDA approval before distribution of the product with the labeling change include any change in the package insert, package label, or container label, including information required under 21 CFR 201.57(a), or, if applicable a Medication Guide required under 21 CFR Part 208, except those described in 21 CFR 601.12(f)(2) and [3];6 Footnote 6: 21 CFR 601.12(f)(1). See also FDA guidance on “The ‘Deemed To Be a License’ Provision of the BPCI Act: Questions and Answers” (March 2020), available at https://www.fda.gov/media/119274/download/ (recommending submission of a prior approval supplement for BLA-specific labeling changes for deemed BLAs). [7] 21 CFR 601.12(f)(2). [8] 21 CFR 601.12(f)(3).\n\nLabeling changes that require supplement submission and FDA approval, but which do not require FDA approval of the supplement before the product with the labeling change may be distributed, include certain safety-related labeling changes to the package insert, package label, or container label to reflect newly acquired information, or any other labeling change that FDA specifically requests to be submitted in a changes being effected supplement under 21 CFR 601.12(f)(2)(i)(E);7 Footnote 7: 21 CFR 601.12(f)(2).\n\nLabeling changes requiring submission in an annual report include changes to any final printed package insert, package label, container label, or Medication Guide required under 21 CFR Part 208 include, among other things, editorial or similar minor changes and changes in the information on how the product is supplied that does not involve a change in the dosage strength or dosage form.8 Footnote 8: 21 CFR 601.12(f)(3).\n\nFor manufacturing changes that impact labeling, reporting classification is generally commensurate with the risks of the manufacturing change. If the reporting classification recommendations are unclear for submissions that include both manufacturing and labeling changes, license holders are advised to consult with the appropriate FDA Review Division.\n\nDuring the finalization of this FDA guidance, the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) published Q12 Technical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmaceutical Product Lifecycle Management (see also the associated Annex) (Ref. [7]). The ICH Q12 guidance describes certainterminologies and concepts, including Established Conditions,9 that may impact how an applicant reports post-approval changes. The ICH Q12 guidance, should be used by applicants in concert with any other applicable FDA guidance to report post-approval changes to the Agency when such reporting is required by the statute and regulation.\n\nFootnote 9: Established Conditions are defined by the FDA as the description of the product, manufacturing process, facilities and equipment, and elements of the associated control strategy, as defined in an application, that assure process performance and quality of an approved product, and that can be specifically identified and proposed by the sponsor and approved as part of a BLA. Changes to the established conditions must be reported to FDA (21 CFR 601.12).\n\nIV Reporting Changes\n\nReporting Categories\n\nUnder 21 CFR 601.12, each post-approval change in the product, production process, quality controls, equipment, facilities, responsible personnel, or labeling established in the approved BLA must be reported using the submission type associated with one of the three tier-based reporting categories depending upon the potential (i.e., risk) of the change to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product (i.e., a substantial potential, moderate potential, or minimal potential). The reporting categories in this regulatory provision also specify when the product made using the change can be distributed. The submission types and associated reporting categories are as follows:\n\nPrior Approval Supplement (PAS) - Changes that have a substantial potential to have an adverse effect on product quality (i.e., major changes) require an applicant to report the change to the FDA in a supplement to the approved BLA. A PAS must be approved by the FDA prior to distribution of the product manufactured using the change (21 CFR 601.12(b)).\n\nChanges Being Effected in 30 Days/Changes Being Effected Supplements10 (CBE30/CBE) - Changes that have a moderate potential to have an adverse effect on product quality (i.e., moderate changes) require an applicant to report the change to the FDA in a supplement at least 30 days prior to distribution of the product made using the change (21 CFR 601.12(c)). In certain circumstances, the FDA may determine that, based on the Agency's experience with a particular type of moderate change, the supplement for such a change is complete and provides the proper information and particular assurances that the change has been appropriately submitted. The product made using such a change may be distributed immediately upon receipt of the supplement by the FDA (21 CFR 601.12(c)(5)). These circumstances may include substantial similarity with a type of change that ordinarily involves a CBE supplement or a situation in which the applicant presents evidence that the change has been validated in accordance with an approved comparability protocol (CP) under 21 CFR 601.12(c) and 21 CFR 601.12(e).\n\nFootnote 10: This paragraph refers to CBE supplements submitted under 21 CFR 601.12(c), and does not refer to CBE supplements for certain types of labeling changes submitted under 21 CFR 601.12(f)(2).\n\nAnnual Report (AR) - Changes that have a minimal potential to have an adverse effect on product quality (i.e., minor changes) shall be documented by the applicant in an annual report (21 CFR 601.12(d)).\n\nAssessing and Implementing Manufacturing Changes\n\nApplicant Assessment and Implementation of Change\n\nThe potential for a change to impact product quality as it may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product should be thoroughly assessed and documented. The information and data to demonstrate comparability of the product pre- and post- change can include a combination of testing, validation studies, and non-clinical or clinical studies as necessary to evaluate potential effects of the change. Knowledge and experience accumulated during development and commercial manufacturing regarding how product performance relates to material attributes and process parameters is useful in assessing the impact of manufacturing changes (Ref. 8).\n\nWhen assessing the impact of a change on product quality, some or all of the following considerations should be taken into account by the applicant:\n\nPrior knowledge (e.g., established chemical and biological engineering principles; published, peer-reviewed scientific and technical literature; and applied manufacturing experience) (Ref. 9);\n\nDevelopment and manufacturing of the drug substance and drug product11 (Ref. 10); Footnote 11: For the purposes of this document, “Drug Substance” also refers to “In vitro Substance.”\n\nProcess validation activities and experience gained during commercial manufacture;\n\nQuality risk management activities;\n\nStudies conducted at less than commercial scale to gain an increased understanding of the effects of the change on product quality and process consistency; and\n\nCumulative impact of multiple related changes.\n--------------------\nContext title: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved Application- Certain Biological Products Guidance for Industry""

The collections of information related to the submission of a BLA under section 351(k) of the PHS Act have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0719, and the collections of information in 21 CFR part 601 have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0338.\n\nAn Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The information collection provisions in this guidance, including resulting proposed modifications to the information collections approved under OMB control number 0910-0338, have been submitted to OMB for review as required by section 3507(d) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and are not for current implementation.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 49: See the draft guidance for industry Comparative Analyses and Related Comparative Use Human Factors Studies for a Drug-Device Combination Product Submitted in an ANDA (January 2017). When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nAs a general matter, in assessing the therapeutic equivalence of a proposed generic drug-device combination product, FDA intends to consider whether the proposed generic product can be expected to have the same clinical effect and safety profile as the RLD when administered to patients under the conditions specified in the labeling.50 While FDA does not expect the proposed generic combination product and its RLD to be identical in all respects, any differences identified between a proposed generic combination product and its RLD should be adequately analyzed, scientifically justified, and otherwise not preclude approval under an ANDA. The extent to which differences between the proposed generic combination product and the RLD affect the approximability of the ANDA product will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nFootnote 50: See 21 CFR 314.3. See also the Orange Book, preface to the 41({}^{\\text{a}}) edition, at page vii.\n\nAppendix C Biologic-Led Combination Products\n\nBiologic-led combination products are licensed through one of the two BLA pathways under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), either under a section 351(a) BLA (i.e.,a stand-alone BLA) or under a section 351(k) BLA for a biosimilar or interchangeable biological product.51\n\nFootnote 52: Section 351(a)(2)(C) of the PHS Act.\n\n3.2.1 Biologics License Applications (BLAs) Submitted Under Section 351(a)\n\nTo be licensed, a biological product must be shown to be safe, pure, and potent, and the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed, or held must meet standards designed to ensure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure, and potent.52 A BLA submitted under section 351(a) of the PHS Act is a stand-alone application in that all of the information and data necessary to demonstrate that these requirements are met are included in the application. This pathway is generally appropriate for biologic-led combination products other than products that are proposed to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, a previously licensed biological product.53\n\nFootnote 52: See footnote 17.\n\nFor example, this pathway would be appropriate for the following products when the sponsor is not seeking to rely on FDA\'s license of another biological product in order to demonstrate biosimilarity to, or interchangeability with, such product:\n\na gene therapy combined with a specialized delivery catheter\n\na vaccine in a pre-filled syringe\n\na protein product in an autoinjector\n\n_BLAs for Biosimilar and Interchangeable Biological Products Submitted Under Section 351(k)_Section 351(k) of the PHS Act sets forth the requirements for the licensure of biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product.54 Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act defines biosimilarity to mean that the product ""is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components"" and that ""there are no clinically meaningful differences"" between the two products with respect to safety, purity, and potency. To meet the interchangeability standard, an applicant must show that its product ""is biosimilar to the reference product,"" and must further show that the product ""can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient"" and that, for a product that is administered more than once to an individual, ""the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the [two products] is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.""55 Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing healthcare provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nFDA has published guidance indicating the availability of this abbreviated pathway for combination products, as well as considerations related to demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability of such products. With respect to demonstrating biosimilarity, Q.I.4 of the guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act (Biosimilars Q&A Guidance) states that some design differences in the delivery device used with the proposed biosimilar product may be permissible, and explains that it may be possible to obtain licensure of a proposed biosimilar product in a pre-filled syringe or auto-injector, for example, even though the reference product is a biological product licensed in a vial presentation, provided that the proposed biosimilar product meets the statutory standard for biosimilarity.\n\nThe Biosimilars Q&A Guidance also explains that licensure under section 351(k) would not be possible if design difference in a delivery device results in any of the following:\n\nA clinically meaningful difference between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency;\n\nA different route of administration;\n\nA condition of use (e.g., indication, dosing regimen) for which the reference product has not been previously approved; or\n\nA proposed biosimilar product that otherwise does not meet the standard for biosimilarity.\n\nSee Biosimilars Q&A Guidance for considerations for seeking licensure of a combination product as biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, a reference product.\n\nAnnex\n\nAnalysis of Pathway Availability for Device-Led Combination Products - Illustrative Examples\n\nTo date, questions regarding pathway availability for combination products have focused most often on device-led combination products. Accordingly, we have included this annex to address common questions utilizing the analyses discussed in section IV.1. The outcomes are also consistent with the expectations discussed in section III, that the application enable evaluation substantially similar to that which would occur if the constituent parts were reviewed under separate applications for the use.\n\nThese hypothetical examples are not intended to reflect a complete analysis of the premarket review considerations that need to be addressed for the types of products discussed in the examples or other types of combination products. In addition, specific products may raise distinct issues that are not taken into account in the examples below. If manufacturers have specific questions relating to their particular products, the Agency recommends that they contact the lead center for the product or OCP, as needed, for assistance.\n\nFor the purposes of the illustrative examples below, it is assumed that the sponsor submitted a 510(k) to CDRH for the combination product.\n\nExample 1: Antimicrobial coating added for the first time to a previously classified device type\n\nPredicate Product:\n\nA previously classified hypothetical class II device (product has no drug or biological product constituent part), which is subject to 510(k) requirements (e.g., an externally-communicating device intended to be implanted in the abdominal cavity for drainage of excessive fluids).\n\nDrug Constituent Part:\n\nA hypothetical antimicrobial coating (Antimicrobial A) that contains the same active ingredient that is in an NDA drug product approved for intravenous administration that has a well-established and understood risk profile as an antimicrobial indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. The sponsor has provided FDA documentation of a right of reference to the NDA.56\n\nFootnote 56: Alternatively, the sponsor could rely on FDA’s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for the NDA approved antimicrobial product, provided all of the requirements of 503(g)(5)(A) and (C) are satisfied and it is scientifically justified. FDA may then consider such findings in its review of a device premarket submission.\n\nNew Product:\n\nThe sponsor proposes to add an antimicrobial coating (Antimicrobial A) to the predicate product described above, making a single-entity combination product (hereinafter referred to as Product A). The purpose of adding the antimicrobial to this device is to prevent infections associated with the surgical procedure and continued use of the product. The sponsor requests the product be considered substantially equivalent to the previously cleared uncoated version of the device. An antimicrobial drug product has never been combined with this devicetype. To make a substantial equivalence determination, the following questions are generally asked:\n\nIs the predicate product legally marketed? Yes.\n\nDoes the predicate product have the same intended use? While both the predicate and the new combination product are intended to drain excessive fluid from the abdominal cavity, the addition of the proposed drug constituent part and the indication of preventing infection are not applicable to the predicate product. These changes raise different questions of safety and effectiveness, precluding a meaningful comparison with the predicate product.57 Therefore, these changes in indications for use of the product and of adding the constituent part would result in a new intended use, and the product would be found not substantially equivalent (NSE). Also, the addition of Antimicrobial A is a different technological characteristic that would raise different questions of safety and effectiveness.\n\nFootnote 57: See 21 CFR 807.92(a)(5) and the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications [510(k)].\n--------------------\nContext title: Principles of Premarket Pathways for Combination Products Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: An application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that ""the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product"" based upon data derived from:11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(3) of the PHS Act.\n\nAnalytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;\n\nAnimal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and\n\nA clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.\n\nThe Agency has the discretion to determine that an element described above is unnecessary in a 351(k) application.12 FDA advises sponsors intending to develop biosimilar products to meet with FDA to present their product development plans and establish a schedule of milestones that will serve as landmarks for future discussions with the Agency. FDA anticipates that early discussions with FDA about product development plans and about approaches to providing adequate scientific justifications will facilitate biosimilar development.13\n\nFootnote 12: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See the draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants for a detailed discussion. When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\n4 Complexities of Protein Products\n\nA sponsor should consider the complexities of protein products and related scientific issues when designing a development program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.\n\nNature of Protein Products and Related Scientific Considerations\n\nUnlike small molecule drugs, whose structure can usually be completely defined and entirely reproduced, proteins are typically more complex and are unlikely to be shown to be structurally identical to a reference product. Many potential differences in protein structure can arise. Because even minor structural differences (including certain changes in glycosylation patterns) can significantly affect a protein\'s safety and/or effectiveness, it is important to evaluate these differences.\n\nIn general, proteins can differ in at least three ways: (1) primary amino acid sequence; (2) modification to amino acids, such as sugar moieties (glycosylation) or other side chains; and (3) higher order structure (protein folding and protein-protein interactions). Modifications to amino acids may lead to heterogeneity and can be difficult to control. Protein modifications and higher order structure can be affected by formulation and environmental conditions, including light, temperature, moisture, packaging materials, container closure systems, and delivery device materials. Additionally, process- as well as product-related impurities may increase the likelihood and/or the severity of an immune response to a protein product, and certain excipients may limit the ability to characterize the protein product.\n\nAdvances in analytical sciences enable some protein products to be extensively characterized with respect to their physicochemical and biological properties, such as higher order structures and functional characteristics. These analytical methodologies have increasingly improved the ability to identify and characterize not only the drug substance of a protein product but also excipients and product- and process-related impurities.\n\nDespite such significant improvements in analytical techniques, however, current analytical methodology may not be able to detect all relevant structural and functional differences between two protein products. In addition, there may be incomplete understanding of the relationship between a product\'s structural attributes and its clinical performance. Thus, as set forth in the PHS Act, data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies are required to demonstrate biosimilarity unless FDA determines an element unnecessary.14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nManufacturing Process Considerations\n\nDifferent manufacturing processes may alter a protein product in a way that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the product. For example, differences in biological systems used to manufacture a protein product may cause different posttranslational modifications, which in turn may affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the product. Thus, when the manufacturing process for a marketed protein product is changed, the application holder must assess the effects of the change and demonstrate--through appropriate analytical testing, functional assays, and/or in some cases animal and/or clinical studies--that the change does not have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they relate to the safety oreffectiveness of the product.15 The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process (ICH Q5E) describes scientific principles in the comparability assessment for manufacturing changes.\n\nFootnote 15: See 21 CFR 601.12 and 21 CFR 314.70 for regulatory requirements for changes (including manufacturing changes) made to a licensed biologics license application (BLA) and an approved NDA, respectively.\n\nDemonstrating that a proposed product is biosimilar to a reference product typically will be more complex than assessing the comparability of a product before and after manufacturing changes made by the same manufacturer. This is because a manufacturer that modifies its own manufacturing process has extensive knowledge and information about the product and the existing process, including established controls and acceptance parameters. By contrast, the manufacturer of a proposed product is likely to have a different manufacturing process (e.g., different cell line, raw materials, equipment, processes, process controls, and acceptance criteria) from that of the reference product and no direct knowledge of the manufacturing process for the reference product. Therefore, even though some of the scientific principles described in ICH Q5E may also apply in the demonstration of biosimilarity, in general, FDA anticipates that more data and information will be needed to establish biosimilarity than would be needed to establish that a manufacturer\'s post-manufacturing change product is comparable to the pre-manufacturing change product.\n\nV U.S.-LICENSED Reference Product and Other Comparators\n\nTo obtain licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act, a sponsor must demonstrate that the proposed product is biosimilar to a single reference product that previously has been licensed by FDA.16 In general, a sponsor needs to provide information to demonstrate biosimilarity based on data directly comparing the proposed product with the reference product. As a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical PK study and, if appropriate, at least one PD study, intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity for purposes of section 351(k) of the PHS Act must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed. However, a sponsor may seek to use data derived from animal or clinical studies comparing a proposed product with a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act. In such a case, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.17 Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program their plans to provide an adequate scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of such justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFootnote 16: Sections 7002(a)(2) and (b)(3) of the Affordable Care Act, adding sections 351(k), 351(i)(2), and 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act.\n\nVI Approaches to developing and assessing evidence to demonstrate biosimilarity\n\nFDA recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to develop the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity. FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence provided by a sponsor when the Agency evaluates the sponsor\'s demonstration of biosimilarity, consistent with a longstanding Agency approach to evaluating scientific evidence.18\n\nFootnote 18: See footnote 4.\n\nUsing a Stepwise Approach to Demonstrate Biosimilarity\n--------------------\nContext title: Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product']","['The key differences for the prescribing information for a biological product regulated under the PHS Act are that the labeling must include the proper name of the biological product, including any appropriate descriptors (see 21 CFR 201.57(a)(2)), and the manufacturer name, address, and license number (see 21 CFR 610.60(a)(2) and 610.61(b)). Conforming revisions also would need to be made to FDA-approved patientlabeling.

The blended wet formulation has a water content of 50% (i.e., a solids content of 50%). The product goes through a drying step. The finished product has a water content of 10% (i.e., a solids content of 90%) and a serving size of 40 g.\n\nStep 1: The amount of total sugars contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving.\n\nBecause there is water loss during manufacturing, in this method we calculate the amount of wet formulation needed to yield 40 g serving size finished product.\n\nSolids content in the finished product g = 40 x 90% = 36 g.\n\nBecause the solids prior to drying is 50% (moisture = 50%), the starting wet formulation prior to drying that yielded the 40 g serving size finished product is 72 g (36 g / 50%).\n\nThe amount of total sugar contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving (based on wet formulation weight percentage) = 72 g (\\times) 20% (\\times) 11.5% = 1.656 g.\n\nStep 2: The water content of the finished product = weight per serving (\\times)moisture content = 40 g (\\times) 10% = 4 g.\n\nStep 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = (1.656 g/ 4 g) (\\times) 100 = 41.4%.\n\nSince 41.4% is greater than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength apple juice (11.5 Brix value), you would need to calculate the amount of sugars from the apple juice ingredient (41.4% sugar) that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent apple (11.5% sugar). Please note that, in this hypothetical example, even though the starting juice is a single strength juice, because of the concentration during processing, the amount of added sugars from the apple juice is not zero. You may use the method described in Q&A 11 or other alternative methods to determine the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient.\n\n13. The regulation says in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii) that added sugars are a ""statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving, except that label declaration of added sugars content is not required for products that contain less than 1 gram of added sugars in a serving if no claims are made about sweeteners, sugars, added sugars, or sugar alcohol content."" What does FDA consider to be a ""sweetener?"" Do sweeteners include sugar alcohols and other low-calorie sweeteners?\n\nWe have used the term ""sweetener"" to refer to ingredients that provide sweetness to a food regardless of whether they provide calories (43 FR 43248, September 22, 1978; 56 FR 60437 to 60438, November 27, 1991; and 58 FR 2326 to 2327, January 6, 1993). We have not changed our approach to the use of this term. Therefore, we consider both caloric and non-caloric sweeteners, including sugar alcohols, to be sweeteners for the purposes of this regulation.\n\nSome ingredients contain mono- and disaccharides (DP1 and DP2 (one and two degrees of polymerization)) that are created through processes such as hydrolysis. Do the mono- and disaccharide portions of ingredients that are created through hydrolysis need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33832), we said that, other than sugar syrup types of products where the sugars are specifically and purposely produced via hydrolysis, we do not have information suggesting that sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates results in significant increase in the sugar content of foods. We did not receive any comments or other information suggesting that these sugars should be captured under the added sugars declaration, and we did not include sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis in our definition of added sugars (id.). Therefore, such sugars would not be declared as added sugars on the label. We also explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, since hydrolysis was purposely used by the manufacturer to increase the sugar content of the product (id.).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33835), we also said that, in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Report (2015 DGAC Report).\n\nManufacturers may purposely employ methods, such as hydrolysis, for a number of reasons, some of which result in an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides with DP1 and DP2. Ingredients such as maltodextrin and corn syrup solids are hydrolyzed to achieve various degrees of dextrose equivalence (DE). The higher the DE, the lower the degree of polymerization, and the sweeter the ingredient becomes. Maltodext (21 CFR 184.1444) are ingredients with a DE less than 20, and corn syrup (21 CFR 168.120, 168.121, and 184.1865) are ingredients with a DE of 20 or higher. Depending on the manufacturing process, different maltodextrin and corn syrup will have different DE and different amounts of mono- and disaccharides. Although maltodext are not used primarily for sweetening purposes, depending on the DE, some can contain 8-9% mono and disaccharides and can contribute to sweetness. We also understand that the hydrolysis process to manufacture maltodextrin and corn syrup are controlled so that the desired DE can be consistently achieved. This indicates that some maltodext and corn syrup solids are manufactured purposely to contain certain levels of mono- and disaccharides. Information that is publicly available (e.g., online product specification sheets and reference materials) indicates that manufacturers have knowledge of the level of mono- and disaccharides created during the processing of ingredients through controlled hydrolysis.\n\nMaltodext, corn syrups, and other ingredients with mono-and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis are widely used by manufacturers and are present in many different types of food products (47 FR 36443 at 36444, September 20, 1982). The sugars contributed by these ingredients are consistent with the concept of empty calories as described in the 2015 DGAC Report because they supply sugars and calories to the diet when they are added as an ingredient to foods. We explained in the Nutrition Facts label final rule that small amounts of added sugars that are contributed to the diet by a wide variety of foods can add up over the course of the day and can make it difficult for an individual to eat sufficient amounts of foods from the basic food groups to meet nutrient needs without exceeding the amount of calories they need in a day for weight maintenance (81 FR 33742 at 33759). As such, when an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis (e.g. maltodextrin or corn syrup) is added to a food during processing, those mono- and disaccharides contributed by the ingredient need to be declared as added sugars on the label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(9)(iii).\n\nShould sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch and other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g., beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label?\n\nYes. Sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch or other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g. beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods need to be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label because the sugars created through controlled hydrolysis add empty calories to the diet (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii); 81 FR 33742 at 33831 through 33832 (comment 201 and response), 33835 (comment 207 and response)).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, because the manufacturer purposely used hydrolysis to increase the product\'s sugar content (81 FR 33742 at 33832).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: The definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n\nThe determination of the amount of added sugars contributed by a powdered fruit or vegetable juice that is added as an ingredient to a product and that is not reconstituted to single strength juice during processing (e.g., that is added to a pureed fruit or to a yogurt) would be the same as the determination of the sugars contributed by a liquid or frozen fruit or vegetable juice concentrate. In our response to question 11, we have suggested that when calculating the added sugars declaration for a product containing concentrated fruit or vegetable juice, the total moisture content of the finished product can be considered to go towards reconstitution of the fruit juice concentrate in the formulation. Thus, the total moisture content of a finished product formulated with powdered fruit or vegetable juice concentrates can be considered to contribute towards the dilution of the powdered fruit or vegetable juice. Further, the sugars contributed by the powdered fruit or vegetable juice that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type must be declared as added sugars on the label, as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule.\n8. Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates? We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12). We require that, when a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)). If you use Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 to calculate the amount of added sugars in a product containing juice concentrate, you must document this information in the records regarding the amount of added sugars added to the food during processing (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). If you use the amount of sugars present in a single strength juice and/or a juice concentrate, that is determined through chemical analysis or other available information, when calculating the amount of added sugars in a product containing fruit juice concentrate, you must document the source of the information and/or the amount of sugars determined through chemical analysis in the records that you make and keep (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). If a diluted juice concentrate slightly exceeds the amount of sugar that would be found in the same volume of the same type of 100 percent fruit juice, manufacturers should document the average and consistency with cGMPs in the records that they make and keep.\n9. Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis? The amount of added sugars declared on the label must be in grams (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The added sugars definition includes sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. For juice, the serving size is based on volume (e.g., 8 oz. or 240 ml) while the amount of added sugars per serving is based on weight. Therefore, when calculating the weight of added sugars per serving, you may need to consider the densities of both the finished juice product and the single strength juice of the same type. You may choose to arrive at the gram amount of added sugars in different ways. Please see our responses to questions 11 and 12 for examples of how to calculate the amount of added sugars in products containing concentrated fruit juices on both a volume and weight basis.\n10. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit or vegetable juice (juice made from a single type of fruit or vegetable) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength juice where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)? In the hypothetical example below, we provide three general steps to calculate the amount of added sugars (in grams) for an apple juice product (240 ml serving size) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength apple juice. The product in this hypothetical example is reconstituted to have juice soluble solids above the minimum Brixrequirement in 21 CFR 101.30 where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9). Therefore, all sugars in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice must be declared as added sugars. The apple juice example here uses the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration. This example is provided solely to demonstrate one method of calculating the added sugars content of the product. You can use alternate methods.\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals""

For example, you can make a single strength juice blend with the same ratios of the three juices and measure the amount of total sugars per 240 ml serving size.\n\nYou can also calculate the sugar weight in the theoretical single strength juice blend of the same type by the following method:\n\na) Calculate the ratios of the three juices in your formulation based on weight.\n\nTo obtain the weight-based ratios of the three juices in this hypothetical juice blend example, you need to first determine the weight-based concentration factors for the three types of juice. The weight-based concentration factor is the ratio of the Brix values between the concentrate and the single strength juice. For example, the weight-based concentration factor for the apple juice in the hypothetical example is 70 / 11.5 = 6.087. Using a similar calculation, the weight based concentration factor for the mango juice is 5.385 and the weight based concentration factor for the pear juice is 5.833.\n\nBecause the hypothetical juice blend formulation has 10% apple juice concentrate (70 Brix), 10% mango juice concentrate (70 Brix), and 20% pear juice concentrate (70 Brix), the theoretical single strength juice blend of the same type would have the following ratios of single strength apple juice, single mango juice, and single pear juice:\n\nPercentage apple juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) apple juice concentration factor; percentage mango juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) mango juice concentration factor; percentage pear juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) pear juice concentration factor\n\nOr\n\n10% (\\times) 6.087; 10% (\\times) 5.385; 20% (\\times) 5.833\n\nOr\n\n0.6087; 0.5385; 1.167_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nThe above ratios for the three types of juice can be converted to percentage-based ratios with the sum of the ratios being 100%. The sum of the ratios is 100% because all of the sugars in the juice blend are from the three types of juices.\n\nTherefore:\n\nSingle apple juice: single strength mango juice: single strength pear juice =\n\n({)[0.6087 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (}):\n\n({)[0.5385 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (}):\n\n({)[1.167 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (})\n\nOr\n\n26.30%: 23.27%: 50.42%\n\nb) Calculate the theoretical Brix value of the single strength juice blend of the same type juice with the same ratios of the three juices.\n\nThe theoretical Brix value of the juice blend is the sum of the multiplication products of the Brix value and the percentage contribution (the ratio percentage from step 2a) for each type of juice.\n\n(Single strength apple juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single strength apple juice) + (single strength mango juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single strength mango juice) + (single strength pear juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single pear juice) = theoretical Brix value of the hypothetical juice blend.\n\n11.5% (\\times) 26.31% + 13% (\\times) 23.27% + 12% (\\times) 50.42% = 12.10%.\n\nc) Determine the density of single strength juice blend with a Brix value of 12.10. You can either experimentally measure the density or look up references that convert Brix values to densities.\n\nd) The amount of sugars in 240 ml serving size of the theoretical single strength juice blend of the same type with the same ratios of the three types of juice = 240 ml (\\times) density (g/ml) (\\times) 12.10 %.\n\nStep 3: The weight of added sugars (in grams) is the weight of sugars obtained from step 1 minus that from step 2.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: 3. Do I need to take into consideration sugars from ingredients that are used in formulating my product when determining the added sugars declaration for a serving of my product?\n\nIngredients containing free mono- and disaccharides that meet our definition of added sugars need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (e.g. sugars from cane sugar and concentrated fruit juice added to sweeten an apple sauce). Manufacturers may need to work with ingredient suppliers to determine the amount of added sugars provided by ingredients used in formulating food products.\n\n4. Do the sugars in dried fruits meet the definition of added sugars?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we responded to comments on dried fruits (see response to comment 212, 81 FR 33742 at 33837). We said that dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them should not be considered to contain added sugars because they are essentially a dehydrated whole fruit and still retain the nutrients and other components of a whole fruit (e.g. diced dried apples). However, if additional sugar is added to a dried fruit, the sugar added to the dried fruit must be declared on the label as added sugars (81 FR 33742 at 33837).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5. Are the sugars used in the production of vinegar added sugars?\n\nIn the production of vinegar, naturally occurring sugars are first fermented into alcohol and then a secondary fermentation occurs in which alcohol is converted to vinegar. For most vinegar products, no sugars remain in the final product. Vinegars that do not contain any sugars in the finished food would not need an added sugars declaration. However, we are aware of some vinegars (e.g., balsamic vinegar) that are made using ingredients that are often used as sweeteners in foods, and that are similar to concentrated fruit juices (e.g., grape must). According to the definition of added sugars, sugars found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type are added sugars. Therefore, fruit juices that are concentrated before or during processing of some vinegars contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars. To the extent that sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are present in the finished product, the added sugars must be declared on the label and in labeling, as required in our Nutrition Facts label final rule. We understand that the manufacturing of vinegar involves several steps, and manufacturers need to consider the impact of these steps (e.g. potential concentration due to water loss when aged in wooden barrels) on the final added sugars declaration.\n\n6. The definition of added sugars excludes the ""fruit component of fruit spreads."" What constitutes the ""fruit component"" of a non-standardized fruit spread?\n\nPlease see our response to question 1 above. The fruit component of a non-standardized fruit spread would include whole fruits, pieces of fruit, dried fruit, fruit or vegetable pures (single strength or concentrated), fruit pulps, single strength juices, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders that are not made from fruit or vegetable juices.\n\n7. Do sugars found in fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the form of the fruit or vegetable (e.g., concentrated fruit and vegetable pures, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders) need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833), we explained that we excluded from the definition of ""added sugars"" whole fruit, fruit pieces, dried fruit, pulps, and pures because they are nutrient rich and maintain the basic properties of a fruit when added to foods and are not considered to contain added sugars (see response to comment 208, 81 FR 33742 at33835). We also explained that sugars from 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, and sugars from certain fruit and vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under certain regulations, fruit juice concentrates used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, and preserves under our standards of identity, and 100 percent juice concentrate sold directly to consumers (e.g. frozen orange juice concentrate) are excluded from the definition of ""added sugars.""\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833 through 33834), we explained that, while foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices can be a part of a healthful diet, the sugars added to the foods by the concentrated fruit or vegetable juice provide additional calories. Over the course of the day, small amounts of calories in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages can add up and make it difficult to balance the amount of calories expended (81 FR 33742 at 33834). For these reasons, we consider foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices to be sugar-sweetened foods (id).\n\nWe also explained that in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report (Ref. 1) (81 FR 33742 at 33835).\n\nWe are applying these same guiding principles when determining when the sugars in an ingredient are added sugars. Concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes, and some fruit and vegetable powders are essentially whole fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the physical form of the fruit or vegetable and to remove moisture. They maintain the basic properties of a whole fruit or vegetable, even if the peel and seeds may be removed. Their composition and use is more consistent with that of whole fruits or vegetables, dried fruits or vegetables, pulps and pureses than that of concentrated fruit juices, which are commonly used by industry in place of sugars. Therefore, the sugars in concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes and some fruit and vegetable powders contribute to the diet the same way that sugars found in whole fruits or vegetables do, and do not have to be declared as added sugars on the label. However, we consider sugars in powders made from fruit and vegetable juices to be the same as those found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices because such powders are essentially concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that have all moisture removed. Therefore, some or all sugars contributed by a powder made from fruit or vegetable juices must be declared as added sugars on the label as required by the Nutrition Facts label final rule, depending on the degree of reconstitution in the finished food.\n\nThe definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals'

Each class or subclass of food is to be given a common or usual name that states, in clear terms, what it is in a way that distinguishes it from different foods. The common or usual name, which may be a coined term, must accurately describe, in as simple and direct terms as possible, the basic nature of the food or its characterizing properties or ingredients; must be uniform among all identical or similar products; and may not be ""confusingly similar to the name of any other food that is not reasonably encompassed within the same name"" (21 CFR 102.5(a)).\n\nSugar cane products exist in many different forms, ranging from raw sugars and syrups to refined sugar and molasses. These products are differentiated by their moisture, molasses, and sucrose content as well as by crystal size and any special treatments (e.g., treatment with sulfur).2 Sugar cane products with common or usual names established by regulation are sugar (21 CFR 101.4(b)(20)) and cane sirup (alternatively spelled ""syrup"") (21 CFR 168.130). Several other sugar cane products have common or usual names established by common usage (e.g., molasses, brown sugar, turbinado sugar, muscovado sugar, and demerara sugar). For purposes of ingredient labeling, ""sugar"" is defined to mean sucrose obtained from sugar cane or sugar beets in accordance with 21 CFR 184.1854, the regulation affirming that sucrose is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in food when used under specified conditions. The GRAS regulation describes sucrose as the substance ""obtained by crystallization from sugar cane or sugar beet juice that has been extracted by pressing or diffusion, then clarified and evaporated"" (21 CFR 184.1854(a)). To be GRAS for use in food, sucrose must be of a purity suitable for its intended use (21 CFR 184.1854(b)).\n\nFootnote 2: Honig, P. Principles of Sugar Technology. Elsevier Publishing Company. 1953.\n\nOn October 7, 2009, FDA published a draft guidance entitled ""Guidance for Industry:\n\nIngredients Declared as Evaporated Cane Juice"" in the Federal Register (74 FR 51610) to advise industry of FDA\'s view that the common or usual name for the solid or dried form of sugar cane syrup is ""dried cane syrup,"" and that sweeteners derived from sugar cane syrup should not be declared on food labels as ""evaporated cane juice"" because that term falsely suggests the sweeteners are juice. On March 5, 2014, we reopened the comment period (79 FR 12507) for the draft guidance seeking further comments, data, and information about how the ingredient sometimes declared as ""evaporated cane juice"" is produced, what its basic nature and characterizing properties are, and how it compares with other sweeteners made from sugar cane. We received numerous comments on the draft guidance. The majority of comments objected to the term ""dried cane syrup."" Several comments from sugar producers asserted that this term does not accurately describe the ingredient they produce, mostly because the standardized food ""cane syrup"" is not the starting material or an intermediate step for the ingredient they refer to as ""evaporated cane juice."" Based on comments stating that the ingredient sometimes declared as evaporated cane juice is not made from cane syrup as defined in 21 CFR 168.130, FDA is no longer recommending that this ingredient be labeled as ""dried cane syrup.""\n\nMany comments described the process used to manufacture the ingredient described as ""evaporated cane juice,"" and some comments also described the manufacturing process for other products derived from sugar cane. The initial processing steps are generally the same for all products produced from sugar cane. After sugar cane is harvested, it is cut or shredded and then crushed to extract the fluid. The extracted fluid is clarified and then evaporated to concentrate the solids. To make the product ""evaporated cane juice,"" the concentrated cane extract is filtered and undergoes a single crystallization process. The crystals are then separated from the molasses using centrifugation. From the comments, the method of filtering the ""evaporated cane juice""\n\nfluid varies from producer to producer, as does the method used for single crystallization.\n\nMost other common types of cane sugar (e.g., white sugar, brown sugar) are not filtered prior to the first crystallization. After the crystals are separated from the molasses using centrifugation, as part of the refining process, the sugar is melted and re-crystallized. Most cane-based sweeteners, including white sugar, undergo multiple crystallization steps.\n\nSome comments stated that ""evaporated cane juice"" has essentially the same composition as white sugar and other sweeteners derived from sugar cane. As support for this point, one comment provided a specification sheet for ""evaporated cane juice"" indicating that the ingredient contains between 99.0 and 99.8% sucrose. The comment also included a specification sheet for another product identified as ""certified organic sugar"" and pointed out that the composition of the two products was identical except that the organic ingredient was made with organic sugar cane. Other comments focused on the differences between ""evaporated cane juice"" and other cane-based sweeteners. For example, some of these comments stated that ""evaporated cane juice"" has a different composition from white sugar because it retains traces of molasses and minerals. A few comments said that ""evaporated cane juice"" is different than other less refined, ""alternative"" sugars because it contains less molasses and can be substituted for white sugar in processed foods without affecting the taste or appearance of the finished product.\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nThis guidance is intended to help consumers make informed choices among sweeteners by promoting accurate and consistent labeling. To that end, we are advising the regulated industry of our view that the term ""evaporated cane juice"" is not the common or usual name of any type of sweetener and that this ingredient should instead be declared on food labels as ""sugar,"" preceded by one or more truthful, non-misleading descriptors if the manufacturer so chooses (e.g., ""cane sugar"").\n\nIn developing this guidance, FDA reviewed the Codex Alimentarius Commission\'s (Codex\'s) Standard for Sugars, Codex Stan. 212-1999 (Ref. 4), which provides standards for certain sugars intended for human consumption without further processing, to determine whether Codex had established a standard for a product similar to that described on some U.S. food labels as ""evaporated cane juice."" The Codex Standard for Sugars contains no product identified as ""evaporated cane juice."" However, the Codex standard does define ""raw cane sugar""3 as ""[p]artially purified sucrose, which is crystallised from partially purified cane juice, without further purification, but which does not preclude centrifugation or drying, and which is characterised by sucrose crystals covered with a film of cane molasses."" This standard appears to describe the same sweetener referred to in many of the comments as ""evaporated cane juice."" We agree that the common or usual name used to describe this ingredient on food labels should include the term ""sugar"" because that term describes the basic nature and characterizing properties of the food.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Ingredients Declared as Evaporated Cane Juice'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: VIIILG How Do These New Formatting Rules Affect the Percentage Juice Declaration?\n\nFigure 16: Simplified Format Label (101.9(f))\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWith the changes to some type size requirements on the Nutrition Facts label, it is permissible if the percentage juice declaration for foods purporting to be beverages that contain fruit or vegetable juice is smaller in height than the declaration of ""Serving size,"" ""Calories,"" and the numerical value for ""Calories,"" in addition to already being permitted to be smaller in height than the brand name, product name, logo, universal product code, and ""Nutrition Facts"" heading (21 CFR 101.30(e)(2)).\n\n4.2.3 VIII.H Are There Specific Formatting Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels?\n\nInformation other than the title, headings, and footnotes must be in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Column headings (e.g., ""Amount Per Serving"" and ""% Daily Value"") and footnotes (e.g., ""Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet"") must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Because many dietary supplement products may contribute a negligible amount of calories, we do not require information about calories to be displayed in a larger type size or highlighted on Supplement Facts labels (81 FR 33742 at 33939).\n\nFor small packages which have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, all information within the nutrition label must be in type size no smaller than 4.5 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(i)).\n\nIntermediate-sized packages, which have from 12 to 40 square inches of surface area available to bear labeling, have different type size requirements. All information within the nutrition label must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)). However, type size no smaller than 4.5 point may be used on packages that have less than 20 square inches available for labeling and more than eight dietary ingredients to be listed (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)). Similarly, type size no smaller than 4.5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches available for labeling and more than 16 dietary ingredients to be listed (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)).\n\nThe footnote stating that the ""Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet"" is required if the percent DV is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, protein, or added sugars (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D)). On labels of products represented or purported to be for use by children 1 through 3 years of age, the footnote statement must read: ""Percent Daily Values are based on a 1,000 calorie diet"" if the % Daily Value is declared for total fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, protein, or added sugars (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D)).\n\nIf there is inadequate space to list the required information vertically, the list may be split. The list to the right must be set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the dietary ingredients and percent DV information given to the left (21 CFR 101.36(e)(12)). The column headings are also repeated (21 CFR 101.36(e)(12)). Figure 17 reflects this label formatting.\n\nIX When Must I Comply with the Rule?\n\nIf you have $10 million or more in annual food sales, your compliance date is January 1, 2020. If you have less than $10 million in annual food sales, your compliance date is January 1, 2021.\n\nIf you manufacture single-ingredient packages and/or containers of pure honey, pure maple syrup, or other pure sugars and syrups, as well as the cranberry products discussed in the Final Guidance (Ref. 1), we intend to exercise enforcement discretion until July 1, 2021, for compliance with the labeling changes outlined in the Nutrition Facts label rule and the Serving Size rule.\n\nIf you manufacture certain dried cranberry products with added flavorings (Ref. 11), we intend to exercise enforcement discretion until July 1, 2020, for compliance with the labeling changes outlined in the Nutrition Facts label final rule and the Serving Size final rule.\n\nX Why Must I Comply with the Rule?\n\nFailure to comply with the final rule will render the covered food misbranded under section 403(q) of the FD&C Act and potentially other sections as well. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is misbranded constitutes a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act. Among potential consequences, committing a prohibited act can result in injunction and/or seizure (see sections 302 and 304 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 332 and 334)).\n\nFigure 17: Supplement Facts Label – Split List (101.36(e)(12))\n\nXI References\n\nThe following references are on display at the Dockets Management Staff ((HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852) and are available for viewing by interested persons between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday; they are also available electronically at https://www.regulations.gov.

Juice (fruit or vegetable) ingredients are unique in that the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient depends on whether the juice ingredient is concentrated, and thus, contains sugar in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. We realize that food formulation is complex and manufacturers can use different ingredients or alternative formulas to achieve the same finished product composition. For example, you may use 100% fruit juice and dry sugar in a baking application. You also may have an alternative formulation that uses concentrated fruit juice and liquid syrup to achieve the same product composition. When water or other wet ingredients containing water (e.g. milk, syrup, egg, diluted wines and cider with less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, etc.) are added to a formulation containing concentrated juice and other ingredients during processing, the amount of moisture that goes towards reconstituting the juice or towards wetting or reconstituting other ingredients is not known. Furthermore, if the water added during formulation is divided among the ingredients when determining the amount of reconstitution or wetting that has occurred, different formulations of the same finished food could have different calculated added sugar amounts. Therefore, we considered an approach that we believe would provide a reasonable estimate of the added sugars content of a multi-ingredient product that includes concentrated fruit juice as an ingredient (e.g. a bakery product, marinade, or diluted wines and cider with less than 7 percent alcohol by volume). When concentrated juices are used in the formulation, we believe that it is practical to use all of the moisture in the formulation towards reconstitution of the concentrated juice when calculating the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product. It is also possible that the initial juice ingredient in the formulation (either diluted, 100%, or concentrated) is further concentrated during processing due to loss of water (e.g., during drying or baking). Because the amount of added sugars is based on the finished product composition, you should account for the loss of water during processing to reflect the concentration of the juice ingredient after processing. Considering the complexity of food formulation and processing, we believe it is also appropriate to use the moisture content of the finished product towards reconstitution of the juice soluble solids when the product is subject to water loss during processing. This approach is consistent with our approach for the use of all of the moisture in the formulation towards reconstitution of concentrated juices when calculating the added sugars content of an ingredient. The following general approach can be used to calculate the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation. This general approach applies when there is either dilution or concentration during manufacturing.']",0.999999999975,0.3333333333333333
18,"Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?","['--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?\n--------------------\nContext: iv.2.1 Appearance and Description (4.2.1)\n\nA qualitative statement describing the physical state (e.g., solid, liquid), color, and clarity of the drug product should be provided.\n\niv.2.2 Identity (4.2.2)\n\nThe identity test(s) should be highly specific for the drug product and should be based on unique aspects of its molecular structure and other specific properties. The identity test(s) can be qualitative in nature. While it is recognized that in most cases a single test is adequate, more than one test (physicochemical, biological, and/or immunochemical) may be necessary to establish identity for some products. Some of the methods typically used for characterization of the product, as described in section II.A and in appendix A, may be employed and/or modified as appropriate for the purpose of establishing identity.\n\niv.2.3 Purity and Impurities (4.2.3)\n\nImpurities may be generated or increased during manufacture and/or storage of the drug product. These may be either the same as those occurring in the drug substance itself, process-related, or degradation products which form specifically in the drug product during formulation or during storage. If impurities are qualitatively and quantitatively (i.e., relative amounts and/or concentrations) the same as in the drug substance, testing is not considered necessary. If impurities are known to be introduced or formed during the production and/or storage of the drug product, the levels of these impurities should be determined and acceptance criteria established.\n\nAcceptance criteria and analytical procedures should be developed and justified, based upon previous experience with the drug product, to measure changes in the drug substance during the manufacture and/or storage of the drug product.\n\nThe choice and optimization of analytical procedures should focus on the separation of the desired product and product-related substances from impurities including degradation products, and from excipients.\n\nPotency (4.2.4)\n\nA relevant, validated potency assay (section II.A.2) should be part of the specifications for a biotechnological and biological drug substance and/or drug product. When an appropriate potency assay is used for the drug substance, an alternative method (physicochemical and/or biological) may suffice for quantitative assessment of the drug product. However, the rationale for such a choice should be provided.\n\nQuantity (4.2.5)\n\nThe quantity of the drug substance in the drug product, usually based on protein content (mass), should be determined using an appropriate assay. In cases where product manufacture is based upon potency, there may be no need for an alternate determination of quantity.\n\nGeneral Tests (4.2.6)\n\nPhysical description and the measurement of other quality attributes are often important for the evaluation of the drug product functions. Examples of such tests include pH and osmolarity.\n\nAdditional Testing for Unique Dosage Forms (4.2.7)\n\nIt should be recognized that certain unique dosage forms may need additional tests other than those mentioned above.\n\nGLOSSARY (5.0)\n\nAcceptance criteria: Numerical limits, ranges, or other suitable measures for acceptance of the results of analytical procedures which the drug substance or drug product or materials at other stages of manufacture should meet.\n\nAction limit: An internal (in-house) value used to assess the consistency of the process at less critical steps.\n\nBiological activity: The specific ability or capacity of the product to achieve a defined biological effect. Potency is the quantitative measure of the biological activity.\n\nContaminants: Any adventitiously introduced materials (e.g., chemical, biochemical, or microbial species) not intended to be part of the manufacturing process of the drug substance or drug product.\n\nDegradation products: Molecular variants resulting from changes in the desired product or product-related substances brought about over time and/or by the action of, e.g., light, temperature, pH, water, or by reaction with an excipient and/or the immediate container/closure system. Such changes may occur as a result of manufacture and/or storage (e.g., deamidation, oxidation, aggregation, proteolysis). Degradation products may be either product-related substances or product-related impurities.\n\nDesired product: (1) The protein that has the expected structure, or (2) the protein that is expected from the DNA sequence and anticipated post-translational modification (including glycoforms), and from the intended downstream modification to produce an active biological molecule.\n\nDrug product (Dosage form; Finished product): A pharmaceutical product type that contains a drug substance, generally in association with excipients.\n\nDrug substance (Bulk material): The material that is subsequently formulated with excipients to produce the drug product. It can be composed of the desired product, product-related substances, and product- and process-related impurities. It may also contain excipients including other components, such as buffers.\n\nExipient: An ingredient added intentionally to the drug substance which should not have pharmacological properties in the quantity used.\n\nImpurity: Any component present in the drug substance or drug product that is not the desired product, a product-related substance, or an excipient including buffer components. It may be either process- or product-related.\n\nIn-house primary reference material: An appropriately characterized material prepared by the manufacturer from a representative lot(s) for the purpose of biological assay andphysicochemical testing of subsequent lots, and against which in-house working reference material is calibrated.\n\nIn-house working reference material A material prepared similarly to the primary reference material that is established solely to assess and control subsequent lots for the individual attribute in question. It is always calibrated against the in-house primary reference material.\n\nPotency: The measure of the biological activity using a suitably quantitative biological assay (also called potency assay or bioassay), based on the attribute of the product which is linked to the relevant biological properties.\n\nProcess-related impurities: Impurities that are derived from the manufacturing process. They may be derived from cell substrates (e.g., host cell proteins, host cell DNA), cell culture (e.g., inducers, antibiotics, or media components), or downstream processing (e.g., processing reagents or column leachables).\n\nProduct-related impurities: Molecular variants of the desired product (e.g., precursors, certain degradation products arising during manufacture and/or storage) which do not have properties comparable to those of the desired product with respect to activity, efficacy, and safety.\n\nProduct-related substances: Molecular variants of the desired product formed during manufacture and/or storage which are active and have no deleterious effect on the safety and efficacy of the drug product. These variants possess properties comparable to the desired product and are not considered impurities.\n\nReference standards: International or national standards.\n\nSpecification: A list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and appropriate acceptance criteria which are numerical limits, ranges, or other criteria for the tests described. It establishes the set of criteria to which a drug substance, drug product, or materials at other stages of its manufacture should conform to be considered acceptable for its intended use. Conformance to specification means that the drug substance and drug product, when tested according to the listed analytical procedures, will meet the acceptance criteria. Specifications are critical quality standards that are proposed and justified by the manufacturer and approved by regulatory authorities as conditions of approval.\n\nAppendix A Appendix for Physiochemical Characterization (6.1)\n\nThis appendix provides examples of technical approaches that might be considered for structural characterization and confirmation, and evaluation of physicochemical properties of the desired product, drug substance, and/or drug product. The specific technical approach employed will vary from product to product, and alternative approaches, other than those included in this appendix, will be appropriate in many cases. New analytical technology and modifications to existing technology are continuously being developed and should be utilized when appropriate.\n\n1. Structural Characterization and Confirmation (6.1.1)\n\na. Amino acid sequence\n\nThe amino acid sequence of the desired product should be determined to the extent possible using approaches such as those described in items (b) through (e) and then compared with the sequence of the amino acids deduced from the gene sequence of the desired product.\n\nb. Amino acid composition\n\nThe overall amino acid composition is determined using various hydrolytic and analytical procedures and compared with the amino acid composition deduced from the gene sequence for the desired product, or the natural counterpart, if considered necessary. In many cases, amino acid composition analysis provides some useful structural information for peptides and small proteins, but such data are generally less definitive for large proteins. Quantitative amino acid analysis data can also be used to determine protein content in many cases.\n\nc. Terminal amino acid sequence\n\nTerminal amino acid analysis is performed to identify the nature and homogeneity of the amino- and carboxy-terminal amino acids. If the desired product is found to be heterogeneous with respect to the terminal amino acids, the relative amounts of the variant forms should be determined using an appropriate analytical procedure. The sequence of these terminal amino acids should be compared with the terminal amino acid sequence deduced from the gene sequence of the desired product.\n\nd.

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 4: Specifications must be scientifically sound and appropriate (§ 211.160(b)), test procedures must be validated as to their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility (§ 211.165(e)), and the suitability of the test procedures under actual conditions of use must be documented (§ 211.194(a)(2)). For products that are the subjects of new drug applications (NDAs), abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), or investigational new drug applications (INDs), specifications are contained in the application or DMF. Specifications for nonapplication products may be found in official compendia or established by the manufacturer.\n\nBoth finished pharmaceuticals and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are to be manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practice under section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act. Current good manufacturing practice for APIs includes the performance of scientifically sound raw material testing, in-process monitoring, release and stability testing, process validation, and adequate investigations of any OOS result obtained from such testing. All citations to part 211 in this document pertain to finished pharmaceuticals, but these referenced regulatory requirements are also consistent with Agency guidance on CGMP for APIs with respect to laboratory controls, which include out-of-specification investigations. See FDA'sguidance for industry Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (September 2016) (ICH Q7) for specific recommendations.5\n\nFootnote 5: We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the CDER guidance page at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/guidances-drugs.\n\nThe responsibility of a contract testing laboratory in meeting these requirements is equivalent to that of a manufacturing firm.\n\nIII Identifying and Assessing OOS Test Results -- Phase I: Laboratory Investigation\n\nFDA regulations require that an investigation be conducted whenever an OOS test result is obtained (SS 211.192).6 The purpose of the investigation is to determine the cause of the OOS result. The source of the OOS result should be identified either as an aberration of the measurement process or an aberration of the manufacturing process. Even if a batch is rejected based on an OOS result, the investigation is necessary to determine if the result is associated with other batches of the same drug product or other products. Batch rejection does not negate the need to perform the investigation. The regulations require that a written record of the investigation be made, including the conclusions and follow-up (SS 211.192).\n\nFootnote 6: Although the subject of this document is OOS results, much of the guidance may be useful for examining results that are out of trend.\n\nTo be meaningful, the investigation should be thorough, timely, unbiased, well-documented, and scientifically sound. The first phase of such an investigation should include an initial assessment of the accuracy of the laboratory's data. Whenever possible, this should be done before test preparations (including the composite or the homogenous source of the aliquot tested) are discarded. This way, hypotheses regarding laboratory error or instrument malfunctions can be tested using the same test preparations. If this initial assessment indicates that no causative errors were made in the analytical method used to arrive at the data, a full-scale OOS investigation should be conducted. For contract laboratories, the laboratory should convey its data, findings, and supporting documentation to the manufacturing firm's quality unit (QU). The manufacturing firm's QU should then initiate the Phase 2 (full-scale) OOS investigation, whenever no clearly causative laboratory error was identified.\n\nResponsibility of the Analyst\n\nThe first responsibility for achieving accurate laboratory testing results lies with the analyst who is performing the test. The analyst should be aware of potential problems that could occur during the testing process and should watch for problems that could create inaccurate results.\n\nIn accordance with the CGMP regulations in SS 211.160(b)(4), the analyst should ensure that only those instruments meeting established performance specifications are used and that all instruments are properly calibrated.\n\nCertain analytical methods have system suitability requirements, and systems not meeting these requirements should not be used. For example, in chromatographic systems, reference standard solutions may be injected at intervals throughout chromatographic runs to measure drift, noise, and repeatability. If reference standard responses indicate that the system is not functioning properly, all of the data collected during the suspect time period should be properly identified and should not be used. The cause of the malfunction should be identified and, if possible, corrected before a decision is made whether to use any data prior to the suspect period.\n\nAnalysts should check the data for compliance with test specifications before discarding test preparations or standard preparations. When unexpected results are obtained and no obvious explanation exists, test preparations should be retained, if stable, and the analyst should inform the supervisor. An assessment of the accuracy of the results should be started immediately.\n\nIf errors are obvious, such as the spilling of a sample solution or the incomplete transfer of a sample composite, the analyst should immediately document what happened. Analysts should not knowingly continue an analysis they expect to invalidate at a later time for an assignable cause (i.e., analyses should not be completed for the sole purpose of seeing what results can be obtained when obvious errors are known).\n\nResponsibilities of the Laboratory Supervisor\n\nOnce an OOS result has been identified, the supervisor's assessment should be objective and timely. There should be no preconceived assumptions as to the cause of the OOS result. Data should be assessed promptly to ascertain if the results might be attributed to laboratory error, or whether the results could indicate problems in the manufacturing process. An immediate assessment could include re-examination of the actual solutions, test units, and glassware used in the original measurements and preparations, which might provide more credibility for laboratory error hypotheses.\n\nThe following steps should be taken as part of the supervisor's assessment:\n\nDiscuss the test method with the analyst; confirm analyst knowledge of and performance of the correct procedure.\n\nExamine the raw data obtained in the analysis, including chromatograms and spectra, and identify anomalous or suspect information.\n\nVerify that the calculations used to convert raw data values into a final test result are scientifically sound, appropriate, and correct; also determine if unauthorized or unvalidated changes have been made to automated calculation methods.\n\nConfirm the performance of the instruments.\n\nDetermine that appropriate reference standards, solvents, reagents, and other solutions were used and that they met quality control specifications.\n\nEvaluate the performance of the test method to ensure that it is performing according to the standard expected based on method validation data and historical data.\n\nFully document and preserve records of this laboratory assessment.\n\nThe assignment of a cause for OOS results will be greatly facilitated if the retained sample preparations are examined promptly. Hypotheses regarding what might have happened (e.g., dilution error, instrument malfunction) should be tested. Examination of the retained solutions should be performed as part of the laboratory investigation.\n\nExamples:\n\nSolutions can be re-injected as part of an investigation where a transient equipment malfunction is suspected. Such hypotheses are difficult to prove. However, reinjections can provide strong evidence that the problem should be attributed to the instrument, rather than the sample or its preparation.\n\nFor release rate testing of certain specialized dosage form drugs that are not destroyed during testing, where possible, examination of the original dosage unit tested might determine whether it was damaged during laboratory handling in a way that affected its performance. Such damage would provide evidence to invalidate the OOS test result, and a retest would be indicated.\n\nFurther extraction of a dosage unit, where possible, can be performed to determine whether it was fully extracted during the original analysis. Incomplete extraction could invalidate the test results and should lead to questions regarding validation of the test method.\n\nIt is important that each step in the investigation be fully documented. Laboratory management should ascertain not only the reliability of the individual value obtained, but also the significance these OOS results represent to the laboratory quality assurance program. Laboratory management should be especially alert to developing trends. As part of an effective quality system, a firm's upper management should appropriately monitor these trends and ensure that any problematic areas are addressed.\n\nLaboratory error should be relatively rare. Frequent errors suggest a problem that might be due to inadequate training of analysts, poorly maintained or improperly calibrated equipment, or careless work. Whenever laboratory error is identified, the firm should determine the source of that error and take corrective action to prevent recurrence. To ensure full compliance with the CGMP regulations, the manufacturer also should maintain adequate documentation of the corrective action.\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigating Out-of-Specification (OOS) Test Results for Pharmaceutical Production - Level 2 revision Guidance for Industry""

It is also intended to help ensure that APIs meet the requirements for quality and purity that they purport or are represented to possess.\n\nIn this Guide ""manufacturing"" is defined to include all operations of receipt of materials, production, packaging, repackaging, labelling, relabelling, quality control, release, storage and distribution of APIs and the related controls. In this Guide the term ""should"" indicates recommendations that are expected to apply unless shown to be inapplicable or replaced by an alternative demonstrated to provide at least an equivalent level of quality assurance. For the purposes of this Guide, the terms ""current good manufacturing practices"" and ""good manufacturing practices"" are equivalent.\n\nThe Guide as a whole does not cover safety aspects for the personnel engaged in the manufacture, nor aspects of protection of the environment. These controls are inherent responsibilities of the manufacturer and are governed by national laws.\n\nThis Guide is not intended to define registration/filing requirements or modify pharmacopoeial requirements. This Guide does not affect the ability of the responsible regulatory agency to establish specific registration/filing requirements regarding APIs within the context of marketing/manufacturing authorizations or drug applications. All commitments in registration/filing documents must be met.\n\nRegulatory Applicability\n\nWithin the world community, materials may vary as to the legal classification as an API. When a material is classified as an API in the region or country in which it is manufactured or used in a drug product, it should be manufactured according to this Guide.\n\nScope\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?\n--------------------\nContext: Final Concept Paper\n\nICH Q7 Q&As\n\nQ7: Good Manufacturing Practice Guide for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients\n\nDated and endorsed by the Steering Committee: 17 October 2012\n\nType of Harmonization Action Proposed\n\nImplementation Working Group (Q7 IWG) on Q7 (Q&A document).\n\nStatement of the Perceived Problem\n\nThe ICH Q7 Guideline is implemented successfully in the regulatory framework by WHO and most authorities around the world. However, experience gained with the implementation of ICH Q7 since the approval in November 2000 shows that uncertainties related to the interpretation of some sections exist. Furthermore, the importance of the application of the life-cycle approach addressed in the new ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, Q10 Guidelines to API manufacturing procedures is emphasized by the ICH Quality Implementation Working Group (Quality IWG). Technical issues with regard to GMP of APIs - also in context with new ICH Guidelines - need to be addressed in order to harmonize expectations during inspections.\n\nA document would be helpful in removing these ambiguities and uncertainties and also in harmonizing the inspections of both small molecules and biotech APIs.\n\nIssues to be resolved\n\nThe following issues have so far been identified by practical experience and will need to be addressed in a Q&A document on Q7:\n\nOutput from the review of existing Q&As (e.g., from PIC/S Expert Circle on APIs, from initial Regulatory/PDA training 2002) currently underway by PIC/S teams will be considered for endorsement.\n\nTechnical issues for clarification such as application in the supply chain control, contractor/supplier management (outsourcing), monitoring of impurity profiles, quality systems, applicability to biologicals/biotech and relationship with Q5D, and GMP expectations in the development phase (manufacturing for clinical trials).\n\nImpact of the implementation of ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, and Q10 on Q7 (see also Quality IWG Q&As and Points to Consider).\n\nBackground to the Proposal\n\nIt has become apparent, based on the approval and implementation of ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11 principles into GMP of APIs that certain individual implementation approaches are leading to non harmonized interpretation and new expectations beyond the intention of ICH Q7. The Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme (PIC/S) launched the 'International Collaboration on APIs - Training programme on ICH Q7'. This training programme includes a basic training, an advanced training and a Q&A document on interpretation of ICH Q7. This provides a feedback by the global knowledge of its network of inspectors. PIC/S will be supportive of the Q7 IWG work.\n\nType of Implementation Working Group and Resources\n\nThe Q7 IWG should comprise of the Six ICH Parties (2 experts per Party), Observers to ICH (1 expert per Observer), RHIs, DRAs and DoH (1 expert per RHI/DRA/DoH), and Interested Parties (WSNI, IGPA, Biotechnology Industry, PIC/S, API Industry and CEP programme of EDQM, 1 expert per Interested Party).\n\nTiming\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Q&As Concept Paper""

It does not create any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist institutional review boards (IRBs), clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA\'s informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. This guidance supersedes FDA\'s guidance entitled ""A Guide to Informed Consent,"" issued in September 1998, and finalizes FDA\'s draft guidance entitled ""Informed Consent Information Sheet,"" issued in July 2014. This document is structured to first present general guidance on FDA\'s regulatory requirements for informed consent and a discussion of the roles of IRBs, clinical investigators, sponsors, and FDA related to informed consent, followed by a series of frequently asked questions.\n\nIn a final rule published on January 19, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal departments and agencies revised the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects. The final rule became effective in 2018 (codified for HHS at 45 CFR 46, subpart A; ""the 2018 Common Rule"").2,3 The 2018 Common Rule sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by federal departments or agencies that have adopted the Common Rule. The revisions include significant changes to the provisions regarding informed consent. FDA is currently engaged in notice and comment rulemaking to harmonize its human subject protection\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nof the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Summary of the Consent process\n\nTo many, the term informed consent is mistakenly viewed as synonymous with obtaining a subject\'s signature on the consent form;9 however, obtaining documentation of a subject\'s informed consent is only part of the consent process. Informed consent involves providing a prospective subject, or their legally authorized representative (LAR), with adequate information to allow for an informed decision about participation in the clinical investigation prior to enrollment. Informed consent also involves facilitating the prospective subject\'s understanding of the information, providing adequate opportunity for the prospective subject to ask questions and to consider whether to participate, obtaining the prospective subject\'s voluntary agreement to participate prior to enrollment, and continuing to provide information as the clinical investigation progresses or as the enrolled subject or situation requires.10\n\nFootnote 9: In this guidance document, the terms informed consent form and informed consent document are used interchangeably.\n\nExcept as provided in 21 CFR 50.23 and 50.24,11 (see section III.A.1, ""Exceptions to Informed Consent""), no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in FDA-regulated research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s LAR (21CFR 50.20).12 To be legally effective, the informed consent process must satisfy the general requirements under 21 CFR 50.20 and include the relevant elements of informed consent described at 21 CFR 50.25 (see section3), ""FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion"").\n\nFootnote 12: As described in guidance, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances, with respect to its current regulations governing the requirement for informed consent when human specimens are used for FDA-regulated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device investigations. See “Guidance on Informed Consent for in Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable: Guidance for Sponsors, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff”, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-informed- Consent-vitro-diagnostic-device-studies-using-leftover-human-specimens-are-not\n\nFDA considers advertising used to recruit subjects into the clinical trial to be the start of the ongoing consent process, and the information provided in any online or hard copy recruitment materials should be consistent with the informed consent document. Generally, FDA recommends that any advertisement to recruit subjects be limited to the information the prospective subjects need to determine their interest and potential eligibility. The FDA information sheet ""Recruiting Study Subjects"" includes information regarding scripts for those who will interface with subjects to determine basic eligibility.13\n\nFootnote 13: See the FDA Information Sheet “Recruiting Study Subjects,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects, for further information.\n\nOnce a prospective subject is identified, and before research activities requiring prior consent occur, a person knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and capable of answering questions raised by the prospective subject should conduct a consent discussion. The consent discussion and the consent form must contain information to allow prospective subjects to make an informed decision about participation in a clinical investigation and provide an opportunity for prospective subjects to ask questions about the clinical investigation and the information in the consent document (see section3), ""FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion"") (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25).14 The consent form serves several purposes, including helping to ensure that prospective subjects receive the required information, providing a ""take home"" reminder of the elements of the clinical investigation, providing contact information in case additional questions or concerns arise, and documenting prospective subjects\' voluntary agreement to participate as well as the date of their agreement.\n\nFootnote 14: The regulations allow use of a “short form” consent form when the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For a discussion of the short form written consent, see section3.5.4.2, “Short Form.”\n\nThe informed consent process is an ongoing exchange of information throughout a subject\'s participation in a clinical trial and does not end after the consent form is signed. For example, if new safety information or protocol changes occur during the conduct of the study, additional information may need to be given to the subject, and/or the subject may need additional opportunities to ask questions and receive answers throughout the clinical investigation (see sectionIII.3.5, ""Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects,"" and Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nIII FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b ""Short Form"" for more details). If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For ""applicable clinical trials"" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, “Element of Informed Consent for ‘Applicable Clinical Trials.”\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nTreatment Use of Investigational Drugs\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/treatment-use-investigational-drugs).\n\nOffice of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nInvestigational products are sometimes used for treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions either for a single subject or for a group of subjects. The procedures that have evolved for an investigational new drug (IND) used for these purposes reflect the recognition by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that, when no satisfactory alternative treatment exists, subjects are generally willing to accept greater risks from test articles that may treat life-threatening and debilitating illnesses. The following mechanisms expand access to promising therapeutic agents without compromising the protection afforded to human subjects or the thoroughness and scientific integrity of product development and marketing approval.\n\nOpen Label Protocol or Open Protocol Ind\n\nThese are usually uncontrolled studies, carried out to obtain additional safety data (Phase 3 studies). They are typically used when the controlled trial has ended and treatment is continued so that the subjects and the controls may continue to receive the benefits of the investigational drug until marketing approval is obtained. These studies require prospective Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and informed consent.\n\nTreatment Ind\n\nThe treatment IND [21 CFR 312-34 and 312-35] is a mechanism for providing eligible subjects with investigational drugs for the treatment of serious and life-threatening illnesses for which there are no satisfactory alternative treatments. A treatment IND may be granted after sufficient data have been collected to show that the drug ""may be effective"" and does not have unreasonable risks. Because data related to safety and side effects are collected, treatment INDs also serve to expand the body of knowledge about the drug.\n\nThere are four requirements that must be met before a treatment IND can be issued: 1) the drug is intended to treat a serious or immediately life-threatening disease; 2) there is no satisfactory alternative treatment available; 3) the drug is already under investigation, ortrials have been completed; and 4) the trial sponsor is actively pursuing marketing approval. Treatment IND studies require prospective IRB review and informed consent. A sponsor may apply for a waiver of local IRB review under a treatment IND if it can be shown to be in the best interest of the subjects, and if a satisfactory alternate mechanism for assuring the protection of human subjects is available, e.g., review by a central IRB. Such a waiver does not apply to the informed consent requirement. An IRB may still opt to review a study even if FDA has granted a waiver. Treatment INDs are discussed under the general heading of expanded access to investigational drugs. On August 13, 2009, FDA issued in the Federal Register 21 CFR Part 312 and 316, Charging for Investigational Drugs Under an Investigational New Drug Application; Expanded Access to Investigational Drugs for Treatment Use; Final Rules. These rules include clinical studies conducted under an IND as well as treatment protocols and treatment INDs. These rules and the accompanying preamble are available at http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-19004.pdf (http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-19004.pdf).\n\nGroup C Treatment IND\n\nThe ""Group C"" treatment IND was established by agreement between FDA and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The Group C program is a means for the distribution of investigational agents to oncologists for the treatment of cancer under protocols outside the controlled clinical trial. Group C drugs are generally Phase 3 study drugs that have shown evidence of relative and reproducible efficacy in a specific tumor type. They can generally be administered by properly trained physicians without the need for specialized supportive care facilities. Group C drugs are distributed only by the National Institutes of Health under NCI protocols. Although treatment is the primary objective and patients treated under Group C guidelines are not part of a clinical trial, safety and effectiveness data are collected. Because administration of Group C drugs is not done with research intent, FDA has generally granted a waiver from the IRB review requirements [21 CFR 56.105]. Even though FDA has granted a waiver for these drugs, an IRB may still choose to conduct a review under its policies and procedures. The usage of a Group C drug is described in its accompanying ""Guideline Protocol"" document. The Guideline Protocol contains an FDA-approved informed consent document which must be used if there has been no local IRB review.\n\nParallel Track\n\nThe Agency\'s Parallel Track policy [57 FR 13250] permits wider access to promising new drugs for AIDS/HIV related diseases under a separate ""expanded access"" protocol that ""parallels"" the controlled clinical trials that are essential to establish the safety and effectiveness of new drugs. It provides an administrative system that expands the availability of drugs for treating AIDS/HIV. These studies require prospective IRB review and informed consent.\n\nEmergence use IND\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]\n--------------------\nContext title: Treatment Use of Investigational Drugs Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: INDs\n\nWho can sponsor an IND? INDs can be sponsored by an individual (e.g., a physician), an institution, or a company.\n\nContent and Format for NDAs and ANDAs_.\n\nWill drugs for which there is a United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) monograph be exempt from submitting an IND? No. The fact that a drug has a USP monograph does not eliminate the need for an IND, although the drug might be eligible for an expanded access IND if the criteria are met (see the guidance Investigational New Drug Applications for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Drugs).\n\nWhat is the definition of clinical use in the context of PET drugs?Clinical use refers to administration of the drug to patients as a component of their clinical care with no intent to study the safety or effectiveness of the drug in any systematic way.\nQ20: Can research be conducted under an IND for FDG, Ammonia N13, Sodium Fluoride F18, or Rubidium Chloride Rb82?\n\nYes. Research and/or investigational studies using these drugs should be conducted under an IND if they are being studied for purposes of commercial clinical use (see the guidance Investigational New Drug Applications for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Drugs). Human research using a PET drug may be conducted under the RDRC if it is basic science research and not research that is intended for immediate therapeutic, diagnostic, or similar purposes, or research to determine the safety and effectiveness of the radioactive drug or biological product for such purposes (see the guidance The Radioactive Drug Research Committee: Human Research Without an Investigational New Drug Application).\nQ21: In submitting the physician-sponsored IND, one of the biggest hurdles is trying to get the necessary preclinical pharmacological and toxicology data to support the submission. Would FDA consider reducing the requirement?\n\nIf you have adequate evidence of the PET drug\'s safe clinical use, you may submit that clinical information to FDA for review and we will determine whether the drug is safe for use within the proposed IND clinical study or studies. The existing clinical information may limit or negate the need for preclinical data. Clinical information from the use of the PET drug\'s non-radiolabeled ligand may also prove sufficient to limit or negate the need for preclinical data.\n\nFor PET drugs that have not been in clinical use, the extent of necessary preclinical data depends on whether the PET drug ligand is a naturally occurring endogenous substance in humans or not. In general, limited or no preclinical data are necessary to support the use of a PET drug that consists of a ligand that is naturally occurring within humans, if the only major ex vivo modification is the radiolabeling of the ligand. The extent of preclinical data necessary to support a clinical study or studies under an exploratory IND is more limited than the preclinical data necessary for a traditional IND (see the guidance Exploratory IND Studies).\nQ22: Many trials for therapeutic drugs are currently being conducted abroad. If a PET drug is used to determine eligibility for the clinical trial abroad, what would FDA need to know about the PET drug when approval is sought under an NDA for the therapeutic drug?Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe answer to this question depends on several factors. If the use of the PET drug to determine eligibility is an approved indication in the United States, we would need CMC data to show that the PET drug used in the trial is comparable to the drug that is approved for use in the United States. For example, if a PET drug were to be approved in the United States to identify early Parkinson\'s or Alzheimer\'s disease, the foreign trial\'s PET drug would need to be bioequivalent to the approved drug in the United States.\n\nIf the use of the PET drug to determine eligibility is not an approved indication in the United States (e.g., no PET drugs are currently approved to determine whether a patient has early Parkinson\'s disease or Alzheimer\'s disease), the safety and efficacy of the PET drug for that use would have to be established and the data submitted within an NDA.\nQ23: If a PET drug producer creates a centralized IND (e.g., an IND for multicenter participation and protocol compliance, image acquisition standardization, image output harmonization) to use FDG in biomarker trials and that producer has an ANDA, can the applicant cross-reference the CMC data in the ANDA or must the applicant submit the CMC documentation with the IND?\n\nCross-referencing to the approved ANDA is acceptable provided that the drug used in the biomarker trials is the drug produced under the ANDA.\nQ24: What is FDA\'s current position regarding the continued use of PET drugs (Fludeoxyglucose F18 Injection, Sodium Fluoride F18 Injection, and Ammonia N13 Injection) in ongoing clinical trials for new uses of these products or to support clinical trials of therapeutic drugs?\n\nFDA\'s position is as follows:\n\nIf the PET drug used in the clinical trial is being made at a facility for which manufacturing data have been submitted in an NDA or ANDA for the PET drug, then FDA does not intend to object to use of the PET drug without an IND until December 12, 2015, if this and the other requirements in 21 CFR 312.2 are met (see 21 CFR 312.2(b)).\n\nHowever, if significant manufacturing deficiencies are found during the NDA or ANDA review, or during inspection of the facility the PET drug is sourced from, FDA may notify the sponsor that the PET drug should no longer be used in clinical trials.\n\nAfter December 12, 2015, investigational use of a PET drug must be covered by an IND unless it is exempt from all of the IND requirements.\n\nFor a PET drug that has not been approved, what documentation must be provided to support an IND that is already in effect for a therapeutic drug that relies on the PET drug to monitor disease progression or otherwise evaluate the efficacy of the therapeutic drug? Before December 12, 2015, no CMC documentation for the PET drug needs to be submitted to the IND for the therapeutic drug as long as the PET drug is manufactured at a facility for which supportive manufacturing information has been submitted in an NDA or ANDA. After December 12, 2015, for PET drugs manufactured at facilities that are not named in an approved NDA or ANDA, CMC documentation for the PET drug will need to be submitted to the IND for the therapeutic drug.\n\nHow will an investigator know whether an NDA or ANDA has been submitted and what records should be submitted to document that the PET drug was sourced from a facility named in an NDA or ANDA? Documentation should be maintained at the trial site where the investigation is being conducted that indicates the number of the NDA or ANDA that contains the CMC data for the facility from which the drug is sourced. Over the next several months, clinical investigators should make sure this documentation is in place for the PET drugs used in their investigations.\n\nIf an approved PET drug is used to determine eligibility for patient entry into an investigational therapeutic trial, will we have to submit an IND for the PET drug and an IND for the therapeutic drug? No. If the PET drug\'s use in the investigational trial is not for an approved indication, the sponsor could describe the investigational use of the PET drug in the original IND for the therapeutic drug trial. Two INDs would not be necessary in this situation. The therapeutic drug IND would need to either provide documentation that the PET drug is sourced from a facility with an approved NDA or ANDA, or provide sufficient CMC data to support its use in the trial. 3. ANDAs\n\nDo I need to use the same manufacturing process as the reference listed drug (RLD)? No. Within the context of ANDAs, FDA regulations define a drug that is ""the same as"" a listed drug to mean a generic drug that has the ""identical...active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use"" as its RLD (See 21 CFR314.92(a)(1)). Differences in the manufacturing processes do not affect whether a product may be submitted and approved under an ANDA.\nQ29: Will we need to contact the NDA holder to obtain a sample of the RLD for the comparison testing?\n\nObtaining the RLD for comparison testing is not necessary. FDA recognizes that for PET products, it may not be possible to do a direct comparison with an RLD product because of the short shelf life of these products.\nQ30: A recently approved ANDA for FDG has different inactive ingredients than its RLD, although the drug was found to be bioequivalent. Will this ANDA be considered an RLD?\n\nNo, the ANDA would not be identified as an RLD in the Orange Book.\nQ31: If an ANDA applicant is referencing an NDA, does the applicant have to perform all of the quality control testing listed in that approved NDA? For example, if the High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and osmolality testing are listed in the RLD NDA, does the ANDA applicant have to include that testing?\n\nNo. Each application is reviewed on its own merits. The application must establish the necessary quality standards, tests, and specifications, and demonstrate that the quality standards will be met over the life of the product.\nQ32: How would an ANDA applicant be able to demonstrate sameness to the RLD if the composition per batch is not known by the applicant?\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Oversight of PET Drug Products -- Questions and Answers'

REFERENCESGUIDANCE FOR INDUSTRY1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration. Although this guidance does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the industry, it does represent the agency\'s current thinking on data requirement issues related to the initial entry of an unapproved drug into human studies in the United States. For additional copies of this guidance, contact the Consumer Affairs Branch (formerly the Executive Secretariat Staff), HFD-210, CDER, FDA, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857 (Phone: 301-594-1012) or the Congressional and Consumer Affairs Branch (HFM-12), CBER, FDA, 1401 Rockville Pike (STE 200N), Rockville, MD 20852-1448 (Phone: 301-594-1800 or 800-835-4709). An electronic version of this guidance is also available via Internet by connecting to the CDER file transfer protocol (FTP) server (CDVS2.CDER.FDA.GOV).\n\n1 Introduction\n\nWith FDA\'s recent successes in meeting the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 (PDUFA) review action performance goals, and the resulting significant declines in mean and median time from submission of a marketing application to approval for marketing, attention has turned to increasing the efficiency of other components of the drug development process without sacrificing the long-standing safety and efficacy standards Americans expect their drug products to meet. One part of IND regulation of particular interest - under active discussion for more than two years and the subject of various degrees of attention since the McMahon Committee - is the regulation of the initial testing of drugs in humans (i.e., Phase 1 trials).\n\nThis guidance clarifies requirements for data and data presentation in 21 CFR 312.22 and 312.23 related to the initial entry into human studies in the United States of an investigational drug, including well-characterized, therapeutic, biotechnology-derived products2. Present regulations allow a great deal of flexibility in the amount and depth of various data to be submitted in an IND depending in large part on the phase of investigation and the specific human testing being proposed. In some cases, the extent of that flexibility has not been appreciated. FDA believes clarifications of many of these requirements will help expedite entry of new drugs into clinical testing by increasing transparency and reducing ambiguity and inconsistencies, and by reducing the amount of information submitted, while providing FDA with the data it needs to assess the safety of the proposed Phase 1 study. If the guidance specified in this document is followed, IND submissions for Phase 1 studies should usually not be larger than two to three, three inch, 3-ring binders (""jackets"").\n\nThe most significant clarifications are: 1) the explicit willingness to accept an integrated summary report of toxicology findings based upon the unaudited draft toxicologic reports of completed animal studies as initial support for human studies, and 2) specific manufacturing data appropriate for a Phase 1 investigation. For products not covered by this Guidance, other FDA guidance documents should be consulted. In addition, the Center responsible for the product may be contacted for guidance.\n\nBecause of the manufacturing and toxicologic differences between well-characterized, therapeutic, biotechnology-derived products and other biologic products, this Guidance only applies to drugs and well-characterized, therapeutic, biotechnology-derived products. For products not covered by this Guidance, the Center responsible for the product should be contacted for guidance.\n\nThis guidance applies equally to both commercial and individual investigator sponsored INDs.\n\nII Current Requirements and Practices\n\nUnder current regulations, any use in the United States of a drug product not previously authorized for marketing in the United States first requires submission of an IND to the FDA. Current regulations at 21 CFR 312.22 and 312.23 contain the general principles underlying the IND submission and the general requirements for an IND\'s content and format.\n\nIII Clarifications of Present IND Regulations\n\nAn IND submission for Phase 1 studies is required by regulation to contain the sections enumerated below. Clarifications are described when appropriate beneath each section heading.\n\nF. Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control Information [21 CFR 312.23(a)(7)]:\n\nThe regulations at 312.23(a)(7)(i) emphasize the graded nature of manufacturing and controls information. Although in each phase of the investigation sufficient information should be submitted to assure the proper identification, quality, purity, and strength of the investigational drug, the amount of information needed to make that assurance will vary with the phase of the investigation, the proposed duration of the investigation, the dosage form, and the amount of information otherwise available. For example, although stability data are required in all phases of the IND to demonstrate that the new drug substance and drug product are within acceptable chemical and physical limits for the planned duration of the proposed clinical investigation, if very short-term tests are proposed, the supporting stability data can be correspondingly very limited.\n\nIt is recognized that modifications to the method of preparation of the new drug substance and dosage form, and even changes in the dosage form itself, are likely as the investigation progresses. The emphasis in an initial Phase 1 CMC submission should, therefore, generally be placed on providing information that will allow evaluation of the safety of subjects in the proposed study. The identification of a safety concern or insufficient data to make an evaluation of safety is the only basis for a clinical hold based on the CMC section.\n\nReasons for concern may include, for example: 1) a product made with unknown or impure components; 2) a product possessing chemical structures of known or highly likely toxicity; 3) a product that cannot remain chemically stable throughout the testing program proposed; or 4) a product with an impurity profile indicative of a potential health hazard or an impurity profile insufficiently defined to assess a potential health hazard; or 5) a poorly characterized master or working cell bank.\n\nIn addition, for pre-clinical studies to be useful in assuring the safety of human studies, sponsors should be able to relate the drug product being proposed for use in a clinical study to the drug product used in the animal toxicology studies that support the safety of the proposed human study.\n\nThe information discussed in the following numbered paragraphs should usually suffice for a meaningful review of the manufacturing procedures for drug products used in Phase 1 clinical studies. Additional information should ordinarily be submitted for review of the larger-scale manufacturing procedures used to produce drug products for Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials or as part of the manufacturing section of a marketing application. Any questions sponsors have about potential large scale IND clinical trials or potential marketing application manufacturing requirements or specifications should be directed to the appropriate division in the CDER Office of New Drug Chemistry, or the appropriate CBER division with responsibility for the product, for clarification and discussion. As clinical development of a drug product proceeds, sponsors should discuss the manufacturing data that will be needed to support the safe use of their products in Phase 2 and 3 trials with the appropriate division in the CDER Office of New Drug Chemistry, or the appropriate CBER division with responsibility for the product.\n\n1 Chemistry and Manufacturing Introduction:\n\nAt the beginning of this section, the sponsor should state whether it believes: 1) the chemistry of either the drug substance or the drug product, or 2) the manufacturing of either the drug substance or the drug product, presents any signals of potential human risk. If so, these signals of potential risks should be discussed, and the steps proposed to monitor for such risk(s) should be described, or the reason(s) why the signal(s) should be dismissed should be discussed.\n\nIn addition, sponsors should describe any chemistry and manufacturing differences between the drug product proposed for clinical use and the drug product used in the animal toxicology trials that formed the basis for the sponsor\'s conclusion that it was safe to proceed with the proposed clinical study. How these differences might affect the safety profile of the drug product should be discussed. If there are no differences in the products, that should be stated.\n\nDrug Substance [312.23 (a)(7)(iv)(a)]:\n\nSponsors are reminded that, under present regulations, references to the current edition of the USP-NF may be used to satisfy some of the requirements, when applicable.\n\nInformation on the drug substance should be submitted in a summary report containing the following items.\n--------------------\nContext title: Content and Format of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-derived Products Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: As noted in sections I and II of this guidance, the purpose of this guidance is to recommend a more efficient and flexible model to evaluate multiple versions of an investigational product that would otherwise be evaluated in separate clinical studies. For a single clinical study of different versions of an investigational product where each version is submitted in a separate IND, it may be challenging to determine how to structure and organize the INDs, and how to submit changes or new information as the study progresses. The framework described here is intended to provide clarity on these topics and, as feasible, to minimize submission of the same information to multiple INDs by facilitating cross-referencing to shared information in the INDs. Sponsors may discuss their specific clinical study and planned submission approach with OTAT, CBER prior to submitting an IND (e.g., by requesting an INitial Targeted Engagement for Regulatory Advice on CBER producTs (INTERACT)3 or pre-IND meeting4).\n\nFootnote 3: For additional information about INTERACT meetings, please see https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/industry-biologics/interact-meetings.\n\nFootnote 4: See Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products, Draft Guidance for Industry, December 2017, https://www.fda.gov/media/109951/download. When finalized, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nOverview\n\nFor purposes of the framework outlined in this guidance, we refer to INDs either as ""Primary"" or ""Secondary"". The purpose of this nomenclature is to distinguish which INDs will include clinical information about the umbrella trial (Primary INDs) and which INDs will not include clinical information about the umbrella trial (Secondary INDs). For example, an IND amendment that contains only clinical information about the umbrella trial (e.g., no CMC or P/T information) would only need to be submitted to the Primary IND.\n\nFor a clinical study with two different versions of the investigational product (Product A and Product B), we recommend that the sponsor submit two separate INDs, IND A and IND B. One of the INDs, IND A, will be considered the ""Primary"" IND, and should include CMC and P/T information for Product A. IND B will be considered a ""Secondary"" IND, and will include CMC and P/T information for Product B. Primary IND A should also include complete clinical information for the umbrella\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]\n\nbetween the product versions may be submitted solely to the Primary IND and incorporated into the Secondary IND(s) by cross-reference.\n* In some cases, sponsors may decide to develop additional versions of a product after an IND has already been submitted. If the sponsor wishes to evaluate the original and additional versions of a product together in an umbrella trial, we recommend that sponsors submit an amendment to the existing IND specifying that it is a Primary IND and follow the steps in the section IV.B of this guidance to submit Secondary IND(s) and add arm(s) to the study.\n\nAppendix B Adding Arms to the Study\n\nIf the arm to be added includes a new version of the investigational cellular or gene therapy product, (e.g., Product C), we recommend that the sponsor submit:\n\nIND C with CMC and P/T information for Product C. IND C will be considered a Secondary IND. We recommend that the cover letter for a Secondary IND clearly state that the IND is a Secondary IND and specify the Primary IND number. The Secondary IND should cross-reference the Primary IND for clinical information.\n\nAn amendment to IND A with the updated clinical protocol, which now includes an arm for Product C. We recommend that the cover letter for the amendment to IND A clearly state that the IND is a Primary IND and specify the Secondary IND number(s), including IND C. We recommend that the Primary IND also be updated to include a cross-reference to the Secondary IND for CMC and P/T information related to Product C. It should be noted that the new Secondary IND C cannot go into effect until 30 days after FDA receives the new IND (21 CFR 312.40(b)(1)), unless FDA provides earlier notification that the clinical investigations in the IND may begin (21 CFR 312.40(b)(2)). Administration of Product C cannot begin until IND C goes into effect and IRB approval of the modified protocol has been granted (21 CFR 56.103).\n\nIf the arm to be added does not include a new version of the investigational cellular or gene therapy (e.g., a new arm that will study Product B in combination with a marketed product, or a new arm that will study investigational Products A and B together), then we recommend that the sponsor submit:\n\nAn amendment to the Primary IND with the updated clinical protocol (i.e., with the new arm); and\n\nAny additional P/T information supporting the new arm, if applicable, submitted to the relevant IND(s).\n\nSubmitting Other Types of Changes or New Information\n\nFor revisions to the umbrella trial clinical protocol that do not add a new arm or for other types of new clinical information, the sponsor should submit the revised protocol or new clinical information to the Primary IND. The sponsor does not need to submit any information to the Secondary INDs.\n\nFor new CMC or P/T information (e.g., changes to the CMC information, new P/T study report): if the new information is specific to one product (e.g., Product B), then that information should be submitted to IND B only. If the new information is for multiple products (e.g., Products A and B), then the new information should be submitted to INDs A and B (or submitted to IND A and cross-referenced by IND B, as mentioned previously). For new P/T information, the sponsor should also submit an updated investigator brochure to the Primary IND.\n\nClinical Holds and Responses to Hold\n\nIf only one arm (e.g., arm studying Product B) will be placed on hold, then the Primary IND would be placed on partial hold and the relevant Secondary IND would be placed on hold (or partial hold, if appropriate).\n\nIn the event that FDA issues an order placing the entire study on clinical hold (e.g., due to a safety issue that applies to all product versions), then all Primary and Secondary INDs would be placed on hold (or partial hold, if appropriate). 21 CFR 312.42(a).\n\nTo respond to a clinical hold, the sponsor will need to submit a response to each IND that was placed on hold. However, detailed information responding to each hold comment does not need to be submitted to multiple INDs. For example, if the Primary IND was placed on partial hold due to CMC concerns with a product in a Secondary IND, the sponsor should submit the CMC information responding to the hold comments to the Secondary IND. The response to hold for the Primary IND can refer to the Secondary IND for detailed information.\n\nReporting\n\nIND safety reporting must be performed in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32.7 The sponsor must submit safety reports for an investigational product to all of the sponsor\'s INDs that are relevant to that product. At a minimum, safety reports must be submitted to both the Primary IND and any Secondary IND that contains the CMC and P/T information for that product. In cases where a safety report for one product is relevant to the safety of multiple related products, the safety report must be submitted to all of the relevant INDs (21 CFR 312.32(c)). The report submitted to the\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Studying Multiple Versions of a Cellular or Gene Therapy Product in an Early-Phase Clinical Trial Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA had provided additional information about aggregate safety assessment and reporting for INDs in the guidance for industry and investigators, Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies (December 2012),64 and has proposed recommendations in the draft guidance for industry Safety Assessment for IND Safety Reporting (December 2015).65\n\n6.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhere an IND safety report is required to be submitted to FDA under 21 CFR 312.32, the investigator must also send that IND safety report to the IRB.66 The IRB may have additional reporting requirements regarding COVID-19 during the clinical trial.\n\nFootnote 66: See 21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vii) and 312.66. See also the guidance for clinical investigators, sponsors, and IRBs Adverse Event Reporting to IRBs—Improving Human Subject Protection (January 2009), available on the FDA guidance web page.\n\nQ25. Trial participants with COVID-19 may experience a number of serious and unexpected adverse clinical events, which may increase the volume of corresponding IND safety reports. If an investigator receives an IND safety report from a sponsor, is it acceptable to review only reports that the sponsor indicates will result in a change to the investigator brochure, informed consent, or protocol? Which IND safety reports must an investigator send to the IRB?\n\nNo, it is not acceptable for an investigator to review only certain IND safety reports. Under 21 CFR 312.60, investigators are responsible for protecting the safety of trial participants in a clinical investigation. IND safety reports must be sent by the sponsor to FDA and all participating investigators67 when the sponsor determines that a serious adverse event is unexpected and there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the serious adverse event, i.e., there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.68 Reviewing IND safety reports is essential for protecting the safety of trial participants because a serious and unexpected adverse event represents a new potential risk associated with the investigational product. FDA considers the review of all IND safety reports critical to fulfilling investigators\' responsibility to protect the safety of trial participants in a clinical investigation.69\n\nFootnote 67: See 21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vii) and 312.66. See also the guidance for clinical investigators, sponsors, and IRBs Adverse Event Reporting to IRBs—Improving Human Subject Protection (January 2009), available on the FDA guidance web page.\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 312.32(c)(1).\n\nFootnote 69: See 21 CFR 312.32. IND safety reports must be submitted as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. Unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reactions must be submitted no later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information (21 CFR 312.32(c)(2)).\n\nFootnote 60: See 21 CFR 312.60.\n\nFootnote 61: Many study protocols specify that the sponsor will submit IND safety reports to the IRB on the investigator’s behalf. In these situations, where the investigator receives confirmation that the report has been sent to the IRB (e.g., the investigator is copied on the report sent to the IRB by the sponsor), FDA does not intend to object to the sponsor submitting the report to the IRB on the investigator’s behalf and would not expect an investigator to provide the IRB with a duplicate copy of the report.\n\nIn addition, investigators are required under 21 CFR 312.66 to report all ""unanticipated problems involving risk to human subjects or others"" to the IRB. FDA considers a serious and unexpected adverse event that meets the criteria for sponsor reporting to FDA and all investigators in an IND safety report under 21 CFR 312.32, and would generally consider a serious adverse event that meets the criteria for safety reporting for an IND-exempt bioavailability/bioequivalence study under 21 CFR 320.31(d)(3), to be an ""unanticipated [problem] involving risk to human subjects or others"" that therefore must be reported to the IRB by the investigator.70,71\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor more information about safety reporting, see FDA\'s guidances Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies (December 2012)72 and Adverse Event Reporting to IRBs--Improving Human Subject Protection (January 2009).73\n\nFootnote 72: Available on the FDA guidance web page.\n\nFootnote 73: Available on the FDA guidance web page.\n\nFootnote 74: For the purposes of this guidance, the term electronic systems means systems, including hardware and software, that produce electronic records.\n\nFootnote 75: For the purposes of this guidance, the term electronic signature means a computer data compilation of any symbol or series of symbols executed, adopted, or authorized by an individual to be the legally binding equivalent of the individual’s handwritten signature (21 CFR 11.3(b)(7)).\n\nQ26. What considerations apply to the electronic systems used to generate electronic signatures on clinical trial records, including informed consent documents, during the COVID-19 public health emergency?\n\nElectronic systems74 used to generate electronic signatures75 on clinical trial records, including informed consent documents, during informed consent documents, during the COVID-19 public health emergency must comply with the requirements outlined in FDA regulations at 21 CFR part 11 (Part 11) when applicable.76,77\n\nFootnote 76: See 21 CFR 11.1(b). See also the guidance for industry Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures—Scope and Application (August 2003), available on the FDA guidance web page.\n\nFDA is aware that there are multiple commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software systems providing electronic signature services for clinical trial records. FDA does not certify individual electronic systems or methods to obtain Part 11 compliant electronic signatures, but COTS vendors may be able to provide sponsors and other regulated entities with information regarding whether their systems are Part 11 compliant. When such information is unavailable from the vendor, and a Part 11 compliant electronic system is required, sponsors and other regulated entities must take other steps to ensure the electronic system or software in use is Part 11 compliant. For further information regarding Part 11 compliance, see FDA\'s guidance for industry Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures--Scope and Application (August 2003)78 and the additional recommendations proposed in the draft guidance for industry Use of Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures in Clinical Investigations under 21 CFR Part 11--Questions and Answers (June 2017).79\n\nFootnote 79: For records that are not subject to Part 11, sponsors and other regulated entities should rely on their internal business practices to determine acceptable electronic signature methods and controls.\n\nFootnote 78: Available on the FDA guidance web page. When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nWhen an electronic system that is Part 11 compliant is not available, regulated entities must have an alternate means of obtaining required signatures (e.g., handwritten80 wet ink signatures executed on documents, handwritten stylus or finger-drawn signatures executed on electronic documents that are then printed or appropriately witnessed). Alternative methods for obtaining signatures on informed consent documents during the COVID-19 public health emergency are described in Q11 and Q12 of this guidance. When handwritten methods are used, the sponsor and other regulated entities should ensure that all records containing original handwritten signatures are (1) collected and archived, as either original paper copies or appropriately certifiedelectronic copies (e.g., using a validated process for scanning paper copies), and (2) retained according to applicable FDA record retention requirements.81\n\nFootnote 81: See 21 CFR 312.57, 312.62, and 812.140.\n\nQ27. Certain clinical trial protocols have an exclusion criterion for receipt of another ""investigational medical product."" If a participant receives a vaccine or other medical product for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 authorized under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), would FDA consider this receipt of an investigational medical product?\n\nWhen a medical product is being used under an EUA, it is an authorized (though not an approved or cleared) medical product for use in clinical care that has met the statutory criteria under section 564 of the FD&C Act. The product is not being studied under an IND or IDE when used pursuant to an EUA, and FDA therefore does not consider receipt under an EUA as receipt of an investigational product.82 In contrast, when the same product is used in a clinical investigation under an IND or IDE, the product\'s safety and/or effectiveness is being studied for investigational uses, and FDA would consider receipt in this situation to be receipt of an investigational product.\n\nAs always in the design of a clinical investigation, there may be valid scientific reasons to have an exclusion (and even a discontinuation) criterion for a medical product--a monoclonal antibody or vaccine, for example--whether that product was used under an EUA or not. These scientific reasons may include risks to an individual if they enroll or continue to participate in a clinical trial after receiving (or having received) the excluded product, or the potential impact of the use of the excluded product on trial objectives, such as confounding the determination of effectiveness of the product under investigation.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Institutional Review Boards']","[""This guidance document is part of FDA's overall efforts to strengthen oversight of foreign clinical trials.8 Specifically, FDA is issuing this guidance as part of its efforts to encourage sponsors and applicants to standardize information relating to foreign clinical trials in their INDs and applications for marketing approval (see (1), above).

May one member satisfy more than one membership category?","['--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n--------------------\nContext: II IRB Membership\n\n12. May a clinical investigator be an IRB member?\n\nYes, however, the IRB regulations [21] CFR 56.107(e)] prohibit any member from participating in the IRB\'s initial or continuing review of any study in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB. When selecting IRB members, the potential for conflicts of interest should be considered. When members frequently have conflicts and must absent themselves from deliberation and abstain from voting, their contributions to the group review process may be diminished and could hinder the review procedure. Even greater disruptions may result if this person is chairperson of the IRB.\n\n13. The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n\nYes. For example, one member could be otherwise unaffiliated with the institution and have a primary concern in a non-scientific area. This individual would satisfy two of the membership requirements of the regulations. IRBs should strive, however, for a membership that has a diversity of representative capacities and disciplines. In fact, the FDA regulations [21] CFR 56.107(a)] require that, as part of being qualified as an IRB, the IRB must have ""... diversity of members, including consideration of race, gender, cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes....""\n\n14. When IRB members cannot attend a convened meeting, may they send someone from their department to vote for them?No. Alternates who are formally appointed and listed in the membership roster may substitute, but ad hoc substitutes are not permissible as members of an IRB. However, a member who is unable to be present at the convened meeting may participate by video-conference or conference telephone call, when the member has received a copy of the documents that are to be reviewed at the meeting. Such members may vote and be counted as part of the quorum. If allowed by IRB procedures, ad hoc substitutes may attend as consultants and gather information for the absent member, but they may not be counted toward the quorum or participate in either deliberation or voting with the board. The IRB may, of course, ask questions of this representative just as they could of any non-member consultant. Opinions of the absent members that are transmitted by mail, telephone, telefax or e-mail may be considered by the attending IRB members but may not be counted as votes or the quorum for convened meetings.\n\n15 May the IRB use alternate members?\n\nThe use of formally appointed alternate IRB members is acceptable to the FDA, provided that the IRB\'s written procedures describe the appointment and function of alternate members. The IRB roster should identify the primary member(s) for whom each alternate member may substitute. To ensure maintaining an appropriate quorum, the alternate\'s qualifications should be comparable to the primary member to be replaced. The IRB minutes should document when an alternate member replaces a primary member. When alternates substitute for a primary member, the alternate member should have received and reviewed the same material that the primary member received or would have received.\n\n16 Does a non-affiliated member need to attend every IRB meeting?\n\nNo. Although 21 CFR 56.108(c) does not specifically require the presence of a member not otherwise affiliated with the institution to constitute a quorum, FDA considers the presence of such members an important element of the IRB\'s diversity. Therefore, frequent absence of all non-affiliated members is not acceptable to FDA. Acknowledging their important role, many IRBs have appointed more than one member who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution. FDA encourages IRBs to appoint members in accordance with 21 CFR 56.107(a) who will be able to participate fully in the IRB process.\n\n17 Which IRB members should be considered to be scientists and non-scientists?\n\n21 CFR 56.107(c) requires at least one member of the IRB to have primary concerns in the scientific area and at least one to have primary concerns in the non-scientific area. Most IRBs include physicians and Ph.D. level physical or biological scientists. Such members satisfy the requirement for at least one scientist. When an IRB encounters studies involving science beyond the expertise of the members, the IRB may use a consultant to assist in the review, as provided by 21 CFR 56.107(f).\n\nFDA believes the intent of the requirement for diversity of disciplines was to include members who had little or no scientific or medical training or experience. Therefore, nurses, pharmacists and other biomedical health professionals should not be regarded to have ""primary concerns in the non-scientific area."" In the past, lawyers, clergy and ethicists have been cited as examples of persons whose primary concerns would be in non-scientific areas.\n\nSome members have training in both scientific and non-scientific disciplines, such as a J.D., R.N. While such members are of great value to an IRB, other members who are unambiguously non-scientific should be appointed to satisfy the non-scientist requirement.\n\nIII. IRB Procedures\n\n18. The FDA regulations [21 CFR 56.104(c)] exempt an emergency use of a test article from prospective IRB review, however, ""... any subsequent use of the test article at the institution is subject to IRB review."" What does the phrase ""subsequent use"" mean?\n\nFDA regulations allow for one emergency use of a test article in an institution without prospective IRB review, provided that such emergency use is reported to the IRB within five working days after such use. An emergency use is defined as a single use (or single course of treatment, e.g., multiple doses of antibiotic) with one subject. ""Subsequent use"" would be a second use with that subject or the use with another subject.\n\nIn its review of the emergency use, if it is anticipated that the test article may be used again, the IRB should request a protocol and consent document(s) be developed so that an approved protocol would be in place when the next need arises. In spite of the best efforts of the clinical investigator and the IRB, a situation may occur where a second emergency use needs to be considered. FDA believes it is inappropriate to deny emergency treatment to an individual when the only obstacle is lack of time for the IRB to convene, review the use and give approval.\n\n19. Are there any regulations that require clinical investigators to report to the IRB when a study has been completed?\n\nIRBs are required to function under written procedures. One of these procedural requirements [21 CFR 56.108(a)(3)] requires ensuring ""prompt reporting to the IRB of changes in a research activity."" The completion of the study is a change in activity and should be reported to the IRB. Although subjects will no longer be ""at risk"" under the study, a final report/notice to the IRB allows it to close its files as well as providing information that may be used by the IRB in the evaluation and approval of related studies.\n\n20. What is expedited review?\n\nExpedited review is a procedure through which certain kinds of research may be reviewed and approved without convening a meeting of the IRB. The Agency\'s IRB regulations [21 CFR 56.110] permit, but do not require, an IRB to review certain categories of research through an exedited procedure if the research involves no more than minimal risk. A list of categories was last published in the Federal Register on January 27, 1981 [46 FR 8980].\n\nThe IRB may also use the expedited review procedure to review minor changes in previously approved research during the period covered by the original approval. Under an expedited review procedure, review of research may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced members of the IRB designated by the chairperson. The reviewer(s) may exercise all the authorities of the IRB, except disapproval. Research may only be disapproved following review by the full committee. The IRB is required to adopt a method of keeping all members advised of research studies that have been approved by expedited review.\n\n[See Conditions for IRB Use of Expedited Review - Federal Register: November 9, 1998 (Volume 63, Number 216), Notices (/about-fda/page-not-found)]\n\n21. The number of studies we review has increased, and the size of the package of review materials we send to IRB members is becoming formidable. Must we send the full package to all IRB members?\n\nThe IRB system was designed to foster open discussion and debate at convened meetings of the full IRB membership. While it is preferable for every IRB member to have personal copies of all study materials, each member must be provided with sufficient information to be able to actively and constructively participate. Some institutions have developed a ""primary reviewer"" system to promote a thorough review. Under this system, studies are assigned to one or more IRB members for a full review of all materials. Then, at the convened IRB meeting the study is presented by the primary reviewer(s) and, after discussion by IRB members, a vote for an action is taken.\n\nThe ""primary reviewer"" procedure is acceptable to the FDA if each member receives, at a minimum; a copy of consent documents and a summary of the protocol in sufficient detail to determine the appropriateness of the study-specific statements in the consent documents. In addition, the complete documentation should be available to all members for their review, both before and at the meeting. The materials for review should be received by the membership sufficiently in advance of the meeting to allow for adequate review of the materials.\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nSponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/sponsor-investigator-irb-interrelationship). Office of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nThe interrelationship and interaction between the research sponsor (e.g., drug, biologic and device manufacturers), the clinical investigator and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) may be very complex. The regulations do not prohibit direct sponsor-IRB contacts, although, the sponsor-IRB interaction customarily occurs through the investigator who conducts the clinical study. The clinical investigator generally provides the communication link between the IRB and the sponsor. Such linkage is agreed to by the sponsors and investigators when they sign forms FDA-1571 and FDA-1572, respectively, for drug and biologic studies or an investigator agreement for device studies. There are occasions when direct communication between the IRB and the sponsor may facilitate resolution of concerns about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The clinical investigator should be kept apprised of the discussion.\n\nSponsor Assurance that IRBs Operate in Compliance with 21 CFR Part 56\n\nFDA regulations [21 CFR 312.23(a)(1)(iv)] require that a sponsor assure the FDA that a study will be conducted in compliance with the informed consent and IRB regulations [21 CFR parts 50 and 56]. This requirement has been misinterpreted to mean that it is a sponsor\'s obligation to determine IRB compliance with the regulations. This is not the case. Sponsors should rely on the clinical investigator, who assures the sponsor on form FDA-1572 for drugs and biologics or the investigator agreement for devices that the study will be reviewed by an IRB. Because clinical investigators work directly with IRBs, it is appropriate that they assure the sponsor that the IRB is functioning in compliance with the regulations.\n\nAn IRB must notify an investigator in writing of its decision to approve, disapprove or request modifications in a proposed research activity [21 CFR 56.109(e)]. This correspondence should be made available to the sponsor by the clinical investigator. In the Agency\'s view, this required documentation provides the sponsor with reasonable assurance that an IRB complies with 21 CFR part 56 and that it will be responsible for initial and continuing review of the study. Also, the sponsor and, in fact, anyone who is interested, mayobtain an Establishment Inspection Report from an FDA inspection of an IRB. These reports summarize the conditions observed during the IRB inspection. FDA, however, does not certify IRBs.\n\nSponsor Access to Medical Records\n\nThe IRB is responsible for ensuring that informed consent documents include the extent to which the confidentiality of medical records will be maintained [21 CFR 50.25(a)(5)]. FDA requires sponsors (or research monitors hired by them) to monitor the accuracy of the data submitted to FDA in accordance with regulatory requirements. These data are generally in the possession of the clinical investigator. Each subject must be advised during the informed consent process of the extent to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained and of the possibility that the FDA may inspect the records. While FDA access to medical records is a regulatory requirement, subject names are not usually requested by FDA unless the records of particular individuals require a more detailed study of the cases, or unless there is reason to believe that the records do not represent actual cases studied or actual results obtained. The consent document should list all other entities (e.g., the sponsor) who will have access to records identifying the subject. The extent to which confidentiality will be maintained may affect a subject\'s decision to participate in a clinical investigation.\n\nConfidentiality of Sponsor Information\n\nThe IRB\'s primary responsibility with respect to protecting confidentiality is to the research subject. IRBs should, however, respect the sponsor\'s need to maintain confidentiality of certain information about products under development. IRB members and staff should be aware that information submitted for review may be confidential, trade secret, and of commercial interest and should recognize the need for maintaining the confidentiality of the review materials and IRB records. It is advisable for IRBs to have policies that address this issue.\n\nNonsignificant Risk Device Studies\n\n""A sponsor\'s preliminary determination that a medical device study presents an NSR is subject to IRB approval."" The effect of the IRB\'s NSR decision is important to research sponsors and investigators because significant risk (SR) studies require sponsors to file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with FDA before they may begin. NSR studies, however, may begin as soon as the IRB approves the study. The sponsor, usually through the clinical investigator, provides the IRB with information necessary to make a judgment on the risk of a device study. While the investigational plan and supporting materials usually contain sufficient information to make a determination, the IRB can request additional information if needed [21 CFR 812.150(b)(10)]. If the IRB believes that additional information is needed, it may contact the sponsor directly, but it should keep the clinical investigator apprised of the request. While making the SR/NSR determination, any of the three parties may ask FDA to provide a risk assessment. See FDA Information Sheet: ""Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies"" for further information.\n\nDisagreements\n\nThe sponsor may choose not to conduct, to terminate, or to discontinue studies that do not conform with the sponsor\'s wishes. For example, the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB may reach an impasse about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The FDA will not mediate such disagreements.

May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsor\n\nFor studies conducted under an IND, 21 CFR part 312 provides that a sponsor is responsible for obtaining a commitment from each investigator that he or she will ensure that requirements in part 56 relating to IRB review and approval are met with respect to the research conducted by the investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d)). Sponsors can also initiate plans for use of a centralized IRB review process and facilitate agreements and other necessary communications among the parties involved.\n\n3.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.1.2 Investigator\n\nUnder 21 CFR part 312, an investigator is responsible for ensuring that there will be initial and continuing review by a qualified IRB of research conducted by that investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d); 312.66). If the investigator is conducting clinical research as part of a multicenter study at an institution with its own IRB and is subject to the policies of that institution, those policies would dictate how the investigator will ensure IRB review. Those policies may provide that the investigator\'s responsibility can be met by ensuring review through a centralized IRB review, through the institution\'s IRB, or through apportionment of IRB review responsibilities between a centralized IRB and the institution\'s IRB.\n\nCentral IRB\n\nFor multicenter studies, the central IRB is the IRB that conducts reviews on behalf of all study sites that agree to participate in the centralized review process. For sites at institutions that have an IRB that would ordinarily review research conducted at the site, the central IRB should reach agreement with the individual institutions participating in centralized review and those institutions\' IRBs about how to apportion the review responsibilities between local IRBs and the central IRB (21 CFR 56.114).\n\nIV Addressing Local Aspects of IRB Review\n\nThe implementation of a centralized IRB review process involves addressing a number of issues related to the communities where the research will take place. The requirements for IRB membership in 21 CFR 56.107(a) specify that the membership of an IRB must have sufficient experience, expertise, and diversity to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. This requirement was intended to implement a recommendation of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research that IRB members be ""men and women of diverse backgrounds and sufficient maturity, experience, and competence to assure that the Board will be able to discharge its responsibilities and that its determinations will be accorded respect by investigators and the community served by the institution or in which it is located.""1 In addition, IRB members must ""be able to ascertain the acceptability of the proposed research in terms of institutional commitments and regulations, applicable law, and standards or professional conduct and practice"" (21 CFR 56.107(a)). Thus, IRB review, through its membership, is intended to provide meaningful consideration of various local factors in assessing research activities, including the cultural backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, educational level, religious affiliations) of the population from which research subjects will be drawn, community attitudes10 about the nature\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nof the proposed research, and the capacity of the institution to conduct or support the proposed research. Inter-community differences could influence, among other things, assessments of whether mechanisms of subject selection will be equitable, whether adequate provision is made to minimize risks to vulnerable populations, and the adequacy of the informed consent process.\n\nThe preamble to the final rule indicates that where a centralized IRB review process is used (21 CFR 56.114), the review should consider the ethical standards of the local community.11 Therefore, a centralized IRB review process should include mechanisms to ensure meaningful consideration of these relevant local factors. Possible mechanisms include:\n\nFootnote 11: Federal Register, Vol. 46, p. 8966, January 27, 1981\n\nProvision of relevant local information to the central IRB in writing by individuals or organizations familiar with the local community, institution, and/or clinical research\n\nParticipation of consultants with relevant expertise, or IRB members from the institution\'s own IRB, in the deliberations of the central IRB\n\nLimited review of a central IRB-reviewed study by the institution\'s own IRB, with that limited review focusing on issues that are of concern to the local community\n\nOther mechanisms may also be appropriate.12 IRB meeting minutes or other records should document how relevant community issues were considered in the review (21 CFR 56.115(a)) (see section 5).\n\nFootnote 12: Guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) (IRB Knowledge of Local Research Context) discusses mechanisms for ensuring adequate consideration of local factors by IRBs in review of clinical research that is supported by DHHS funding. Although the guidance applies only to DHHS funded research, it may be also helpful to off-site IRBs seeking to provide meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for non-DHHS funded clinical research.\n\n5 IRB Records -- Documenting Agreements and Procedures\n\nIRBs and institutions are required to prepare and maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities (21 CFR 56.115(a)). IRBs are also required to follow written procedures for the conduct of initial and continuing review of clinical research and for reporting their findings and actions to the investigator and the institution (21 CFR section 56.108(a), 56.115(a)(6)). The following recommendations should help IRBs fulfill these requirements.\n\nDocumenting Agreements\n\nIf an institution, its IRB, and a central IRB agree (under 21 CFR 56.114) to participate in a centralized IRB review process, they should document that action in an agreement signed by the parties. IRBs should report this action to the investigator and the institution, for example, by providing copies of the agreement to the investigator, and the institution.13 If the agreement\n\n3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApportions IRB review responsibilities between a central IRB and the institution\'s IRB, the agreement should delineate the specific responsibilities of the central IRB and the institution\'s IRB for the initial and continuing review of the study.\n\nWritten Procedures\n\nWhen an institution and an institution\'s IRB rely on review by a central IRB, both IRBs must have written procedures in place to implement the centralized IRB review process (21 CFR 56.108, 56.114). For example, procedures should address the following:\n\nHow the institution\'s IRB determines that the central IRB is qualified to review research conducted at the institution\n\nHow the central IRB intends to communicate with relevant institutions, the institutions\' IRBs, and investigators regarding its review\n\nHow the central IRB ensures that it provides meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for communities from which research subjects will be drawn (see Section 4)\n\nHow the central IRB assesses the ability of a geographically remote site to participate in a study (e.g., whether the site has medical services appropriate to the complexity of the study)\n\nWhen an institution, an institution\'s IRB, and a central IRB agree to apportion IRB review responsibilities between the two IRBs, each IRB must have written procedures describing how it implements its responsibilities under the agreement (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)).\n\nVI Using a Central IRB at Unaffiliated Sites\n\nAt clinical sites that are not already affiliated with an IRB, investigators and sponsors typically rely on the review and oversight of a central IRB. In this situation, the central IRB should document in meeting minutes or other records how it considered relevant local factors for the various communities from which research subjects are to be drawn (see Section 4). The central IRB must also document its action in agreeing to conduct IRB review for the site (21 CFR 56.115) and must have written procedures in place that describe how it will perform its initial and continuing review responsibilities at remote sites (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)) (see Section 5).\n\nVII Examples of Cooperative IRB Review Models\n\nThere are a variety of mechanisms that have been used to distribute IRB review responsibilities between an institution\'s IRB and a central IRB. This guidance is not intended to endorse any particular mechanism. These examples are provided only to illustrate possible mechanisms.\n\nTrial in Which Multiple Sites Rely on a Central IRB\n\nThe primary model contemplated by this guidance is a centralized IRB review process used for a single multicenter trial performed by a commercial or publicly funded sponsor. Under 21 CFR 56.114, IRBs affiliated with the study sites could enter into agreements with a central IRB to rely on all or some of the review findings of the central IRB, or could decline to participate in a centralized IRB review (i.e., do their own complete review). Study sites not already affiliated with an IRB would rely on a central IRB for all IRB review responsibilities.\n\nCentral IRB Formed to Review Multicenter Trials in a Therapeutic Category\n--------------------\nContext title: Using a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials Guidance for Industry'

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA also recommends that the IRB notify the sponsor of any instance of serious or continuing non-compliance with FDA regulations or IRB requirements or determinations, and any suspension or termination of IRB approval. Among the general responsibilities of sponsors is the assurance of proper monitoring of the investigation (21 CFR 312.50 and 21 CFR 812.40) and the selection of qualified investigators (21 CFR 312.53(a) and 21 CFR 812.43(a)). Informing sponsors of investigator non-compliance or IRB suspension or termination of the study allows the sponsor the opportunity to address these concerns. For example, the sponsor could work with the investigator to transfer subjects to another site in the local area, find a replacement investigator at the current site, or ensure that the study is terminated in an orderly manner.\n\n2.2.2 Suspension or Termination of IRB Approval\n\nThe IRB has the authority to suspend or terminate approval of clinical investigations:\n\nthat are not conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements (21 CFR 56.113); or\n\nthat are associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects (21 CFR 56.113).\n\nSuspension of approval may be appropriate when a significant issue is first identified and while the IRB investigates the matter. For example, if there is an allegation of investigator misconduct or a safety issue that needs further investigation and evaluation, the IRB may decide to suspend the study until the matter is resolved. In addition, the IRB may determine whether it is appropriate to notify subjects, and if so, when, given that complete information may not be available when the IRB first becomes aware of the issue.\n\nFor multi-site studies in which a local IRB is responsible for review of research at a given site, the local IRB's decision to suspend or terminate its approval of the research only applies to the conduct of the research project at the site under its review. On the other hand, if many or all sites engaged in a multi-site study rely upon a central IRB for review of the research, the central IRB could suspend or terminate its approval of the research either at one site because of a problem regarding the conduct of the research at that site, or at all sites under its review because of a study-wide problem. If an IRB (whose authority is only over a single site) believes the problem it found may be present at other sites, the IRB should inform FDA of its concern in the suspension or termination notification.\n\nAny suspension or termination of IRB approval must include the reasons for the IRB's actions and be promptly reported to the clinical investigator, institutional officials, and the FDA (21 CFR 56.113). IRBs must follow written procedures for ensuring such reporting (21 CFR 56.108(b)(3)).\n\nWhen reporting suspensions or terminations of IRB approval to FDA, IRBs should include:\n\nthe name of the drug, biologic, or device;the IND number; or the IDE number/non-significant risk (NSR) status of the device;\n\nthe full name of the research protocol;\n\nthe name(s) and address(es) of the clinical investigator(s);\n\nthe reason(s) for the suspension or termination; and\n\ninformation about the IRB's investigation and action plan to prevent/address future non-compliance.\n\nIRBs that have concerns about suspension or termination of approval of studies may contact FDA at any time to discuss these issues.27\n\nFootnote 27: See http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/ucm134493.htm\n\nWhen a study is suspended or terminated by the IRB, the IRB should consider the need to inform current or previously enrolled study subjects, as appropriate, about the action. In addition, an IRB should have established procedures to ensure that the rights and welfare of currently enrolled subjects are protected, subjects are not put at risk, and subjects receive appropriate care, if indicated, should the IRB (a) suspend or terminate its approval during the period for which IRB approval had already been given, or (b) disapprove a study at the time of continuing review. For example, the IRB, in consultation with the investigator and the subjects' treating physicians (if different from the investigator), may need to determine whether it is in the best interests of currently enrolled subjects to (a) continue receiving the interventions that were being administered to subjects under the study at the present site, (b) be transferred to another study-site so that participation of the subjects in the study may continue, or (c) be transitioned to medical management outside of the research context. Continuation of subjects on the test article may be appropriate, for example, when the test article holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the study subjects or when withholding the test article poses increased risk to study subjects. If the IRB decides that enrolled subjects should continue to receive the test article, it should also ensure that data collection (especially safety information) continues for such subjects. If follow-up of currently enrolled subjects is necessary to ensure their rights, safety or welfare, the IRB should ensure that the investigators inform the subjects, and report any unanticipated problems to the IRB, the sponsor, and the FDA (see 21 CFR 56.108(b)).\n\nAppendix\n\nCATEGORIES OF RESEARCH THAT MAY BE REVIEWED BY THE INSTITITUDINAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB) THROUGH AN EXPEDITION REVIEW PROCEDURE({}^{\\lx@sectionsign})1\n\nFootnote 1: An expedited review procedure consists of a review of research involving human subjects by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of the IRB in accordance with the requirements set forth in 45 CFR 46.110.\n\n[Federal Register: November 9, 1998 (Volume 63, Number 216)] [Notices] [Page 60353-60356]*\n\nFootnote *: The list may be viewed online via GPO Access at http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dhname=1998 register&docid=98-29748-filed.pdf\n\nThe list that is referenced in Sec. 56.110(a) was originally published in the Federal Register of January 27, 1981 (46 FR 8980), as a notice of a list of research activities that could be reviewed by the IRB through the expedited review procedures set forth in the FDA's regulations. OPRR has a separate codification that references the Expedited Review List for matters under the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) jurisdiction (45 CFR part 46). The HHS list was published in the Federal Register on January 26, 1981 (46 FR 8392). The FDA and HHS lists published in 1981 differ slightly, in that item nine on the HHS list, concerning research on individual or group behavior, pertains only to 45 CFR 46.110. Because behavioral research is not specifically regulated by FDA, that category was not included in the list published by FDA.\n\nApplicability\n\n(A) Research activities that (1) present no more than minimal risk to human subjects, and (2) involve only procedures listed in one or more of the following categories, may be reviewed by the IRB through the expedited review procedure authorized by 45 CFR 46.110 and 21 CFR 56.110. The activities listed should not be deemed to be of minimal risk simply because they are included on this list. Inclusion on this list merely means that the activity is eligible for review through the expedited review procedure when the specific circumstances of the proposed research involve no more than minimal risk to human subjects. (B) The categories in this list apply regardless of the age of subjects, except as noted. (C) The expedited review procedure may not be used where identification of the subjects and/or their responses would reasonably place them at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, insurability, reputation, or be stigmatizing, unless reasonable and appropriate protections will be implemented so that risks related to invasion of privacy and breach of confidentiality are no greater than minimal. (D) The expedited review procedure may not be used for classified research involving human subjects. (E) IRBs are reminded that the standard requirements for informed consent (or its waiver, alteration, or exception) apply regardless of the type of review--expedited or convened-utilized by the IRB. (F) Categories one (1) through seven (7) pertain to both initial and continuing IRB review.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nResearch Categories\n\n(1) Clinical studies of drugs and medical devices only when condition (a) or (b) is met. (a) Research on drugs for which an investigational new drug application (21 CFR Part 312) is not required;\n\n(Note: Research on marketed drugs that significantly increases the risks or decreases the acceptability of the risks associated with the use of the product is not eligible for expedited review.)\n\n(b) Research on medical devices for which (i) an investigational device exemption application (21 CFR Part 812) is not required; or (ii) the medical device is cleared/approved for marketing and the medical device is being used in accordance with its cleared/approved labeling.\n\n(2) Collection of blood samples by finger stick, heel stick, ear stick, or venipuncture as follows: (a) From healthy, nonpregnant adults who weigh at least 110 pounds. For these subjects, the amounts drawn may not exceed 550 ml in an 8 week period and collection may not occur more frequently than 2 times per week; or (b) from other adults and children,1 considering the age, weight, and health of the subjects, the collection procedure, the amount of blood to be collected, the frequency with which it will be collected. For these subjects, the amount drawn may not exceed the lesser of 50 ml or 3 ml per kg in an 8 week period and collection may not occur more frequently than 2 times per week.\n--------------------\nContext title: IRB Continuing Review After Clinical Investigation Approval Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors""]","['Yes.

For more information visit: https://www.fda.gov/international-programs/international-arrangements/mutual-recognition-agreement-mra.\n\nFootnote 8: See FDA guidance for industry Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (April 2021).\n\n2.2.2 What types of inspections would be deemed ""mission-critical""?\n\nA2: FDA\'s assessment of whether an inspection is mission-critical considers many factors related to the public health benefit of U.S. patients having access to the product subject to inspection. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether the product has received breakthrough therapy designation, orphan-drug designation, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation; is included in the Drug Shortage or CBER-Regulated Products Shortage list; is used for critical care or as a medical countermeasure; is used to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a serious disease or medical condition, including COVID-19, for which there is no other appropriate and available treatment. Therefore, for-cause (including follow-up and where a specific drug quality problem or facility issues come to FDA\'s attention), preapproval, and pre-license inspections can be deemed mission-critical. When determining whether to conduct a mission-critical inspection, FDA also takes into account concerns about the safety of its investigators, employees at a site or facility, and where applicable, clinical trial participants and other patients at investigator sites.\n\n2.3 Does FDA determine what is ""mission-critical"" using the same factors for both domestic and foreign inspections?\n\nA3: Yes, the determination is made considering the same factors regardless of whether the site is domestic or foreign.\n\n2.2.4 How will FDA ensure the quality of imported products while inspections are limited?\n\nA4: During this interim period, FDA is expanding the use of other tools and approaches for assessing manufacturing facilities, when appropriate, to help ensure the quality of the drug products imported into the United States. These may include physical examinations of products arriving at U.S. borders or product sampling and testing before release into commerce, reviewing the compliance histories of facilities, using information shared by trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements, requestingrecords directly from facilities ""in advance of or in lieu of"" certain drug inspections,9 and conducting remote interactive evaluations where appropriate. If a product appears not to meet applicable standards for safety, effectiveness, or quality based on these approaches, FDA has the authority to refuse admission of the product into the United States.10\n\nFDA continues to work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to target products intended for importation into the United States that violate applicable legal requirements for FDA-regulated products. FDA has the ability to use a risk-based analytics tool (Predictive Risk-based Evaluation for Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT)) to electronically screen regulated shipments imported or offered for import into the United States.11 PREDICT uses automated data mining, pattern discovery, and automated queries of FDA databases to determine the potential risk of a shipment. It takes into consideration the inherent risk of a product and also information about the previous history of importers, manufacturers, and shippers.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 10: See section 801(a) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: For more details visit FDA’s Entry Screening Systems and Tools page at https://www.fda.gov/industr/import-systems/entry-screening-systems-and-tools.\n\nQ5: How will travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency affect my application?\n\nA5: During the COVID-19 public health emergency, FDA is using all available tools and sources of information to support regulatory decisions on applications12 that include sites impacted by travel restrictions due to COVID-19. For example, FDA will continue the assessment of all applications per normal assessment operations for all disciplines, where all manufacturing facilities will be evaluated using a risk-based approach consistent with existing guidelines. Similarly, the need for and selection of sites for BIMO inspections will continue to be risk-based, considering application and site-specific factors. During this interim period, FDA is using alternative tools, where available, to determine or mitigate the need for an inspection and to support the application assessment. This includes reviewing a firm\'s previous compliance history, using information sharing from trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements, requesting records ""in advance of or in lieu of"" facility inspections13 or voluntarily from facilities and sites, and conducting remote interactive evaluations where appropriate.\n\nFootnote 12: See 21 CFR 314.50(d), 314.94(a), and 601.20(d).\n\nCDER and CBER are continuing to evaluate applications, strategically applying a holistic approach in the decision-making process to determine if an inspection is warranted or if an inspection is no longer needed due to information gained through the use of the alternative tools mentioned above. FDA will continue to work directly with the applicants of those impacted applications.\n\nFDA is also working directly with facilities to communicate any issues identified through a review of records or other information requested. For example, for both CDER- and CBER-regulated products, interim processes have been implemented to communicate with manufacturing facilities regarding issues identified following a review of records or other information requested ""in advance of or in lieu of"" a preapproval or pre-license inspection. Responses from the facility regarding these issues will, as feasible, be considered before taking an action on a pending application.\n\nThe Agency encourages applicants to be in communication with all their facilities and sites to ensure timely responses to any inquiries to support application assessment.\n\nQ6: If my application includes sites that cannot be inspected because of travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency will my application automatically receive a complete response letter?\n\nA6: No, FDA will not automatically issue a complete response (CR) letter if FDA cannot conduct an inspection because of travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency.14 Decisions regarding applications will be based on the totality of the information available to FDA, including information obtained from use of the alternative tools as described in Q5/A5.\n\nFootnote 14: For mission-critical and prioritized domestic inspections needed to support application approval, FDA aims to conduct those inspections during the review of the application. However, in cases where travel restrictions due to the public health emergency prevent FDA from performing those inspections during the review clock, recommendations in Q6/A6 are applicable.\n\nBased on an assessment of the product information provided in the application and based on available information about the facility or site, FDA will take one of the following actions:\n\nFDA plans to *approve\n\nthe application if\n\nAvailable information, including information obtained from the use of alternate tools, supports the adequacy of the facilities and sites named in a pending application, no other deficiencies have been identified, and the application otherwise satisfies the requirements for approval.15 Footnote 15: See 21 CFR 314.50, 314.94, and 601.2.\n\nIn this case, the need for an inspection could be sufficiently mitigated by the FDA\'s use of alternate tools, including a firm\'s responses to outstanding issues identified from the use of alternate tools (see Q5/A5).\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter with facility- or site-related deficiencies\n\nAvailable information from a prior FDA or mutual recognition agreement inspection or the use of alternate tools identifies concerns about the adequacy of a facility or site, and an inspection needed to address those concerns cannot be completed during the review cycle, or\n\nResponses to outstanding issues identified from requested records and other alternate sources (see Q5/A5) are not sufficient to address the issues identified for a facility or site.\n\nIn this case, FDA intends to inform the applicant of the facility or site issues as soon as possible during the review cycle. Specifically, FDA intends to inform the applicant that an inspection will be needed before the application can be approved\nand that the inspection may not be conducted before the action date due to restrictions on travel. * FDA generally intends to issue a CR letter, including a deficiency related to the facility or site, if the inspection has not been conducted by the action date.\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter without facility or site deficiencies\n\nAn inspection is necessary because there is insufficient information currently available to make a determination on the acceptability of a facility or site16,17 and other deficiencies have been identified.\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats such as emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to describe how we will request and conduct voluntary remote interactive evaluations at facilities2 where drugs3 are manufactured, processed, packed, or held; facilities covered under FDA\'s bioresearch monitoring (BIMO) program; and outsourcing facilities registered under section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nFootnote 2: In this guidance, the term facility covers persons, sites, and establishments subject to FDA drug manufacturing and bioresearch monitoring regulations and statutory authority.\n\nFootnote 3: In this guidance, the term drug includes biologics.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]\n\nconduct an evaluation. In this guidance, we refer to our use of any combination of these interactive tools as a remote interactive evaluation. FDA may request to conduct a remote interactive evaluation prior to or following other types of regulatory oversight activities (e.g., an inspection or a request for records or other information).7\n\nFootnote 7: A remote interactive evaluation is not the same as an inspection as described in section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act or a request for records or other information in advance of or in lieu of an inspection, as described in section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act. Similarly, a remote interactive evaluation or a request under section 704(a)(4) does not constitute an inspection for purposes of section 510(h)(3) of the FD&C Act. Section 704(a)(4) does not apply to every inspection program covered by this guidance (e.g., section 704(a)(4) does not apply to the BIMO inspection program). Failure to cooperate with either an inspection or a 704(a)(4) request for records or other information may constitute a limiting of inspection and as a result, FDA may deem the relevant drugs manufactured at these establishments adulterated. See the guidance for industry Circumstances that Constitute Delaying, Denying, Limiting, or Refusing a Drug Inspection (October 2014) for further information.\n\nIII Planning a Remote Interactive Evaluation\n\nFDA may request to conduct a remote interactive evaluation whenever a program office determines it is appropriate based on mission needs and any travel limitations. FDA conducts inspections for many purposes and programs, and we will consider each of those inspection program areas as possible candidates for a remote interactive evaluation. This policy applies to all drug inspection programs including, but not limited to:\n\nPre-Approval Inspections (PAIs) and Pre-License Inspections (PLIs): FDA may perform a PAI or PLI to assess a marketing application. FDA uses these inspections to ensure that any facility named or referenced in support of an application can perform the proposed manufacturing operations in conformance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements, to verify conformance with the application, and to confirm that data submitted in the application are accurate and complete.\n\nPost-Approval Inspections (PoAIs): PoAIs focus on a specific drug and changes to its manufacturing operations, the evaluation of process validation, any changes submitted to the application, and the execution of supporting activities according to application commitments and CGMP requirements.\n\nSurveillance Inspections: Surveillance drug quality inspections examine overall operations, including controls that ensure manufacturing processes produce quality drugs, thereby reducing the risk of adulterated or misbranded drugs reaching consumers and patients. FDA uses surveillance inspections to evaluate the CGMP compliance of manufacturing operations. Surveillance inspections are performed at active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product manufacturing facilities, as well as outsourcing facilities that have registered with FDA under section 503B of the FD&C Act.\n\nFollow-Up and Compliance Inspections: When a specific drug quality problem or facility issue comes to FDA\'s attention, we may initiate a follow-up or compliance drug quality inspection. For example, FDA may conduct an inspection to investigate: (1) product safety, effectiveness, or quality concerns arising from defect reports; (2) information provided by an informant about a facility; (3) violata facility that were discovered during the inspection of another facility; or (4) corrective actions undertaken by a facility in response to, for example, a warning letter or regulatory meeting.\n--------------------\nContext title: Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry'

FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to provide answers to frequently asked questions about regulatory and policy issues related to inspections, pending drug applications, and changes in manufacturing facilities for approved pharmaceutical products.1 This document updates the guidance of the same title issued in August 2020, and revised in January 2021.\n\nFootnote 1: In this guidance, the terms drug and pharmaceutical product include biological products.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS) (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\nFDA has issued guidance on how to implement manufacturing process and facility changes; relevant guidances that describe the process for reporting changes to an application can be found in section V. References. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), and the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) remain fully capable of continuing daily activities, such as application assessments, including facility evaluation and certain inspection activities, while responding to public health needs related to the current COVID-19 pandemic. As this remains an evolving and very dynamic situation, FDA will continue to be flexible and as transparent as possible.\n\nInspections\n\nThe following questions and answers are intended to provide information regarding common queries related to inspections for facilities manufacturing pharmaceutical products and sites involved in the conduct of clinical, analytical, and nonclinical studies.\n\nQ1: How are inspections impacted by COVID-19?\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA has continued, on a case-by-case basis, to conduct mission-critical inspections and other activities to ensure that FDA-regulated pharmaceutical products are meeting applicable FDA requirements.\n\nIn the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA announced that it was temporarily postponing all domestic and foreign routine surveillance facility inspections. Similarly, routine surveillance inspections in support of the Bioresearch Monitoring (BIMO) program were postponed.\n\nBeginning the week of July 20, 2020, FDA resumed prioritized domestic inspections, as described in the FDA statement ""Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA prepares for resumption of domestic inspections with new risk assessment system"" issued on July 10, 2020.4 As explained in this statement, FDA uses its COVID-19 Advisory Rating system to determine what categories of regulatory activity can take place in a given geographic region. Based on this determination, FDA is either continuing, on a case-by-case basis, to conduct only ""mission-critical"" inspections,5 or, where possible to do so safely, resuming prioritized domestic inspections, which generally include preapproval, pre-license, surveillance, and for-cause inspections. For the foreseeable future, prioritized domestic inspections will be pre-announced to FDA-regulated businesses.6 This helps ensure the safety of the investigator and the firm\'s employees, providing the safest possible environment to accomplish FDA\'s regulatory activities, while also ensuring the appropriate staff are on-site to assist FDA staff with inspection activities.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCurrently, certain inspections (e.g., foreign preapproval, surveillance, and for-cause inspections that are not deemed mission-critical) remain temporarily postponed.\n\nWhile inspections that can be conducted by FDA during the public health emergency are limited due to factors including travel restrictions, FDA intends to continue using alternative tools, when appropriate, to evaluate facilities. This includes requesting existing inspection reports from other trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements,7 requesting information from applicants, requesting records and other information directly from facilities and other inspected entities, and conducting remote interactive evaluations8 where appropriate.\n\nFootnote 7: For existing FDA mutual recognition agreements with the European Union and the United Kingdom, this includes the use of official inspection reports issued by a recognized authority for manufacturing facilities located inside and outside the territory of the issuing authority. For more information visit: https://www.fda.gov/international-programs/international-arrangements/mutual-recognition-agreement-mra.\n\nFootnote 8: See FDA guidance for industry Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (April 2021).\n\n2.2.2 What types of inspections would be deemed ""mission-critical""?\n\nA2: FDA\'s assessment of whether an inspection is mission-critical considers many factors related to the public health benefit of U.S. patients having access to the product subject to inspection. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether the product has received breakthrough therapy designation, orphan-drug designation, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation; is included in the Drug Shortage or CBER-Regulated Products Shortage list; is used for critical care or as a medical countermeasure; is used to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a serious disease or medical condition, including COVID-19, for which there is no other appropriate and available treatment. Therefore, for-cause (including follow-up and where a specific drug quality problem or facility issues come to FDA\'s attention), preapproval, and pre-license inspections can be deemed mission-critical. When determining whether to conduct a mission-critical inspection, FDA also takes into account concerns about the safety of its investigators, employees at a site or facility, and where applicable, clinical trial participants and other patients at investigator sites.\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, What types of inspections would be deemed ""mission-critical""?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAfter issuance of a warning letter, holding a regulatory meeting, or following an enforcement action (e.g., seizure or injunction), FDA usually will conduct an inspection to confirm that corrective actions have been implemented.\n\nTo evaluate defect reports (e.g., Field Alert Reports or Biological Product Deviation Reports), FDA may request a remote interactive evaluation and/or make a request under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\n3.1.5 Specific Considerations for Bioresearch Monitoring Inspections\n\nSelection of facilities for BIMO inspections is risk based. While some facility selection factors such as inspection history and time since last inspection may be common across BIMO programs, other factors are unique to each BIMO program.\n\nFDA will consider BIMO facilities for remote interactive evaluation according to existing risk-based facility selection methodologies when there are no data integrity or other concerns that FDA determines require an inspection, and information to be evaluated can be accessed remotely. Generally, the information obtained from a remote interactive evaluation will be used to assess the facility\'s conduct, including data reliability and human subject protections to determine the acceptability of BIMO studies for FDA\'s application decision-making.\n\nAppendix B Preparing for a Remote Interactive Evaluation\n\nOnce the facility confirms its willingness and ability to participate in a remote interactive evaluation, FDA will schedule a brief virtual meeting to discuss logistics, responsibilities, and expectations. Discussion topics may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nObjectives and scope of the remote interactive evaluation.\n\nIntroduction of the FDA remote interactive evaluation team and the remote interactive evaluation lead.\n\nIdentification of the facility point of contact and all other participants (e.g., sponsor or contract research organization, monitor, remote ancillary operations).\n\nSchedule of virtual interactions and the anticipated duration of the remote interactive evaluation.\n\nFDA\'s expectations during the livestreaming walkthroughs of the facility.\n\nTime zone differences and translation services (i.e., spoken and written translation), if applicable. Virtual interactions, including remote observation of manufacturing operations or livestream assessment of data, usually will occur during the facility\'s normal business hours.\n\nMethods for sharing requested information, including sharing documents and the use of video-streaming technology.\n\nTechnological limitations that could impair or prevent FDA\'s remote interactive evaluation of the facility.\n\n3.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCheck of the internet connection throughout the facility to verify that the signal strength is adequate to support livestreaming video and audio during the actual remote interactive evaluation.\n\nIV Conducting a Remote Interactive Evaluation\n\nWhen facilities agree to participate in a remote interactive evaluation, FDA expects them to cooperate with the same level of transparency as they would during an FDA inspection. We expect appropriate staff to be available at scheduled times for interviews and other virtual interactions, and we expect the facility to be operational to the extent possible for FDA to evaluate areas and operations of interest (e.g., manufacturing, laboratory, packaging). If a facility is unable to support video or other virtual interactions, or if FDA determines that the video or any other virtual interaction during the remote interactive evaluation does not permit a sufficient examination of the facility or of a corrective action, FDA may terminate the remote interactive evaluation and instead perform an inspection or use other available tools.\n\nAs part of a remote interactive evaluation, FDA may:\n\nRequest and review documents, records, and other information (electronic systems).9 Footnote 9: Some remote interactive evaluations will be preceded by a request for records and other information for those facilities covered by FDA’s authority under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, when appropriate. FDA requests, including requests for records, during a remote interactive evaluation are considered voluntary unless a section 704(a)(4) request is sent to the facility.\n\nUse livestream and/or pre-recorded video to examine facilities, operations, and data and other information.10 Footnote 10: For a remote interactive evaluation supporting a pending biologics license application, FDA usually will expect a facility to provide for livestream video of the manufacturing operations described in the application.\n\nThrough the facility\'s point of contact, schedule interviews and meetings to address any questions or concerns.\n\nEvaluate a facility\'s corrective actions (e.g., in response to a previous inspection or evaluation, or to the current remote interactive evaluation). An inspection instead of a remote interactive evaluation may be necessary to verify the adequacy of some corrective actions, or if evaluating the corrective actions remotely would unreasonably extend the duration of the remote interactive evaluation.\n\nProvide verbal updates to the facility on observations and outstanding issues, whenever feasible.\n\nFDA will not issue a Form FDA 482, Notice of Inspection, to announce or open a remote interactive evaluation.\n\nTechnological Requirements\n\nThe quality of the remote connection (e.g., connectivity, image quality, cameras used) should be adequate for FDA to remotely review, observe, examine, and evaluate the information requested. To the extent practicable, technologies employed also should allow access for remotely viewingand evaluating operations at the facility, as necessary (e.g., aseptic practices, equipment cleaning and set up, material weighing and dispensing, instrument set up, sampling, testing). FDA understands that there may be temporary connection issues during the virtual interaction, and we expect either party to resolve the issue in a timely manner.\n\nFor security reasons, FDA will use its own IT platforms and equipment11 to host virtual interactions during remote interactive evaluations (e.g., videoconferences, livestreaming video of the facility and operations in the facility). FDA currently uses the following conferencing platforms:\n\nFootnote 11: FDA is not able to supply equipment to a facility to enable FDA’s remote interactive evaluation. Additionally, FDA is not able to accept equipment or devices from a facility for our use in conducting a remote interactive evaluation.\n\nFDA Microsoft Teams\n\nFDA Zoom for Government\n\nFDA Adobe Connect\n\nRemote Interactive Evaluation of Documents and Records\n\nFDA will usually request and review documents and other information in advance of a remote interactive evaluation12 to ensure the livestream interactions are as efficient as possible. However, we may request additional documents and other information, including video recordings, at any time during the remote interactive evaluation to address questions and to explain observations. Documents and other information requested during a remote interactive evaluation are expected to be provided within a reasonable timeframe, similar to requests for documents or other information made during an inspection.\n\nFDA expects all documents requested during the remote interactive evaluation to be provided in electronic format or accessible by screen sharing during a live interaction so that the documents can be assessed efficiently. FDA will provide a secure means to send requested information during a remote interactive evaluation. For electronic documents and other information, facilities should identify any limitations and ensure that encrypted and password-protected files can be accessed by FDA. Documents submitted during a remote interactive evaluation should be in English. However, if translation is needed during a livestream interaction, the facility may need to provide a translator.\n\nFDA recognizes that some facilities maintain documents in paper format and not all electronic systems will be accessible for direct viewing. Thus, when such a facility agrees to participate in a remote interactive evaluation, they should consider taking steps to enable FDA\'s remote viewing and verification of the facility\'s documents, procedures, and electronic systems. Requested documents maintained in paper format should be scanned as searchable Portable Document Format (PDF) files when possible.\n\nConcluding a Remote Interactive Evaluation\n\nUpon completion of a remote interactive evaluation, FDA will have a closeout meeting with the facility\'s management. During this meeting, FDA will usually present a written list of observations, if any, and describe and discuss any observations in sufficient detail to enable understanding and foster an appropriate response.13 This written list of observations will not be a final Agency action or decision. FDA will not issue a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations. As with an inspection, FDA encourages facilities to respond during the discussion and/or provide responses in writing to the observations within 15 U.S. business days.\n\nFootnote 13: If the remote interactive evaluation, including the review of any records before or during the evaluation, is intended to supplement a scheduled inspection, then FDA usually will combine any observations from the remote interactive evaluation(s) into a single written list of observations issued at the close of the inspection, which would be issued on a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations.\n\nDepending on the purpose and outcome of the remote interactive evaluation, the information and documentation collected may be used to, among other regulatory purposes:\n\nSupport FDA\'s assessment of pending applications, including whether to approve an application\n\nPreclude the need for an inspection in follow-up to a reported concern or defect\n--------------------\nContext title: Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, What types of inspections would be deemed ""mission-critical""?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 34: See 21 CFR 312.62(b) and 812.140(a)(3)\n\nThis alternative approach must be reviewed and approved by the IRB overseeing the trial as required under FDA regulations.35\n\nFootnote 35: See 21 CFR 50.27, 56.103, and 56.108(a).\n\nQ14. What factors should sponsors consider when deciding whether to change their clinical trial protocol during the COVID-19 public health emergency to include remote clinical outcome assessments?\n\nSome clinical outcome assessments (COAs)36 can be conducted remotely in clinical trials during the COVID-19 public health emergency, including COAs for performance outcome (PerfO), interview-based clinician-reported outcome (ClinRO),37 patient-reported outcome (PRO), and observer-reported outcome (ObsRO). During the COVID-19 public health emergency, sponsors may still be conducting in-person assessments on some trial participants, whereas remote assessments may be necessary for others to protect their safety or to respond to COVID-19-related public health measures implemented by government authorities to control the virus. When deciding whether to change their clinical trial protocols to include remote COAs, sponsors should evaluate the general and specific considerations outlined below.\n\nFootnote 36: For purposes of this guidance, a COA is an assessment of a clinical outcome (i.e., an outcome that describes or reflects how a patient feels, functions or survives); a ClinRO is a measurement by a trained health care professional after observing a trial participant’s health condition, a PerfO is a measurement based on a standardized task performed by a participant that is administered and evaluated by an appropriately trained individual or is individually completed, a PRO is a measurement based on a report that comes directly from the participant about the status of a patient’s health condition without amendment or interpretation of the participant’s response by a clinician or anyone else, and an ObsRO is a measurement based on a report of observable signs, events, or behaviors related to a participant’s health condition by someone other than the participant or a health professional (e.g., a parent or caregiver).

Silver Spring (MD): Food and Drug Administration (US); 2016, available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK326791/. Co-published by National Institutes of Health (US), Bethesda, (MD).\n\nGeneral considerations regarding (1) prioritization of trial participant safety and privacy; (2) maintenance of data quality and integrity, including minimizing missing data; and (3) appropriate training for personnel and trial participants, which are discussed elsewhere in this guidance, are also common to all COAs. Other general considerations that are common to all COAs include attention to (1) the potential for increased variability in trial data; (2) the feasibility of conducting a specific type of COA remotely, depending on the context of use; (3) documentation and audit trails; and (4) availability of technology and technical support required for remote assessment. These considerations are explained in more detail below.\n\nIncreased Variability in Data: When switching from in-person to remote assessments, sponsors should perform remote assessments in a manner as similar as possible to those done in-person, while protecting trial participant safety and privacy. To the extent feasible, sponsorsshould ensure that the methods and conduct of remote assessments are consistent across sites, trial participants, and visits to minimize variability in the data. For example, if a sponsor decides that video is their preferred method of remote assessment in a clinical trial, then using different methods to conduct assessments (e.g., both telephone and video in the same trial) may increase variability. Maintaining consistency in assessment methods should be balanced, however, against the need to minimize missing data and the decision to use different methods should be justified in study documentation.\n\nFeasibility of the Assessment Method Within the Context of Use:Investigators should assess the feasibility of conducting a specific type of COA remotely, which will depend on corresponding trial goals and needs (e.g., ability to conduct the assessment in a way that captures all the data needed to evaluate the endpoint in the trial), given that not all assessments can provide an accurate assessment when done remotely.\n\nDocumentation and Audit Trails:Investigators should document, and sponsors should include data on related variables in the clinical trial datasets, whether an assessment was conducted in-person or remotely (including type of technology used), as well as the date of the assessment and the person who conducted the assessment. Sponsors also should ensure that remote data acquisition, transmission, and storage are secure, and that the privacy of trial participants is protected. When sponsors use electronic platforms to perform remote assessments that transmit data directly into trial records, these platforms should include automated audit trails.\n\nTechnology and Technological Support:Sponsors planning to use remote electronic assessments as part of a clinical investigation should use appropriate technology and develop procedures for provision of technology and technical support to trial participants, investigators, and/or other trial personnel to facilitate those assessments. For example, sponsors could develop a plan to accommodate trial participants who are either already enrolled in a trial or may be enrolled in a trial in the future, but who do not have access to appropriate communication technology (e.g., cell phones or Internet), by providing trial participants with these services.\n\nSpecific considerations for certain COA types are explained below.\n\nPerfO- and Interview-Based ClinRO-Specific Considerations:For these types of assessments, sponsors should consider: (1) appropriateness of remote assessment for the type of clinical data to be collected; (2) special investigator training to administer the PerfO or interview-based ClinRO assessments remotely; and (3) procedures for assessing and confirming the safety of trial participants, their privacy, and appropriate setting and resources to adequately complete the assessment.\n\nRecognizing that components of the PerfO and interview-based ClinRO assessment for some trials may specify visualization or in-person interactions with trial participants that may be difficult to replicate through remote interactions, sponsors should assess whether these components can be evaluated in an alternative way that still permits an accurate clinical assessment. When components of the assessment cannot be accomplished in a remote encounter, investigators should document, and sponsors should report in the clinical trial datasets, any aspects of the assessment they are unable to accomplish remotely. Sponsors should consider whether the information that can be collected remotely will be sufficient to reliably assess the clinical outcome and support robust conclusions for the study.\n\nPRO- and ObsRO-Specific Considerations: For these types of assessments, sponsors should consider: (1) potential for missing data when switching from in-person assessment to remote assessment; (2) whether switching from use of paper- or electronic-based PRO and ObsRO assessments completed independently to assessments administered verbally by another person may lead to bias of scores (e.g., if trial participants try to please the site staff by offering ratings that might not truly reflect their experience); and (3) that data collected with PROs and ObsROs through verbal administration should not be considered a substitute for required safety monitoring throughout the trial.38\n\nFootnote 38: See 21 CFR 312.32(b), 312.56(c), and 812.46.\n\nTo minimize potential bias resulting from verbal administration of PRO and ObsRO assessments, sponsors should ensure interviewer training and use of an interview script. Sponsors may also consider using automated virtual interviewers or a trained neutral third-party interviewer to administer the assessments remotely.\n\nThe potential for missing data is also a limitation when switching from in-person to remote assessment using paper-based PRO or ObsRO assessments, if the trial participant or observer fails to complete all or part of the questionnaire within a given timeframe. To mitigate potential for missing data, sponsors should consider remote electronic capture of these assessments through technologies that can remind trial participants to complete the questionnaires and/or verbal administration at the time instructed (assuming appropriate steps are taken to minimize bias from verbal administration).\n\nQ15. I am a study monitor and am unable to conduct on-site monitoring visits due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. May I remotely perform the site monitoring visit? What recommendations does FDA have for how I can remotely perform source document review?\n\nFDA regulations require sponsors to monitor the conduct and progress of their clinical investigations.39 The regulations are not specific about how sponsors must conduct such monitoring and are therefore compatible with a range of approaches to monitoring that may vary depending on multiple factors. Therefore, certain aspects of site monitoring visits may be done remotely if technically feasible. FDA understands that there may be deviations from the timing of on-site monitoring visits set forth in the trial monitoring plan and procedures, and that sponsors may consider ways to replace on-site monitoring visits with remote monitoring visits during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Further, there may be components of an on-site monitoring visit, as outlined in the trial monitoring plan, that cannot be completed remotely.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Institutional Review Boards'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, What types of inspections would be deemed ""mission-critical""?\n--------------------\nContext: In the following sections, we recommend points to consider when developing a Plan for maintaining an adequate supply of MNPs during an emergency that results in high employee absenteeism.\n\n1 General Considerations\n\nFirms may already have plans in place to maintain business continuity during an emergency. CDER recognizes that the quality unit might not be designated to review or approve contingencies in the execution of a Plan having no potential to affect product quality. However, any planned changes having the potential to affect product quality should be reviewed and approved by the quality unit prior to implementation in accordance with the requirements in 21 CFR 211.22, 211.100(a) and 211.160(a); execution of the Plan should be documented in accordance with the requirements described in 21 CFR 211.100(b).\n\nA Plan should be specific enough to address unique considerations at each location where it is to be implemented. A broader Plan to address multiple sites within the organization also might be appropriate in certain circumstances. This approach provides for the specific and unique considerations of individual facilities and the flexibility to shift operations, resources, or personnel from one manufacturing facility to another.\n\nCDER recommends that the Plan identify people or position titles with the authority to activate the Plan, deactivate the Plan, and make decisions during the emergency. The Plan should allow for the possibility that one or more people or positions identified in the Plan are unavailable.\n\n2 Prioritizing Products Based on Medical Necessity\n\nFDA encourages firms that anticipate high absenteeism to give highest priority to medically necessary products when scheduling manufacturing and making plans for reassigning or cross-training personnel. Special attention should be given to medically necessary products for which the company is sole source or supplies a significant share of the U.S. market, as well as products vulnerable to shortage because of low levels of finished product likely to be in the supply chain at any given time. Manufacters should also consider whether particular emergency situations might affect whether certain products are considered medically necessary (e.g., antiviral drugs during an influenza pandemic). It is important to note that medical necessity during an emergency is not limited to products directly related to the specific emergency, but also encompasses products necessary for maintenance of dependent populations (i.e., for conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, asthma, and cancer). CDER is aware that during an emergency, it might not be feasible to consult with CDER to determine if a product should be considered medically necessary. In such cases, each company should use its best judgment to determine the relative priority of a product within its manufacturing portfolio.\n\nCompanies might benefit from prioritizing their products (based on medical necessity) within a single manufacturing facility, as well as across groups of manufacturing facilities, or across their entire manufacturing operation, including approved contractors. This tiered approach could provide useful insight into how best to manage and shift resources to meet the public health need for the most critical products. If a company finds itself unable to maintain manufacturing of all of its products, suspension of the manufacturing of products that are not medically necessary may free resources used to manufacture MNPs.\n\nRecommendations for Actions Prior to a Period of High Absenteeism\n\nWhen it is possible to anticipate an emergency that could result in a high rate of absenteeism affecting production of MNPs, CDER recommends that manufacturers consider one or more of the following measures, as appropriate:\n\nIncrease inventory of MNPs\n\nIncrease inventory of components and other materials needed for the manufacture of MNPs\n\nConduct cross-training exercises to ensure the competency of personnel that might be reassigned to the manufacture of MNPs or assigned to different roles in the manufacture of MNPs\n\nPerform maintenance, calibrations, and other activities that take place periodically so that these activities are not scheduled to occur while the Plan is active\n\nMake provisions for the use of competent resources that might be accessible at alternate sites, including contractors (e.g., qualified testing labs)\n\nMake provisions for the use of alternative suppliers of goods and services, including distributors, to reduce the potential for disruptions in the supply chain\n\nConsiderations for Plan Implementation During a Period of High Absenteeism\n\nCDER acknowledges that the measures discussed in section III.C might not be possible or sufficient in all situations. Accordingly, CDER recommends that manufacturers develop a detailed Plan designed to maintain adequate supply of MNPs in a period of high absenteeism of manufacturing employees.\n\niii.1.1 Developing Criteria for Activating the Plan\n\nOne critical element of any Plan is identifying criteria and the threshold for activation of the Plan. Knowledge acquired through the prioritization of medically necessary products will be helpful in developing these criteria by identifying the percentage of resources routinely dedicated to the manufacture of medically necessary products. It may be helpful to consider the following points when attempting to determine when to activate the Plan:\n\nConsider criteria based on factors directly relevant to the manufacture of MNPs (such as percent of employees in critical manufacture or laboratory positions absent at one time)rather than external factors (such as the World Health Organization\'s Pandemic Influenza Phases).\n\nIdentify criteria for each individual manufacturing site as well as for the company as a whole. -- The criteria should be based on the relative amount of resources dedicated to production of MNPs. Activation of the Plan should be limited to periods when shortages of MNPs are anticipated as a result of increased absenteeism in critical manufacturing positions, including laboratory positions. -- The criteria need to be based on data readily available to the responsible person.\n\n1.1.2 Performing Quality Risk Assessments\n\nCDER recommends that each manufacturer, in developing a Plan to address high rates of absenteeism, conduct a prospective risk assessment and ensure that appropriate risk control measures are identified, approved by relevant decision makers, and used in development of the Plan, with the objective of meeting the demand for MNPs while continuing to provide a high level of assurance that manufacturers comply with CGMP and that products meet specifications. CDER recognizes that the primary measures recommended in the preceding sections might not be sufficient to address production of all MNPs when high absenteeism rates exist. CDER recommends that, as a secondary measure, manufacturers apply quality risk assessments to identify activities that might be reduced in frequency, delayed, or substituted by a suitable alternative. CDER recommends that before taking such measures, a manufacturer have a well-supported conclusion, based upon its process and product knowledge and quality risk assessments, that the anticipated actions to address absenteeism are not expected to unacceptably reduce assurance of product quality.\n\nCDER recommends that manufacturers, when evaluating activities that might be reduced in frequency, delayed, or substituted by a suitable alternative, first identify and consider activities that are intended by the CGMP regulations to provide controls not connected with the manufacturing of any specific batch. Examples include:\n\nProduction equipment routine maintenance\n\nUtility system performance checks and maintenance (e.g., air temperature, lighting, compressed air)\n\nEnvironmental monitoring of facilities such as cell culture, harvesting, and purification rooms during production\n\nStability testing for certain drug products and components\n\nPeriodic examinations of data and of reserve samples\n\nIf the demand for MNPs cannot be met by the measures described above, manufacturers can consider reducing activities that are more directly connected with batch manufacturing or a product accept/reject decision provided that they have a documented rationale or risk assessment to show that the proposed changes will not unacceptably reduce assurance of product quality. Examples include:\n\nNot requiring second-person verification of activities for less critical steps (though we recommend a self-check of work)\n\nReducing the number of samples for labor-intensive laboratory testing\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nForgoing an in-process test to assure adequacy of mix, particularly when making successive batches, where the risk is judged to be low in terms of drug safety and efficacy\n\nDelaying completion of deviation investigations of minor events\n\nCDER recommends that in taking such measures, firms plan to carefully monitor indicators of product quality to note any unfavorable trends or shifts as a result of the implementation of the Plan. CDER also recommends that firms retain samples for testing at a later date in cases where testing is reduced or omitted because of lack of resources.\n\nReturning to Normal Operations\n\nA critical component of any emergency Plan is a procedure detailing when and how the transition back to pre-emergency, or normal, operations should occur. Once the Plan has been activated, it should remain active continuously until there is a reasonable expectation that normal operations will be maintainable for an extended period of time. The Plan should consider:\n\nWhat factors will indicate that it is time to return to normal operations or deactivate the Plan\n\nWhat resources will be necessary to complete postponed activities\n\nWhat activities will enable a successful transition back to normal operations\n--------------------\nContext title: Planning for the Effects of High Absenteeism to Ensure Availability of Medically Necessary Drug Products']","[""FDA's assessment of whether an inspection is mission-critical considers many factors related to the public health benefit of U.S. patients having access to the product subject to inspection.

The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: It is important that the CGMP regulations are harmonized to the extent possible with other widely used quality management systems, including ISO 9000, non-U.S. pharmaceutical quality management requirements, and FDA's own medical device quality system regulations. This guidance serves as a first step to highlight common elements between the CGMP regulations and Quality Management Systems. With the globalization of pharmaceutical manufacturing and the increasing prevalence of drug- and biologic-device combination products, the convergence of quality management principles across different regions and among various product types is very desirable.\n\nThe FDA has concluded that modern quality systems, when coupled with manufacturing process and product knowledge and the use of effective risk management practices, can handle many types of changes to facilities, equipment, and processes without the need for prior approval regulatory submissions. Manufacturers with a robust quality system and appropriate process knowledge can implement many types of improvements. In addition, an effective quality system, by lowering the risk of manufacturing problems, may result in shorter and fewer FDA inspections.\n\nA quality system can provide the necessary framework for implementing quality by design4 (building in quality from the development phase and throughout a product's life cycle), continual improvement, and risk management in the drug manufacturing process. A quality system adopted by a manufacturer can be tailored to fit the specific environment, taking into account factors such as scope of operations, complexity of processes, and appropriate use of finite resources. Footnote 4: See ICH Q8 Pharmaceutical Development.\n\nScope of the Guidance\n\nThis guidance applies to manufacturers of drug products (finished pharmaceuticals), including products regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). It may also be useful to manufacturers of components (including active pharmaceutical ingredients) used in the manufacture of these products.\n\nThis document is not intended to create new requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturing that go beyond those established in the current regulations, nor is the guidance intended to be a guide for the conduct of FDA inspections. Rather, the document explains how implementing comprehensive quality systems can help manufacturers achieve compliance with 21 CFR parts210 and 211. Although the QS working group found that many of the quality system elements correlate with specific CGMP requirements, some do not. The Agency expects compliance with CGMP regulations, and FDA's inspection program will remain focused on compliance with those regulations.\n\nOrganization of this Guidance\n\nTo provide a reference familiar to industry, the quality systems model described in section IV of this guidance is organized -- in its major sections -- according to the structure of international quality standards. Major sections of the model include the following:\n\nManagement Responsibilities\n\nResources\n\nManufacturing Operations\n\nEvaluation Activities\n\nUnder each of these sections the key elements found in modern quality systems are discussed. When an element correlates with a CGMP regulatory requirement, that correlation is noted. In some cases, a specific CGMP regulation is discussed in more detail as it relates to a quality system element. At the end of each section, a table is included listing the quality system elements of that section and the specific CGMP regulations with which they correlate. A glossary is included at the end of the document.\n\nIII CGMPS and the Concepts of Modern Quality Systems\n\nSeveral key concepts are critical for any discussion of modern quality systems. The following concepts are used throughout this guidance as they relate to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.\n\nQuality\n\nEvery pharmaceutical product has established identity, strength, purity, and other quality characteristics designed to ensure the required levels of safety and effectiveness. For the purposes of this guidance document, the phrase achieving quality means achieving these characteristics for a product.\n\nQuality by Design and Product Development\n\nQuality by design means designing and developing a product and associated manufacturing processes that will be used during product development to ensure that the product consistently attains a predefined quality at the end of the manufacturing process.5 Quality by design, in conjunction with a quality system, provides a sound framework for the transfer of product knowledge and process understanding from drug development to the commercial manufacturing processes and for post-development changes and optimization. The CGMP regulations, when viewed in their entirety, incorporate the concept of quality by design. This guidance describes how these elements fit together.\n\nAppendix C Quality Risk Management\n\nQuality risk management is a valuable component of an effective quality systems framework.6 Quality risk management can, for example, help guide the setting of specifications and process parameters for drug manufacturing, assess and mitigate the risk of changing a process or specification, and determine the extent of discrepancy investigations and corrective actions.\n\nFootnote 6: See ICH Q9 Quality Risk Management.\n\nCAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action)\n\nCAPA is a well-known CGMP regulatory concept that focuses on investigating, understanding, and correcting discrepancies while attempting to prevent their recurrence. Quality system models discuss CAPA as three separate concepts, all of which are used in this guidance.\n\nRemedial corrections of an identified problem\n\nRoot cause analysis with corrective action to help understand the cause of the deviation and potentially prevent recurrence of a similar problem\n\nPreventive action to avert recurrence of a similar potential problem\n\nChange Control\n\nChange control is another well-known CGMP concept that focuses on managing change to prevent unintended consequences. The CGMP regulations provide for change control primarily through the assigned responsibilities of the quality control unit. Certain major manufacturing changes (e.g., changes that alter specifications, a critical product attribute or bioavailability) require regulatory filings and prior regulatory approval (21 CFR 314.70, 514.8, and 601.12).\n\nEffective change control activities (e.g., quality planning and control of revisions to specifications, process parameters, procedures) are key components of any quality system. In this guidance, change is discussed in terms of creating a regulatory environment that encourages change towards continual improvement. This means a manufacturer is empowered to make changes subject to the regulations based on the variability of materials used in manufacturing and process improvements resulting from knowledge gained during a product's lifecycle.\n\nAppendix F The Quality Unit\n\nMany of the modern quality system concepts described here correlate very closely with the CGMP regulations (refer to the charts later in the document). Current industry practice generally divides the responsibilities of the quality control unit (QCU), as defined in the CGMP regulations, between quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) functions.\n\nQC usually involves (1) assessing the suitability of incoming components, containers, closures, labeling, in-process materials, and the finished products; (2) evaluating the performance of the manufacturing process to ensure adherence to proper specifications and limits; and (3) determining the acceptability of each batch for release.\n\nQA primarily involves (1) review and approval of all procedures related to production and maintenance, (2) review of associated records, and (3) auditing and performing/evaluating trend analyses.\n\nThis guidance uses the term quality unit7 (QU) to reflect modern practice while remaining consistent with the CGMP definition in SS 210.3(b)(15). The concept of a quality unit is also consistent with modern quality systems in ensuring that the various operations associated with all systems are appropriately planned, approved, conducted, and monitored.\n\nFootnote 7: Generally, the term quality unit is used in this guidance. However, quality control unit is used when directly quoting parts 210 and 211.\n\nThe CGMP regulations specifically assign the QU the authority to create, monitor, and implement a quality system. Such activities do not substitute for, or preclude, the daily responsibility of manufacturing personnel to build quality into the product. The QU should not take on the responsibilities of other units of a manufacturer's organization, such as the responsibilities handled by manufacturing personnel, engineers, and development scientists.8 Manufacturing personnel and the QU are both critical in fulfilling the manufacturer's responsibility to produce quality products.\n\nFootnote 8: See Reference #1, comment 91.\n\nOther CGMP assigned responsibilities of the QU are consistent with modern quality system approaches (SS 211.22):\n\nEnsuring that controls are implemented and completed satisfactorily during manufacturing operations\n\nEnsuring that developed procedures and specifications are appropriate and followed, including those used by a firm under contract to the manufacturer\n\nApproving or rejecting incoming materials, in-process materials, and drug products\n\nReviewing production records and investigating any unexplained discrepancies\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: In summary, the CGMP regulations require that manufacturing processes be designed and controlled to assure that in-process materials and the finished product meet predetermined quality requirements and do so consistently and reliably.\n\nIV Recommendations\n\nIn the following sections, we describe general considerations for process validation, the recommended stages of process validation, and specific activities for each stage in the product lifecycle.\n\nGeneral Considerations for Process Validation\n\nIn all stages of the product lifecycle, good project management and good archiving that capture scientific knowledge will make the process validation program more effective and efficient. The following practices should ensure uniform collection and assessment of information about the process and enhance the accessibility of such information later in the product lifecycle.\n\nWe recommend an integrated team approach11 to process validation that includes expertise from a variety of disciplines (e.g., process engineering, industrial pharmacy, analytical chemistry, microbiology, statistics, manufacturing, and quality assurance). Project plans, along with the full support of senior management, are essential elements for success. Footnote 11: This concept is discussed in more detail in FDA’s guidance for industry, Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations, available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatory/Information/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nThroughout the product lifecycle, various studies can be initiated to discover, observe, correlate, or confirm information about the product and process. All studies should be planned and conducted according to sound scientific principles, appropriately documented, and approved in accordance with the established procedure appropriate for the stage of the lifecycle.\n\nThe terms attribute(s) (e.g., quality, product, component) and parameter(s) (e.g., process, operating, and equipment) are not categorized with respect to criticality in this guidance. With a lifecycle approach to process validation that employs risk based decision making throughout that lifecycle, the perception of criticality as a continuum rather than a binary state is more useful. All attributes and parameters should be evaluated in terms of their roles in the process and impact on the product or in-process material, and reevaluated as new information becomes available. The degree of control over those attributes or parameters should be commensurate with their risk to the process and process output. In other words, a higher degree of control is appropriate for attributes or parameters that pose a higher risk. The Agency recognizes that terminology usage can vary and expects that each manufacturer will communicate the meaning and intent of its terminology and categorization to the Agency.\n\nMany products are single-source or involve complicated manufacturing processes. Homogeneity within a batch and consistency between batches are goals of process validation activities. Validation offers assurance that a process is reasonably protected against sources of variability that could affect production output, cause supply problems, and negatively affect public health.\n\nStage 1 -- Process Design\n\nProcess design is the activity of defining the commercial manufacturing process that will be reflected in planned master production and control records. The goal of this stage is to design a process suitable for routine commercial manufacturing that can consistently deliver a product that meets its quality attributes.\n\nii.2.1 Building and Capturing Process Knowledge and Understanding\n\nGenerally, early process design experiments do not need to be performed under the CGMP conditions required for drugs intended for commercial distribution that are manufactured during Stage 2 (process qualification) and Stage 3 (continued process verification). They should, however, be conducted in accordance with sound scientific methods and principles, including good documentation practices. This recommendation is consistent with ICH Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality System.12 Decisions and justification of the controls should be sufficiently documented and internally reviewed to verify and preserve their value for use or adaptation later in the lifecycle of the process and product.\n\nFootnote 12: Available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nAlthough often performed at small-scale laboratories, most viral inactivation and impurity clearance studies cannot be considered early process design experiments. Viral and impurity clearance studies intended to evaluate and estimate product quality at commercial scale should have a level of quality unit oversight that will ensure that the studies follow sound scientific methods and principles and the conclusions are supported by the data.\n\nProduct development activities provide key inputs to the process design stage, such as the intended dosage form, the quality attributes, and a general manufacturing pathway. Process information available from product development activities can be leveraged in the process design stage. The functionality and limitations of commercial manufacturing equipment should be considered in the process design, as well as predicted contributions to variability posed by different component lots, production operators, environmental conditions, and measurement systems in the production setting. However, the full spectrum of input variability typical of commercial production is not generally known at this stage. Laboratory or pilot-scale models designed to be representative of the commercial process can be used to estimate variability.\n\nDesigning an efficient process with an effective process control approach is dependent on the process knowledge and understanding obtained. Design of Experiment (DOE) studies can help develop process knowledge by revealing relationships, including multivariate interactions, between the variable inputs (e.g., component characteristics 13 or process parameters) and the resulting outputs (e.g., in-process material, intermediates, or the final product). Risk analysis tools can be used to screen potential variables for DOE studies to minimize the total number of experiments conducted while maximizing knowledge gained. The results of DOE studies can provide justification for establishing ranges of incoming component quality, equipmentparameters, and in-process material quality attributes. FDA does not generally expect manufacturers to develop and test the process until it fails.\n\nOther activities, such as experiments or demonstrations at laboratory or pilot scale, also assist in evaluation of certain conditions and prediction of performance of the commercial process. These activities also provide information that can be used to model or simulate the commercial process. Computer-based or virtual simulations of certain unit operations or dynamics can provide process understanding and help avoid problems at commercial scale. It is important to understand the degree to which models represent the commercial process, including any differences that might exist, as this may have an impact on the relevance of information derived from the models.\n\nIt is essential that activities and studies resulting in process understanding be documented. Documentation should reflect the basis for decisions made about the process. For example, manufacturers should document the variables studied for a unit operation and the rationale for those variables identified as significant. This information is useful during the process qualification and continued process verification stages, including when the design is revised or the strategy for control is refined or changed.\n\nii.2.2 Establishing a Strategy for Process Control\n\nProcess knowledge and understanding is the basis for establishing an approach to process control for each unit operation and the process overall. Strategies for process control can be designed to reduce input variation, adjust for input variation during manufacturing (and so reduce its impact on the output), or combine both approaches.\n\nProcess controls address variability to assure quality of the product. Controls can consist of material analysis and equipment monitoring at significant processing points (SS 211.110(c)). Decisions regarding the type and extent of process controls can be aided by earlier risk assessments, then enhanced and improved as process experience is gained.\n\nFDA expects controls to include both examination of material quality and equipment monitoring. Special attention to control the process through operational limits and in-process monitoring is essential in two possible scenarios:\n\nWhen the product attribute is not readily measurable due to limitations of sampling or detectability (e.g., viral clearance or microbial contamination) or\n\nWhen intermediates and products cannot be highly characterized and well-defined quality attributes cannot be identified.\n\nThese controls are established in the master production and control records (see SS 211.186(a) and (b)(9)).\n\nMore advanced strategies, which may involve the use of process analytical technology (PAT), can include timely analysis and control loops to adjust the processing conditions so that the output remains constant. Manufacturing systems of this type can provide a higher degree of process control than non-PAT systems. In the case of a strategy using PAT, the approach to process qualification will differ from that used in other process designs.

The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: The calculated mean concentration for each dilution should be within (\\pm)20% of the nominal concentration after correction for dilution and the precision should not exceed 20%.\n\nThe dilution factor(s) applied during study sample analysis should be within the range of dilution factors evaluated during validation.\n\n4.2.7 Stability\n\nStability evaluations should be carried out to ensure that every step taken during sample preparation, processing and analysis as well as the storage conditions used do not affect the concentration of the analyte.\n\nThe storage and analytical conditions applied to the stability tests, such as the sample storage times and temperatures, sample matrix, anticoagulant, and container materials should reflect those used for the study samples. Reference to data published in the literature is not considered sufficient. Validation of storage periods should be performed on QCs that have been stored for a time that is equal to or longer than the study sample storage periods.\n\nStability of the analyte in the studied matrix should be evaluated using low and high concentration QCs. Aliquots of the low and high QCs are analysed at time zero and after the applied storage conditions that are to be evaluated. One bulk QC should be prepared at each concentration level. For each concentration tested, the bulk sample should be divided into a minimum of three aliquots that will be stored, stressed and analysed.\n\nThe QCs are analysed against a calibration curve, obtained from freshly spiked calibration standards in a run with its corresponding freshly spiked QCs or QCs for which stability has been proven. While the use of freshly prepared calibration standards and QCs is the preferred approach, it is recognised that in some cases, for macromolecules, it may be necessary to freeze them overnight. In such cases, valid justification should be provided and freeze-thaw stability demonstrated. QCs should be kept frozen for at least 12 hours between the thawing cycles. The mean concentration at each QC level should be within (\\pm)20% of the nominal concentration.\n\nSince sample dilution may be required for many LBA methods due to a narrow calibration range, the concentrations of the study samples may be consistently higher than the ULOQ of the calibration curve. If this is the case, the concentration of the QCs should be adjusted, considering the applied sample dilution, to represent the actual sample concentration range.\n\nFor fixed dose combination products and specifically labelled drug regimens, the freeze-thaw, bench-top and long-term stability tests of an analyte in matrix should be conducted with the matrix spiked with all of the dosed compounds, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAs mentioned in Section 3.2.8, the investigation of stability should cover bench top (short-term) stability at room temperature or sample preparation temperature and freeze-thaw stability. In addition, long-term stability should be studied.\n--------------------\nContext title: M10_Guideline_Step4_2022_0524'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: No, heroic measures need not be taken. Storage conditions should be consistent with the knowledge of the stability of the mixture under conditions of use and reasonable so as not to permit accelerated decomposition.\n\nWhat are the details of the Agency\'s reserve sample retention policy?\n\nWith regard to reserve sample retention, the GLPs provide as follows:\n\nReserve samples are to be retained from each batch of test and control article prepared in accord with section 58.105(a) for all nonclinical laboratory studies lasting more than 4 weeks. For the purposes of these sections, the 4-week period includes initial dosing to the final in vivo observations. Only sufficient sample need be retained to permit meaningful reanalysis. The samples need be retained either for the terms specified in section 58.105 or for the useful life of the sample (dependent on the stability or the quality of the sample) whichever is shorter. Storage conditions should be those commonly accepted as minimizing the deterioration of sample quality and need not require exhaustive study to determine those which maximize stability. All batches of test and control article mixtures are to be retained even if they are prepared daily.\n\nFor medical devices, how can stability be demonstrated any more effectively than by the continued functioning of a device within specifications during an in vivo nonclinical study?\n\nThe stated procedure is acceptable.\n\nThe cost of chemical assay development and assay of dosage forms prior to conducting acute studies far exceeds the cost of doing the experiment. Will data confirming the weighing, mixing and administration of the test article be considered sufficient?\n\nNo. The test article must be sufficiently characterized to ensure that the same article is used in any further studies.\n\nDoes FDA expect a firm to conduct long-term stability tests on test article-carrier mixtures, which are used within a day of preparation?\n\nThe firm must determine the stability of the mixtures over the period of their use. The GLPs require retention of samples of all batches of test article-carrier mixtures for studies that last longer than 4 weeks. The regulations do not require stability studies on such samples. Samples placed in storage may be analyzed periodically to determine their useful storage life.\n\nAm I correct in assuming that the chemical testing done by the sponsor to characterize the test article is not covered by the GLPs when the test article is subsequently submitted to a contract laboratory as a blind sample for safety testing?\n\nThe GLPs do not cover the basic exploratory chemical tests done to derive the specifications of the test article. They do cover those chemical tests done on discrete batches of test article to determine identity, strength, purity and composition.\n\nDoes the phrase ""mixtures of articles and carriers"" also refer to solutions and suspensions, e.g., a solution of a test article in distilled water?\n\nYes.\n\nFor acute studies, is it necessary for the laboratory to analyze each batch of test article-carrier mixture prior to dosing the test system?\n\nNo. Uniformity of the mixture must be known and periodic batch analyses need to be done.\n\nWill dialogues such as this and recent inspectional experience bring about substantive changes in the final regulations through FDA initiated proposed amendments? Whatchanges are anticipated in the reserve sample retention requirements?\n\nThe Agency does not believe the initiative to change the GLPs rests with FDA. Petitions for change may be submitted to the Agency in accord with the 21 CFR 10.30. As was mentioned at the meeting, the Agency recognizes that the reserve sample retention requirements are extensive and expensive and a petition for change would be considered.\n10. What guidelines can be used by a laboratory or sponsor in deciding how frequently concentration analyses should be made?\n\nThe Agency has not established guidelines with regard to the frequency of periodic reanalysis of test article-carrier mixtures. Enough batches should be analyzed to assure that the test systems are being exposed to the quantities of test article in the specified protocol.\n11. How long must one retain samples of feed used in nonclinical laboratory studies and should they be frozen?\n\nThe sample retention period differs for the various regulated products and the periods are listed in section 58.195. Feed samples need not be frozen for storage.\n12. What is the definition of carrier?\n\nCarrier is the material with which the test article is mixed for administration to the test system. It can be feed, water, solvents and excipients depending on dosage form and route of administration.\n13. Once stability of a given concentration of a test article-carrier mixture is substantiated, is it necessary to establish a stability profile for each batch at that concentration?\n\nNo. Stability need be determined only on a single batch of test article-carrier mixture; however, periodic reanalysis to determine concentration must be done.\n14. In the course of a 14-C tissue residue study in the target animal, is it necessary to retain:\n\nAll samples listed in a - d and f above should be retained for the term listed in section 58.195.\n\na. sample of the 14-C labeled drug,\n\nb. samples of the diet fed control and experimental animals,\n\nc. samples of urine and feces after completion of the analyses,d. samples of collected tissues after completion of the analyses, e. if they must be retained, for how long? f. is similar sample retention necessary when doing ""cold"" tissue residue studies in target animals?\n15. If a battery of different tests on a substance is being conducted by different contractors, is it necessary to run replicate stability analyses from each and every contractor especially when long-term stability has been documented for the substance?\n\nNo. Once stability has been determined in accord with good science, it is not necessary to continually replicate the stability determination.\n\n58.120 Protocol\n\n58.130 Conduct of a Nonclinical Laboratory Study\n\nIn as much as only wet tissues, blocks and slides are necessary to reconstruct the histopathologic aspects of a study by a third party, are written notes, tapes, etc. of the histopathological\'s thought process in arriving at a final report legitimately considered ""raw data"" in the presence of a signed and dated final report? Does the Agency have the right to inspect the written notes from the pathologist?\n\nRaw data in this case, refers only to the signed and dated final report of the pathologist. Agency investigators may wish to examine the interim notes and reports in an attempt to reconstruct the study but not to second-guess the scientific process used to arrive at the final report. The GLPs do not require that these interim reports and notes be retained.\n2. What is considered to be raw data in computer systems when the data is generated from dictated results?\n\nTranscribed dictation, which has been proofread and corrected for typographical -and transcription errors, is raw data.\n3. Do the GLPs require that the protocol be amended to reflect the actual starting date of the study?\n\nYes, this is a critical piece of information, which should be supplied by way of a formal protocol amendment.\n\nIt is said that raw data may be any verified exact copy of the original data. In a computerized data system where data is put directly on disc thence to tape, what documentation of the program performing this transfer is required to assure that the tape copy is exact? The standard operating procedures, which cover computer operations, should describe the computer program and the procedure used to assure the production of an exact tape copy.\n\nIf reformatting of data is done as part of the transfer described in question 4 above, is the new file not raw data even if all data is transferred intact although in a different organization? The Agency can not precisely answer this question without further details of the new data format.\n\nAre initials and dates on data printouts (e.g., scintillation counters, gas chromatographs), when these printouts include standards, sufficient documentation for standardization? Yes.\n\nIs there a time limit for submission of the final report of a nonclinical laboratory study after its conclusion? Generally no. On occasion, for marketed products, the Agency may establish time frames for study conduct. Of course alarming findings on marketed products should be reported as soon as possible.\n\nIs it permissible to list changes in a final report on a page, which is appended, to the original final report? Yes.\n\nDoes ""studies in progress on June 20, 1979"" refer to the phase of dosing of the test system or the phase post-dosing but not yet reported? The quotation pertains to all studies for which the final report has not yet been completed. Included are all post-dosing phases.\n\nThe final report requires a list of participants. Should this include technicians as well as people who perform support functions?The final report should include the name of the study director, the names of other scientists or professionals, and the names of all supervisory personnel involved in the study.\n\nWhen an analysis protocol is developed for the first time by using standard scientific technique, who shall validate the protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: Minimum Required Dilution\n\nMRD is a dilution factor employed in samples that are diluted with buffer solution to reduce the background signal or matrix interference on the analysis using LBA. The MRD should be identical for all samples including calibration standards and the QCs and it should be determined during method development. If MRD is changed after establishment of the method, partial validation is necessary. MRD should be defined in the Validation Report of the analytical method.\n\nCommercial and Diagnostic Kits\n\nCommercial or diagnostic kits (referred to as kits) are sometimes co-developed with new chemical or biological drugs for point-of-care patient diagnosis. The recommendations in this section of the guideline do not apply to the development of kits that are intended for point-of-care patient diagnosis (e.g., companion or complimentary diagnostic kits). Refer to the appropriate guideline documents regarding regulatory expectations for the development of these kits.\n\nIf an applicant repurposes a kit (instead of developing a new method) or utilises ""research use only"" kits to measure chemical or biological drug concentrations during the development of a novel drug, the applicant should assess the kit validation to ensure that it conforms to the drug development standards described in this guideline.\n\nValidation considerations for kit assays include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nIf the reference standard in the kit differs from that of the study samples, testing should evaluate differences in assay performance of the kit reagents. The specificity, accuracy, precision and stability of the kit assay should be demonstrated under actual conditions ofuse in the facility conducting the sample analysis. Modifications from kit processing instructions should be completely validated.\n\nKits that use sparse calibration standards (e.g., one- or two-point calibration curves) should include in-house validation experiments to establish the calibration curve with a sufficient number of standards across the calibration range.\n\nActual QC concentrations should be known. Concentrations of QCs expressed as ranges are not sufficient for quantitative applications. In such cases QCs with known concentrations should be prepared and used, independent of the kit-supplied QCs.\n\nCalibration standards and QCs should be prepared in the same matrix as the study samples. Kits with calibration standards and QCs prepared in a matrix different from the study samples should be justified and appropriate experiments should be performed.\n\nIf multiple kit assay lots are used within a study, lot-to-lot variability and comparability should be addressed for any critical reagents included in the kits.\n\nIf a kit using multiple assay plates is employed, sufficient replicate QCs should be used on each plate to monitor the accuracy of the assay. Acceptance criteria should be established for the individual plates and for the overall analytical run.\n--------------------\nContext title: M10_Guideline_Step4_2022_0524'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: When the tonicity of a product is declared in its labeling, the manufacturing process should be appropriately controlled to assure that the osmolality of every batch will conform to labeled osmolality. Osmolality determined during development and validation might be sufficient to justify not performing testing of every batch. This data should be submitted in the application.\nQ60: When is it necessary to dilute final product to meet the concentration specification? Is there a preference to use sterile water, normal saline, or half normal saline?\n\nNormal saline is the most commonly used agent to maintain the isotonicity of the final drug product. However, you may use any of the three named diluents. Justification should be provided if an isotonic product cannot be formulated. In addition, for ANDA products, the diluent used should be the same as the diluent used in the RLD for which the ANDA is being submitted.\nQ61: What are FDA\'s expectations on handling invalid tests and sample size for repeat testing?\n\nUnder 21 CFR part 212, it is acceptable to repeat a test that failed the first time if a mistake or error was made in the first attempt to test (i.e., the test was truly invalid). It is not acceptable to simply retest with a new sample because of a failing result; true out-of-specification results must be investigated to determine the cause of the failure to meet the specifications, and corrections must be implemented as appropriate. If a repeat test is appropriate, the sample size depends on what parameter is being tested and should be chosen to ensure the test results are representative of the characteristics of the batch.\nQ62: Does FDA have current information about drug master files (DMFs) that might apply to PET?\n\nPET producers should contact their suppliers to determine whether they have a DMF on file with the FDA. FDA does not provide a list of DMFs that are available for reference. For further information about DMFs, see FDA Manual of Policies and Procedures (MAPPs) on DMF files, available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ManualofPoliciesProcedures/ucm079564.pdf. You can also direct any specific DMF questions to\n\ndmfquestion@cder.fda.gov.\n\nApplicants that plan to rely on one or more DMFs should provide a letter of authorization from the DMF holder that gives the ANDA or NDA applicant the right to reference the DMF and for FDA to refer to the DMF in its review of the application in the ANDA or NDA.\nQ63: Is notification to the FDA required for replacement of quality control equipment (e.g., gas chromatography (GC), HPLC, or dose calibrator)Replacement of quality control equipment is managed under the facility\'s quality system and should be qualified for installation, operation, and performance; therefore, notification is not necessary. However, any change in the analytical method should be reported in accordance with 21 CFR 314.70.\n* Does a change in precursor require submission of a supplement? Yes. The submission should be made under 21 CFR 314.70(b).\n* Does a change in container closure system require submission of a supplement? Yes. The submission should be made under 21 CFR 314.70.\n* Does a change in the vendor of inactive ingredients or other auxiliary materials require submission of a supplement? No, these are reported in the annual report.\n\nv.2.2 Stability Testing\n\nContent and Format for NDAs and ANDAs (the PET drug applications guidance) states that quality control needs to be done for three qualification batches at the highest concentration allowed. Upon how many batches are we required to perform stability testing?_** You should conduct stability testing of three batches. For more information, see Attachment I of the PET drug applications guidance titled ""Sample Formats\n\nChemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) Section.""5 Footnote 5: Available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM078740.pdf.\n\nDoes stability testing need to be performed on each vial size, for example, 30 mL and 50 mL, if the components are identical? We recommend that you choose the highest vial size (i.e., the 50 mL size in the example). In some cases, multiple presentations might need to be tested (e.g., if the headspace oxygen-to-surface ratio differs significantly).\n\nAre we required to perform forced degradation studies with these short shelf life drugs?For the commonly used PET drugs (e.g., FDG, Ammonia N13, Sodium Fluoride F18), where the storage and other molecular stability characteristics under different conditions have been well defined in the scientific literature, forced degradation studies are not needed when an NDA or ANDA is submitted.\n\nFor new PET drugs, the molecular stability and storage conditions under certain stress conditions (e.g., photo-stability, pH dependant stability) might need to be evaluated and described in the application. The need for this testing should be discussed with the review division during product development (e.g., at the End of Phase-2 meeting). During inspection, the inspector may inspect the source data.\nQ70: Assuming that product stability is demonstrated, is there any limit to expiry of the product?\n\nThe stability data should support the proposed expiration dating period. These data are submitted in the application for which the expiration dating period is approved. The individual batch used may expire earlier than the approved expiration dating period. It is expected that the product will be used before its specified expiry.\n\nv.2.3 Sterility Testing\n\nQ71: With respect to sterility testing, what are the requirements for the sample hold time validation and expected storage conditions during hold time?\n\nSterility testing can begin 30 hours after manufacture without further justification.\n\nDelays beyond this time need to be justified and shown to be valid (i.e., that contamination, if present, would result in growth). Samples are to be stored appropriately during the extended hold time; the hot cell might be appropriate for storage.\nQ72: Would the air quality requirement still hold if the sterility inoculations were performed in Hungate tubes, which is generally performed within the hot cell environment, not a laminar flow environment?\n\nWe recommend that sterility tests be performed in a Class 100 environment so there is no risk of environmental contamination. However, we do understand if the sterility testing has to be performed in a hot cell because of the nature of the product.\n\nC. Current Good Manufacturing Practices\n\nQ73: Are there specific guidances for the qualification of vendors that would guide us in selecting components and establishing standards for vendor compliance?No guidance on this topic is presently available.\n\nQ74: FDA recently issued the guidance PET Drugs - Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) (Small Entity Compliance Guide) that appears to be identical to the guidance issued in December 2009. Is there a definition of small entity? Does the August 2011 version differ from the version dated December 2009?_\n\nThere are no substantive differences between the Small Entity Compliance Guide and the guidance published in December 2009. The Small Entity Compliance Guide on Drug CGMPs was prepared to comply with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121). The Act states the following:\n\nFor each rule or group of related rules for which an agency is required to prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis under section 605(b) of title 5, United States Code, the agency shall publish 1 or more guides to assist small entities in complying with the rule and shall entitle such publications ""small entity compliance guides.""\n\nA definition for small entity can be found in section 211 of the Act.\nQ75: Is identity testing on mannose triflate required? If required, does it need to be a specific identity test?\n\nAlthough an identity test on incoming components is required to be performed, a specific identity test is not needed under certain conditions (see 21 CFR 212.40(c). When the finished-product testing of a PET drug product includes testing to ensure that the correct components have been used, the PET drug producer need only determine that each lot of incoming components complies with written specifications by examining a certificate of analysis provided by the supplier (21 CFR 212.40(c)(1)(i)). We believe that the use of this type of finished-product testing makes specific identity testing of components redundant and unnecessary. For example, when identity of the F18 radionuclide is established as part of the finished-product testing and the method of production used is well-documented and understood, it can be reasonably argued that the component that yields this radionuclide is likely to be O 18 water. In this case, a specific identity test for O 18 water is not necessary before the lot is used in production. Similarly, a specific identity test before using a lot of mannose triflate might be redundant and unnecessary when (1) a well-understood method of synthesis of FDG is used, (2) a test to confirm the radiochemical identity is performed in the finished drug product, and (3) the mannose triflate was obtained from a reliable supplier with whom a relationship has been previously established and is accompanied by a certificate of analysis.\n\nWhat is FDA\'s current thinking on conditional final release testing if there was a problem or malfunction? Under the CGMP regulations at 21 CFR 212.70, you may not release another batch of the PET product until you have corrected the problem concerning the malfunction of analytical equipment. A reserve sample is needed to complete the finished product testing.\n\n*Which analytical techniques, if any, require validation?\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Oversight of PET Drug Products -- Questions and Answers']","['The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.']",0.3333333333,0.2857142857142857
23,"Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel?","['--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: The ""Supplement Facts"" nutrition information (referred to as a panel) must be enclosed in a box by using hairlines. The title, ""Supplement Facts,"" must be larger than all other print in the panel and, unless impractical, must be set full width of the panel. The title and all headings must be bolded to distinguish them from other information.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n36. How must I present the information in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n\nYou must present all information using the following:\n\na. A single easy-to-read type style;\n\nb. All black or one color type, printed on a white or neutral contrasting background, whenever practical;3. Upper- and lowercase letters, except that you may use all uppercase lettering on small packages (i.e., packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches); d. At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text); and e. Letters that do not touch.\n37. What are the type size requirements for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n\nExcept as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must set information other than the title, headings, and footnotes in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. You also must use a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label for the title ""Supplement Facts."" You may set the column headings and footnotes in type no smaller than 6 point type. See the section on ""Special Labeling Provisions"" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nMust I use hairlines in the Supplement Facts panel?\n\nExcept for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must use a hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text to separate each dietary ingredient from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it. FDA has provided an exception for certain packages with space constraints. See the section on ""Special Labeling Provisions"" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nHow closely must I follow the ""Examples of graphic enhancements used by the FDA"" in appendix B to Part 101?\n\nYou are not required to follow Appendix B to Part 101. Appendix B and its specifications are a model, which FDA has suggested in the interest of uniformity of presentation. For example, 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(i) requires the use of an ""easy-to-read"" type style, not specifically Helvetica type, as suggested in Appendix B.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)(9)\n\nHow do I provide nutrition labeling when my product contains two or more packets of supplements (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening)?\n\nYou may present the information for each packet (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening) in an individual nutrition label or you may use an aggregate nutrition label. For two packets, this would consist of five columns. List all of the dietary ingredients in the first column. List the amounts and percents of the morning packet in the second and third columns and similar information for the evening packet in the fourth and fifth columns (see the illustration of aggregate nutrition labeling in 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iii)).\n\nCompliance\n\nWhat kind of samples will FDA collect to determine compliance with 21 CFR 101.36?\n\nFDA will collect a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller. FDA will randomly select these packages.\n\nWhat if it is not technically feasible for me to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements?\n\nFDA may permit you to use an alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9). If your firm needs such special allowances, you must make your request in writing to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(f)(2)\n\nMust dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?\n\nFor dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value.\n\nExemptions\n\nWhat are the circumstances in which my dietary supplement products would be exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements? Your dietary supplement product is not required to have a ""Supplement Facts"" panel if: a. Your firm is a small business that has not more than $50,000 gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers or not more than $500,000 per year from total sales in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1); b. You sell less than 100,000 units of the product annually, your firm has fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(2) andyou file an annual notification with FDA as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(18)(iv); or c. You ship the product in bulk form, do not distribute it to consumers in such form, and you supply it for use in the manufacture of other dietary supplements in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(3). The two exemptions for small businesses and low-volume products (a. and b. above) are available to you only if your products\' labels bear no claims or other nutrition information.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(h)(1) - (3)\n\nSpecial Labeling Provisions\n\nWhat are small packages?\n\nSmall packages are those packages having less than 12 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)\n\nWhat is the telephone provision for small packages?\n\nIn lieu of a ""Supplement Facts"" panel, you may print labels for small packages with a telephone number or address that consumers can use to obtain nutrition information. You may use a telephone number or an address in place of the ""Supplement Facts"" panel only if you place no claims or other nutrition information on the product label.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size that I may use for small packages?\n\nYou may use a type size no smaller than 4-5 point for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on the labels of small packages.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(i)\n\nMay I use a tabular or linear format for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on a small package?\n\nYes. You may use a tabular format on small packages. You also may present ""Supplement Facts"" information in a linear (i.e., string) fashion if the label will not accommodate the ""Supplement Facts"" panel in a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j) (13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display.)\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n\nWhat are intermediate-sized packages?\n\nIntermediate-sized packages are those packages having from 12 to 40 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(ii)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size for intermediate-sized packages?The ""Supplement Facts"" panel on the labels of intermediate-sized packages must use type size no smaller than 6 point, except that type no smaller than 4-5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches that list more than 16 dietary ingredients. Also, 4-5 point type may be used on packages with less than 20 square inches that list more than 8 dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the type size used in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on an inner container may be as small as needed to accommodate all required information if the ""Supplement Facts"" on the outer container meets these type size requirements.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv)\n51. May I use a tabular or linear format for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on an intermediate-sized package? You may use a tabular format on an intermediate-sized package if the package shape or size cannot accommodate vertical columns. You may use a linear format if the label will not accommodate a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n52. May I abbreviate on the labels of intermediate- sized packages? You may use the abbreviations in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B) in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel for small and intermediate-sized packages, e.g, ""Serv size"" for ""Serving Size"" and ""Servings"" for ""Servings Per Container.""\n\n21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B)\n53. Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016 (81 FR 33742), FDA (we) published a final rule entitled ""Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels"" (""the final rule""). The final rule amends the labeling regulations for conventional foods and dietary supplements to provide updated nutrition information on the label to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices and set a compliance date of July 26, 2018, for manufacturers with $10 million or more in annual food sales, and July 26, 2019, for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales. We subsequently extended the compliance dates to January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021, respectively (83 FR 19619). We have prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28). This guidance document restates in plain language the revisions made in the final rule and is intended to help small entities comply with the requirements established in 21 CFR 101.9, 101.30, and 101.36.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in our guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nIn the remainder of this guidance, ""you"" and ""I"" refer to food manufacturers that are subject to the rule. Many answers in this guidance are followed by citations to show where a specific requirement can be found in either the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) or Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nII Who Is Subject to the Rule?\n\nYou are subject to the rule if you manufacture food that is subject to our nutrition labeling requirements. The nutrition labeling requirements apply to both conventional foods under 21 CFR 101.9(a) and dietary supplements under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(6).\n\nIII What Foods Are Covered by the Rule?\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for the General Food Supply?\n\nYes. Foods for the general food supply are foods eaten by persons 4 years of age and older.\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for Infants and Young Children 1 Through 3 Years of Age?\n\nYes. Foods, other than infant formula, represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age are subject to nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(j)(5)(i)). Manufacturers of foods represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months and/or children 1 through 3 years of age must use the Reference Daily Intakes (RDIs) and Daily Reference Values (DRVs) that are specified for this intended group when calculating percent Daily Values (DVs) for labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)). The previous categories of ""infants"" (or ""infants 7 to 12 months"") and ""children less than 4 years"" have been changed to ""infants through 12 months"" and ""children 1 through 3 years of age"" throughout 21 CFR 101.9.\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for Pregnant Women and Lactating Women?\n\nYes. Manufacturers of foods represented or purported to be specifically for pregnant women and lactating women must use the RDIs and DRVs that are specified for this intended group when calculating percent DVs for labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)).\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Dietary Supplements?\n\nYes. Section 201(f) of the FD&C Act defines ""food"" as: ""(1) articles used for food or drink for man or other animals, (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article."" Further, section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act explains that dietary supplements are deemed to be foods within the meaning of the FD&C Act except for the purposes of sections 201(g) (definition of ""drug"") and 417 (reportable food registry) of the FD&C Act. Nutrition labeling information for food must be provided for all products intended for human consumption and offered for sale, unless an exemption is provided (21 CFR 101.9(a)). As dietary supplements fall under the definition of ""food,"" they are therefore subject to nutrition labeling. Specific nutrition labeling requirements and guidelines for dietary supplements can be found in 21 CFR 101.36.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNaturally-occurring sugars found in whole fruits and vegetables or dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them.\n\nThe amount of added sugars declared on the label should never exceed the amount of total sugars on the label.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(i) Do Honey, Maple Syrup, and Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n\nIn the Federal Register of June 20, 2019 (84 FR 28726), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled ""The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products,"" which provides clarity on the labeling of added sugars for such products (Ref. 1). In that guidance, we discuss section 12516 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (""the Farm Bill""), which states that the food labeling requirements cannot require the declaration ""Includes Xg Added Sugars"" in a serving of these single-ingredient products. While these products are not required to have this declaration of the gram amount of added sugars, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet, so the percent DV for added sugars must still be included consistent with 21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii). We stated that we intend to exercise enforcement discretion by permitting the use of the ""+"" symbol immediately following the percent DV declaration for added sugars on packages and containers of single-ingredient sugars and syrups. This symbol would lead to a footnote inside the Nutrition Facts label, explaining the amount of added sugars that one serving of the product contributes to the diet, as well as the contribution of a serving of the product toward the percent DV for added sugars. This symbol and footnote are not required; however, we encourage you to use them.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(ii) Do Added Sugars in Dried Cranberry Products and Cranberry Beverage Products Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: How Do the Nutrient Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels Differ?\n\nBoth the content and format of the Supplement Facts label have been updated to correspond to the Nutrition Facts label, wherever possible. However, there are still some differences between the two. On the Supplement Facts label, information on calories and serving size was not made more prominent through increased type size, as it has been on the Nutrition Facts label. While the percentage of the RDI for protein for foods purported to be for infants through 12 months of age is allowed on Nutrition Facts labels, this declaration must be omitted for Supplement Facts labels (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)).\n\nIn addition, the new ordering for vitamins and minerals on the Supplement Facts label is as follows: vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate and folic acid, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, choline, calcium, iron,phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, potassium, and fluoride (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(B)).\n\nHas Nutrient Compliance or the Level of Variance Allowed Changed?\n\nThere are still two classes of nutrients for compliance purposes. Class I covers those added nutrients in fortified or fabricated foods (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(i)), and Class II nutrients are those that are naturally occurring, or indigenous, nutrients (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(ii)). For compliance purposes, if both Class I and Class II nutrients are present in the final food product, then the total amount of the nutrient (both indigenous and exogenous) is subject to class I requirements.\n\nThe updated rule does not change the level of variances allowed in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and 101.9(g)(5), but the rule also now includes soluble fiber and insoluble fiber in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and added sugars in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Therefore, 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) now states that a food with a label declaration of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat will be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the FD&C Act, unless the nutrient content of the composite is formulated to be at least equal to the declared value for the vitamin, mineral, protein, or dietary fiber meeting the definition of a Class I nutrient (potassium has been removed), or the nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to 80 percent of the declared value for the vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber meeting the definition of a Class II nutrient (potassium and ""other carbohydrate"" have been removed). Our regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5), state that a food with a label declaration of calories, sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium will be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the FD&C Act if the nutrient content of the composite is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label. Reasonable excesses of soluble fiber, insoluble fiber and sugar alcohols, and reasonable deficiencies of added sugars are also now acceptable within current good manufacturing practices.\n\nWhich Version of the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International Should be Used?\n\nThe final rule now incorporates by reference the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International, 19th edition (2012) (21 CFR 101.9(l)(1)(i)).\n\nVIII. How Do I Comply with the Formatting Requirements?\n\nThere are required formats for Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels. We strongly recommend that the nutrition information be presented using the graphic specifications below (see also Appendix B to 21 CFR part 101 and Ref. 8).\n\nVIII.1 How Do I Comply with the Standard Version of the Nutrition Facts Label?\n\nFigures 3 through 5 reflect what a standard vertical Nutrition Facts label must look like (see 21 CFR 101.9(d)(12)). This format is to be used except on foods where the tabular display is\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]\n\n11 How Has the Formatting Changed for the ""Nutrition Facts"" Header on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe ""Nutrition Facts"" heading must be in a type size no smaller than all other print size in the nutrition label, except for the numerical information for ""Calories,"" which according to 21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii) must be in a type size no smaller than 22 point for the standard label (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)). It must be set the full width of the nutrient information, unless impractical (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)). It is not required to be set the full width of the nutrient information for labels presented according to the following formats: tabular display, aggregate display, tabular dual column display, tabular display for small or intermediate-sized packages, and linear display for small or intermediate-sized packages (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)).\n\nA thin horizontal line (i.e., a hairline rule) is to be inserted directly beneath the Nutrition Facts heading, before the servings per container statement (except on the linear display discussed below) (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(v)).\n\nFigure 5: Standard Vertical, Mandatory and Voluntary Nutrients\n\n11.2 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declaration of Calories on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe type size has increased for ""Calories"" and the numeric value of ""Calories."" On the standard vertical display of the Nutrition Facts label, the numeric value of ""Calories"" must be listed in a type size no smaller than 22 point, as well as in bold or extra bold type highlighting (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). The word ""Calories"" must be listed in a type size no smaller than 16 point, as well as in bold or extra bold type highlighting (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 3 through 5.\n\n3 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declarations of Serving Size and Servings Per Container on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe "" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container"" declaration now immediately follows the ""Nutrition Facts"" heading and must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i)).\n\nBelow "" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container"" is the declaration of ""Serving size."" ""Serving size"" is to be highlighted in bold or extra bold and in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(ii)). While the ""Serving size"" declaration is still left-justified, the corresponding numerical value is now right-justified on Nutrition Facts labels only (not on Supplement Facts labels), provided that adequate space is available (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(ii)). If the ""Serving size"" declaration does not fit in the allocated space, then a type size no smaller than 8 point may be used on packages of any size.\n\nFor further information on the updates made to the Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed and Serving Size regulations, please reference the Small Entity Compliance Guide entitled ""Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments: Guidance for Industry"" (Ref. 9), as well as the final guidance entitled ""Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Size-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics"" (Ref. 10).\n\n4 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declaration of Vitamins and Minerals on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nNutrient information for vitamins and minerals (except sodium) are to be separated from information regarding other nutrients by a bar (21 CFR 101.9(d)(8)). They may be listed vertically (Figures 3 and 5) or horizontally (Figure 4). If listed horizontally in two columns, then vitamin D and calcium should be listed on the first line, and iron and potassium should be listed on the second line (21 CFR 101.9(d)(8)). Nutrient information must be in a type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)).\n\n11.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhile ""Calories from fat"" can no longer be declared, ""Calories from saturated fat"" is still allowed (21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(ii)). When declared, it is to be indented under the statement of calories and must be in a type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(5)).\n\n11.4 Where, and How, Do I Declare ""Added Sugars"" on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe statement ""Includes \'X\' g Added Sugars"" must be used to declare added sugars content (except on packages of single ingredient sugars), and this statement must be indented directly beneath the listing for ""Total Sugars"" on the Nutrition Facts label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The \'X\' will be filled in with the respective added sugar content (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). In Appendix B to 21 CFR 101, we illustrate our recommendation to shorten the length of the hairline requirement between total sugars and added sugars to help denote that ""added sugars"" are a subcomponent of ""total sugars."" As mentioned above, a DRV has been established for added sugars for most population groups, and the % Daily Value declaration is required as well (21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii)). Added sugars must also be declared on the Supplement Facts label (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAdded sugars content must be expressed to the nearest gram, except in the following circumstances:\n\nThe statement ""Contains less than 1 gram"" or, alternatively, ""less than 1 gram"" may be used if a serving contains less than 1 gram added sugars; or\n\nThe added sugars content may be expressed as zero if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram.\n\nSee 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: Small Entity Compliance Guide on Structure/Function Claims\n\nJANUARY 2002\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (P.L. 104-121). This guidance document restates in plain language the legal requirements set forth in a regulation concerning labeling claims for dietary supplements. This is a Level 2 guidance document published for immediate implementation in accordance with FDA\'s good guidance practices (21 CFR 10.115). The regulations are binding and have the force and effect of law. However, this guidance document represents the agency\'s current thinking on this subject and does not, itself, create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute and regulations.\n\nSummary\n\nOn January 6, 2000, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a final rule in the Federal Register defining the types of statements that may be used on the label and in the labeling of dietary supplements without prior review by the agency (65 FR 1000) (http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/(\\sim)lrd/fro00106.html ). Called structure/function claims, these claims are statements that describe the effect a dietary supplement may have on the structure or function of the body. The regulation also provides criteria to assist you in determining when a statement about a dietary supplement is a disease claim, that is, a claim to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease. Disease claims require prior approval by FDA and may be made only for products that are approved drug products or for foods under separate legal provisions that apply to claims called ""health claims.""\n\nThis guidance discusses only the requirements that apply to determining whether a claim is a structure/function claim or a disease claim. It should be noted that other regulations also cover labeling and packaging requirements for dietary supplements. These requirementswere published as final rules in the Federal Registers of September 23, 1997 (62 FR 49826), June 5, 1998 (63 FR 30615), and Jan 15, 1997 (62 FR 2218)\n\n(https://www.federalregister.gov/ (https://www.federalregister.gov/)) (see Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) Parts 101 and 111).(1).\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\nThe regulation added $101.93(f) and (g) to Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 101. These two sections define what types of claims are structure/function claims and what types of claims are disease claims. In addition to these definitions, the regulation includes criteria that are intended to assist you in determining whether a particular statement is or is not a disease claim. Finally, the preamble to this rule clarifies several legal issues that are important to understand if you use structure/function claims on the labels or in the labeling of your products. They are restated below.\n\nBasic Legal Requirements for Structure/Function Claims. What are structure/function claims? The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) added section 403(r)(6) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)2. This section of the law states that a dietary supplement may bear certain statements on its label or in its labeling if the claim meets certain requirements. Section 101.93(f) simply restates part of the definition of the types of claims that may be made under section 403(r)(6) of the FD&C Act. Section 101.93(f) reads: (f) Permitted structure/function statements. Dietary supplement labels or labeling may, subject to the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, bear statements that describe the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans or that characterize the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, provided that such statements are not disease claims under paragraph (g) of this section. If the label or labeling of a product marketed as a dietary supplement bears a disease claim as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, the product will be subject to regulation as a drug unless the claim is an authorized health claim for which the product qualifies. Are there other claims that can be made for dietary supplements under this section of the law? Yes. Section 403(r)(6) also states that dietary supplements can use claims about nutrient deficiency diseases (for example, vitamin C and scurvy) or that describe the effect of the dietary supplement on general well-being. What requirements must I meet to make any of these types of claims for my dietary supplement?There are three requirements you must meet. First, the law says you can make these claims if you have substantiation that the claims are truthful and not misleading. You must have this substantiation before you make the claims. Second, you must notify FDA that you are using the claim within 30 days of first marketing your product. Third, the claim must include a mandatory disclaimer statement that is provided for in the law.\nWhere can I find information on the mandatory disclaimer and the notification I need to send in?\n\nWe have published regulations that describe exactly what the disclaimer must say and what you must include in your notification to us and where you must send it in the September 23, 1997 Federal Register (62 FR 49859 and 49883, respectively). These requirements can be found in 21 CFR 101.93(b) through (e) and 21 CFR 101.93(a), respectively.\nB. When and What You Must Do To Comply With the New Regulation.**\n\nWhen does this rule become effective?\n\nThe rule became effective on February 7, 2000, for any products marketed for the first time after publication of the final rule or for any new claims made for an existing product after publication of the final rule (i.e., new claims made after January 6, 2000).\nIf I have existing inventory, do I need to re-label it now?\n\nLarge businesses had until January 7, 2001, to bring existing claims on products into compliance. FDA granted this period for firms to use up their label inventories. Small businesses had until July 7, 2001, to bring existing claims on products into compliance. Any existing inventory not used up after these dates would need to be relabeled.\nC. How Do I Determine if a Claim is a Structure/Function Claim or a Disease Claim?\n\nIt may not be possible always to draw a bright line between structure/function and disease claims. You should look at the objective evidence in your labeling to assess whether a claim explicitly or implicitly is a disease claim. For example, a statement may not mention a disease but may refer to identifiable characteristic signs or symptoms of a disease such that the intended use of the product to treat or prevent the disease may be inferred. It is important that you keep in mind two things. First, the context of the statement, decided from information on the label and in other labeling, will determine if the statement is considered to be a disease claim. Second, dietary supplements may not bear disease claims, explicit or implied, unless the claim has undergone premarket review by FDA and has been authorized or approved under the rules for health claims or drugs, as appropriate. To assist you in deciding whether a claim is or isn\'t a disease claim, the new regulation contains a definition for disease, and then includes 10 criteria intended to help clarify the types of claims that may be made for dietary supplements without prior authorization or approval by FDA. We are providing that disease definition and an explanation of the 10 criteria below.\n\nWhat is the definition of a disease?Section 101.93(g) defines disease as:\n\n...damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition.\n\nWhat are the criteria for determining if a statement is a disease claim?\n\nThere are 10 criteria in the rule that are useful in determining if a statement is a disease claim.\n\nCriterion 1: Claims an effect on a disease or class of diseases (see section E, starting on page 1012 of the preamble to the rule).\n\nA statement is a disease claim if it mentions a specific disease or class of diseases. For example, a claim that a product is ""protective against the development of cancer"" or ""reduces the pain and stiffness associated with arthritis"" would be a disease claim.\n\nA statement also is a disease claim if it implies that it has an effect on a specific disease or class of diseases by using descriptions of the disease state. Examples of implied disease claims are ""relieves crushing chest pain (angina),"" ""improves joint mobility and reduces inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis),"" or ""relief of bronchospasm (asthma).""\n\nCriterion 2: Claims an effect on characteristic signs or symptoms of disease using scientific or lay terminology (see section F, starting on page 1015 of the preamble to the rule).\n\nHow can I tell if a particular claimed effect is a sign or symptom of a specific disease?\n\nThe test of whether claimed effects are characteristic signs or symptoms depends on 2 questions: (1) Is the condition, to which the signs and symptoms refer, related to a disease; and (2) are the signs and symptoms referred to in the labeling characteristic of the disease and permit the inference that the product is intended to affect that disease.\n\nDoes it matter if I don\'t use every sign or symptom of a condition or if I use layman\'s terms instead of technical language?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide on Structure:Function Claims'

If the principal display panel of your product is 5square inches or less, the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent does not apply when the declaration of net quantity of contents meets the other requirements of 21 CFR 101.105(f)\n3. How must I express the net quantity of contents statement on my label? You must express the net quantity of contents statement in either weight, measure, numerical count or a combination of numerical count and weight or measure. When you express this quantity as a weight or measure, you must specify both metric (grams, kilograms, milliliters, or liters) and U.S. Customary System (ounces, pounds, or fluid ounces) terms. Public Law 102-329, August 3, 1992 and 21 CFR 101.105\n4. Why must I calculate the area of the principal display panel? You must calculate the area of the principal display panel (calculated in square inches or square centimeters) to determine the minimum type size that is permitted for the net quantity of contents statement.\n5. How do I calculate the area of the principal display panel? You may calculate the area of the principal display panel for rectangular or square shaped packages by multiplying the height by the width (both in inches or both in centimeters), and for cylindrical shaped packages by multiplying 40% of the circumference by the height. For example, a rectangular package that is 8 inches high and 6 inches wide would have a principal display panel of 48 square inches. A cylindrical package having a circumference of 10 inches and a height of 2 inches would have a principal display panel of 8 square inches.\n6. Am I required to place the net quantity of contents statement conspicuously and prominently on my product labels? Yes. You are required to use a print style that is prominent, conspicuous, and easy to read, with letters not more than three times as high as wide. Use letters that contrast sufficiently with the background.\n7. What is the minimum type size that I can use for the net quantity of contents statements? The smallest type size permitted for the net quantity of contents statement is based on the size of the principal display panel. You may determine the height of the type by measuring the height of upper case letters, when only upper case letters are used, or the height of a lower case letter ""o,"" or its equivalent, when mixed upper and lower case letters are used. The table below sets out the minimum type size in inches (in.), with metric equivalents (millimeters (mm) and centimeters (cm)) in parentheses.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\nMinimum Type Size & Area of Principal Display Panel \\ \\hline\n1/16 in.

It is of value, however, in that\n\nit demonstrates that the facility has favorably passed a peer group review.\n\nResults of the quality assurance unit inspections are not routinely available to an\n\nAgency investigator. However, the conforming amendments require that GLP\n\ndeviations are to be reported in detail with each submission to the FDA. Are we\n\nrequired to send the contents of the quality assurance unit inspection report to the\n\nFDA?\n\nNo. The GLP compliance statement in the conforming amendments to the GLPs was\n\nincluded for several reasons:\n\n(a) to provide an orderly transition across the effective date of the regulations. It was\n\nunderstood that applications for research and marketing permits submitted to the\n\nAgency for some period of time after the GLP effective date of June 20, 1979, would\n\ncontain final reports of nonclinical studies begun and completed prior to the effective date, begun prior to the effective date and completed thereafter, and begun and completed after the effective date. Studies begun and completed prior to the effective date are not required to comply with the GLPs and accordingly, the conforming amendments require that differences be noted. Similar considerations apply to studies begun prior to and completed after the effective date, although in these studies, those portions underway as of the effective date are required to comply.\n\n(b) to provide for the submission of final reports of studies, which were not required to comply with the GLPs but which otherwise, contribute to safety evaluation. The GLPs do not apply to safety studies conducted by independent investigators studying regulated products. Such studies are not sponsored by the product manufacturer, nor is there any intention to submit the results to the Agency. The study results are published in the open literature. The sponsor is required red to submit the study to the Agency but could in no way control the research. If the sponsor wishes to use the data in support of the application, the conforming amendments provide a mechanism by which the sponsor can prove that the study was not compromised. A similar situation exists for preliminary exploratory safety studies done by the sponsor.\n\n(c) to foster GLP compliance attitudes by management. The conforming amendment causes management to act responsively to all cases of GLP non-compliance and to take prompt corrective actions.\n\nWith these purposes in mind, the conforming amendments require a brief statement of overall GLP compliance and need not contain the Quality Assurance Unit findings. The Quality Assurance Unit findings should cover short-term GLP deviations, which are promptly corrected. The conforming amendments statement should cover those systematic GLP deviations which have occurred throughout the study.\n\nWho provides the GLP compliance statement required by the conforming amendments?\n\nThis statement is provided by the applicant for the research or marketing permit.\n\nWhat is the degree of compliance with GLPs, which the FDA will require for INDs submitted after June 20, 1979, but which include toxicology studies initiated before June 20, 1979, and completed after June 20, 1979?\n\nThose portions of the studies underway as of the effective date will have to be done in accord with the applicable provisions of the GLPs.\n\nDo nonclinical laboratory studies completed *prior to June 20, 1979 but submitted as part of an IND or NDA subsequent to that date fall under the conforming amendments?\n\nThese studies would not have to have been conducted under the GLPs but the conforming amendment statement of compliance is required.\n\nHow many members of the National Association of Life Science Industries (NALSI) come under the GLPs? How can the membership list be obtained?The Agency has not compiled such a list. A membership list is available from NALSI, 1747 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 2oOo6. All members who conduct nonclinical laboratory studies are subject to the GLPs.\n\nShould a contract laboratory ask a sponsor if the article they are testing is subject to FDA regulations? Should these studies then be listed as a separate master list of studies to comply with the GLP regulations? Contract laboratories should ask sponsors to identify studies which are associated with FDA regulated products, although the GLPs place this responsibility on the sponsor. A separate listing of such studies, apart from the firm\'s master list of all studies undertaken by the firm will satisfy the requirements of the GLPs.\n\nWhat impact have the GLP regulations had on the cost of performing toxicology studies? The president of a large contracting laboratory has stated that three years ago a chronic rat study could be done for about $8o,0oo; and that the current cost is closer $250,000. He estimated that half of the increased cost is due to GLPs, 30% to larger numbers of test animals per study on present day protocols and 20% to inflation. The Agency has not developed cost estimates.\n\n58.1 Scope\n\n58.3 Definitionsapplicability to Studies Performed Under Grants and Contracts\n\n58.15 Inspection of a Testing Facility\n\nAre short-term microbiological screening tests and microbiological preservative stability research and development covered by the GLPs? Microbiological preservative stability research, development and quality control tests are not covered by the GLPs. However, microbiological tests conducted to establish the toxicological profile of an article are covered.\n\nDoes the Agency intend to audit analytical data collected on a test article? Yes, insofar as it contributes to the evaluation of a nonclinical laboratory study.\n\nDoes the Agency intend to audit draft final protocols and draft final reports? The regulations do not require that such materials be retained, however, if draft reports are available, they may be audited in order to help the Agency follow the process from raw data to final report.\n\nExplain why the GLPs apply to ""microorganisms or subparts thereof."" How are microorganisms currently used by FDA in assessment of safety? For certain products, FDA does request that microbial tests be done for the purpose of obtaining information on potential neoplastic and mutagenic activity. Likewise, microsomal preparations (subparts thereof) are used as activating systems for certain in vitro tests. When this happens, the tests should be done in accord with the GLPs.\n\nDo the GLPs apply to engineering/electronic testing laboratories that perform functionality tests on medical devices? No.\n\nIs a licensed manufacturer of human biological products subject to continuing GLP inspection? The GLPs apply to safety studies submitted to the Agency in order to obtain the license. They do not apply to such studies conducted for the purpose of obtaining batch release of licensed biologicals.\n\nWill nonclinical studies in support of medical devices which do not come in contact with man (e.g., stopcocks, a gas machine, a urine bag) be subject to the GLP regulations? If the medical device application for a research or marketing permit does not require the submission of safety data for approval, then the GLPs do not apply.\n\nIf a test article is produced by microbial fermentation, are tests run on the bacteria, such as pathogenicity or virulence covered by the GLPs? No.\n\nAre studies performed for label purposes as required by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act considered to be nonclinical laboratory studies under the GLPs? No.\n\nWhen an application for Premarket Approval for a Class III Device is scrutinized, would a GLP audit by FDA become a criterion for premarket approval? Safety data are required for Class III Devices and such data are to be collected under the GLPs, but an FDA audit will not automatically become part of the premarket approval mechanisms.\n\nAre Class I, II and III Devices regulated products within the meaning of the GLPs? Yes.\n\nAre data contained in a 510(k) notification subject to the GLPs? No.\n\nHow do the GLPs apply to the testing of electromechanical medical devices (non-animal work)?It is presumed that the question refers to engineering tests and in vitro tests of such devices conducted to assess functionality. In these cases, the GLPs do not apply.\n\nPlease elaborate on the preamble statement (43 FR 59989) that studies involving ""diagnostic products"" and ""medical devices, which do not come in contact with or are implanted in man"" are not within the scope of the GLPs. Failure of diagnostic products or medical devices, which do not come in contact with man or are not implanted does pose a safety hazard. This is also true for implantable devices. Tests to establish the reliability of these articles are functionality tests, not safety tests. The GLPs cover implantable devices, which may cause adverse tissue reactions or may have components, which leach into the tissues and cause a toxic response.\n\nIs an in vitro study to quantitate the amounts of residual proteolytic enzyme on a soft contact lens (the enzyme is used to clean the lens) a safety study which is covered by the GLPs? No, the enzyme is part of the lens manufacturing process and its analysis would be covered by the GMPs and not the GLPs. If, however, the proteolytic enzyme is sold as a means of cleaning lenses after purchase by a person, the enzyme is an accessory to a medical device and the safety studies supporting the use of the enzyme would be subject to the GLPs.\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.10.2 Studies During Clinical Development\n\nAdditional studies may be warranted to clarify observed or suspected adverse effects in animals and humans during clinical development.\n\n2.10.3 Studies Before Approval\n\nSafety pharmacology effects on systems listed in section 2.8 should be assessed prior to product approval, unless not warranted, in which case this should be justified. Available information from toxicology studies adequately designed and conducted to address safety pharmacology endpoints, or information from clinical studies, can support this assessment and replace safety pharmacology studies.\n\nApplication of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)\n\nIt is important to ensure the quality and reliability of non-clinical safety studies. This is normally accomplished through the conduct of the studies in compliance with GLP. Due to the unique design of, and practical considerations for, some safety pharmacology studies, it may not be feasible to conduct these in compliance with GLP. It has to be emphasized that data quality and integrity in safety pharmacology studies should be ensured even in the absence of formal adherence to the principles of GLP. When studies are not conducted in compliance with GLP, study reconstruction should be ensured through adequate documentation of study conduct and archiving of data. Any study or study component not conducted in compliance with GLP should be adequately justified, and the potential impact on evaluation of the safety pharmacology endpoints should be explained.\n\nThe safety pharmacology core battery should ordinarily be conducted in compliance with GLP. Follow-up and supplemental studies should be conducted in compliance with GLP to the greatest extent feasible. Safety pharmacology investigations can be part of toxicology studies; in such cases, these studies would be conducted in compliance with GLP.\n\nPrimary pharmacodynamic studies do not need to be conducted in compliance with GLP.\n\nGenerally, secondary pharmacodynamic studies do not need to be conducted in compliance with GLP. Results from secondary pharmacodynamic studies conducted during the compound selection process may contribute to the safety pharmacology evaluation; when there is no cause for concern (e.g., there are no findings for the safety pharmacological endpoint or the chemical or therapeutic class), these studies need not be repeated in compliance with GLP. In some circumstances, results of secondary pharmacodynamic studies may make a pivotal contribution to the safety evaluation for potential adverse effects in humans, and these are normally conducted in compliance with GLP.\n\n3 Notes\n--------------------\nContext title: S7A_Guideline""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: It is important that the CGMP regulations are harmonized to the extent possible with other widely used quality management systems, including ISO 9000, non-U.S. pharmaceutical quality management requirements, and FDA's own medical device quality system regulations. This guidance serves as a first step to highlight common elements between the CGMP regulations and Quality Management Systems. With the globalization of pharmaceutical manufacturing and the increasing prevalence of drug- and biologic-device combination products, the convergence of quality management principles across different regions and among various product types is very desirable.\n\nThe FDA has concluded that modern quality systems, when coupled with manufacturing process and product knowledge and the use of effective risk management practices, can handle many types of changes to facilities, equipment, and processes without the need for prior approval regulatory submissions. Manufacturers with a robust quality system and appropriate process knowledge can implement many types of improvements. In addition, an effective quality system, by lowering the risk of manufacturing problems, may result in shorter and fewer FDA inspections.\n\nA quality system can provide the necessary framework for implementing quality by design4 (building in quality from the development phase and throughout a product's life cycle), continual improvement, and risk management in the drug manufacturing process. A quality system adopted by a manufacturer can be tailored to fit the specific environment, taking into account factors such as scope of operations, complexity of processes, and appropriate use of finite resources. Footnote 4: See ICH Q8 Pharmaceutical Development.\n\nScope of the Guidance\n\nThis guidance applies to manufacturers of drug products (finished pharmaceuticals), including products regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). It may also be useful to manufacturers of components (including active pharmaceutical ingredients) used in the manufacture of these products.\n\nThis document is not intended to create new requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturing that go beyond those established in the current regulations, nor is the guidance intended to be a guide for the conduct of FDA inspections. Rather, the document explains how implementing comprehensive quality systems can help manufacturers achieve compliance with 21 CFR parts210 and 211. Although the QS working group found that many of the quality system elements correlate with specific CGMP requirements, some do not. The Agency expects compliance with CGMP regulations, and FDA's inspection program will remain focused on compliance with those regulations.\n\nOrganization of this Guidance\n\nTo provide a reference familiar to industry, the quality systems model described in section IV of this guidance is organized -- in its major sections -- according to the structure of international quality standards. Major sections of the model include the following:\n\nManagement Responsibilities\n\nResources\n\nManufacturing Operations\n\nEvaluation Activities\n\nUnder each of these sections the key elements found in modern quality systems are discussed. When an element correlates with a CGMP regulatory requirement, that correlation is noted. In some cases, a specific CGMP regulation is discussed in more detail as it relates to a quality system element. At the end of each section, a table is included listing the quality system elements of that section and the specific CGMP regulations with which they correlate. A glossary is included at the end of the document.\n\nIII CGMPS and the Concepts of Modern Quality Systems\n\nSeveral key concepts are critical for any discussion of modern quality systems. The following concepts are used throughout this guidance as they relate to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.\n\nQuality\n\nEvery pharmaceutical product has established identity, strength, purity, and other quality characteristics designed to ensure the required levels of safety and effectiveness. For the purposes of this guidance document, the phrase achieving quality means achieving these characteristics for a product.\n\nQuality by Design and Product Development\n\nQuality by design means designing and developing a product and associated manufacturing processes that will be used during product development to ensure that the product consistently attains a predefined quality at the end of the manufacturing process.5 Quality by design, in conjunction with a quality system, provides a sound framework for the transfer of product knowledge and process understanding from drug development to the commercial manufacturing processes and for post-development changes and optimization. The CGMP regulations, when viewed in their entirety, incorporate the concept of quality by design. This guidance describes how these elements fit together.\n\nAppendix C Quality Risk Management\n\nQuality risk management is a valuable component of an effective quality systems framework.6 Quality risk management can, for example, help guide the setting of specifications and process parameters for drug manufacturing, assess and mitigate the risk of changing a process or specification, and determine the extent of discrepancy investigations and corrective actions.\n\nFootnote 6: See ICH Q9 Quality Risk Management.\n\nCAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action)\n\nCAPA is a well-known CGMP regulatory concept that focuses on investigating, understanding, and correcting discrepancies while attempting to prevent their recurrence. Quality system models discuss CAPA as three separate concepts, all of which are used in this guidance.\n\nRemedial corrections of an identified problem\n\nRoot cause analysis with corrective action to help understand the cause of the deviation and potentially prevent recurrence of a similar problem\n\nPreventive action to avert recurrence of a similar potential problem\n\nChange Control\n\nChange control is another well-known CGMP concept that focuses on managing change to prevent unintended consequences. The CGMP regulations provide for change control primarily through the assigned responsibilities of the quality control unit. Certain major manufacturing changes (e.g., changes that alter specifications, a critical product attribute or bioavailability) require regulatory filings and prior regulatory approval (21 CFR 314.70, 514.8, and 601.12).\n\nEffective change control activities (e.g., quality planning and control of revisions to specifications, process parameters, procedures) are key components of any quality system. In this guidance, change is discussed in terms of creating a regulatory environment that encourages change towards continual improvement. This means a manufacturer is empowered to make changes subject to the regulations based on the variability of materials used in manufacturing and process improvements resulting from knowledge gained during a product's lifecycle.\n\nAppendix F The Quality Unit\n\nMany of the modern quality system concepts described here correlate very closely with the CGMP regulations (refer to the charts later in the document). Current industry practice generally divides the responsibilities of the quality control unit (QCU), as defined in the CGMP regulations, between quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) functions.\n\nQC usually involves (1) assessing the suitability of incoming components, containers, closures, labeling, in-process materials, and the finished products; (2) evaluating the performance of the manufacturing process to ensure adherence to proper specifications and limits; and (3) determining the acceptability of each batch for release.\n\nQA primarily involves (1) review and approval of all procedures related to production and maintenance, (2) review of associated records, and (3) auditing and performing/evaluating trend analyses.\n\nThis guidance uses the term quality unit7 (QU) to reflect modern practice while remaining consistent with the CGMP definition in SS 210.3(b)(15). The concept of a quality unit is also consistent with modern quality systems in ensuring that the various operations associated with all systems are appropriately planned, approved, conducted, and monitored.\n\nFootnote 7: Generally, the term quality unit is used in this guidance. However, quality control unit is used when directly quoting parts 210 and 211.\n\nThe CGMP regulations specifically assign the QU the authority to create, monitor, and implement a quality system. Such activities do not substitute for, or preclude, the daily responsibility of manufacturing personnel to build quality into the product. The QU should not take on the responsibilities of other units of a manufacturer's organization, such as the responsibilities handled by manufacturing personnel, engineers, and development scientists.8 Manufacturing personnel and the QU are both critical in fulfilling the manufacturer's responsibility to produce quality products.\n\nFootnote 8: See Reference #1, comment 91.\n\nOther CGMP assigned responsibilities of the QU are consistent with modern quality system approaches (SS 211.22):\n\nEnsuring that controls are implemented and completed satisfactorily during manufacturing operations\n\nEnsuring that developed procedures and specifications are appropriate and followed, including those used by a firm under contract to the manufacturer\n\nApproving or rejecting incoming materials, in-process materials, and drug products\n\nReviewing production records and investigating any unexplained discrepancies\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: III Preclinical safety testing (3)\n\nGeneral Principles (3.1)\n\nThe objectives of the preclinical safety studies are to define pharmacological and toxicological effects not only prior to initiation of human studies but throughout clinical development. Both in vitro and in vivo studies can contribute to this characterization. Biopharmaceuticals that are structurally and pharmacologically comparable to a product for which there is wide experience in clinical practice may need less extensive toxicity testing.\n\nPreclinical safety testing should consider: (1) Selection of the relevant animal species; (2) age; (3) physiological state; (4) the manner of delivery, including dose, route of administration, and treatment regimen; and (5) stability of the test material under the conditions of use.\n\nToxicity studies are expected to be performed in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP); however, it is recognized that some studies employing specialized test systems, which are often needed for biopharmaceuticals, may not be able to comply fully with GLP. Areas of noncompliance should be identified and their significance evaluated relative to the overall safety assessment. In some cases, lack of full GLP compliance does not necessarily mean that the data from these studies cannot be used to support clinical trials and marketing authorizations.\n\nConventional approaches to toxicity testing of pharmaceuticals may not be appropriate for biopharmaceuticals due to the unique and diverse structural and biological properties of the latter that may include species specificity, immunogenicity, and unpredicted pleiotropic activities.\n\nBiological Activity/Pharmacodynamics (3.2)\n\nBiological activity may be evaluated using in vitro assays to determine which effects of the product may be related to clinical activity. The use of cell lines and/or primary cell cultures can be useful to examine the direct effects on cellular phenotype and proliferation. Due to the species specificity of many biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals, it is important to select relevant animal species for toxicity testing. In vitro cell lines derived from mammalian cells can be used to predict specific aspects of in vivo activity and to assess quantitatively the relative sensitivity of various species (including human) to the biopharmaceutical. Such studies may be designed to determine, for example, receptor occupancy, receptor affinity, and/or pharmacological effects, and to assist in the selection of an appropriate animal species for further in vivo pharmacology and toxicology studies. The combined results from in vitro and in vivo studies assist in the extrapolation of the findings to humans. In vivo studies to assess pharmacological activity, including defining mechanism(s) of action, are often used to support the rationale of the proposed use of the product in clinical studies.\n\nFor monoclonal antibodies, the immunological properties of the antibody should be described in detail, including its antigenic specificity, complement binding, and any unintentional reactivity and/or cytotoxicity towards human tissues distinct from the intended target. Such cross-reactivity studies should be carried out by appropriate immunohistochemical procedures using a range of human tissues.\n\nAnimal Species/Model Selection (3.3)\n\nThe biological activity together with species and/or tissue specificity of many biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals often preclude standard toxicity testing designs in commonly used species (e.g., rats and dogs). Safety evaluation programs should include the use of relevant species. A relevant species is one in which the test material is pharmacologically active due to the expression of the receptor or an epitope (in the case of monoclonal antibodies). A variety of techniques (e.g., immunochemical or functional tests) can be used to identify a relevant species. Knowledge of receptor/epitope distribution can provide greater understanding of potential in vivo toxicity.\n\nRelevant animal species for testing of monoclonal antibodies are those that express the desired epitope and demonstrate a similar tissue cross-reactivity profile as for human tissues. This would optimize the ability to evaluate toxicity arising from the binding to the epitope and any unintentional tissue cross-reactivity. An animal species that does not express the desired epitope may still be of some relevance for assessing toxicity if comparable unintentional tissue cross-reactivity to humans is demonstrated.\n\nSafety evaluation programs should normally include two relevant species. However, in certain justified cases one relevant species may suffice (e.g., when only one relevant species can be identified or where the biological activity of the biopharmaceutical is well understood). In addition, even where two species may be necessary to characterize toxicity in short term studies, it may be possible to justify the use of only one species for subsequent long-term toxicity studies (e.g., if the toxicity profile in the two species is comparable in the short term).\n\nToxicity studies in nonrelevant species may be misleading and are discouraged. When no relevant species exists, the use of relevant transgenic animals expressing the human receptor or the use of homologous proteins should be considered. The information gained from use of a transgenic animal model expressing the human receptor is optimized when the interaction of the product and the humanized receptor has similar physiological consequences to those expected in humans. While useful information may also be gained from the use of homologous proteins, it should be noted that the production process, range of impurities/contaminants, pharmacokinetics, and exact pharmacological mechanism(s) may differ between the homologous form and the product intended for clinical use. Where it is not possible to use transgenic animal models or homologous proteins, it may still be prudent to assess some aspects of potential toxicity in a limited toxicity evaluation in a single species, e.g., a repeated dose toxicity study of (\\leq 14) days duration that includes an evaluation of important functional endpoints (e.g., cardiovascular and respiratory).\n\nIn recent years, there has been much progress in the development of animal models that are thought to be similar to the human disease. These animal models include induced and spontaneous models of disease, gene knockout(s), and transgenic animals. These models may provide further insight, not only in determining the pharmacological action of the product, pharmacokinetics, and dosimetry, but may also be useful in the determination of safety (e.g., evaluation of undesirable promotion of disease progression). In certain cases, studies performed in animal models of disease may be used as an acceptable alternative to toxicity studies in normal animals (Note 1). The scientific justification for the use of these animal models of disease to support safety should be provided.\n\nNumber/Gender of Animals (3.4)\n\nThe number of animals used per dose has a direct bearing on the ability to detect toxicity. A small sample size may lead to failure to observe toxic events due to observed frequency alone regardless of severity. The limitations that are imposed by sample size, as often is the case for nonhuman primate studies, may be in part compensated by increasing the frequency and duration of monitoring. Both genders should generally be used or justification given for specific omissions.\n\nAdministration/Dose Selection (3.5)\n\nThe route and frequency of administration should be as close as possible to that proposed for clinical use. Consideration should be given to pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of the product in the species being used and to the volume which can be safely and humanely administered to the test animals. For example, the frequency of administration in laboratory animals may be increased compared to the proposed schedule for the human clinical studies in order to compensate for faster clearance rates or low solubility of the active ingredient. In these cases, the level of exposure of the test animal relative to the clinical exposure should be defined. Consideration should also be given to the effects of volume, concentration, formulation, and site of administration. The use of routes of administration other than those used clinically may be acceptable if the route must be modified due to limited bioavailability, limitations due to the route of administration, or to size/physiology of the animal species.\n\nDosage levels should be selected to provide information on a dose-response relationship, including a toxic dose and a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL). For some classes of products with little to no toxicity, it may not be possible to define a specific maximum dose. In these cases, a scientific justification of the rationale for the dose selection and projected multiples of human exposure should be provided. To justify high dose selection, consideration should be given to the expected pharmacological/physiological effects, availability of suitable test material, and the intended clinical use. Where a product has a lower affinity to or potency in the cells of the selected species than in human cells, testing of higher doses may be important. The multiples of the human dose that are needed to determine adequate safety margins may vary with each class of biotechnology-derived pharmaceutical and its clinical indication(s).\n\nImmunogenicity (3.6)\n--------------------\nContext title: S6 Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: 3 Preclinical Safety Testing\n\nGeneral Principles\n\nThe objectives of the preclinical safety studies are to define pharmacological and toxicological effects not only prior to initiation of human studies but throughout clinical development. Both in vitro and in vivo studies can contribute to this characterisation. Biopharmaceuticals that are structurally and pharmacologically comparable to a product for which there is wide experience in clinical practice may need less extensive toxicity testing.\n\nP Preclinical safety testing should consider:\n\n1) selection of the relevant animal species;2. age;\n3. physiological state;\n4. the manner of delivery, including dose, route of administration, and treatment regimen; and\n5. stability of the test material under the conditions of use.\n\nToxicity studies are expected to be performed in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP); however, it is recognised that some studies employing specialised test systems which are often needed for biopharmaceuticals, may not be able to comply fully with GLP. Areas of non-compliance should be identified and their significance evaluated relative to the overall safety assessment. In some cases, lack of full GLP compliance does not necessarily mean that the data from these studies cannot be used to support clinical trials and marketing authorisations.\n\nConventional approaches to toxicity testing of pharmaceuticals may not be appropriate for biopharmaceuticals due to the unique and diverse structural and biological properties of the latter that may include species specificity, immunogenicity, and unpredicted pleiotropic activities.\n\nBiological Activity/Pharmacodynamics\n\nFor monoclonal antibodies, the immunological properties of the antibody should be described in detail, including its antigenic specificity, complement binding, and any unintentional reactivity and/or cytotoxicity towards human tissues distinct from the intended target. Such cross-reactivity studies should be carried out by appropriate immunohistochemical procedures using a range of human tissues.\n\nAnimal Species/Model Selection\n\nThe biological activity together with species and/or tissue specificity of many biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals often preclude standard toxicity testing designs in commonly used species (e.g., rats and dogs). Safety evaluation programs should include the use of relevant species. A relevant species is one in which the test material is pharmacologically active due to the expression of the receptor or an epitope (in the case of monoclonal antibodies). A variety of techniques (e.g., immunochemical or functional tests) can be used to identify a relevant species. Knowledge of receptor/epitope distribution can provide greater understanding of potential in vivo toxicity.\n--------------------\nContext title: S6_R1_Guideline_0""

25,"Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., ""outliers"")?","['--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., ""outliers"")?\n--------------------\nContext: Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., ""outliers"")?\n\nAn outlier, an observation that lies an unexpected distance from other values, does not in itself prove that an error or violation has occurred. Therefore, the primary data analysis should include all such observations, including ""outliers"". A sponsor may perform some specific supplemental analyses on subsets of the data, if clinically and scientifically justified, that may exclude outlying data points. Excluding large amounts of data, regardless of the reasons for exclusion, will seriously bias the results.\n\nCan I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?In most studies the sponsor should avoid multiple testings of the same subject because it may skew performance statistics and under-estimate standard deviations. When multiple testing is done, the sponsor should explain why it is necessary and choose methods of statistical analysis that allow adjustment for within-subject correlation. It is appropriate to conduct repeated testing of the same sample to evaluate test reproducibility - i.e., the ability of the test to yield the same or similar readings when expected.\n\n8. How much precision (see the Glossary for definition) is needed for measurement data, e.g., in terms of decimal places?\n\nStudy data should contain no more decimal places than the precision of the instrument allows, i.e., if the instrument is only precise to the second decimal place the sponsor should not analyze the data using three decimal places.\n\n9. What records should help to ensure scientific soundness of an IVD investigational study?\n\nUnless a study falls within the exemption at 21 CFR 812.2(c), specific record requirements are listed in 21 CFR 812.140. In general, the records that are needed are those that provide the data for testing the study hypotheses. Records should contain sufficient detail to allow the study to be reproduced when the same protocol is followed. We recommend that investigators maintain detailed records because a review of the study may indicate the need for other analyses of the collected data.\n\nWe also recommend that investigators:\n\na. Maintain records of all data elements captured in the study, including raw measurements and subject co-variables in the form of demographic and morbidity factors; b. Link every observation recorded to the subject and that person\'s co-variable data; c. Preserve information obtained for all subjects enrolled and for all specimens collected.\n\nAdditionally, electronic spreadsheets of study data are useful. Given the possible need to review or analyze study data at the most detailed level, electronic spreadsheets may help to minimize review time. For information on electronic records, see the guidance document, ""Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures -- Scope and Application,"" at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation\n\nn/Guidances/ucm072322.pdf. There is also a more general guidance document available on electronic records for clinical studies that is entitled ""Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Trials,"" which can be found at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126402.htm.\n\nWhat does FDA recommend be included in the final report of the investigation from the sponsor to all reviewing IRBs (and to FDA for significant risk studies) (21 CFR 812.150(b)(7))?\n\nA final report should be a basic scientific report of the studies conducted, including the results of testing the study hypotheses. This report can be a useful means of providing a simple account of the data collection and study outcome. Such a report can facilitate preparation of the eventual submission for regulatory action, particularly when accompanied by the information included in the investigational plan (see the Glossary for definition).\n\nThe suggested format for the IDE final report, which FDA includes as an enclosure in all IDE approval letters, is found in Appendix 5 of this guidance.\n\nIt should be noted that FDA will consider submission of a marketing application (510(k), PMA, or HDE) to serve as the final report for the IDE. When a study sponsor submits a marketing application in lieu of the final report, the sponsor should still submit a supplement to the IDE stating that the marketing application should be considered the final report for the study.\n\nThe final report for significant risk device investigations must be submitted to the IRBs and/or FDA within six months after termination or completion of the study. 21 CFR 812.150(b)(7).\n\nVII.

SS 360j(g)(7)), that is available to anyone planning to investigate the safety or effectiveness of a class III device (see definition below) or any implant. The purpose of the meeting is to reach agreement on the key parameters of the investigational plan, including the study protocol. The meeting is to be held within 30 days of the receipt of a written request. FDA will document in writing any agreement reached and make it a part of the administrative record. The agreement is binding on FDA and can only be changed with the written agreement of the applicant or when there is a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the device. See 21 U.S.C. SS 360j(g)(7). A guidance document regarding these meetings, ""Early Collaboration Meetings Under the FDA Modernization Act (FDAMA); Final Guidance for Industry and for CDRH Staff,"" is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocument\n\ns/ucm073604.htm.\n\nAnalyte specific reagent (ASR) - ASRs are defined as ""antibodies, both polyclonal and monoclonal, specific receptor proteins, ligands, nucleic acid sequences, and similar reagents which, through specific binding or chemical reactions with substances in a specimen, are intended for use in a diagnostic application for identification and quantification of an individual chemical substance or ligand in biological specimens."" 21 CFR 864.4020(a). ASRs are medical devices that are regulated by FDA. They are subject to general controls, including current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs), 21 CFR Part 820, as well as the specific provisions of the ASR regulations (21 CFR 809.10(e), 809.30, 864.4020).\n\nClass I devices - devices for which the general controls of the Act are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness. They typically present minimal potential for harm to the user and the person being tested. They are subject to general controls, which include registration and listing, labeling, and adverse event reporting requirements (section 513(a)(1)(A) of the Act). Most Class I devices are exempt from premarket notification (see definition below), subject to certain limitations found in section 510(l) of the Act and in 21 CFR 862.9, 864.9, and 866.9. Some are also exempt from the ""Quality Systems Regulation"" found in 21 CFR Part 820. IVD examples of Class I devices include complement reagent, phosphorus (inorganic) test systems (21 CFR 862.1580), and E. coli serological reagents (21 CFR 866.3255).\n\nClass II devices - devices for which general controls alone are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness and for which establishment of special controls can provide such assurances. Special controls may include special labeling, mandatory performance standards, risk mitigation measures identified in guidance, and postmarket surveillance (section 513(a)(1)(B) of the Act). Some Class II devices are exempt from premarket notification (see definition below), subject to limitation in 21 CFR 862.9, 864.9, and 866.9. IVD examples of Class II devices include glucose test systems (21 CFR 862.1345), antinuclear antibody immunological test systems (21 CFR 866.5100), and coagulation instruments (21 CFR 864.5400).\n\nClass III devices - devices for which insufficient information exists to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness through general or special controls. Class III devices are usually those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury (section 513(a)(1)(C) of the Act). Most Class III devices require premarket approval (PMA, see definition below). IVD examples of these include automated PAP smear readers, nucleic acid amplification devices for tuberculosis, and total prostate specific antigen (PSA) for the detection of cancer. A limited number of Class III devices that are equivalent to devices legally marketed before enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 may be marketed through the premarket notification (510(k)) process (see definition below), until FDA has published a requirement for manufacturers of that generic type of device to submit PMA data.\n\nCompassionate use - The compassionate use provision allows access for patients with a serious disease or condition who do not meet the requirements for inclusion in the clinical investigation but for whom the treating physician believes the device may provide a benefit in treating and/or diagnosing their disease or condition. There must be no feasible alternative therapies/diagnostics available. Compassionate use is typically available only for individual patients but also may be used to treat a small group. Prior FDA approval is needed before compassionate use occurs.\n\nFurther information can be found at\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance outlines FDA\'s regulatory approach for approval of Class III in vitro diagnostic devices, as well as certain licensed1 or certain cleared2 in vitro diagnostic devices in cases, when a previously approved, licensed, or cleared assay is migrating (i.e., transitioning) to another system for which assay performance has not been evaluated by FDA.2 In this guidance the term ""new system"" refers to the system (assay, instrument, and software) to which the assay is migrating from a previously approved/licensed/cleared system. The term ""old system"" refers to the system (assay, instrument and software) which was approved/licensed/cleared from which the assay is migrating to a currently unapproved/unlicensed/uncleared system.\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance does not apply to immunohematology tests licensed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance can be used for 510(k) devices where the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy (http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm) does not apply (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests) and devices for which transitioning to a new system presents specific concerns, either because of the nature of the analyte and indications, or because of the specific technology used.\n\nThis guidance is focused on the study designs and performance criteria that should be fulfilled in order for a sponsor to utilize the migration study approach in support of the change. FDA will review information from the sponsor, including results of analytical and comparison studies outlined in this guidance, as well as device descriptions and risk analyses, to determine whether the use of the approved/licensed/cleared assay with the new system may compromise safety and effectiveness of the assay. The guidance document describes information that we recommend you include in a PMA (premarket approval application) supplement, a BLA (Biologicals License Application) supplement, or a 510(k) (premarket notification). For devices regulated by OIR (Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health, within CDRH), sponsors may contact OIR, and for those regulated by CBER, sponsors may contact CBER to obtain feedback concerning study plans.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe FDA believes that the assay migration study paradigm discussed in this guidance provides a least burdensome scientific and regulatory pathway for manufacturers to transfer a previously approved or licensed assay with full clinical data from an old system to a new system (not approved. licensed, or cleared). The paradigm is suitable in cases when sufficient knowledge can be derived from the documentation of design controls, risk analyses, and prior performance studies on an old system.\n\nIf you make further modifications or iterations of the old or new system you should compare back to the original old system that has full clinical data when performing new migration studies. However, if the old system with full clinical data is no longer available please contact the appropriate FDA CDRH or CBER Division for further discussion.\n\nThe migration studies approach is related to the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy that FDA uses for many Class I and Class II diagnostic devices.3 Similar to that policy, migration studies rest on the premise that as platform changes are made throughout the lifetime of an approved, licensed, or cleared assay, smaller and more focused analytical and clinical data sets, along with prior knowledge of device design and performance, could allow for a determination that the safety and effectiveness profile of the modified system has not been compromised.\n\nFootnote 3: http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm.\n\nThe assay migration study paradigm is practical, risk based, and consistent with FDA\'s Critical Path Initiative, which is intended to help bring new medical products to market successfully and efficiently4. FDA believes that with proper control and review, migration studies will meet regulatory thresholds for premarket review in a manner that will be least burdensome for both companies and FDA while protecting public health.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThis guidance is intended to be applied, where appropriate, to licensed donor screening tests5 and approved (Class III) in vitro diagnostic assays, as well as 510(k) cleared assays for which migration to a new system presents concerns. Possible scenarios for assay migration are when the assay is being transferred from a manual system to an automated or semi-automated instrument system or from a semi-automated instrument system to a fully automated instrument system, or from one automated instrument system to another (and vice versa for all scenarios). A broad variety of methodologies may use the migration studies paradigm depending on what is known about the two Systems involved. Assay transfer may be from one approved, licensed, or cleared old system to a new system that has the same technical characteristics. However, if scientific evidence suggests migration studies may not be adequate to predict actual clinical testing performance on the new system, the assay migration paradigm should not apply and FDA will recommend that traditional evaluation studies be performed.\n\nFootnote 5: FDA does not believe that this guidance is suitable for use in its entirety when immunohematology tests (e.g., blood grouping, blood group antibody detection and/or identification, crossmatching) are being migrated because of the differences in assay methodology and results reading and interpretation as compared to the other assays and systems described in this guidance. If you believe that your immunohematology reagents and system can be evaluated using the criteria outlined in this guidance, contact the responsible review division in CBER. Immunohematology products are reviewed in the Devices Review Branch, Division of Blood Applications, Office of Blood Research and Review, CBER.\n\nAssay migration studies are ideally suited for test systems for which the assay output (raw signal) is a numeric result or is expressed as a signal to cutoff (S/CO). Devices for which a numeric output is not available might be more difficult to analyze and may not be suitable candidates for use of this approach.\n\nMigration studies would not be applicable to the following devices or to system changes that are generally considered significant, such as:\n\nsystems intended for over-the-counter use,\n\nsystems intended for prescription home use, or\n\ndevices that do not meet the Critical Considerations criteria stated below.\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'

An early contact with the Agency is especially recommended for an assay being transferred from a manual system to an automated or semi-automated instrument system. For CBER licensed devices, this contact may be through an IND, or protocol review, providing preliminary protocols, data, and justifications prior to performing the migration studies. The size, nature,and scope of migration studies we recommend will depend on a detailed evaluation of the old and new systems, the level of regulation appropriate for the product (e.g., PMA, BLA, or 510(k)), the performance characteristics of the assay, and the design and scope of the analytical testing and clinical trials used to support approval, licensure, or clearance of the assay on the old system.\n\nCritical Considerations for Determining Whether The Migration Studies Paradigm May Apply To A Particular Device\n\nA sponsor should take into account the following critical considerations in determining whether the migration studies approach is appropriate for a particular product, and describe these considerations in the submission:\n\nThe intended use and indications for use for the new system should be unchanged from the old system, except for inclusion of the new system.\n\nReagent and assay parameters (e.g., cutoff) should be unchanged, except for very minor differences (such as small changes in incubation times) in order to optimize the assay on the new system. However, the sponsor should provide evidence that the changes do not compromise the assay\'s performance.\n\nSome assay technologies may not be good candidates for the migration studies paradigm (e.g., assays with relatively high imprecision near the assay cutoff).\n\nAssay and system technologies should remain unchanged. All biochemical (e.g., antibody and antigen interactions or DNA probe construct) and physical detection (e.g., colorimetric, chemiluminescence, or dye binding) technologies should be unchanged from the old system. Minor differences in hardware instrumentation may be appropriate and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThere should be no expected change to the assay performance when run on the new system. However, actual changes will be evaluated in the context of their impact on the clinical use of the assay. Due to the limited number of positive and negative samples, the migration studies approach is not appropriate to support changes in clinical performance claims.\n\n5 Additional Considerations\n\nIn addition to addressing each of the critical considerations noted in Section 4, you should also include the information listed below to demonstrate the applicability of migration studies to the transfer of the assay from the old system to the new system. The information in your submission should include, but is not limited to, the following:Footnote 5: http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm089543.html\n\nContents\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nDevice description, including functional block diagrams and hardware and software components for both the old and new systems to allow an evaluation of the changes to the new system when compared to the old system.\n\nA similarities and differences table for a side-by-side comparison of assay parameters and hardware/software functions, requirements and design.\n\nA risk analysis of the new system (software/hardware/assay) using relevant guidance documents [6, 7].\n\nSummaries of software data validating functional operation of alerts and alarms in real or simulated circumstances.\n\nSystem Operator Manual(s): If the new system was previously approved or licensed with analytes other than the one under consideration, a new review of the System Operator Manual may only be called for if changes have been made that impact safety and effectiveness, or if there are assay-specific sections or changes.\n\nProposed modifications to the labeling that appropriately describe respective prior data and new migration study information. The sponsor should consult with FDA when determining whether a dual or separate package insert will be appropriate. Inclusion of the old system\'s analytical and performance data should be included where appropriate.\n\nIn addition, the sponsor should include documentation on software and instrumentation for the new system. When appropriate for the device, this documentation should meet all recommendations for the appropriate Level of Concern[7]. To further minimize risk, studies should be performed on the final production model of the new system that is intended to be marketed. Likewise, studies should be performed using the final release candidate of the software and any differences between the release candidate and the final release should be evaluated using a risk based approach and included in the submission for FDA review.\n\nIf you are using the migration paradigm to migrate an approved Class III assay to an instrument that has not previously been cleared or approved, or to move an approved Class III manual assay to an instrument not previously cleared or approved, you should submit documentation describing the hardware and software design controls, including design verification and validation, along with other appropriate Quality Systems documentation. (See 21 CFR Part 820 - Quality System Regulation). For a general discussion of the Quality System information that FDA recommends including in premarket applications please also refer to the guidance document available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm089543.htmlm070897.htm. In addition, if the instrument manufacturing site has not been inspected as part of the original class III assay approval process, then a site inspection may be conducted.\n\nVI Assay Migration Studies\n\nThis section outlines specific studies that may be appropriate to support assay migration for in vitro diagnostic devices. Before preparing to use the migration studies approach, you should determine whether the assay is quantitative, qualitative or semi-quantitative, according to the definitions in this guidance. Specifically, for the purposes of this guidance, qualitative assays are those that use numeric values (e.g., signal, S/CO), to determine nominal categorical assay results (e.g., positive or negative). Quantitative assays determine numeric values which are referenced to a measuring interval, and standards that allow determination of analyte concentrations. Section VI.A below describes studies for qualitative assays; Sections VI.B and VI.C address quantitative assays and semi-quantitative assays respectively; and Section VI.D addresses point-of-care assays. Special considerations for blood screening assays are covered in Appendix I, ""Migration Studies for Blood Donor Screening Assays.""\n\nMigration Studies for Qualitative Assays\n\nAnalytical Studies for Qualitative Assays\n\nThe evaluations described below are based on the idea that similar studies were conducted previously for the old system. If the study design of the analytical studies conducted for the old system were different from the design of the studies described in this guidance, please contact the FDA for feedback. If you believe that some of the studies outlined in this document do not apply to your particular device, you should present your justification for FDA review.\n\nWe recommend that you use fresh clinical specimens for all analytical studies. If this is impractical, in some cases you may substitute or supplement fresh clinical specimens with archived samples. If archived samples are not available, spiked or diluted clinical samples may be used. In some instances, use of otherwise contrived matrix-specific samples may also be appropriate; however these should mimic clinical specimens as much as is feasible. We recommend that you contact FDA if you wish to discuss appropriate sample types for these evaluations. The matrix of any of these alternative specimens should be the same as that specified by the intended use of the old system.\n\na) Performance at Low Analyte Levels\n\nYou should evaluate the performance of the assay on the new system compared to the old system at low analyte levels (e.g., with dilution panels and seroconversion panels).\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., ""outliers"")?\n--------------------\nContext: A similar approach should be adopted to exploring the influence of outliers, the statistical definition of which is, to some extent, arbitrary. Clear identification of a particular value as an outlier is most convincing when justified medically as well as statistically, and the medical context will then often define the appropriate action. Any outlier procedure set out in the protocol or the statistical analysis plan should be such as not to favor any treatment group a priori. Once again, this aspect of the analysis can be usefully updated during blind review. If no procedure for dealing with outliers was foreseen in the trial protocol, one analysis with the actual values and at least one other analysis eliminating or reducing the outlier effect should be performed and differences between their results discussed.\n\nData Transformation (5.4)\n\nThe decision to transform key variables prior to analysis is best made during the design of the trial on the basis of similar data from earlier clinical trials. Transformations (e.g., square root, logarithm) should be specified in the protocol and a rationale provided, especially for the primary variable(s). The general principles guiding the use of transformations to ensure that the assumptions underlying the statistical methods are met are to be found in standard texts; conventions for particular variables have been developed in a number of specific clinical areas. The decision on whether and how to transform a variable should be influenced by the preference for a scale that facilitates clinical interpretation.\n\nSimilar considerations apply to other derived variables, such as the use of change from baseline, percentage change from baseline, the area under the curve of repeated measures, or the ratio of two different variables. Subsequent clinical interpretation should be carefully considered, and the derivation should be justified in the protocol. Closely related points are made in section II.2.2.\n\nEstimation, Confidence Intervals, and Hypothesis Testing (5.5)\n\nThe statistical section of the protocol should specify the hypotheses that are to be tested and/or the treatment effects that are to be estimated in order to satisfy the primary objectives of the trial. The statistical methods to be used to accomplish these tasks should be described for the primary (and preferably the secondary) variables, and the underlying statistical model should be made clear. Estimates of treatment effects should be accompanied by confidence intervals, whenever possible, and the way in which these will be calculated should be identified. A description should be given of any intentions to use baseline data to improve precision or to adjust estimates for potential baseline differences, for example, by means of analysis of covariance.\n\nIt is important to clarify whether one- or two-sided tests of statistical significance will be used and, in particular, to justify prospectively the use of one-sided tests. If hypothesis tests are not considered appropriate, then the alternative process for arriving at statistical conclusions should be given. The issue of one-sided or two-sided approaches to inference is controversial, and a diversity of views can be found in the statistical literature. The approach of setting Type I errors for one-sided tests at half the conventional Type I error used in two-sided tests is preferable in regulatory settings. This promotes consistency with the two-sided confidence intervals that are generally appropriate for estimating the possible size of the difference between two treatments.\n\nThe particular statistical model chosen should reflect the current state of medical and statistical knowledge about the variables to be analyzed as well as the statistical design of the trial. All effects to be fitted in the analysis (for example, in analysis of variance models) should be fully specified, and the manner, if any, in which this set of effects might be modified in response to preliminary results should be explained. The same considerations apply to the set of covariates fitted in an analysis of covariance. (See also section V.G.) In the choice of statistical methods, due attention should be paid to the statistical distribution of both primary and secondary variables. When making this choice (for example between parametric and nonparametric methods), it is important to bear in mind the need to provide statistical estimates of the size of treatment effects together with confidence intervals (in addition to significance tests).\n\nThe primary analysis of the primary variable should be clearly distinguished from supporting analyses of the primary or secondary variables. Within the statistical section of the protocol or the statistical analysis plan there should also be an outline of the way in which data other than the primary and secondary variables will be summarized and reported. This should include a reference to any approaches adopted for the purpose of achieving consistency of analysis across a range of trials, for example, for safety data.\n\nModeling approaches that incorporate information on known pharmacological parameters, the extent of protocol compliance for individual subjects, or other biologically based data may provide valuable insights into actual or potential efficacy, especially with regard to estimation of treatment effects. The assumptions underlying such models should always be clearly identified, and the limitations of any conclusions should be carefully described.\n\nAdjustment of Significance and Confidence Levels (5.6)\n\nWhen multiplicity is present, the usual frequentist approach to the analysis of clinical trial data may necessitate an adjustment to the Type I error. Multiplicity may arise, for example, from multiple primary variables (see section II.B.2), multiple comparisons of treatments, repeated evaluation over time, and/or interim analyses (see section IV.E). Methods to avoid or reduce multiplicity are sometimes preferable when available, such as the identification of the key primary variable (multiple variables), the choice of a critical treatment contrast (multiple comparisons), and the use of a summary measure such as area under the curve (repeated measures). In confirmatory analyses, any aspects of multiplicity that remain after steps of this kind have been taken should be identified in the protocol; adjustment should always be considered and the details of any adjustment procedure or an explanation of why adjustment is not thought to be necessary should be set out in the analysis plan.\n\nSubgroups, Interactions, and Covariates (5.7)\n\nThe primary variable(s) is often systematically related to other influences apart from treatment. For example, there may be relationships to covariates such as age and sex, or there may be differences between specific subgroups of subjects, such as those treated at the different centers of a multicenter trial. In some instances, an adjustment for the influence of covariates or for subgroup effects is an integral part of the planned analysis and hence should be set out in the protocol. Pretrial deliberations should identify those covariates and factors expected to have an important influence on the primary variable(s), and should consider how to account for these in the analysis to improve precision and to compensate for any lack of balance between treatment groups. If one or more factors are used to stratify the design, it is appropriate to account for those factors in the analysis. When the potential value of an adjustment is in doubt, it is often advisable to nominate the unadjusted analysis as the one for primary attention, the adjusted analysis being supportive. Special attention should be paid to center effects and to the role of baseline measurements of the primary variable. It is not advisable to adjust the main analyses for covariates measured after randomization because they may be affected by the treatments.\n\nThe treatment effect itself may also vary with subgroup or covariate. For example, the effect may decrease with age or may be larger in a particular diagnostic category of subjects. In some cases such interactions are anticipated or are of particular prior interest (e.g., geriatrics); hence a subgroup analysis or a statistical model including interactions is part of the planned confirmatory analysis. In most cases, however, subgroup or interaction analyses are exploratory and should be clearly identified as such; they should explore the uniformity of any treatment effects found overall. In general, such analyses should proceed first through the addition of interaction terms to the statistical model in question, complemented by additional exploratory analysis within relevant subgroups of subjects, or within strata defined by the covariates. When exploratory, these analyses should be interpreted cautiously. Any conclusion of treatment efficacy (or lack thereof) or safety based solely on exploratory subgroup analyses is unlikely to be accepted.\n\nH. Integrity of Data and Computer Software Validity (5.8)\n\nThe credibility of the numerical results of the analysis depends on the quality and validity of the methods and software (both internally and externally written) used both for data management (data entry, storage, verification, correction, and retrieval) and for processing the data statistically. Data management activities should therefore be based on thorough and effective standard operating procedures. The computer software used for data management and statistical analysis should be reliable, and documentation of appropriate software testing procedures should be available.\n\nVI. EVALUATION OF SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY\n\nA. Scope of Evaluation (6.1)\n--------------------\nContext title: E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., ""outliers"")?\n--------------------\nContext: Migration Studies for Qualitative Assays\n\nAnalytical Studies for Qualitative Assays\n\nThe evaluations described below are based on the idea that similar studies were conducted previously for the old system. If the study design of the analytical studies conducted for the old system were different from the design of the studies described in this guidance, please contact the FDA for feedback. If you believe that some of the studies outlined in this document do not apply to your particular device, you should present your justification for FDA review.\n\nWe recommend that you use fresh clinical specimens for all analytical studies. If this is impractical, in some cases you may substitute or supplement fresh clinical specimens with archived samples. If archived samples are not available, spiked or diluted clinical samples may be used. In some instances, use of otherwise contrived matrix-specific samples may also be appropriate; however these should mimic clinical specimens as much as is feasible. We recommend that you contact FDA if you wish to discuss appropriate sample types for these evaluations. The matrix of any of these alternative specimens should be the same as that specified by the intended use of the old system.\n\na) Performance at Low Analyte Levels\n\nYou should evaluate the performance of the assay on the new system compared to the old system at low analyte levels (e.g., with dilution panels and seroconversion panels).\n\nWhere available, assay performance at low positive analyte levels usingdilution panels should be based on international standards (e.g., World Health Organization (WHO) standards, Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) standards) and compared with the old system.\n\nIf available and appropriate, test well-characterized seroconversion panels similar in number and type to the panels originally used to support approval/licensure/clearance. The seroconversion panels should be run on both the old system and the new system.\n\n3.2.2 Precision\n\nThis section describes precision study designs including panel composition.\n\n(i) Composition of Precision Panel\n\nThe categorical result of a qualitative test is determined using the numeric test data and a cutoff(s) (e.g., a numeric threshold), which define numeric ranges that correspond to the final result categories. For a qualitative test with two categorical results, a cutoff (one threshold) is used to define positive and negative results of the test. When the observed numeric test data exceeds the threshold, the final result is considered positive (or ""reactive"", ""detected""). When the observed numeric test result is below the cutoff, it is considered negative (or ""not reactive"", ""not detected"").\n\nQualitative assays discriminating between two classes of subjects (non-diseased vs diseased) can fall into two groups: 1) assays used in situations where non- diseased subject samples have a true zero concentration of the analyte of interest, and 2) assays used in situations where non-diseased subject samples have a detectable analyte concentration. For the latter, the cutoff was chosen to optimize clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity of the assay based on a clinical data set. Appropriate precision panels for these two types of assays, as well as assays that produce equivocal results, and/or have a re-test zone, are discussed in more detail in (a)-(c), below:\n\n(a) When non-diseased subject samples have a detectable amount of analyte.\n\nFor the non-diseased subject samples that have a detectable amount of analyte the cutoff of the assay is higher than the limit of the blank. A useful characteristic of the cutoff is that a sample with a concentration (determined by the mean signal to cutoff value from a large a series of replicate measurements) at the cutoff yields a positive result 50% of the time and a negative result 50% of the time when a large number of replicates of that sample are run under stipulated conditions (see Figure 1 below). We denote this concentration as C({}_{50}).\n\nFor samples with concentrations exceeding C({}{50}), one expects to see positive results more than 50% of the time, and similarly for samples with a concentration below C({}{50}), one expects to see positive results less than 50% of the time. In this guidance we refer to an analyte concentration that yields, upon evaluating many replicates, a positive result 95% of the time (and a negative result 5% of the time) as a Low Positive concentration (C({}{95}) concentration). We refer to a sample concentration which yields a positive result 5% of the time (and negative result 95% of the time) as a High Negative concentration (C({}{5}) concentration). Samples with concentrations of analyte close to C({}{95}) and C({}{5}) as determined by the old system are recommended for the within-laboratory precision (see CLSI8 document EP12). The panel should consist of at least four members, as described below (also, see Figure 2):\n\nFootnote 8: Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute. CLSI documents referenced in this guidance are listed in Section XI of this document.\n\nA True Negative sample: a sample with a true analyte concentration of zero.\n\nA High Negative sample: a sample that repeatedly tests negative approximately 95% of the time and positive 5% of the time by the old system. One should expect that the same concentration tested by the new system will also produce negative results approximately 95% of\n\nFigure 1: Results of a qualitative assay (probability density function) for a sample with a concentration at the cutoff measured multiple times.\n\nthe time (C({}{5}) concentration as determined by the old system).\n* A Low Positive sample: a sample with an analyte concentration around C({}{95}) as determined by the old system. Repeatedly testing this sample by the old system should give a positive result approximately 95% of the time and a negative result 5% of the time. One should expect that the same concentration tested by the new system will also produce positive results approximately 95% of the time. Note that if the LoB is used as a cutoff, then the concentration C({}_{95}) is the same as the LoD.\n* A Moderate Positive sample: a sample with a concentration close to the cutoff, and at which one observes positive results by the old system approximately 100% of the time (e.g., a sample with a signal approximately two to three times the signal at the cutoff if the cutoff=1.0, or a sample with concentration approximately two to three times the 95% LoD if the cutoff is based on LoB).\n\nFor the details of how the C({}{95}) and C({}{5}) concentrations can be evaluated from the previous precision studies of the old system, see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 1. For the precision study of the new system, it is not necessary to have the High Negative and Low Positive samples at exactly C({}{5}) or C({}{95}) of the old system. If the High Negative and Low Positive samples in the precision study of the new system are close enough to the cutoff that the standard\n\nFigure 2: Relationship between percent of positive results and the analyte cutoff concentration.\n\ndeviation (or percent coefficient of variation (CV) is approximately constant over the range around the cutoff, the C({}{5}) and C({}{95}) of the new system can be evaluated from this precision study (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 1).\n\n(b) When non-diseased subject samples have a true zero analyte concentration.\n\nWhen non-diseased subject samples have a true zero analyte concentration there are two types of assays: (1) assays for which samples with zero concentration have a distribution of numeric signals and the cutoff of the assay is the limit of blank (with some type I error, for example, 5%); and (2) ultrasensitive assays for which samples with zero analyte concentration almost always have a negative assay result (type I error is close to zero). These two types of assays are discussed further in the two bullets below.\n\nConsider assays where samples with zero analyte concentration have a distribution of numeric signals and the limit of blank is used as a cutoff. In this case the concentration C({}{95}) is the same as the limit of detection (LoD) and zero concentration (no analyte present in sample) is C({}{5}) as illustrated in Figure 3, below. The precision panel should consist of at least the following three members: True Negative, Low Positive (around LoD) and Moderately Positive.\n\nFigure 3: Relationship between the percent of positive results and the analyte concentration where True Negative samples produce numeric results and the C({}_{95}) concentration is the LoD of the assay.\n\nFor ultrasensitive assays that employ, for example, a signal amplification methodology (e.g., real-time PCR), the following approaches for precision panel members are recommended. For ultrasensitive assays, the concentration range that spans High Negative (around C({}{5})) to Low Positive (around C({}{95})=LoD) is narrow with respect to the observed concentration range of clinical specimens. Due to this narrow range, it may be difficult to prepare a sample with C({}{5}) concentration. If less than 10% of all subjects positive by the old system have an observed concentration less than C({}{95}), then samples at the C({}{5}) concentration could be excluded from the precision panel. In this case, samples which compose the precision panel should include the following concentrations: True Negative, Low Positive (around C({}{95})) and Moderately Positive. If more than 10% of all subjects positive by the old system have an observed concentration less than C({}{95}), then samples which compose the precision panel should include the following concentrations: True Negative, Low Positive (around C({}{95})), samples in the range of C({}{20}) to C({}{80}) and Moderately Positive as illustrated in Figure 4, below.\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., ""outliers"")?\n--------------------\nContext: The full analysis set and the per protocol set play different roles in superiority trials (which seek to show the investigational product to be superior), and in equivalence or non-inferiority trials (which seek to show the investigational product to be comparable, see section 3.3.2). In superiority trials the full analysis set is used in the primary analysis (apart from exceptional circumstances) because it tends to avoid over-optimistic estimates of efficacy resulting from a per protocol analysis, since the non-compliers included in the full analysis set will generally diminish the estimated treatment effect. However, in an equivalence or non-inferiority trial use of the full analysis set is generally not conservative and its role should be considered very carefully.\n\nMissing Values and Outliers\n\nMissing values represent a potential source of bias in a clinical trial. Hence, every effort should be undertaken to fulfil all the requirements of the protocol concerning the collection and management of data. In reality, however, there will almost always be some missing data. A trial may be regarded as valid, nonetheless, provided the methods of dealing with missing values are sensible, and particularly if those methods are pre-defined in the protocol. Definition of methods may be refined by updating this aspect in the statistical analysis plan during the blind review. Unfortunately, no universally applicable methods of handling missing values can be recommended. An investigation should be made concerning the sensitivity of the results of analysis to the method of handling missing values, especially if the number of missing values is substantial.\n\nA similar approach should be adopted to exploring the influence of outliers, the statistical definition of which is, to some extent, arbitrary. Clear identification of a particular value as an outlier is most convincing when justified medically as well as statistically, and the medical context will then often define the appropriate action. Any outlier procedure set out in the protocol or the statistical analysis plan should be such as not to favour any treatment group a priori. Once again, this aspect of the analysis can be usefully updated during blind review. If no procedure for dealing with outliers was foreseen in the trial protocol, one analysis with the actual values and at least one other analysis eliminating or reducing the outlier effect should be performed and differences between their results discussed.\n\nData Transformation\n--------------------\nContext title: E9_Guideline']","['An outlier, an observation that lies an unexpected distance from other values, does not in itself prove that an error or violation has occurred.

26,"Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?","['--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nSponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/sponsor-investigator-irb-interrelationship). Office of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nThe interrelationship and interaction between the research sponsor (e.g., drug, biologic and device manufacturers), the clinical investigator and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) may be very complex. The regulations do not prohibit direct sponsor-IRB contacts, although, the sponsor-IRB interaction customarily occurs through the investigator who conducts the clinical study. The clinical investigator generally provides the communication link between the IRB and the sponsor. Such linkage is agreed to by the sponsors and investigators when they sign forms FDA-1571 and FDA-1572, respectively, for drug and biologic studies or an investigator agreement for device studies. There are occasions when direct communication between the IRB and the sponsor may facilitate resolution of concerns about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The clinical investigator should be kept apprised of the discussion.\n\nSponsor Assurance that IRBs Operate in Compliance with 21 CFR Part 56\n\nFDA regulations [21 CFR 312.23(a)(1)(iv)] require that a sponsor assure the FDA that a study will be conducted in compliance with the informed consent and IRB regulations [21 CFR parts 50 and 56]. This requirement has been misinterpreted to mean that it is a sponsor\'s obligation to determine IRB compliance with the regulations. This is not the case. Sponsors should rely on the clinical investigator, who assures the sponsor on form FDA-1572 for drugs and biologics or the investigator agreement for devices that the study will be reviewed by an IRB. Because clinical investigators work directly with IRBs, it is appropriate that they assure the sponsor that the IRB is functioning in compliance with the regulations.\n\nAn IRB must notify an investigator in writing of its decision to approve, disapprove or request modifications in a proposed research activity [21 CFR 56.109(e)]. This correspondence should be made available to the sponsor by the clinical investigator. In the Agency\'s view, this required documentation provides the sponsor with reasonable assurance that an IRB complies with 21 CFR part 56 and that it will be responsible for initial and continuing review of the study. Also, the sponsor and, in fact, anyone who is interested, mayobtain an Establishment Inspection Report from an FDA inspection of an IRB. These reports summarize the conditions observed during the IRB inspection. FDA, however, does not certify IRBs.\n\nSponsor Access to Medical Records\n\nThe IRB is responsible for ensuring that informed consent documents include the extent to which the confidentiality of medical records will be maintained [21 CFR 50.25(a)(5)]. FDA requires sponsors (or research monitors hired by them) to monitor the accuracy of the data submitted to FDA in accordance with regulatory requirements. These data are generally in the possession of the clinical investigator. Each subject must be advised during the informed consent process of the extent to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained and of the possibility that the FDA may inspect the records. While FDA access to medical records is a regulatory requirement, subject names are not usually requested by FDA unless the records of particular individuals require a more detailed study of the cases, or unless there is reason to believe that the records do not represent actual cases studied or actual results obtained. The consent document should list all other entities (e.g., the sponsor) who will have access to records identifying the subject. The extent to which confidentiality will be maintained may affect a subject\'s decision to participate in a clinical investigation.\n\nConfidentiality of Sponsor Information\n\nThe IRB\'s primary responsibility with respect to protecting confidentiality is to the research subject. IRBs should, however, respect the sponsor\'s need to maintain confidentiality of certain information about products under development. IRB members and staff should be aware that information submitted for review may be confidential, trade secret, and of commercial interest and should recognize the need for maintaining the confidentiality of the review materials and IRB records. It is advisable for IRBs to have policies that address this issue.\n\nNonsignificant Risk Device Studies\n\n""A sponsor\'s preliminary determination that a medical device study presents an NSR is subject to IRB approval."" The effect of the IRB\'s NSR decision is important to research sponsors and investigators because significant risk (SR) studies require sponsors to file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with FDA before they may begin. NSR studies, however, may begin as soon as the IRB approves the study. The sponsor, usually through the clinical investigator, provides the IRB with information necessary to make a judgment on the risk of a device study. While the investigational plan and supporting materials usually contain sufficient information to make a determination, the IRB can request additional information if needed [21 CFR 812.150(b)(10)]. If the IRB believes that additional information is needed, it may contact the sponsor directly, but it should keep the clinical investigator apprised of the request. While making the SR/NSR determination, any of the three parties may ask FDA to provide a risk assessment. See FDA Information Sheet: ""Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies"" for further information.\n\nDisagreements\n\nThe sponsor may choose not to conduct, to terminate, or to discontinue studies that do not conform with the sponsor\'s wishes. For example, the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB may reach an impasse about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The FDA will not mediate such disagreements. The Agency\'s policy of decentralized ethical review of clinical investigations allows such decisions to be made by local IRBs, and any disagreements between a sponsor, IRB, and clinical investigator should be resolved through appropriate communication among those parties.\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) - Specific Electronic Submissions Intended For FDA\'s Dockets Management Staff (i.e., Citizen Pettitions, Draft Proposed Guidance Documents, Variances, and other administrative record submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management Food and Drug Administration 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061 Rockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\n[] Search for FDA Guidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: Research interactions that involve no more than minimal risk to subjects (e.g., quality of life surveys); and\n\nCollection of follow-up data from procedures or interventions that would have been done as part of routine clinical practice to monitor a subject for disease progression or recurrence, regardless of whether the procedures or interventions are described in the research protocol.\n\nIn contrast, FDA interprets ""long-term follow-up"" to exclude:\n\nResearch interventions that would not have been performed for clinical purposes, even if the research interventions involve no more than minimal risk.\n\nOf note, some studies that are not eligible for expedited review under category (8)(a) at the time of continuing review may be eligible for expedited review under one of the other expedited review categories. For example, if a study\'s only remaining activity involves long-term follow-up of subjects by drawing 15 ml of blood once annually for a test that is not part of routine clinical practice, such research would not be eligible for expedited review under category (8)(a), but might be eligible for expedited review under category (2).\n\nExpedited review category (8)(b)\n\nIRBs conducting continuing review should be aware that if a study previously received expedited continuing review under category (8)(b), but has now begun enrolling subjects, the study may need to be referred for review by the IRB at a convened meeting. The criterion that ""no additional risks have been identified"" is interpreted by FDA to mean that neither the investigator nor the IRB has identified any additional risks in the research from any relevant source20 since the IRB\'s most recent prior review.\n\nFootnote 20: For example, “any relevant source” would include a review of scientific literature or adverse event reports by the IRB or investigator, as well as communication with FDA or the sponsor.\n\nExpedited review category (8)(c)\n\nFDA notes that the process for conducting continuing review of research eligible under expedited review category (8)(c) can be accomplished through a simple, abbreviated process. For example, if the study is no longer enrolling subjects, all subjects have completed all protocol required visits, and no new data is being collected, and the investigator\'s sole activity is data analysis, the investigator, as part of the continuing review process, could provide to the IRB the following statement regarding the research: ""The study only involves data analysis, which is proceeding in accordance with the IRB-approved research protocol, and there are no problems to report."" This statement could be provided by email or as part of a standard continuing review application form. Upon receipt of such a statement from the investigator, the IRB chairperson, or other member(s) designated by the chairperson, under the expedited review procedure, may approve continuation of the research project for another year without further deliberation or review.\n\nOnce the data collection from all trial sites is complete and the overall study results database has been locked and the only remaining activity is analysis of the aggregate data by the study sponsor, further continuing review of the research is generally no longer required.\n\n4.4.2 Expedited Review Category (9)\n\nSimilar to review category (1)21 for initial review, under category (9), an expedited review procedure may be used for the continuing review of research previously approved by the IRB at a convened meeting that meets the following conditions:\n\nFootnote 21: Category 1 research addresses “(1) Clinical studies of drugs and medical devices only when condition (a) or (b) is met: (a) Research on drugs for which an investigational new drug application (21 CFR Part 312) is not required. (Note: Research on marketed drugs that significantly increases the risks or decreases the acceptability of the risks associated with the use of the product is not eligible for expedited review.)\n\nThe research is not conducted under an investigational new drug (IND) application or an investigational device exemption (IDE);\n\nExpedited review categories (2) through (8) do not apply to the research;\n\nThe IRB has documented at a convened meeting that the research involves no greater than minimal risk to the subjects; and\n\nNo additional risks have been identified.\n\nWith regard to the third condition, the IRB at a convened meeting must have determined that either (a) the research project as a whole involved no more than minimal risk, or (b) the remaining research activities present no more than minimal risk to human subjects. With regard to multi-site studies, the fourth condition, that no additional risks have been identified, is interpreted to mean that neither the investigator nor the IRB at a particular institution has identified any additional risks of the research based on information from any other institution engaged in the research project or from any other relevant source since the IRB\'s most recent prior review.\n\nFrequency of Continuing Review\n\nUnder 21 CFR 56.108(a)(2) and 56.109(f), the IRB must determine the frequency of continuing review for each clinical investigation to ensure the continued protection of the rights and welfare of research subjects. FDA regulations at 21 CFR 56.109(f) require an IRB to conduct continuing review of research at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk posed to the subjects, but not less than once a year.\n\nMore frequent review (i.e., more frequently than once per year) is appropriate, for example, when the risks to subjects require close monitoring. The IRB should consider the factors set forth below when deciding on an appropriate interval for continuing review. These factors should be outlined in the IRB\'s written procedures for deciding on the frequency of continuing review:\n\nThe nature of and any risks posed by the clinical investigation;\n\nThe degree of uncertainty regarding the risks involved;\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe vulnerability of the subject population;\n\nThe experience of the clinical investigator in conducting clinical research;\n\nThe IRB\'s previous experience with that investigator and/or sponsor (e.g., compliance history, previous problems with the investigator obtaining informed consent, prior complaints from subjects about the investigator);\n\nThe projected rate of enrollment; and\n\nWhether the study involve novel therapies.\n\nAt the time of initial approval of the study, FDA recommends that the IRB notify the investigator of the interval at which continuing review will occur (at least annually) and the date by which continuing review must occur. Similarly, at the time of continuing review, the IRB should consider whether the current frequency of continuing review for the study is adequate or should be adjusted. In addition to specifying a time interval, the IRB may also specify a subject enrollment number as a threshold for determining when continuing review is to occur. For example, at the time of initial review and approval of a high-risk clinical trial, the IRB might require that continuing review occur either in 6 months or after 5 subjects have been enrolled, whichever occurs first. However, if the continuing review interval is described in relation to a subject enrollment number, it must at a minimum also provide for continuing review annually, regardless of the number of subjects enrolled at that time; it is therefore not acceptable to describe the review interval solely in relation to a number of subjects enrolled. The minutes of IRB meetings should clearly document the approval period (continuing review interval).\n\nThe IRB\'s determinations regarding the approval of research must be communicated to the investigator in writing (21 CFR 56.109(e)). This written determination should also notify the investigator of the required interval for, and expected date of, continuing review.\n\nDetermining the Effective Date of Initial IRB Approval and the Dates for Continuing Review\n\nContinuing review must occur at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less frequently than once per year (21 CFR 56.109(f)). IRBs should establish written procedures for informing investigators of the FDA\'s regulations and the IRB\'s own policies and procedures on continuing review requirements. (See 21 CFR 56.108(a)(1) & (2).) This applies whether a study is reviewed by the convened IRB or through an expedited process.\n\nThe IRB\'s written procedures should describe how the IRB determines the effective date of approval for the study and how the date and period of approval will be communicated to the clinical investigator.\n\nWhen the IRB Reviews and Initially Approves Research Without Conditions at a\n\nConvened Meeting\n\nWhen the IRB conducts the initial review of a study at a convened meeting and approves the research for one year without requiring either (a) changes to the protocol or informed consent document(s), or (b) submission of clarifications or additional documents, the effective date of the initial approval is the date of that IRB meeting. In such circumstances, the expiration date of theinitial approval period and the date by which the first continuing review must occur may be as late as one year after the date of the IRB meeting at which the research initially was approved (21 CFR 56.109(f)).\n\nWhen the IRB Reviews and Initially Approves Research With Conditions at a Convened IRB Meeting Without Requiring Further Review at a Subsequent Convened Meeting\n\nA much more common scenario is when an IRB conducting the initial review of a research project at a convened meeting takes the following set of actions:\n\nApproves the project for one year;\n--------------------\nContext title: IRB Continuing Review After Clinical Investigation Approval Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsor\n\nFor studies conducted under an IND, 21 CFR part 312 provides that a sponsor is responsible for obtaining a commitment from each investigator that he or she will ensure that requirements in part 56 relating to IRB review and approval are met with respect to the research conducted by the investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d)). Sponsors can also initiate plans for use of a centralized IRB review process and facilitate agreements and other necessary communications among the parties involved.\n\n3.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.1.2 Investigator\n\nUnder 21 CFR part 312, an investigator is responsible for ensuring that there will be initial and continuing review by a qualified IRB of research conducted by that investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d); 312.66). If the investigator is conducting clinical research as part of a multicenter study at an institution with its own IRB and is subject to the policies of that institution, those policies would dictate how the investigator will ensure IRB review. Those policies may provide that the investigator\'s responsibility can be met by ensuring review through a centralized IRB review, through the institution\'s IRB, or through apportionment of IRB review responsibilities between a centralized IRB and the institution\'s IRB.\n\nCentral IRB\n\nFor multicenter studies, the central IRB is the IRB that conducts reviews on behalf of all study sites that agree to participate in the centralized review process. For sites at institutions that have an IRB that would ordinarily review research conducted at the site, the central IRB should reach agreement with the individual institutions participating in centralized review and those institutions\' IRBs about how to apportion the review responsibilities between local IRBs and the central IRB (21 CFR 56.114).\n\nIV Addressing Local Aspects of IRB Review\n\nThe implementation of a centralized IRB review process involves addressing a number of issues related to the communities where the research will take place. The requirements for IRB membership in 21 CFR 56.107(a) specify that the membership of an IRB must have sufficient experience, expertise, and diversity to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. This requirement was intended to implement a recommendation of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research that IRB members be ""men and women of diverse backgrounds and sufficient maturity, experience, and competence to assure that the Board will be able to discharge its responsibilities and that its determinations will be accorded respect by investigators and the community served by the institution or in which it is located.""1 In addition, IRB members must ""be able to ascertain the acceptability of the proposed research in terms of institutional commitments and regulations, applicable law, and standards or professional conduct and practice"" (21 CFR 56.107(a)). Thus, IRB review, through its membership, is intended to provide meaningful consideration of various local factors in assessing research activities, including the cultural backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, educational level, religious affiliations) of the population from which research subjects will be drawn, community attitudes10 about the nature\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nof the proposed research, and the capacity of the institution to conduct or support the proposed research. Inter-community differences could influence, among other things, assessments of whether mechanisms of subject selection will be equitable, whether adequate provision is made to minimize risks to vulnerable populations, and the adequacy of the informed consent process.\n\nThe preamble to the final rule indicates that where a centralized IRB review process is used (21 CFR 56.114), the review should consider the ethical standards of the local community.11 Therefore, a centralized IRB review process should include mechanisms to ensure meaningful consideration of these relevant local factors. Possible mechanisms include:\n\nFootnote 11: Federal Register, Vol. 46, p. 8966, January 27, 1981\n\nProvision of relevant local information to the central IRB in writing by individuals or organizations familiar with the local community, institution, and/or clinical research\n\nParticipation of consultants with relevant expertise, or IRB members from the institution\'s own IRB, in the deliberations of the central IRB\n\nLimited review of a central IRB-reviewed study by the institution\'s own IRB, with that limited review focusing on issues that are of concern to the local community\n\nOther mechanisms may also be appropriate.12 IRB meeting minutes or other records should document how relevant community issues were considered in the review (21 CFR 56.115(a)) (see section 5).\n\nFootnote 12: Guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) (IRB Knowledge of Local Research Context) discusses mechanisms for ensuring adequate consideration of local factors by IRBs in review of clinical research that is supported by DHHS funding. Although the guidance applies only to DHHS funded research, it may be also helpful to off-site IRBs seeking to provide meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for non-DHHS funded clinical research.\n\n5 IRB Records -- Documenting Agreements and Procedures\n\nIRBs and institutions are required to prepare and maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities (21 CFR 56.115(a)). IRBs are also required to follow written procedures for the conduct of initial and continuing review of clinical research and for reporting their findings and actions to the investigator and the institution (21 CFR section 56.108(a), 56.115(a)(6)). The following recommendations should help IRBs fulfill these requirements.\n\nDocumenting Agreements\n\nIf an institution, its IRB, and a central IRB agree (under 21 CFR 56.114) to participate in a centralized IRB review process, they should document that action in an agreement signed by the parties. IRBs should report this action to the investigator and the institution, for example, by providing copies of the agreement to the investigator, and the institution.13 If the agreement\n\n3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApportions IRB review responsibilities between a central IRB and the institution\'s IRB, the agreement should delineate the specific responsibilities of the central IRB and the institution\'s IRB for the initial and continuing review of the study.\n\nWritten Procedures\n\nWhen an institution and an institution\'s IRB rely on review by a central IRB, both IRBs must have written procedures in place to implement the centralized IRB review process (21 CFR 56.108, 56.114). For example, procedures should address the following:\n\nHow the institution\'s IRB determines that the central IRB is qualified to review research conducted at the institution\n\nHow the central IRB intends to communicate with relevant institutions, the institutions\' IRBs, and investigators regarding its review\n\nHow the central IRB ensures that it provides meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for communities from which research subjects will be drawn (see Section 4)\n\nHow the central IRB assesses the ability of a geographically remote site to participate in a study (e.g., whether the site has medical services appropriate to the complexity of the study)\n\nWhen an institution, an institution\'s IRB, and a central IRB agree to apportion IRB review responsibilities between the two IRBs, each IRB must have written procedures describing how it implements its responsibilities under the agreement (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)).\n\nVI Using a Central IRB at Unaffiliated Sites\n\nAt clinical sites that are not already affiliated with an IRB, investigators and sponsors typically rely on the review and oversight of a central IRB. In this situation, the central IRB should document in meeting minutes or other records how it considered relevant local factors for the various communities from which research subjects are to be drawn (see Section 4). The central IRB must also document its action in agreeing to conduct IRB review for the site (21 CFR 56.115) and must have written procedures in place that describe how it will perform its initial and continuing review responsibilities at remote sites (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)) (see Section 5).\n\nVII Examples of Cooperative IRB Review Models\n\nThere are a variety of mechanisms that have been used to distribute IRB review responsibilities between an institution\'s IRB and a central IRB. This guidance is not intended to endorse any particular mechanism. These examples are provided only to illustrate possible mechanisms.\n\nTrial in Which Multiple Sites Rely on a Central IRB\n\nThe primary model contemplated by this guidance is a centralized IRB review process used for a single multicenter trial performed by a commercial or publicly funded sponsor. Under 21 CFR 56.114, IRBs affiliated with the study sites could enter into agreements with a central IRB to rely on all or some of the review findings of the central IRB, or could decline to participate in a centralized IRB review (i.e., do their own complete review). Study sites not already affiliated with an IRB would rely on a central IRB for all IRB review responsibilities.\n\nCentral IRB Formed to Review Multicenter Trials in a Therapeutic Category\n--------------------\nContext title: Using a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials Guidance for Industry'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA also recommends that the IRB notify the sponsor of any instance of serious or continuing non-compliance with FDA regulations or IRB requirements or determinations, and any suspension or termination of IRB approval. Among the general responsibilities of sponsors is the assurance of proper monitoring of the investigation (21 CFR 312.50 and 21 CFR 812.40) and the selection of qualified investigators (21 CFR 312.53(a) and 21 CFR 812.43(a)). Informing sponsors of investigator non-compliance or IRB suspension or termination of the study allows the sponsor the opportunity to address these concerns. For example, the sponsor could work with the investigator to transfer subjects to another site in the local area, find a replacement investigator at the current site, or ensure that the study is terminated in an orderly manner.\n\n2.2.2 Suspension or Termination of IRB Approval\n\nThe IRB has the authority to suspend or terminate approval of clinical investigations:\n\nthat are not conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements (21 CFR 56.113); or\n\nthat are associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects (21 CFR 56.113).\n\nSuspension of approval may be appropriate when a significant issue is first identified and while the IRB investigates the matter. For example, if there is an allegation of investigator misconduct or a safety issue that needs further investigation and evaluation, the IRB may decide to suspend the study until the matter is resolved. In addition, the IRB may determine whether it is appropriate to notify subjects, and if so, when, given that complete information may not be available when the IRB first becomes aware of the issue.\n\nFor multi-site studies in which a local IRB is responsible for review of research at a given site, the local IRB's decision to suspend or terminate its approval of the research only applies to the conduct of the research project at the site under its review. On the other hand, if many or all sites engaged in a multi-site study rely upon a central IRB for review of the research, the central IRB could suspend or terminate its approval of the research either at one site because of a problem regarding the conduct of the research at that site, or at all sites under its review because of a study-wide problem. If an IRB (whose authority is only over a single site) believes the problem it found may be present at other sites, the IRB should inform FDA of its concern in the suspension or termination notification.\n\nAny suspension or termination of IRB approval must include the reasons for the IRB's actions and be promptly reported to the clinical investigator, institutional officials, and the FDA (21 CFR 56.113). IRBs must follow written procedures for ensuring such reporting (21 CFR 56.108(b)(3)).\n\nWhen reporting suspensions or terminations of IRB approval to FDA, IRBs should include:\n\nthe name of the drug, biologic, or device;the IND number; or the IDE number/non-significant risk (NSR) status of the device;\n\nthe full name of the research protocol;\n\nthe name(s) and address(es) of the clinical investigator(s);\n\nthe reason(s) for the suspension or termination; and\n\ninformation about the IRB's investigation and action plan to prevent/address future non-compliance.\n\nIRBs that have concerns about suspension or termination of approval of studies may contact FDA at any time to discuss these issues.27\n\nFootnote 27: See http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/ucm134493.htm\n\nWhen a study is suspended or terminated by the IRB, the IRB should consider the need to inform current or previously enrolled study subjects, as appropriate, about the action. In addition, an IRB should have established procedures to ensure that the rights and welfare of currently enrolled subjects are protected, subjects are not put at risk, and subjects receive appropriate care, if indicated, should the IRB (a) suspend or terminate its approval during the period for which IRB approval had already been given, or (b) disapprove a study at the time of continuing review. For example, the IRB, in consultation with the investigator and the subjects' treating physicians (if different from the investigator), may need to determine whether it is in the best interests of currently enrolled subjects to (a) continue receiving the interventions that were being administered to subjects under the study at the present site, (b) be transferred to another study-site so that participation of the subjects in the study may continue, or (c) be transitioned to medical management outside of the research context. Continuation of subjects on the test article may be appropriate, for example, when the test article holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the study subjects or when withholding the test article poses increased risk to study subjects. If the IRB decides that enrolled subjects should continue to receive the test article, it should also ensure that data collection (especially safety information) continues for such subjects. If follow-up of currently enrolled subjects is necessary to ensure their rights, safety or welfare, the IRB should ensure that the investigators inform the subjects, and report any unanticipated problems to the IRB, the sponsor, and the FDA (see 21 CFR 56.108(b)).\n\nAppendix\n\nCATEGORIES OF RESEARCH THAT MAY BE REVIEWED BY THE INSTITITUDINAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB) THROUGH AN EXPEDITION REVIEW PROCEDURE({}^{\\lx@sectionsign})1\n\nFootnote 1: An expedited review procedure consists of a review of research involving human subjects by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of the IRB in accordance with the requirements set forth in 45 CFR 46.110.\n\n[Federal Register: November 9, 1998 (Volume 63, Number 216)] [Notices] [Page 60353-60356]*\n\nFootnote *: The list may be viewed online via GPO Access at http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dhname=1998 register&docid=98-29748-filed.pdf\n\nThe list that is referenced in Sec. 56.110(a) was originally published in the Federal Register of January 27, 1981 (46 FR 8980), as a notice of a list of research activities that could be reviewed by the IRB through the expedited review procedures set forth in the FDA's regulations. OPRR has a separate codification that references the Expedited Review List for matters under the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) jurisdiction (45 CFR part 46). The HHS list was published in the Federal Register on January 26, 1981 (46 FR 8392). The FDA and HHS lists published in 1981 differ slightly, in that item nine on the HHS list, concerning research on individual or group behavior, pertains only to 45 CFR 46.110. Because behavioral research is not specifically regulated by FDA, that category was not included in the list published by FDA.\n\nApplicability\n\n(A) Research activities that (1) present no more than minimal risk to human subjects, and (2) involve only procedures listed in one or more of the following categories, may be reviewed by the IRB through the expedited review procedure authorized by 45 CFR 46.110 and 21 CFR 56.110. The activities listed should not be deemed to be of minimal risk simply because they are included on this list. Inclusion on this list merely means that the activity is eligible for review through the expedited review procedure when the specific circumstances of the proposed research involve no more than minimal risk to human subjects. (B) The categories in this list apply regardless of the age of subjects, except as noted. (C) The expedited review procedure may not be used where identification of the subjects and/or their responses would reasonably place them at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, insurability, reputation, or be stigmatizing, unless reasonable and appropriate protections will be implemented so that risks related to invasion of privacy and breach of confidentiality are no greater than minimal. (D) The expedited review procedure may not be used for classified research involving human subjects. (E) IRBs are reminded that the standard requirements for informed consent (or its waiver, alteration, or exception) apply regardless of the type of review--expedited or convened-utilized by the IRB.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: In the conduct of an adaptive design, an effective and well-documented firewall increases the likelihood that trial modifications will be scientifically valid, maintain integrity of the data and trial, and be acceptable for regulatory purposes.\n\nInstitutional Review Boards\n\nInstitutional Review Board (IRB) oversight (21 CFR part 56) is an important component of assuring that human research subjects receive adequate protections before and during study conduct. There are several steps that study sponsors can take in advance of initiating an adaptive clinical study that can minimize or avoid critical IRB-related delays during the study.\n\nAs an initial step when seeking IRB approval, sponsors should clearly describe the adaptive nature of the study and provide an informed consent document that accurately reflects the study\'s risks and meets other informed consent requirements. Potential planned adaptations should be described to the IRB and sponsors are encouraged to clearly articulate the circumstances under which protocol amendments will be submitted to the IRB for review.\n\nAn IRB\'s familiarity with adaptive design clinical studies may impact the efficiency with which they are able to review such studies and study modifications. For example, some IRBs may require the resubmission of the study protocol for full board review when an adaptation is made. If pre-specified adaptations were not disclosed to the IRB during the initial approval process, the sponsor risks critical IRB-related delays that can hinder study progress. Failure to disclose the adaptive nature of the study and its associated risks in the initial informed consent document may result in an IRB-mandated reconsenting of study subjects or subject notification related to the study modifications or identified risks.\n\nAdvanced planning and good communication with the IRB can mitigate these potential IRB-related issues.\n\nD. Logistical Challenges\n\nThe conduct of an adaptive clinical study creates several logistical challenges. A robust infrastructure is needed to ensure that the adaptive design is implemented appropriately. All parties that will be involved in the management and implementation of the study should have a thorough understanding of the principles of adaptive design. Efficient and reliable datamanagement should be a priority. Mid-course changes to the sample size may create challenges regarding the timely availability of a sufficient number of investigational devices. A robust and comprehensive set of standard operating procedures to ensure that the outcome results remain sufficiently blinded or masked should be used.\n\n11 Regulatory Considerations\n\nInteractions with FDA\n\nThe FDA is committed to timely evaluation of clinical study protocols through its IDE program. Sponsor - FDA interactions and communication are the best and most efficient ways to ensure that the Agency understands the sponsor\'s plans and device development strategy and that sponsors understand the FDA\'s recommendations regarding maximizing study efficiency and chances for success.\n\nAlthough a study sponsor may directly submit an IDE for Agency evaluation, the likelihood of success is increased through interactions with the relevant FDA review division and statistical staff during the study planning phase. These ""pre-submission"" meetings are intended to promote dialogue and interactive exchange of perspectives, and allow sponsors to understand the FDA expectations for a pivotal adaptive design clinical study. The FDA guidance entitled ""Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff[14]"" outlines the procedures that sponsors can follow when seeking the FDA\'s feedback on specific questions relating to a proposed adaptive design clinical study.\n\nSponsors can use this pre-submission program to obtain Agency feedback on both investigational studies of significant risk (SR) devices as defined in 21 CFR 812.3 (which require FDA approval of an IDE application) as well as studies of non-significant risk (NSR)devices (which require only IRB oversight) or device studies that will be conducted outside of the United States (OUS). For studies of SR devices conducted in the U.S., the adaptive design clinical study protocol, including the statistical analysis plan, will be recorded within the approved IDE and/or subsequent IDE supplements. In the case of certain NSR and OUS device studies, sponsors may choose to submit the final version of the study protocol as a submission that incorporates Agency feedback obtained from the pre-submission, but are not required to do so. Such documentation may assist in assuring a mutual understanding of the proposed study by the sponsor and the FDA.\n\nDuring the course of the conduct of an adaptive design clinical study involving a SR device, the FDA should be informed of any deviations from the planned adaptive process and/or procedures for maintaining study integrity in a timely fashion.15 The FDA should also be made aware of any breaches of the study firewall that was established and described in the approved investigational protocol.\n\nFootnote 15: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Guidance Documents/UCM311176.pdf\n\nSponsor Monitoring\n\nSponsors are advised to have a risk-based monitoring plan in place which focuses on specific aspects of adaptive studies that are of particular importance and may not be present in traditional (non-adaptive) trial designs. The FDA has issued a guidance document entitled ""Guidance for Industry Oversight of Clinical Investigations: A Risk-Based Approach to Monitoring""16 in which the FDA recommends for all clinical investigations, adaptive or not, that sponsors consider adopting a risk-based monitoring approach that focuses on critical study parameters and relies on a combination of monitoring techniques (such as on-site monitoring and centralized monitoring) to oversee the study. For adaptive studies, sponsorsshould have a pre-determined monitoring plan in place to ensure adequate monitoring if the preplanned changes do occur. When an adaptation is planned, sponsors should consider adopting procedures such as preplanned site visits scheduled to verify adequate documentation and execution of blinding procedures in order to ensure blinding was appropriately maintained. Additionally the monitoring plan should include procedures that confirm that data firewalls have not been breached and that statistical changes were made according to the study Statistical Analysis Plan.\n\nBest Practices to Protect Study Blinding (Masking)\n\nSponsons should provide to the FDA, in advance, sufficient evidence of a firewall and documented policies and information that will ensure that personnel are appropriately blinded/masked during the conduct of the adaptive study. Unplanned changes in study design that occur after an unblinded interim analysis of study data are not considered adaptive and in many cases, may undermine the scientific validity of the study. Additional principles and details are available in ""Design Considerations for Pivotal Clinical Investigations for Medical Devices,""[4] including, in particular, Section 9, ""Sustaining the Quality of Clinical Studies,"" and the subsections on Handling Clinical Data, Study Conduct, and Study Analysis, and Anticipating Changes to the Pivotal Study.\n\nContent of an Adaptive Design Submission to the FDA\n\nSubmissions to the FDA for an adaptive study design should clearly identify that the clinical study employs an adaptive design and should provide details of the proposed adaptations. Information provided should address what, when, how, and why the adaptation will be performed. The adaptation should be prospectively described at least generally in the protocol and in detail in the Statistical Analysis Plan, which should include the operating characteristics of the design.\n\nSubmissions should also address key issues related to study monitoring (see Section 11.B.) and role of the DMC (see Section 10.A.). Decision points should be delineated and documented for inclusion in the final study report to be submitted as evidence of safety and effectiveness to the FDA.\n\n12.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf a firewall is part of the design, a mechanism and an implementation plan for the firewall should be provided. If the intent is to limit the information provided to the investigators, a general clinical protocol and a separate detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) could be used, with the SAP not widely distributed. Computer systems can be employed to monitor, document and limit access and can provide audit trails and firewalls.\n\nAt the conclusion of an adaptive study, the documentation that should be sent to the FDA should include a description of how the adaptation was implemented, the data sets for the study, the baseline subject characteristics for pre and post-adaptation subgroups, the pre-specified statistical analysis, and any deviations that may have occurred from the protocol\'s adaptive plan and how they have been addressed in additional analyses.\n\n12 Conclusion\n--------------------\nContext title: Adaptive Designs for Medical Device Clinical Studies Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: IRB meeting minutes must be in sufficient detail to show attendance at the meetings, actions taken by the IRB, the vote on these actions, the basis for requiring changes in or disapproving research, and a written summary of the discussion of controverted issues and their resolution (21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)). FDA anticipates that a study in which informed consent is not obtained for all subjects is by its very nature controversial. Therefore IRBs must summarize their discussions and decisions regarding the required elements for these studies (21 CFR 50.24(a)) in the IRB\'s written meeting minutes. For example, the IRB would document its discussion of issues raised during community consultation activities, particularly discussions of community opposition to, or concern about, the emergency research study. If the IRB approves the study despite the objection of some part(s) of the community, the IRB should also document this, and provide its reason(s) for doing so.\n\n4.2.4 What is meant by ""licensed physician concurrence""?\n\nThe IRB must have the concurrence of a licensed physician, both initially and at the time of continuing review, that the criteria of 21 CFR 50.24 are met (21 CFR 50.24(a)). The licensed physician must be ""a member of or consultant to the IRB and...not otherwise participating in the clinical investigation"" (21 CFR 50.24(a)). Where the licensed physician member(s) cannot participate in the deliberation andvoting for any reason, participation in the convened meeting by a licensed physician consultant would be necessary. Because the concurrence of the licensed physician member or licensed physician consultant is required for the IRB to allow these studies to proceed, IRBs should ensure that meeting minutes record the licensed physician member\'s affirmative vote or the licensed physician consultant\'s concurrence (21 CFR 50.24(a) and 56.115(a)(2)).\n\nVI Sponsor\'s responsibilities\n\nWhat are the sponsor\'s responsibilities under 21 CFR 50.24?\n\nIn addition to sponsor responsibilities required for the conduct of all clinical trials set out in 21 CFR Parts 312 and 812, 21 CFR 50.24 creates additional responsibilities for emergency research conducted under this exception from informed consent requirements. Below is a list of the sponsor\'s responsibilities under 21 CFR 50.24 and one possible order in which they might occur.37 (A sample flow chart is provided in Appendix C.)\n\nFootnote 37: Some of the activities under this rule are unique to emergency research studies; the order in which these activities occur is not specified in the regulations and may vary.\n\nAs part of the investigational plan for the study, the sponsor is responsible for defining the length of the potential therapeutic window,38 based on scientific evidence, during which the investigational product is to be administered to the subjects (21 CFR 50.24(a)(5)). Footnote 38: For more information, see Section IV. Therapeutic Window.\n\nThe sponsor is responsible for using an independent data monitoring committee to exercise oversight of the clinical investigation (21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(iv)).39 Footnote 39: For more information on data monitoring committees, refer to FDA’s Guidance on Establishment and Operations of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees; www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126578.pdf.\n\nThe sponsor submits the protocol to FDA in a separate IND or IDE, the cover sheet of which prominently identifies the study as involving an exception from informed consent under 21 CFR 50.24(d), 21 CFR 312.23(f), 21 CFR 812.20(a)(4), 21 CFR 812.35(a)).\n\nThe sponsor must obtain FDA\'s written authorization before the study may proceed (21 CFR 312.20(c); 21 CFR 812.20(a)(4)(i)).\n\nThe sponsor assists the clinical investigator in developing and providing to the IRB:\n\ninformation to document that the criteria for the exception from informed consent provided in 21 CFR 50.24(a)(1) through (4) are met;\n\nthe proposed investigational plan, including informed consent procedures and an informed consent document, procedures and information to be used when providing an opportunity for family members to object to a subject\'s enrollment and/or continued participation in the study (21 CFR 50.24(a)(6) and (7)(v), and 50.24(b));\n\nthe clinical investigator\'s commitment to attempt to contact the subject\'s legally authorized representative (LAR) to obtain consent, or provide the subject\'s family\nmember an opportunity to object, prior to administering the test article during the time allotted for this within the therapeutic window (21 CFR 50.24(a)(5) and (a)(7)(v)); * procedures and information to be used in the event of a subject\'s death to inform a subject\'s LAR or family members about the subject\'s participation in the investigation (21 CFR 50.24(b)); * plans for community consultation and public disclosure prior to the start of the study; and * information about opt-out mechanisms, if any are proposed by the sponsor. (See also Question 68.)\n\nThe sponsor and clinical investigator (or, where appropriate, the IRB, when the IRB has decided at its discretion to carry out community consultation activities) conduct the community consultation activities. FDA recommends that one or more IRB members attend the community consultation activities in person (see also Question 44), but if an IRB member is not able to do so, information gleaned from the community consultation activities should be provided to the IRB. The IRB should determine how information from community consultation activities is to be provided to the IRB (e.g., oral report at IRB meeting, written report by the investigator).\n\nThe sponsor must monitor the progress of all investigations involving an exception from informed consent under 21 CFR 50.24 (21 CFR 312.54(a), 21 CFR 812.47).\n\nThe sponsor must promptly submit to the IND or IDE file (and to Docket Number 95S-0158 in the Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), identified by the IND or IDE number), copies of the information that was publicly disclosed prior to initiation of the clinical investigation (e.g., plans for the investigation and its risks and expected benefits); see 21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(ii), 312.54(a), 812.47(a)). (See also Question 84.)\n\nThe sponsor must promptly provide in writing to FDA, information related to an IRB\'s determination that it cannot approve a research study under 21 CFR 50.24. The sponsor must also provide this information to investigators who are participating or asked to participate in the same or a substantially equivalent investigation, and to other IRBs that have reviewed or are asked to review this or a substantially equivalent investigation (21 CFR 50.24(e), 21 CFR 312.54(b), 21 CFR 812.47(b)).\n\nIf the IRB requires modifications in the plans for community consultation, the sponsor and the clinical investigator are responsible for revising the community consultation plans and resubmitting them for IRB review (21 CFR 56.109(a)).\n\nIf the IRB requires modifications in the plans for public disclosure, the sponsor and the clinical investigator are responsible for revising the public disclosure plans and resubmitting them for IRB review (21 CFR 56.109(a)).\n\nFollowing completion of the study, the sponsor prepares information to apprise researchers and the community(ies) about the study, including demographic characteristics of the research population, and the study\'s results (21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(iii)).\n\nThe sponsor must promptly submit to the IND or IDE file copies of the information that was publicly disclosed. The sponsor must also submit the information to Docket Number 95S-0158 in the Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), identified by the IND or IDE number (21 CFR 312.54(a) and 21 CFR 812.47(a)). (See also Questions 84 and 94.)\n\nVII Clinical Investigator\'s responsibilities\n\nWhat are the clinical investigator\'s responsibilities under 21 CFR 50.24?\n\nIn addition to the clinical investigator responsibilities set forth in 21 CFR 312 and 812, 21 CFR 50.24 creates additional responsibilities for emergency research conducted with an exception from informed consent requirements. Below is a list of the clinical investigator\'s responsibilities under 21 CFR 50.24 and one possible order in which they might occur.[33] (A sample flow chart is provided in Appendix C.)\n\nThe clinical investigator, assisted by the sponsor, provides to the IRB:\n\nmaterials documenting that the criteria for the exception from informed consent given in 21 CFR 50.24(a)(1) through (4) are met;\n\nthe proposed investigational plan, including informed consent procedures and an informed consent document, procedures and information to be used when providing an opportunity for family members to object to a subject\'s enrollment and/or continued participation in the study (21 CFR 50.24(a)(6) and (7)(v), and 50.24(b));\n\nthe clinical investigator\'s commitment to attempt to contact the subject\'s legally authorized representative to obtain consent, or provide the subject\'s family member an opportunity to object, prior to administering the test article during the time allotted for this within the therapeutic window (21 CFR 50.24(a)(5) and (a)7(v));\n\nprocedures and information to be used to inform a subject\'s legally authorized representative or family members about the subject\'s participation in the investigation in the event of a subject\'s death (21 CFR 50.24(b)); and\n\nplans for additional protections of the rights and welfare of subjects, including, at least, plans for community consultation and public disclosure prior to the start of the study.\n\nThe investigator and sponsor (or the IRB, when the IRB has decided at its discretion to carry out community consultation activities itself) conduct the community consultation activities.

The use of the word should in FDA guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. Statutory Authority\n\nThe Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) (Title II of Public Law 108-282) amended the FD&C Act by defining the term ""major food allergen"" and stating that foods regulated under the FD&C Act are misbranded unless they declare the presence of each major food allergen on the product label using the common or usual name of that major food allergen. Section 201(qq) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(qq)) now defines a major food allergen as ""[m]ilk, egg, fish (e.g., bass, flounder, or cod), Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, or shrimp), tree nuts (e.g., almonds, pecans, or walnuts), wheat, peanuts, and soybeans"" and also as a food ingredient that contains protein derived from these foods. The definition excludes any highly refined oil derived from a major food allergen and any ingredient derived from such highly refined oil.\n\nIn some cases, the production of an ingredient derived from a major food allergen may alter or eliminate the allergenic proteins in that derived ingredient to such an extent that it does not contain allergenic protein. In addition, a major food allergen may be used as an ingredient or as a component of an ingredient such that the level of allergenic protein in finished food products does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health. Therefore, FALCPA provides two mechanisms through which such ingredients may become exempt from the labeling requirement of section 403(w)(1) of the FD&C Act. An ingredient may obtain an exemption through submission and approval of a petition containing scientific evidence that demonstrates that the ingredient ""does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health"" (section 403(w)(6) of the FD&C Act). This section also states that ""the burden shall be on the petitioner to provide scientific evidence (including the analytical method used to produce the evidence) that demonstrates that such food ingredient, as derived by the method specified in the petition, does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health."" Alternately, an ingredient may become exempt through submission of a notification containing scientific evidence showing that the ingredient ""does not contain allergenic protein"" or that there has been a previous determination through a premarket approval process under section 409 of the FD&C Act that the ingredient ""does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health"" (section 403(w)(7) of the FD&C Act).\n\nTo evaluate these petitions and notifications, we will consider scientific evidence that describes:\n\nThe identity or composition of the ingredient;\n\nThe methods used to produce the ingredient;\n\nThe methods used to characterize the ingredient;\n\nThe intended use of the ingredient in food; and\n\nFor a petition, data and information, including the expected level of consumer exposure to the ingredient, that demonstrate that the ingredient when manufactured and used as described does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health; or 5b. For a notification, data and information that demonstrate that the ingredient when manufactured as described does not contain allergenic protein, or documentation of a previous determination under a process pursuant to section 409 of the FD&C Act that the ingredient does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health.\n\nWe will evaluate this scientific evidence only for the specific ingredient and specific use(s) identified in the submission.\n\nFDA recognizes that there are several methods that can be used to demonstrate that an ingredient meets the standards in 403(w)(6) and 403(w)(7) of the FD&C Act. Each submitter may determine which approach is most appropriate for the specific ingredient and specific use(s) identified in the submission.\n\n3 Recommendations for Preparing Submissions\n\nDetermining Need for Submission\n\nThe following points should be considered in determining whether to submit a petition or notification:\n\nAn ingredient derived from a major food allergen that does not contain protein is not subject to the labeling requirements described in section 403(w)(1) of the FD&C Act. We are aware that there are some technologies (e.g., distillation) that may be able to produce protein-free ingredients because of the nature of the process and fundamental biochemical properties of proteins, peptides, and amino acids. When other technologies are used to produce an ingredient, information and expertise available to the manufacturer should make it possible to identify and apply the appropriate analytic methods to ensure that the ingredient does not contain protein. The methods used should be shown to be sufficiently accurate and sensitive under the conditions of use, including consideration of extraction efficiencies and possible interferences, should be scientifically appropriate, and sufficiently sensitive to demonstrate that no proteins or peptide fragments are present in the ingredient. Manufacturers should also consider potential batch to batch variation in the composition of the ingredient. Manufacturers may discuss methodological issues with us.\n\nA petition should be used to demonstrate that an ingredient derived from a major food allergen that may contain allergenic proteins, or derivatives of allergenic proteins such as peptide fragments, does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health in food allergic individuals.\n\nA notification should be used to demonstrate that an ingredient that may contain proteins or protein fragments derived from a major food allergen does not contain allergenic protein.\n\nGeneral\n\nEach submission should contain information identifying the organization and individual primarily responsible for the submission. This should include the name of the individual and organization, a complete mailing address, a physical address if this differs from the mailing address, phone and fax numbers, and an electronic mail (email) address for the organization and for a primary contact. A joint submission from several organizations should include complete information for each organization.\n\nIngredient Description\n\nFor the purposes of this guidance document, ingredients include substances that are-\n\nDerived (e.g., through chemical, biochemical, mechanical, fermentation or bioengineering processes) from a major food allergen and that contain proteins or peptides\n\nA submission should provide a complete description of the ingredient including-\n\nBoth the common or usual name and any scientific name(s) of the ingredient;\n\nThe major food allergen source of the ingredient, if this is not obvious from the name, or the major food allergen sources used in the manufacture or engineering of the ingredient;\n\nThe chemical and biological properties or characteristics of the ingredient including molecular structure, sequence, etc., as appropriate;\n\nAny existing food standards of identity or specifications for the ingredient, such as from the FDA\'s food standards of identity regulations, Food Chemicals Codex, or Codex Alimentarius; and\n\nThe composition of the ingredient, including the methods used to determine composition, and batch-to-batch variation in composition should be described. If the ingredient contains more than one component, all components, including non-allergens, (including carriers or diluents), as well as the relative proportion of each in the ingredient should be described.\n\nIngredient Preparation or Manufacture\n\nThe method(s) or procedure(s) used to prepare or manufacture the ingredient should be described completely, particularly those steps that alter the amount, relative composition, or biochemical state of the proteins present. This description should include, for example-\n\nsuch as grinding, pressing, filtration;\n\nsuch as heating, cooking, baking, retorting;\n\nsuch as solvent extraction, hydrolysis (both enzymatic and non-enzymatic), cross-linking;\n\nsuch as the composition of the growth or nutrient media used in the manufacture of enzymes or organisms; and/or\n\nsuch as details of the construct, transformation event, and DNA and amino acid sequences.\n\nThe description of the manufacturing or preparation process should include-\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications , Are raw agricultural commodities, such as fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state, subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Q: How should I design my FSVP to provide assurances that a human food from a foreign supplier is not misbranded under section 403(w) of the FD&C Act with respect to labeling for the presence of major food allergens?\n\nA: As part of your FSVP, you should assure that the label of each human food you import complies with the labeling requirements for major food allergens. You should determine by audit, inspection, or other appropriate foreign supplier verification activity (see 21 CFR 1.506) whether the food contains a major food allergen that is not declared on the food label. Major food allergen means any of the following:\n\nMilk, egg, fish (e.g., bass, flounder, or cod), crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, or shrimp), tree nuts (e.g., almonds, pecans, or walnuts), wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame. (For sesame, its addition to the definition of major food allergen applies to ""any food that is introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce on or after January 1, 2023"" (Public Law 117-11)).\n\nA food ingredient that contains protein derived from a food specified in paragraph 1 above, except the following: 1. Any highly refined oil derived from a food specified in paragraph 1 above and any ingredient derived from such highly refined oil. 2. A food ingredient that is exempt under section 403(w)(6) and (7) of the FD&C Act (section 201(qq) of the FD&C Act).\n\nPackaged food for humans (except for RACs) that is, or contains an ingredient that bears or contains, a major food allergen must meet the label and labeling requirements set forth in section 403(w) of the FD&C Act. Under section 403(w)(1), the food is misbranded (with respect to the labeling of food allergens) unless it meets one of the following criteria:\n\nThe word ""Contains,"" followed by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, is printed immediately after or is adjacent to the list of ingredients (in a type size no smaller than the type size used in the list of ingredients) required under section 403(g) or (i); or\n\nThe common or usual name of the major food allergen in the list of ingredients required under section 403(g) or (i) is followed in parentheses by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, except that the name of the food source is not required when: (1) the common or usual name of the ingredient uses the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived; or (2) the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived appears elsewhere in the ingredient list, unless the name of the food source that appears elsewhere in the ingredient list appears as part of the name of the food ingredient that is not a major food allergen.\n\nYou can find additional information on food allergen labeling in FDA\'s ""Guidance for Industry:\n\nQuestions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, including the Food Allergen Labeling and\n\nConsumer Protection Act of 2004 (Edition 4).""\n\nThe requirement to provide assurances that a human food is not misbranded with respect to labeling for the presence of major food allergens under section 403(w) of the FD&C Act does not apply to food for animals. Therefore, if you are importing an animal food, you are not required verify that the animal food is not misbranded under section 403(w).\n\nQ: How should I design my FSVP to provide assurance that the foreign supplier did not adulterate a human food under section 402 of the FD&C Act due to cross-contact with a major food allergen?\n\nA: The presence of a major food allergen in a human food due to allergen cross-contact is a chemical hazard (21 CFR 117.130(b)(1)(ii)). Cross-contact can occur either between foods of different allergen profiles (e.g., foods that contain different food allergens or foods with and without food allergens). Introduction of an allergen through cross-contact may occur under various conditions, including during receiving, handling, processing and storage of ingredients and foods, utensils, and packaging; through improper handling and cleaning of equipment, utensils, and facilities; and through improper facility design. Your FSVP should be designed to determine by audit, inspection, or other appropriate foreign supplier verification activity whether your foreign supplier is controlling the potential for allergen cross-contact through processes and procedures such as:\n\nAppropriately scheduling the production of products so that there is no cross-contact between foods of different allergen profiles.\n\nAdequately cleaning between two different formulations of food of different allergen profiles.\n\nStoring allergen-containing ingredients separately from ingredients that do not contain the same allergen profile, especially where leakage of allergen-containing materials could lead to cross-contact.\n\nHandling powdered allergens in a way that prevents particles from blowing onto foods or food-contact surfaces for foods that have different allergen profiles.\n\n(See draft ""Food Hazards Guide"" (Chapter 3, 3.4.2.1.4 Undeclared food allergen hazards due to allergen cross-contact))\n\n2 Low-Acid Canned Food\n\nQ: How does the FSVP regulation apply to a low-acid canned food?\n\nA: For a thermally processed low-acid food packaged in a hermetically sealed container (low-acid canned food or LACF) that you import, you are not required to meet FSVP requirements for microbiological hazards that are controlled by 21 CFR part 113. That means, for example, that you are not required to address microbiological hazards that are controlled by 21 CFR part 113 in your hazard analysis. However, you must verify and document that your foreign supplier is producing the food in accordance with the LACF regulation in 21 CFR part 113 (see 21 CFR 1.502(b)(1)). The LACF regulation is designed to ensure control of microbiological hazards in an LACF.\n\nFor hazards in an LACF other than the microbiological hazards that are controlled by the low-acid canned food regulation (i.e., chemical and physical hazards), you must develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP in accordance with 21 CFR 1.502(a).\n\nIn addition, you are not required to comply with the FSVP requirements with respect to microbiological hazards in raw materials or other ingredients that you import and use in the manufacturing or processing of an LACF, provided that you comply with the LACF regulation for the food that you manufacture or process from the imported raw materials or other ingredients (21 CFR 1.502(b)(2)). With respect to other hazards in such raw materials or other ingredients, you must have an FSVP.\n\nAn appropriate verification activity to determine that your foreign supplier is producing an LACF in compliance with the LACF regulation may be that you conduct an onsite audit or review and assess the results of an onsite audit or inspection conducted by another entity. Alternatively, for each entry of an LACF, you might conclude that, instead of an onsite audit, it is appropriate to review the scheduled process and the processing and production records required under the LACF regulation and verify the integrity of the containers (e.g., cans are not swollen or leaking).\n\nChemical and physical hazards are not controlled under the LACF regulation. For chemical and physical hazards requiring a control, a verification activity (e.g., onsite audit or sampling and testing) would be required as part of your FSVP (see 21 CFR 1.506(d)). You may verify control of all hazards you identify as requiring a control, including non-microbiological hazards, during a single onsite audit or inspection of the LACF facility, instead of conducting separate activities to verify control of the non-microbiological hazards and compliance with the LACF regulation.\n\nFor more information on application of the FSVP regulation and other FSMA regulations to LACF and raw materials or other ingredients used in manufacturing or processing LACF, see FDA\'s guidance ""Low-Acid Foods Packaged in Hermetrically Sealed Containers (LACF) Regulation and the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act.""\n\n3 Importers That Also Are Receiving Facilities Under the Preventive Controls Regulations\n\nQ: What is a ""receiving facility""?\n\nA: A receiving facility is a facility that is subject to the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements and the supply-chain program requirements of 21 CFR part 117 or 507 and that manufactures/processes a raw material or other ingredient that it receives from a supplier(21 CFR 117.3 and 507.3). (A ""facility"" is a domestic facility or a foreign facility that is required to register under section 415 of the FD&C Act in accordance with the registration requirements of 21 CFR part 1, subpart H.)\n\nQ: Do I have to comply with all FSVP requirements if I am a receiving facility for a food I import?\n\nA: Although you must identify yourself as the FSVP importer at entry (21 CFR 1.509), you are deemed to be in compliance with the other FSVP requirements for a food you import if you are a receiving facility and you are in compliance with any of the following requirements with respect to the food:\n\nYou have implemented preventive controls for the hazards in the food in accordance with 21 CFR 117.135 or 507.34; or\n\nYou are not required to implement a preventive control under 21 CFR 117.136 or 507.36 with respect to the food; or\n\nYou are in compliance with the supply-chain program requirements of the preventive controls for human food regulation (21 CFR part 117, subpart G) or preventive controls for animal food regulation (21 CFR part 507, subpart E) (see 21 CFR 1.502(c)).\n\nFSVP requirements and examples for each of these categories of receiving facility are:\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Foreign Supplier Verification Programs for Importers of Food for Humans and Animals'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications , Are raw agricultural commodities, such as fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state, subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n--------------------\nContext: SS 343(a)(1). Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(n)) provides that labeling is misleading if, among other things, it fails to reveal facts that are material in light of representations made or suggested in the labeling, or material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the food to which the labeling relates under the conditions of use prescribed in the labeling, or under such conditions of use as are customary or usual. 21 U.S.C. SS 321(n). In a 1992 ""Statement of Policy: Foods Derived from New Plant Varieties"" (1992 Policy) (Ref. 5) FDA explained its interpretation of the FD&C Act with respect to foods derived from new plant varieties, including varieties developed using bioengineering. In the 1992 Policy, FDA stated that it was not aware of any information showing that bioengineered foods differ from other foods in any meaningful or uniform way, or that, as a class, foods developed by the new techniques present any different or greater safety concern than foods developed by traditional plant breeding (Ref. 5). Further, FDA concluded that the method of development of a new plant variety (including the use of new techniques such as rDNA technology) is generally not material information within the meaning of section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, and would not usually be required to be disclosed in the labeling for the food. This determination was reviewed and upheld by the court in Alliance for Bio-Integrity v. Shalala, 116 F. Supp. 2d 166, 178-79 (D.D.C. 2000) (finding that FDA\'s determination that genetic engineering, alone, is not a material fact that warrants food labeling was entitled to deference) (Ref. 10). Labeling provided by manufacturers on a wholly voluntary basis regarding whether a food was or was not bioengineered as described in this guidance is acceptable to FDA, provided that such labeling is truthful and not misleading. Some consumers are interested in the information provided in such labeling.\n\nThe FD&C Act does not define the term ""material"" within the context of section 201(n) of the FD&C Act. Historically, the agency has interpreted the term, within the context of food, to mean information about the attributes of the food itself. For example, FDA has required special labeling in cases where the absence of such ""material"" information may: (1) pose special health risks (e.g., a warning statement on protein products used in very low calorie diets (21 CFR 101.17(d)) (Ref. 6), or a caution statement not to feed animal food products that contain animal-derived protein to cattle or other ruminants (21 CFR 589.2000(c)(1)(i)) (Ref. 7)); (2) mislead the consumer in light of other statements made on the labeling (e.g., a requirement for quantitative nutrient information when certain nutrient content claims are made about a product (21 CFR 101.13(j)) (Ref. 8)); or (3) in cases where a consumer may assume that a food, because of its similarity to another food, has nutritional, organoleptic (e.g., taste, smell, or texture), or functional characteristics of the food it resembles when in fact it does not (e.g., a statement that reduced fat margarine is not suitable for frying (21 CFR 101.13(d)(1)) (Ref. 9). Further, section 403(i) of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations require that each food bear a common or usual name or, in the absence of such a name, an appropriately descriptive term (21 U.S.C. SS 343(i); 21 CFR 101.3, 501.3). For example, if oil from a genetically engineered canola plant has a significantly different amount of lauric acid such that the fatty acid composition of the oil is significantly changed compared to traditional canola oil, the term ""canola oil"" no longer adequately identifies or describes the nature of the oil or its characterizing properties, particularly Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nsince oils are distinguished by their fatty acid profiles.\n\nSince the commercial introduction of bioengineered crops in the United States in 1996, the use of bioengineered crops has accelerated and such crops are now widely used (Ref. 11). In 2013, in the United States, bioengineered soybeans made up 93 percent of the acreage of planted soybeans, bioengineered cotton made up 90 percent of the acreage of planted cotton, and bioengineered corn varieties made up 90 percent of the acreage planted corn (Ref. 11). In addition, bioengineered sugar beets accounted for 95 percent of the acreage of planted sugar beets in the 2009-2010 crop year (Ref. 11).\n\nIII Guidance\n\nGeneral principles\n\nIn determining whether a food is misbranded, FDA generally reviews labeling statements under sections 403 and 201(n) of the FD&C Act, and if applicable, other sections of the FD&C Act. Under section 403(a)(1) of the FD&C Act, a food is misbranded if its label or labeling is false or misleading in any particular. For example, the label on a chocolate bar may not declare that the chocolate contains ingredients, such as walnuts and coconut oil, if those ingredients are not actually present in the chocolate.\n\nUnder section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, both the presence and the absence of information are relevant to whether labeling is misleading. Put another way, food labeling may be misleading if it makes or suggests certain representations, or if it fails to disclose facts that are material in light of representations made or suggested about a food or facts that are material with respect to the consequences that may result from use of the food. In determining whether a labeling statement about a food is misleading under sections 201(n) and 403(a)(1) of the FD&C Act, FDA takes into account all labeling for that food, including the label on the food itself (e.g., all words used on the label including the brand name of the product, vignettes, logos or any of its containers or wrappers and other information accompanying the food, such as labeling for the food that is on the internet. Labeling means all labels and other written, printed, or graphic matter (1) upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers, or (2) accompanying such article. 21 U.S.C. 321(m) (section 201(m) of the FD&C Act). Firms should be aware that ""labeling"" may extend to information beyond that included on containers or wrappers. For example, in certain circumstances, information that is disseminated over the internet by, or on behalf of, a regulated company meets the definition of labeling in section 201(m) of the FD&C Act and is subject to applicable requirements. See, e.g., Guidance for Industry and FDA: Dear Manufacturer letter Regarding Food Labeling, January 2007, available at:\n\nhttp://wwwfdagov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/Labe\n\nlingNutrition/ucm053425.htm. These general principles apply in evaluating a food labeling claim, including a statement about whether a food is or is not developed using modern plant biotechnology.\n\nB Statements about foods that are not derived from genetically engineered plants\n\nFood manufacturers may voluntarily label their foods with information about whether the foods were not produced using bioengineering, as long as such information is truthful and not misleading. In general, an accurate statement about whether a food was not produced using bioengineering is one that provides information in a context that clearly refers to bioengineering technology. Examples of such statements include:\n\n""Not bioengineered.""\n\n""Not genetically engineered.""\n\n""Not genetically modified through the use of modern biotechnology.""\n\n""We do not use ingredients that were produced using modern biotechnology.""\n\n""This oil is made from soybeans that were not genetically engineered.""\n\n""Our corn growers do not plant bioengineered seeds.""\n\nOther terms are sometimes used by manufacturers in food labeling regarding whether a food was not derived from genetically engineered plants, including ""not genetically modified"" and claims using the acronym ""GMO"" (genetically modified organism). For the reasons discussed in the remaining paragraphs of this section, FDA recommends terms such as ""not bioengineered,"" ""not genetically engineered,"" and ""not genetically modified through the use of modern biotechnology."" However, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action against a label using the acronym ""GMO"" in a statement indicating that the product (or an ingredient) was not produced through the use of modern biotechnology, as long as the food is, in fact, not derived from a genetically engineered plant and the food\'s labeling is not otherwise false or misleading, as further discussed in this guidance. Similarly, we do not intend to take enforcement action against a label using the acronym ""GMO"" in a statement indicating that the product (or an ingredient) was produced through the use of modern biotechnology, as long as the statement was true and the food\'s labeling is not otherwise false or misleading.\n\nAs stated, FDA encourages manufacturers to use labeling claims that state that a food product (or its ingredients, as appropriate) was not developed using bioengineering, genetic engineering, or modern biotechnology such as the claims included above.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Voluntary Labeling Indicating Whether Foods Have or Have Not Been Derived from Genetically Engineered Plants'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance at the phone number listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended for farms subject to the Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption (Produce Safety Rule) (21 CFR Part 112). For certain farms, the Produce Safety Rule provides a qualified exemption; qualified exempt farms are subject to modified rule requirements. During the COVID-19 public health emergency as declared by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), FDA provided certain temporary flexibilities related to eligibility criteria for the qualified exemption. This document communicates FDA\'s current thinking on how, when the COVID-19 public health emergency expires, qualified exempt farms may transition away from those temporary policies and back to the qualified exemption eligibility criteria as established in the Produce Safety Rule.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should beviewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nQualified Exemption under the Produce Safety Rule\n\nAs set forth in 21 CFR 112.5(a), a farm is eligible for a qualified exemption and associated modified requirements in a calendar year if, during the three-year period preceding the applicable calendar year, the average annual monetary value of food the farm sold directly to qualified end-users exceeded the average annual monetary value of the food the farm sold to all other buyers during that period, and the average annual monetary value of all food the farm sold during the three-year period was less than $500,000, adjusted for inflation.1 ""Qualified end-user"" is defined in 21 CFR 112.3 as the consumer of the food (where the term consumer does not include a business); or a restaurant or retail food establishment that is located in the same State or the same Indian reservation as the farm that produced the food or not more than 275 miles from such farm. The modified requirements with which qualified exempt farms must comply are described in 21 CFR 112.6 and include disclosing the name and complete business address of the farm where the produce was grown either on the label of the produce or at the point of purchase. These farms are also required to establish and keep certain documentation as described in 21 CFR 112.7 (e.g., records necessary to demonstrate that the farm satisfies the criteria for a qualified exemption).\n\nFootnote 1: See https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsfma/sfma-inflation-adjusted-cut-offs\n\nTemporary Qualified Exemption Policy During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency\n\nDuring the COVID-19 public health emergency the ability of farms to shift food sales to available buyers had the potential to help reduce food shortages and food waste and to help support both farms and the U.S. economy. In order to support affected farms in selling food to all available buyers while the country was experiencing acute impacts from COVID-19, in May 2020 FDA issued the guidance, ""Temporary Policy During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Regarding the Qualified Exemption from the Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption""2 (COVID Qualified Exemption guidance). The COVID Qualified Exemption guidance communicated FDA\'s intention to not enforce the criterion for direct sales to qualified end-users when determining eligibility for the qualified exemption under the Produce Safety Rule, for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19. The purpose of the temporary policy was to provide flexibility to affected farms during the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nUnder the temporary policy, farms that were eligible in 2020 for the qualified exemption and associated modified requirements could continue to be considered eligible in subsequent years affected by the COVID-19 public health emergency even if they shifted food sales away from qualified end-users, provided that the farms continued to meet the requirement that the three-yearaverage annual monetary value of all food they sold is less than $500,000, adjusted for inflation. We recommended that such farms retain documentation that the farm met all the criteria for the qualified exemption in 2020, and documentation that the average annual monetary value of all the food sold was less than $500,000, adjusted for inflation, for any three-year period impacted by the public health emergency related to COVID-19.\n\nSimilarly, for farms that did not have three years of sales prior to 2020, but that met the relevant requirements during the years they were in operation prior to 2020, we stated that we did not intend to enforce the criterion regarding the portion of sales that are made directly to qualified end-users in 2020 (and any subsequent years that were affected by the COVID-19 public health emergency), provided the farms continued to meet the requirement regarding the average annual monetary value of all food they sold, adjusted for inflation. We recommended that such farms retain documentation that for the year(s) prior to 2020 that the farm was in operation, the average value of direct sales to qualified end-users exceeded that of food sold to all other buyers, and the average annual monetary value of all food sold was less than $500,000, adjusted for inflation. We also recommended that for subsequent years, these newer farms retain documentation that the average annual monetary value of all food the farm sold during the preceding three-year periods (or the year(s) for which the farm was in operation if less than three years) was less than $500,000 adjusted for inflation. We advised a similar approach for farms for which 2020 was their first year of operation.3\n\nFootnote 3: For such farms, we recommended retaining documentation such as contracts with buyers that would provide a sufficient basis to establish that, absent the market disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the average annual monetary value of the food sold by the farm to qualified end-users reasonably would have been anticipated to exceed the average annual monetary value of food sold to all other buyers; and, the monetary value of all food sold in 2020 was less than $500,000, adjusted for inflation. For any three-year period impacted by the COVID-19 public health emergency, we also recommended such farms retain documentation that the average annual monetary value of all food sold was less than $500,000, adjusted for inflation.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Transition from Temporary Policy During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Regarding the Qualified Exemption from the Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption'

We have consistently held to this view in advising inquirers about any food which might be thawed and sold as ""fresh"" food.\n\nIn the past,* we have sanctioned the use of the term ""frozen fresh"" as applied to packaged frozen foods, provided they are actually fresh when frozen.\n\nGenerally, our standards of identity for foods prescribe names which include appropriate descriptive terms such as pasteurized, canned, frozen, or dried. We have insisted on the use of the term ""canned"" when it is obvious that the article is canned.\n\nCertain packers of grapefruit juice have asked us to sanction use of the designation ""grapefruit juice"" without modifying terms, irrespective of whether the juice was pasteurized, canned, or otherwise processed. Investigation indicated that ""canned"" grapefruit juice, packed in glass, was being refrigerated and displayed under conditions which implied it was fresh. We advised the packers that to avoid deception, the name should include the word ""canned"" when the product was so packed, stored, and displayed (particularly if displayed under refrigeration) as to imply or suggest that it was fresh juice.\n\nOn the other hand, frozen foods packed in sealed metal cans like those used for similar articles so processed by heat as to prevent spoilage, unless adequately labeled, may be stored without proper refrigeration. We have received consumer complaints about foods which had spoiled because the label did not clearly state that they should be kept frozen.\n\nPOLICY:The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires that food labels bear the common or usual name of the food. The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act requires that a statement of identity appear prominently on the principal display panel. To avoid misrepresentation and provide information needed to assure proper storage, food labels should include in the name or statement of identity appropriate descriptive terms such as pasteurized, canned, frozen, or dried.\n\nFresh: The term fresh should not be applied to foods which have been subjected to any form of heat or chemical processing.\n\nFrozen: Frozen foods should be prominently labeled as ""frozen."" This deters deceptive practices such as thawing frozen foods and offering them as ""fresh."" It also serves to ""flag"" goods as requiring freezer storage.\n\nFrozen Fresh: Foods which were quickly frozen while still fresh may be labeled ""frozen fresh"" or ""fresh frozen.""\n\nCanned: A food is considered ""canned,"" if it has been hermetically sealed and so processed by heat as to prevent spoilage. Foods which are in metal containers of the types normally used for canning, and are stored and displayed under conditions which do not suggest or imply that the article is other than a canned food need not be labeled ""canned."" If packed in glass or plastic bottles or jars and stored or displayed under refrigeration which might cause consumers to believe it is fresh, the label designation should include the word ""canned,"" or ""pasteurized,"" as the case may be.\n\nDried or dehydrated: A food which is dried or dehydrated should be labeled with a designation which includes one of these words, unless the name is one like ""raisins"" which consumers recognize as indicating a dried product.\n\nFreeze dried: A food which has been freeze dried may be designated as either ""dried"" or ""freeze dried,"" though we believe ""freeze dried"" is more informative.\n\na Revoked: 5/20/69\n\nMaterial between asterisks is new or revised.\n\nIssued: 6/20/69\n\nRevised: 10/1/80\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) - Specific Electronic Submissions Intended For FDA\'s Dockets Management Staff (i.e., Citizen Petitions, Draft Proposed Guidance Documents, Variances, and other administrative record submissions)23.8.25.5.71.105 - 105\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\nSearch for FDA\n\nGuidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: CPG Sec 562.450 Identity of Foods - Use of Terms Such as Fresh, Frozen, Dried, Canned, Etc.']","['No. Raw agricultural commodities, such as fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state, are not subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act.']",0.49999999995,0.0
28,"After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?","['--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nSponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/sponsor-investigator-irb-interrelationship). Office of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nThe interrelationship and interaction between the research sponsor (e.g., drug, biologic and device manufacturers), the clinical investigator and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) may be very complex. The regulations do not prohibit direct sponsor-IRB contacts, although, the sponsor-IRB interaction customarily occurs through the investigator who conducts the clinical study. The clinical investigator generally provides the communication link between the IRB and the sponsor. Such linkage is agreed to by the sponsors and investigators when they sign forms FDA-1571 and FDA-1572, respectively, for drug and biologic studies or an investigator agreement for device studies. There are occasions when direct communication between the IRB and the sponsor may facilitate resolution of concerns about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The clinical investigator should be kept apprised of the discussion.\n\nSponsor Assurance that IRBs Operate in Compliance with 21 CFR Part 56\n\nFDA regulations [21 CFR 312.23(a)(1)(iv)] require that a sponsor assure the FDA that a study will be conducted in compliance with the informed consent and IRB regulations [21 CFR parts 50 and 56]. This requirement has been misinterpreted to mean that it is a sponsor\'s obligation to determine IRB compliance with the regulations. This is not the case. Sponsors should rely on the clinical investigator, who assures the sponsor on form FDA-1572 for drugs and biologics or the investigator agreement for devices that the study will be reviewed by an IRB. Because clinical investigators work directly with IRBs, it is appropriate that they assure the sponsor that the IRB is functioning in compliance with the regulations.\n\nAn IRB must notify an investigator in writing of its decision to approve, disapprove or request modifications in a proposed research activity [21 CFR 56.109(e)]. This correspondence should be made available to the sponsor by the clinical investigator. In the Agency\'s view, this required documentation provides the sponsor with reasonable assurance that an IRB complies with 21 CFR part 56 and that it will be responsible for initial and continuing review of the study. Also, the sponsor and, in fact, anyone who is interested, mayobtain an Establishment Inspection Report from an FDA inspection of an IRB. These reports summarize the conditions observed during the IRB inspection. FDA, however, does not certify IRBs.\n\nSponsor Access to Medical Records\n\nThe IRB is responsible for ensuring that informed consent documents include the extent to which the confidentiality of medical records will be maintained [21 CFR 50.25(a)(5)]. FDA requires sponsors (or research monitors hired by them) to monitor the accuracy of the data submitted to FDA in accordance with regulatory requirements. These data are generally in the possession of the clinical investigator. Each subject must be advised during the informed consent process of the extent to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained and of the possibility that the FDA may inspect the records. While FDA access to medical records is a regulatory requirement, subject names are not usually requested by FDA unless the records of particular individuals require a more detailed study of the cases, or unless there is reason to believe that the records do not represent actual cases studied or actual results obtained. The consent document should list all other entities (e.g., the sponsor) who will have access to records identifying the subject. The extent to which confidentiality will be maintained may affect a subject\'s decision to participate in a clinical investigation.\n\nConfidentiality of Sponsor Information\n\nThe IRB\'s primary responsibility with respect to protecting confidentiality is to the research subject. IRBs should, however, respect the sponsor\'s need to maintain confidentiality of certain information about products under development. IRB members and staff should be aware that information submitted for review may be confidential, trade secret, and of commercial interest and should recognize the need for maintaining the confidentiality of the review materials and IRB records. It is advisable for IRBs to have policies that address this issue.\n\nNonsignificant Risk Device Studies\n\n""A sponsor\'s preliminary determination that a medical device study presents an NSR is subject to IRB approval."" The effect of the IRB\'s NSR decision is important to research sponsors and investigators because significant risk (SR) studies require sponsors to file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with FDA before they may begin. NSR studies, however, may begin as soon as the IRB approves the study. The sponsor, usually through the clinical investigator, provides the IRB with information necessary to make a judgment on the risk of a device study. While the investigational plan and supporting materials usually contain sufficient information to make a determination, the IRB can request additional information if needed [21 CFR 812.150(b)(10)]. If the IRB believes that additional information is needed, it may contact the sponsor directly, but it should keep the clinical investigator apprised of the request. While making the SR/NSR determination, any of the three parties may ask FDA to provide a risk assessment. See FDA Information Sheet: ""Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies"" for further information.\n\nDisagreements\n\nThe sponsor may choose not to conduct, to terminate, or to discontinue studies that do not conform with the sponsor\'s wishes. For example, the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB may reach an impasse about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The FDA will not mediate such disagreements. The Agency\'s policy of decentralized ethical review of clinical investigations allows such decisions to be made by local IRBs, and any disagreements between a sponsor, IRB, and clinical investigator should be resolved through appropriate communication among those parties.\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) - Specific Electronic Submissions Intended For FDA\'s Dockets Management Staff (i.e., Citizen Pettitions, Draft Proposed Guidance Documents, Variances, and other administrative record submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management Food and Drug Administration 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061 Rockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\n[] Search for FDA Guidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Although FDA will not accept as support for an IND or application for marketing approval any study that does not meet the conditions of 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will examine the data from such a study because the data may have a bearing on the safe use of the product.9 Sponsors and applicants are reminded that they must submit all studies and other information as required under the applicable regulations for drugs,10 including studies that do not comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nFootnote 9: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(2); 73 Fed. Reg. at 22807.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nA sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived.11 When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with the requirements in 21 CFR 312.120 in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Under 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and if FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary.12 Note that marketing approval of a new drug based solely on foreign clinical data is governed by 21 CFR 314.106.\n\nFootnote 10: See, for example, 21 CFR 314.50, 314.80, 600.80, and 601.2.\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR part 312.\n\nThe GCP requirements at 21 CFR 312.120 help protect human subjects and enhance the quality and integrity of the resulting clinical data.13 They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.14 Many of the requirements at 21 CFR 312.120 are already incorporated into the IND regulations at 21 CFR part 312, as well as 21 CFR parts 50 and 56,15 and are consistent with certain international ethical and policy standards for clinical trials (e.g., International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) ""GoodClinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline"" (ICH E6), which FDA adopted for use as guidance for industry in 1997).16\n\nFootnote 16: ICH E6 and other FDA guidance documents adopted from the ICH are available electronically at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\n1 Acceptance of Studies (21 Cfr 312.120(a))\n\nFDA regulations define GCP as ""a standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials in a way that provides assurance that the data are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects are protected.""17\n\nFootnote 17: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(1)(i).\n\nGCP includes review and approval (or provision of a favorable opinion) by an independent ethics committee (IEC) before initiating a study, continuing review of an ongoing study by an IEC, and obtaining and documenting the freely given informed consent of the subject (or a subject\'s legally authorized representative, if the subject is unable to provide informed consent) before initiating a study.\n\nAs defined at 21 CFR 312.3(b), an IEC is ""a review panel that is responsible for ensuring the protection of the rights, safety, and well-being of human subjects involved in a clinical investigation, and is adequately constituted to provide assurance of that protection."" We consider an IEC to be ""adequately constituted"" if it includes a reasonable number of members with the qualifications and experience to perform the IEC\'s functions. One type of IEC is an institutional review board (IRB) as defined in 21 CFR 56.102(g) and subject to the requirements of 21 CFR part 56. Another type of IEC is one that adheres to section 3.2.1 of ICH E6. Compliance with 21 CFR part 56 or ICH E6 is not required, however, for an IEC to be considered ""adequately constituted"" under 21 CFR 312.120. We have expressly allowed for flexibility in how to meet the requirements of this regulation in recognition that the organization and membership of IECs may differ among countries because of local needs.18 For more information on IEC membership, see Section 3.2.6 of this guidance document, below.\n\nFootnote 18: 73 Fed. Reg. at 22805.\n\nICH E6 defines informed consent as ""a process by which a subject voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to participate in a particular trial, after having been informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to the subject\'s decision to participate.""19 Informed consent is ""documented by means of a written, signed, and dated informed consent form.""20 In obtaining and documenting informed consent, an investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) and should adhere to principles of GCP.21 Prior to the beginning of the trial, the investigator should obtain the IEC\'s written approval of the informed consent form and any additional written information that will be provided to study subjects.22\n\nFootnote 19: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM073122.pdf.\n\nAppendix B Supporting Information (21 CFR 312.120(b))\n\nA sponsor or applicant submitting non-IND foreign data in support of an IND or an application for marketing approval for a drug must include a description of the actions the sponsor or applicant took to ensure that the research conformed to GCP. Because the description is not required to duplicate information already submitted in the IND or the application for marketing approval, the sponsor or applicant may indicate the location of the required information by providing cross-references (and/or hyperlinks) to relevant sections of the IND application, to relevant sections of an application for marketing approval, or to relevant sections of previously submitted materials.\n\nThe location of all information required by 21 CFR 312.120 should be clearly delineated in the submission. FDA recommends that the sponsor or applicant clearly indicate the following:\n\nwhether each clinical study was conducted at both foreign and domestic sites or only foreign sites;\n\nwhether each foreign site was under an IND or was subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120; and\n\nfor each clinical study subject to 21 CFR 312.120, where in the submission or in previously submitted materials the following information can be found: 1. each of the elements required under 21 CFR 312.120(b) (e.g., ""Information showing that the study is adequate and well controlled, 21 CFR 312.120(b)(5) -- See IND Application, Section X.1, pp. y-z""); and 2. any waiver requests as applicable under 21 CFR 312.120(c) (e.g., ""Waiver request for certain requirements applicable to Study [X] -- see IND Application, Section X.6, pp. y-z"").\n\nClearly delineating where the required information can be found will facilitate FDA\'s review of the IND or marketing application by enabling Agency confirmation of the sponsor\'s/applicant\'s compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nWithin an eCTD format of an application (for marketing approval or an IND), FDA recommends that a sponsor or applicant list the studies subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120 in Section 5.2 of Module 5. The listing can be part of an overall tabular listing or be constructed as an accompanying table and appropriately identified as such. A sponsor or applicant might also use a submission\'s cover letter, particularly in the case of an IND, to indicate whether the submission contains studies subject to 21 CFR 312.120. Whether in Module 5 or in a cover letter, the submission should contain page references and/or links to the respective individual full Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) for the identified studies.\n\nWithin a CSR of a study, using an ICH E3 format as an example, FDA recommends that a sponsor or applicant identify on the Title Page that the study is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120. The Title Page should contain a reference and/or alink to a section or an appendix which specifically addresses the sponsor\'s compliance with 21 CFR 312.120. (In ICH E3 format, such an Appendix would be in addition to the kind of Appendices already listed in the ICH E3 Guidance, e.g. 16.5). FDA further recommends identifying specific foreign non-IND clinical sites using Appendix 16.1.4 (""List and Description of Investigators"") in ICH E3 format or a similarly designated section.\n\nThe section or appendix specifically intended to address compliance with 21 CFR 312.120 should include a brief statement describing actions the sponsor has taken and should provide supporting information in accordance with all the required elements as listed in the regulations (see below). FDA anticipates that for each such element the sponsor would provide the necessary information or provide reference and/or links to other sections of the study report which contain the information. FDA strongly advises against duplicating information provided elsewhere in the application.\n\nThe regulation allows for flexibility in how the requirements are to be met. For example, a full CSR prepared in accordance with ICH E3 ""Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports""23 may meet many of the requirements under 21 CFR 312.120, but adherence to ICH E3 is not required. The same holds for ICH E6: a sponsor or applicant may choose but is not required to meet many of the requirements of this rule through adherence to ICH E6. Note, however, that even if studies are submitted according to ICH E3 or E6, in some cases it may be necessary to provide additional information to FDA to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120, as well as other applicable requirements in 21 CFR parts 312, 314, or 601.24\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsor\n\nFor studies conducted under an IND, 21 CFR part 312 provides that a sponsor is responsible for obtaining a commitment from each investigator that he or she will ensure that requirements in part 56 relating to IRB review and approval are met with respect to the research conducted by the investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d)). Sponsors can also initiate plans for use of a centralized IRB review process and facilitate agreements and other necessary communications among the parties involved.\n\n3.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.1.2 Investigator\n\nUnder 21 CFR part 312, an investigator is responsible for ensuring that there will be initial and continuing review by a qualified IRB of research conducted by that investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d); 312.66). If the investigator is conducting clinical research as part of a multicenter study at an institution with its own IRB and is subject to the policies of that institution, those policies would dictate how the investigator will ensure IRB review. Those policies may provide that the investigator\'s responsibility can be met by ensuring review through a centralized IRB review, through the institution\'s IRB, or through apportionment of IRB review responsibilities between a centralized IRB and the institution\'s IRB.\n\nCentral IRB\n\nFor multicenter studies, the central IRB is the IRB that conducts reviews on behalf of all study sites that agree to participate in the centralized review process. For sites at institutions that have an IRB that would ordinarily review research conducted at the site, the central IRB should reach agreement with the individual institutions participating in centralized review and those institutions\' IRBs about how to apportion the review responsibilities between local IRBs and the central IRB (21 CFR 56.114).\n\nIV Addressing Local Aspects of IRB Review\n\nThe implementation of a centralized IRB review process involves addressing a number of issues related to the communities where the research will take place. The requirements for IRB membership in 21 CFR 56.107(a) specify that the membership of an IRB must have sufficient experience, expertise, and diversity to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. This requirement was intended to implement a recommendation of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research that IRB members be ""men and women of diverse backgrounds and sufficient maturity, experience, and competence to assure that the Board will be able to discharge its responsibilities and that its determinations will be accorded respect by investigators and the community served by the institution or in which it is located.""1 In addition, IRB members must ""be able to ascertain the acceptability of the proposed research in terms of institutional commitments and regulations, applicable law, and standards or professional conduct and practice"" (21 CFR 56.107(a)). Thus, IRB review, through its membership, is intended to provide meaningful consideration of various local factors in assessing research activities, including the cultural backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, educational level, religious affiliations) of the population from which research subjects will be drawn, community attitudes10 about the nature\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nof the proposed research, and the capacity of the institution to conduct or support the proposed research. Inter-community differences could influence, among other things, assessments of whether mechanisms of subject selection will be equitable, whether adequate provision is made to minimize risks to vulnerable populations, and the adequacy of the informed consent process.\n\nThe preamble to the final rule indicates that where a centralized IRB review process is used (21 CFR 56.114), the review should consider the ethical standards of the local community.11 Therefore, a centralized IRB review process should include mechanisms to ensure meaningful consideration of these relevant local factors. Possible mechanisms include:\n\nFootnote 11: Federal Register, Vol. 46, p. 8966, January 27, 1981\n\nProvision of relevant local information to the central IRB in writing by individuals or organizations familiar with the local community, institution, and/or clinical research\n\nParticipation of consultants with relevant expertise, or IRB members from the institution\'s own IRB, in the deliberations of the central IRB\n\nLimited review of a central IRB-reviewed study by the institution\'s own IRB, with that limited review focusing on issues that are of concern to the local community\n\nOther mechanisms may also be appropriate.12 IRB meeting minutes or other records should document how relevant community issues were considered in the review (21 CFR 56.115(a)) (see section 5).\n\nFootnote 12: Guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) (IRB Knowledge of Local Research Context) discusses mechanisms for ensuring adequate consideration of local factors by IRBs in review of clinical research that is supported by DHHS funding. Although the guidance applies only to DHHS funded research, it may be also helpful to off-site IRBs seeking to provide meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for non-DHHS funded clinical research.\n\n5 IRB Records -- Documenting Agreements and Procedures\n\nIRBs and institutions are required to prepare and maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities (21 CFR 56.115(a)). IRBs are also required to follow written procedures for the conduct of initial and continuing review of clinical research and for reporting their findings and actions to the investigator and the institution (21 CFR section 56.108(a), 56.115(a)(6)). The following recommendations should help IRBs fulfill these requirements.\n\nDocumenting Agreements\n\nIf an institution, its IRB, and a central IRB agree (under 21 CFR 56.114) to participate in a centralized IRB review process, they should document that action in an agreement signed by the parties. IRBs should report this action to the investigator and the institution, for example, by providing copies of the agreement to the investigator, and the institution.13 If the agreement\n\n3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApportions IRB review responsibilities between a central IRB and the institution\'s IRB, the agreement should delineate the specific responsibilities of the central IRB and the institution\'s IRB for the initial and continuing review of the study.\n\nWritten Procedures\n\nWhen an institution and an institution\'s IRB rely on review by a central IRB, both IRBs must have written procedures in place to implement the centralized IRB review process (21 CFR 56.108, 56.114). For example, procedures should address the following:\n\nHow the institution\'s IRB determines that the central IRB is qualified to review research conducted at the institution\n\nHow the central IRB intends to communicate with relevant institutions, the institutions\' IRBs, and investigators regarding its review\n\nHow the central IRB ensures that it provides meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for communities from which research subjects will be drawn (see Section 4)\n\nHow the central IRB assesses the ability of a geographically remote site to participate in a study (e.g., whether the site has medical services appropriate to the complexity of the study)\n\nWhen an institution, an institution\'s IRB, and a central IRB agree to apportion IRB review responsibilities between the two IRBs, each IRB must have written procedures describing how it implements its responsibilities under the agreement (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)).\n\nVI Using a Central IRB at Unaffiliated Sites\n\nAt clinical sites that are not already affiliated with an IRB, investigators and sponsors typically rely on the review and oversight of a central IRB. In this situation, the central IRB should document in meeting minutes or other records how it considered relevant local factors for the various communities from which research subjects are to be drawn (see Section 4). The central IRB must also document its action in agreeing to conduct IRB review for the site (21 CFR 56.115) and must have written procedures in place that describe how it will perform its initial and continuing review responsibilities at remote sites (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)) (see Section 5).\n\nVII Examples of Cooperative IRB Review Models\n\nThere are a variety of mechanisms that have been used to distribute IRB review responsibilities between an institution\'s IRB and a central IRB. This guidance is not intended to endorse any particular mechanism. These examples are provided only to illustrate possible mechanisms.\n\nTrial in Which Multiple Sites Rely on a Central IRB\n\nThe primary model contemplated by this guidance is a centralized IRB review process used for a single multicenter trial performed by a commercial or publicly funded sponsor. Under 21 CFR 56.114, IRBs affiliated with the study sites could enter into agreements with a central IRB to rely on all or some of the review findings of the central IRB, or could decline to participate in a centralized IRB review (i.e., do their own complete review). Study sites not already affiliated with an IRB would rely on a central IRB for all IRB review responsibilities.\n\nCentral IRB Formed to Review Multicenter Trials in a Therapeutic Category\n--------------------\nContext title: Using a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Q: What if the sponsor changes during the course of the study or within one year of completion of the study, for example, through purchase or merger?\n\nA:: Agency regulations require that an IND/IDE sponsor collect financial information from all clinical investigators and that clinical investigators promptly update this information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the investigation and for one year following completion of the study (21 CFR SSS 54.4, 312.53(c)(4), 312.64(d), 812.43(c)(5) and 812.110(d)). Therefore, if the study spons changes during the course of the study, the clinical investigators will need to update their financial disclosure information relevant to the new sponsor. The new sponsor is responsible for collecting this information, and to ensure that the new sponsor has complete financial disclosure information, the new sponsor should seek this information from the original sponsor, and the agency encourages the original sponsor to share their records with the new sponsor.\n\nWith respect to covered clinical studies conducted outside the United States not pursuant to an IND or IDE (such as studies submitted pursuant to SS 312.120 or SS 814.15), the agency expects applicants to take affirmative action, at the earliest opportunity, to see that this information is collected and available to make a complete disclosure and/or certification under part 54.\n\nAppendix D Clinical Investigator\n\n0.1 Q: Who is included in the definition of ""clinical investigator""?\n\nUnder part 54, ""clinical investigator means only a listed or identified investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects"" (21 CFR SS 54.2(d)). This definition is intended to identify the individuals for whom reporting under this regulation is required. Generally, these individuals are considered to be the investigators and subinvestigators taking responsibility for the study at a given study site. The definition also includes the spouse and each dependent child of such an investigator or subinvestigator. It should be noted that hospital staff, including nurses, residents, fellows, and office staff who provide ancillary or intermittent care but who do not make direct and significant contribution to the data are not meant to be included under the definition of clinical investigator. Additionally, individuals who only collect specimens or perform routine tests (such as blood pressure, EKG, x-ray) are not meant to be included under the definition of clinical investigator for purposes of financial disclosure.\n\n2 Q: How does the definition of ""clinical investigator"" in the financial disclosure regulation (21 CFR part 54) relate to the definition in the IND regulations (21 CFR part 312)?\n\nFor drugs and biological products, an investigator under 21 CFR part 312 is defined as ""an individual who actually conducts a clinical investigation (i.e., under whose immediate direction the drug is administered or dispensed to a subject). In the event an investigation is conducted by a team of individuals, the investigator is the responsible leader of the team. \'Subinvestigator\' includes any other individual member of that team."" (21 CFR SS 312.3(b).) For purposes of the financial disclosure regulation, a clinical investigator is an investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects (21 CFR SS 54.2(d)). Therefore, the term clinical investigator in this context would generally include anyone who fits any of the following criteria: signs the FORM FDA 1572 (Statement of Investigator), is identified as an investigator in initial submissions or protocol amendments under an IND, or is identified as an investigator in the marketing application. This could include individuals identified as subinvestigatorson a FORM FDA 1572.14 For studies not conducted under an IND, the sponsor will need to identify the investigators and subinvestigators they consider covered by the regulation and provide FORMS FDA 3454 and/or 3455 as appropriate. FDA expects that there will be at least one such person at each clinical site. If other individuals are responsible for a study at a site, those persons should also be included as clinical investigators. Footnote 14: For guidance on who should be listed as an investigator or subinvestigator on Form FDA 1572, please see FDA’s Information Sheet Guidance, “Frequently Asked Questions – Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572)” available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM214282.pdf.\n\nQ: How does the definition of ""clinical investigator"" in the financial disclosure regulation (21 CFR part 54) relate to the definition in the medical device regulations (21 CFR part 812)?\n\nFor medical devices, investigator is defined under 21 CFR part 812 as an individual under whose immediate direction the subject is treated and the investigational device is administered, including follow-up evaluations and treatments. Where an investigation is conducted by a team of individuals, the investigator is the responsible leader of the team. (21 CFR SS 812.3(i).)\n\nIn general, investigators and subinvestigators sign ""investigator agreements"" in accordance with 21 CFR SS 812.43(c), and it is these individuals whose financial interests and arrangements should be reported as they would fall under the definition at 21 CFR SS 54.2(d). For studies not conducted under an FDA-approved IDE (that is, a non-significant risk IDE or an exempt study), the sponsor would need to identify the investigators and subinvestigators they consider covered by the regulation and provide FORMS FDA 3454 and/or 3455, as appropriate. We expect that there will be at least one such person at each clinical site.\n\nQ: Is it necessary to collect financial information on spouses and dependent children of clinical investigators?\n\nYes. The definition of clinical investigator in 21 CFR part 54 includes the spouse and dependent children of the investigators and subinvestigators who are required to report. Therefore, the financial interests and arrangements of the spouse and each dependent child of each investigator and subinvestigator are to be included in the disclosure (21 CFR SS 54.2(d)). The dollar amount that triggers reporting is the total of the financial interests of the investigator, spouse, and dependent children (21 CFR SS 54.2(d)). If a spouse or dependent child is an employee of the sponsor, the clinical investigator should be identified as an employee of the sponsor and no further disclosure is required. (See 21 CFR SS 54.4.)\n\nQ: Who is considered a ""dependent child""?\n\nFor purposes of clinical investigator financial disclosure under part 54, a dependent child is the investigator\'s child (whether by blood or adoption), stepchild or foster child who is unmarried, and for whom the investigator provides more than one-half of the child\'s support. This would include a child who, at any time during the course of the study and for one year following completion of the study, is under the age of 19, under the age of 24 if a full-time student, or who is permanently and totally disabled. Such a child would generally have the same principal residence as the investigator.\n\n*Q: What obligations does the clinical investigator have under the financial disclosure regulations?\n\nClinical investigators are to provide sponsors sufficient accurate financial information to allow the applicant to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements (see 21 CFR SSS 54.4, 312.53(c)(4), 312.64(d), 812.43(c)(5) and 812.110(d)). Clinical investigators must provide this information to sponsors and also promptly update the information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the investigation and for one year following the completion of the study (see 21 CFR SSS 54.4(b), 312.53(c)(4), 312.64(d), 812.43(c)(5) and 812.110(d)). See also Question C.2.\n\n*Q: May a clinical investigator rely on the information he/she provided to comply with his/her institution\'s policies and procedures pertaining to financial conflicts of interest to comply with the investigator obligations for financial disclosure under FDA\'s regulations?\n\nThe financial information a clinical investigator provides to his/her institution is based on the institution\'s requirements, which may not be sufficient to meet FDA\'s regulations. FDA\'s regulations require the clinical investigator to provide sufficient and accurate financial information to the sponsor to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements under FDA\'s clinical investigator financial disclosure regulations (21 CFR SSS 54.4(b)). However, if an investigator determines that the financial information he/she provided to his/her institution adequately fulfills the disclosure requirements in FDA\'s regulations, a clinical investigator could provide the same information to the sponsor. The clinical investigator would still need to commit to promptly updating the financial information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the study and for one year following completion of the study (21 CFR SSS 54.4(b)).\n\n*Q: How does the definition of ""sponsor"" in the financial disclosure regulation (21 CFR part 54) relate to the definition in the IND/IDE regulations (21 CFR parts 312 and 812)?\n--------------------\nContext title: Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Industry,and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nRecruiting Study Subjects\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects).\n\nOffice of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nFDA requires that an Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and have authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove all research activities covered by the IRB regulations [21 CFR 56.109(a)]. An IRB is required to ensure that appropriate safeguards exist to protect the rights and welfare of research subjects [21 CFR 56.107(a) and 56.111]. In fulfilling these responsibilities, an IRB is expected to review all the research documents and activities that bear directly on the rights and welfare of the subjects of proposed research. The protocol, the consent document and, for studies conducted under the Investigational New Drug (IND) regulations, the investigator\'s brochure are examples of documents that the IRB should review. The IRB should also review the methods and material that investigators propose to use to recruit subjects.\n\nMedia Advertising:\n\nDirect advertising for research subjects, i.e., advertising that is intended to be seen or heard by prospective subjects to solicit their participation in a study, is not in and of itself, an objectionable practice. Direct advertising includes, but is not necessarily limited to: newspaper, radio, TV, bulletin boards, posters, and flyers that are intended for prospective subjects. Not included are: (1) communications intended to be seen or heard by health professionals, such as ""dear doctor"" letters and doctor-to-doctor letters (even when soliciting for study subjects), (2) news stories and (3) publicity intended for other audiences, such as financial page advertisements directed toward prospective investors.\n\nIRB review and approval of listings of clinical trials on the internet would provide no additional safeguard and is not required when the system format limits the information provided to basic trial information, such as: the title; purpose of the study; protocol summary; basic eligibility criteria; study site location(s); and how to contact the site for further information. Examples of clinical trial listing services that do not require prospective IRB approval include the National Cancer Institute\'s cancer clinical triallisting (PDQ) and the government-sponsored AIDS Clinical Trials Information Service (ACTIS). However, when the opportunity to add additional descriptive information is not precluded by the data base system, IRB review and approval may assure that the additional information does not promise or imply a certainty of cure or other benefit beyond what is contained in the protocol and the informed consent document. FDA considers direct advertising for study subjects to be the start of the informed consent and subject selection process. Advertisements should be reviewed and approved by the IRB as part of the package for initial review. However, when the clinical investigator decides at a later date to advertise for subjects, the advertising may be considered an amendment to the ongoing study. When such advertisements are easily compared to the approved consent document, the IRB chair, or other designated IRB member, may review and approve by expedited means, as provided by 21 CFR 56.110(b)(2). When the IRB reviewer has doubts or other complicating issues are involved, the advertising should be reviewed at a convened meeting of the IRB. FDA expects IRBs to review the advertising to assure that it is not unduly coercive and does not promise a certainty of cure beyond what is outlined in the consent and the protocol. This is especially critical when a study may involve subjects who are likely to be vulnerable to undue influence. [21 CFR 50.20, 50.25, 56.111(a)(3), 56.111(b) and 812.20(b)(11).] When direct advertising is to be used, the IRB should review the information contained in the advertisement and the mode of its communication, to determine that the procedure for recruiting subjects is not coercive and does not state or imply a certainty of favorable outcome or other benefits beyond what is outlined in the consent document and the protocol. The IRB should review the final copy of printed advertisements to evaluate the relative size of type used and other visual effects. When advertisements are to be taped for broadcast, the IRB should review the final audio/video tape. The IRB may review and approve the wording of the advertisement prior to taping to preclude re-taping because of inappropriate wording. The review of the final taped message prepared from IRB-approved text may be accomplished through expedited procedures. The IRB may wish to caution the clinical investigators to obtain IRB approval of message text prior to taping, in order to avoid re-taping because of inappropriate wording. No claims should be made, either explicitly or implicitly, that the drug, biologic or device is safe or effective for the purposes under investigation, or that the test article is known to be equivalent or superior to any other drug, biologic or device. Such representation would not only be misleading to subjects but would also be a violation of the Agency\'s regulations concerning the promotion of investigational drugs [21 CFR 312.7(a)] and of investigational devices [21 CFR 812.7(d)]. Advertising for recruitment into investigational drug, biologic or device studies should not use terms such as ""new treatment,"" ""new medication"" or ""new drug"" without explaining that the test article is investigational. A phrase such as ""receive new treatments"" leads study subjects to believe they will be receiving newly improved products of proven worth.\n\nAdvertisements should not promise ""free medical treatment,"" when the intent is only to say subjects will not be charged for taking part in the investigation. Advertisements may state that subjects will be paid, but should not emphasize the payment or the amount to be paid, by such means as larger or bold type.\n\nGenerally, FDA believes that any advertisement to recruit subjects should be limited to the information the prospective subjects need to determine their eligibility and interest. When appropriately worded, the following items may be included in advertisements. It should be noted, however, that FDA does not require inclusion of all of the listed items.\n\nthe name and address of the clinical investigator and/or research facility;\n\nthe condition under study and/or the purpose of the research;\n\nin summary form, the criteria that will be used to determine eligibility for the study;\n\na brief list of participation benefits, if any (e.g., a no-cost health examination);\n\nthe time or other commitment required of the subjects; and\n\nthe location of the research and the person or office to contact for further information.\n\nReceptionist Scripts\n\nThe first contact prospective study subjects make is often with a receptionist who follows a script to determine basic eligibility for the specific study. The IRB should assure the procedures followed adequately protect the rights and welfare of the prospective subjects. In some cases personal and sensitive information is gathered about the individual. The IRB should have assurance that the information will be appropriately handled. A simple statement such as ""confidentiality will be maintained"" does not adequately inform the IRB of the procedures that will be used.\n\nExamples of issues that are appropriate for IRB review: What happens to personal information if the caller ends the interview or simply hangs up? Are the data gathered by a marketing company? If so, are names, etc. sold to others? Are names of non-eligibles maintained in case they would qualify for another study? Are paper copies of records shredded or are readable copies put out as trash? The acceptability of the procedures would depend on the sensitivity of the data gathered, including; personal, medical and financial.\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) - Specific Electronic Submissions Intended For FDA\'s Dockets Management Staff (i.e., Citizen Petitions, Draft Proposed Guidance Documents, Variances, and other administrative 23.8.20.5.503\n\nrecord submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\nSearch for FDA\n\nGuidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Recruiting Study Subjects Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nNon-local IRB Review\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/non-local-irb-review).\n\nOffice of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nUnder certain circumstances, local review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) may not be available, e.g., research conducted by investigators unaffiliated with an institution with an IRB. Although conceptually modeled for local IRB review, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations do not prohibit review of research by IRBs in locations other than where the research is to be performed (e.g., independent or non-institutional IRB). Therefore, an IRB may review studies that are not performed on-site as long as the 21 CFR parts 50 and 56 requirements are met.\n\nWhen non-local IRB review takes place, the reviewing IRB must document its role and responsibility. A written agreement should be executed between the performance site where the research is to be conducted (e.g., private practitioner\'s office, clinic, etc.) and the IRB or its institution. The agreement should confirm the authority of the IRB to oversee the study. While the IRB assumes responsibility for oversight and continuing review, the clinical investigator and the research site retain the responsibility for the conduct of the study.\n\nCommunity Attitudes\n\nThe non-local IRB should have adequate knowledge of community attitudes, information on conditions surrounding the conduct of the research, and the continuing status of the research to assure fulfilling the requirements of 21 CFR 56.107, 56.111(a)(3), (a)(7) and (b) for each study site. The non-local IRB needs to ensure these requirements are met for each location for which it has assumed IRB oversight responsibility.\n\nThe FDA regulations require all IRBs to have membership sufficiently qualified to promote respect for the IRB\'s advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects [21 CFR 56.107]. IRBs conducting non-local review need to be knowledgeable about the community from which the subjects are drawn to ensure that subject rights will be protected and that the consent process is appropriate for the subject population involved. The Top 0IRB should be sensitive to community laws and moves because state and local laws and community attitudes pertaining to research may be more restrictive than Federal regulations or the prevailing standards of the community where the IRB is located.\n\nIRBs can obtain knowledge of community attitudes with a site visit by a representative of the IRB, by appointing an IRB member from that community, or by having a consultant from the community advise the IRB, either prior to or during the deliberations. If travel is not feasible, participation in the IRB meeting can be by video-conference or conference telephone call, or by using other technologies that allow for real-time conversational interaction between the remote member and the members at the convened location. All IRB members should receive an advance copy of the documents that are to be reviewed at the meeting. The minutes of the meeting, during which non-local research is reviewed, should document the procedures used to assure that community attitudes were adequately taken into consideration.\n\nIRB Information Needs\n\nIRBs should have access to a variety of information to properly conduct initial and continuing reviews. Knowledge of the conditions surrounding the conduct of the research is needed to ensure that risks to subjects are minimized [21 CFR 56.111]. An IRB should have sufficient information to judge the qualifications of the researcher conducting the study in question. The researcher\'s curriculum vitae, a listing of other studies conducted, letters of reference, information from the sponsor of the research, and information from licensing boards and professional societies are examples of information a non-local IRB may want to review. If the research is to be conducted in an institution, the clinical investigator should provide a description of that institution and associated medical facilities. The acknowledgment and/or the permission of the institution should also be provided. If the research is to be conducted outside an institutional setting, the IRB may request a plan for emergency medical care. Depending upon the degree of risk inherent in the study, a hospital should certify that its facilities are available.\n\nThe IRB should explicitly detail the information it needs in written reports from the researcher. In addition to scheduled continuing review of progress reports, an IRB may use other methods of obtaining information on the conduct of the study. All IRBs should have procedures that assure the IRB becomes aware of unexpected problems in ongoing studies in a timely manner. Fulfilling this requirement may call for additional efforts for non-local IRBs, such as visiting the study site, contacting the sponsor\'s research monitor for information on the monitor\'s site visits, or arranging for other oversight of the study.\n\nIRB Contact\n\nThe FDA informed consent regulations [21 CFR 50.25(a)(7)] require that the subject be given the name of a person to contact ""... for answers to pertinent questions about the research and research subjects\' rights, and whom to contact in the event of a research-related injury to the subject."" Non-local IRBs should include, in the consent document, an IRB contact person and a telephone number (toll-free if long-distance). The non-local IRB may also designate an (\\mathsf{top}\\,0) individual at the research site to be the contact and to relay reports to the IRB.\n\n23.8.20. 5.7.502.\n\nIRB Jurisdiction\n\nWhen an institution has a local IRB, the written procedures of that IRB or of the institution should define the scope of studies subject to review by that IRB. A non-local IRB may not become the IRB of record for studies within that defined scope unless the local IRB or the administration of the institution agree. Any agreement to allow review by a non-local IRB should be in writing.\n\nAlso see FDA Information Sheet: ""Cooperative Research.""

Investigation drug and biologics studies conducted in the U.S. must be conducted in compliance with the IND requirements contained in 21 CFR 312, which includes the requirement that investigators sign the 1572.  If a study also involves foreign clinical sites, the sponsor may choose, but is not required, to include the foreign clinical sites under the IND.  The investigators from the U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND would be required to sign the 1572.  The investigators from the foreign sites that are not included under the IND are not required to sign the 1572.\n\nIf the sponsor chooses to conduct a multinational study with U.S. and some foreign sites under the IND, and other foreign sites not under the IND, the sponsor can submit a single protocol to the IND and all sites would follow this protocol.  Alternatively, the sponsor can conduct a multinational study with one protocol for sites under the IND (U.S. sites and some foreign sites) and a different protocol(s) for foreign sites not under the IND.  If the intent is to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites, the protocols would ordinarily be very similar or identical.  The U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND must follow the protocol that was submitted to the IND.  For foreign sites that are not included under the IND, the protocol(s) does not need to be submitted to the IND.

Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), sponsors must also notify FDA and all participating investigators in an IND safety report of any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected.  This means that FDA and all participating investigators under the IND would be informed of such an adverse experience, even if it occurred in a foreign study not conducted under the IND.']",0.49999999995,0.5185185185185185
29,"Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?","['--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:1]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nDrug Stability Guidelines\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration\'s (FDA\'s) current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the appropriate FDA staff. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe guideline is to be used as an aid in designing and conducting studies to establish drug stability in support of original, abbreviated or supplements to new animal drug applications (NADAs/ANADAs). The guideline will provide a framework within which stability studies can be conducted to provide meaningful and sufficient data. The concept of the guidelines is applicable to studies on drug substances and the actual dosage form. The guideline is not intended to restrict experimentation. The guideline applies to pharmaceutical dosage forms and medicated feed products.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the FDA\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA\'s guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nSection 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b) establishes the requirements for new animal drug approval. 21 CFR 514.1 specifies the proper form and the information required to be submitted. Included is a requirement under section 514.1(b)(5)(x) that an applicant submit data from stability studies completed as well as information about studies that are underway to substantiate the request for a specific expiration date and provide information on the stability of the drug products.\n\nCGMP regulations under 21 CFR Part 200 also require stability testing for pharmaceutical dosage forms (21 CFR 211) and Type A Medicated Articles (medicated premixes) (21 CFR 226). This guideline can be used as an aid to conduct the required stability testing.\n\nThe agency advises that this final guideline represents its current position on the development of stability studies to meet the requirements of the submission of original or abbreviated newanimal drug applications and the corresponding CGMP regulations. The guideline may be useful to manufacturers of new animal drug products. A person may follow the guideline or may choose to use alternate procedures even though they are not provided for in the guideline. If a person chooses to use alternate procedures, that person may wish to discuss the matter further with the agency to prevent an expenditure of money and effort on activities that may later be determined to be unacceptable by FDA. This guideline does not bind the agency, and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits for or on any person.\n\n2 General Considerations\n\nProtocols\n\nPrior to the submission of an original or supplemental NADA, an applicant may wish to submit a stability protocol for comment before committing to studies that will become a permanent part of the NADA.\n\nThe protocol should contain an outline of the proposed plan to be used in generating stability data. The protocol should describe the type of product being tested, sampling process, duration and frequency of testing, number of samples and replicates per time interval, storage conditions (length of storage, type of storage, temperatures and packaging), methods of analysis (description or reference of published methods) with accompanying support data, if available, and other tests. The information listed in these guidelines should be incorporated as appropriate in the development of a plan.\n\nThe Center\'s review scientists will evaluate and comment on the proposed protocols or assist an applicant (upon request) in the design of a study.\n\nIt should be noted that the Center for Veterinary Medicine does not approve protocols.\n\nApplicants or drug firms proposing to conduct stability studies should refer to the following texts:\n\n""Chemical Stability of Pharmaceuticals"" by K. Connors, G. Amidon and L. Kennon, John Wiley & Sons (1979). and\n\n""Formulation of Veterinary Dosage Forms"", vol. 17, Drugs and The Pharmaceutical Sciences, Blodinger, J., Marcel Dekker Inc., NY. (1983). Chapter 5.\n\nThese texts provide information on the various aspects of establishing a stability program.\n\nGeneral Stability Considerations\n\nDefinition of Active IngrediThe active ingredient of an animal drug preparation is defined as that chemical whose biological, physiological, pharmacological, or chemical activities are claimed on the label to be beneficial for animals in normal or pathological conditions (diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, prophylaxis, therapy) or for animal production.\n\nStrength (Potency) The strength of a drug substance may be its concentration (quantity of the drug per unit measure), its potency, or both. The potency of a drug is a measurable (quantitative) extent of the biological, physiological, pharmacological, or chemical activities of the drug per unit weight or volume of the drug preparation. Drug preparations are considered stable if the active ingredient can maintain its strength at the level specified on the label for the maximum anticipated shelf-life (the time period from the date of manufacture until administration to the animal) under environmental conditions likely to be encountered in actual use. However, few, if any, drug preparations maintain their full label-claimed strength under specified conditions. Therefore, allowances are made for some unavoidable deviations from drug levels declared on the label by designating specific limits for tolerable deviations. A drug product is considered unstable when the drug substance (active ingredient) loses sufficient potency to adversely affect the safety or efficacy of the drug or falls outside labeled specifications as shown by stability-indicating methods. To properly evaluate the stability of a drug product, it is essential to determine the storage conditions under which the drug strength can be maintained in order to provide a safe and efficacious drug product. As a guide in determining drug strength in pharmaceutical dosage forms, the following is recognized by the scientific community: * ""Although there are exceptions, 90% of the labeled potency is generally recognized as the minimum acceptable potency level.""1\n\nDrug Preparation The active ingredient should be formulated in any drug preparation at 100% of label claim. An overage of the active ingredient may be permitted in a product should the need exist. All overages should be justified. The assay limits must account for the overage. The overage should not exceed the limits of 5% for antibiotics and 3% for nonantibiotic chemicals as established by the Center for Veterinary Medicine.\n\nChemical and Physical Properties Strength is not the only criterion of drug product stability. Maintenance of various chemical and physical properties to preserve the effectiveness and safety of the drug is also important. Properties, such as physical appearance, crystalline form, particle size, solubility, disintegration rate, pH, sterility, viscosity, palatability (taste and odor), may be stability related and thus require testing and the setting of specific storage conditions and limits. In addition, tests may also be needed to determine the absence or presence of harmful degradation products.\n\nAdded Substances Stability data on substances that are added to a drug preparation to enhance its stability, usefulness, physical or chemical properties or as an aid in manufacturing may be required. The type of substance(s) used, its purpose, and its relationship to the active drug ingredient(s) and total drug preparation will determine if testing for the substance is required. Examples of added substances that may commonly be used are antioxidants, antibacterials, absorbants (bentonite), etc.\n\nProduct Changes Changes made in the composition (formulation) or dosage form of the original or succeeding product(s) present a new drug product and will require generation of new stability data. Data requirements will depend on the nature and degree of change. Any change requires an evaluation as to the effect on the stability of the products.\n\nCorrelation with Efficacy and Toxicity Studies Stability studies supporting an application should be performed on the drug preparation in its final formulation whose efficacy and safety has been demonstrated. Any change made in an approved preparation requires consideration of the effects on the efficacy and safety of the ""changed"" drug product.\n\nDegradation Products\n\nDegradation products that occur during storage (under shelf-life testing) should be identified. These products should be thoroughly investigated and evaluated for safety and toxicology purposes. The presence of degradation products may require additional safety and efficacy studies.\n\nProduct Stability Parameters\n\nThe established regulatory registration (NADA or NDA) specifications or Compendial standards are to be used for determining the stability of the products. There can be only one set of standards. Samples of products (from production lots) on stability should be representative of those in the market place. Expiration dating is based on the ability of the product to be measured over a certain period of time against the established specifications or standards.\n\nAppendix C Storage Conditions\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #5 Drug Stability Guidelines'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA will RTR an ANDA if both worst-case scenario and non-worst-case stability data adhering to the recommendations described in section V.2.1 and this section are not submitted for the described drug product batches: liquids, solutions, semi-solids, and suspensions.55\n\nFootnote 55: See 21 CFR 314.94(a)(9)(i) stating that ANDAs must include chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information required under 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1).\n\nAppendix C Packaging Amount Considerations\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if the ANDA does not package a minimum (threshold) amount of the finished drug product in the container/closure systems that are proposed for marketing, as discussed in FDA\'s guidance for industry ANDAs: Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products, Questions and Answers.56 Also as discussed in the guidance, the threshold amount that should be packaged is governed by the specific dosage form (e.g., solid oral dosage forms, oral powders/solutions/suspensions, parenteral drug products, ophthalmic/otic drug products, transdermal patches, and topicals such as creams/lotions/gels and inhalation solutions/nasal sprays) of the finished drug product that is the subject of the ANDA submission.\n\nFootnote 56: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(ii).\n\nTo qualify the dosage units that are packaged toward the applicable threshold, the following three recommended criteria for each container/closure configuration should be satisfied:\n\nStability data (as described in section V.2.1 of this guidance).\n\nContainer/closure system information should be submitted in ANDA section 3.2.P.7. If bracketing or matrixing is used, an ANDA should include the container/closure system information applicable to configurations that were excluded from stability studies because of bracketing or matrixing.\n\nContainer and carton (if applicable) labeling for each packaging configuration containing dosage units to be counted in the overall packaged total should be provided in section 1.14.1 of the ANDA.\n\nAppendix D Batch Records\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if blank and executed batch records are not provided, regardless of whether commercial scale-up is proposed.57 For example, both commercial (blank) and executed (pilot) batch records for the pilot batches that are manufactured to support an ANDA should be submitted, along with any accompanying reconciliation sheets.\n\nFootnote 57: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(ii).\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if method validation/verification reports are not provided.58 It is critical that method validation/verification reports for all analytical methods be provided in sections 3.2.S.4.3 and 3.2.P.5.3 of the ANDA, for both the drug substance (API) and drug product, respectively. That is, for drug products for which a relevant official United States Pharmacopeia (USP) drug product monograph exists, verification59 of the USP analytical procedures should be provided. Verification should also be submitted for methods used from outside sources, such as a Type II API DMF holder, unless the methods have been fully validated in house. For any in-house methods used, validation of the analytical procedure should be submitted in either of the appropriate sections of the ANDA (i.e., sections 3.2.S.4.3 or 3.2.P.5.3). In-house methods used in lieu of USP methods should be compared to the USP method to support a demonstration that the in-house method is sufficient.\n\nFootnote 58: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1) and 314.94(a)(9)(i).\n\nFootnote 59: 25 EP (European Pharmacopoeia)/BP (British Pharmacopoeia)/JP (Japanese Pharmacopoeia) methods may be allowed, for which, in many cases, verification (versus full validation) may suffice.\n\nFootnote 60: On May 5, 2017, the electronic submission of ANDAs in a format specified by FDA will be required. See discussion in section III.B.\n\nIn addition, for ANDAs not submitted electronically60, the applicant should submit three copies of the method validation/verification package for the API, the drug product, or both.61\n\nFootnote 61: 21 CFR 314.50(e)(2)(i).\n\nFootnote 63: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1).\n\nAppendix F Special Consideration for Transdermal Patches\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA for a transdermal patch if the ANDA does not address certain special considerations.62,63\n\nFootnote 63: In addition to the considerations identified in this section, FDA has provided recommendations on the submission of studies evaluating the adhesive performance of a Transdermal Delivery System (TDS) or topical patch in support of an ANDA in the guidance for industry Assessing Adhesion with Transdermal Delivery Systems and Topical Patches for ANDAs. The recommendations provided in the guidance will supersede the recommendations related to adhesion studies provided in individual product-specific recommendations published before the guidance was issued. Accordingly, FDA will RTR an ANDA for failure to follow the recommendations in the guidance once the final guidance is issued.\n\nMatrix Systems\n\nANDAs for matrix transdermal systems should be supported by stability data on three batches of drug product manufactured from three distinct laminates, where each batch of laminate is made using different lots of API, adhesives, backing, and/or other critical elements in the drug product. If an applicant is seeking approval for multiple strengths of a particular drug product, the applicant can choose to use a bracket approach by manufacturing three batches of the highest and lowest strengths and at least one batch of each of the bracketed strengths. An example is given below. * Laminate Batch # 1 (pilot-scale): All strengths (highest, lowest, and bracketed) * Laminate Batch # 2 (pilot-scale): Highest and lowest strengths * Laminate Batch # 3 (pilot- or small-scale): Highest and lowest strengths\n* Reservoir Systems\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]\n\ncontainer as the RLD. Therefore, a deviation from the fill volume (total drug content) of the RLD parenteral drug product may constitute a change in strength. A change in strength must first be approved via the suitability petition process (see section III.F of this guidance) before it can be proposed in an ANDA submission.\n\n3. Differences in Packaging and/or Labeling That May Be Associated With the Safe/Effective Use of the Drug Product\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA on a case-by-case basis if the ANDA contains differences in packaging and/or labeling from the RLD that may be associated with safe/effective use of the drug product.66 Generally, if the RLD is packaged with certain labeling in a manner to ensure its proper administration, the test product should be packaged and labeled similarly. For example, an RLD product may incorporate labeling on its packaging that contains a combination of visual and/or typographical aids, beyond the direct label text, to facilitate patient compliance and safety. Blister packaging is an example of such packaging, whereby certain drug products communicate crucial patient information directly on the blister carton (and/or the blister itself) to both improve patient compliance and reduce the incidence of harm or injury that may result from improper administration of the drug product. A blister carton may also better allow any supplemental patient information to be attached directly to it, which in turn ensures that each patient receives the necessary drug product information upon dispensing from a pharmacy. Such a proposed product should generally be packaged similarly to the RLD to account for these considerations.\n\nFootnote 66: 21 CFR 314.94(a)(8).\n\n4. Other Inconsistencies\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if the ANDA contains certain other inconsistencies. In accordance with 21 CFR 314.94(a)(4), an ANDA must include a statement that the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling proposed for the drug product have been previously approved for the RLD. However, there are certain exceptions (e.g., for labeling differences permitted pursuant to an approved suitability petition that is cited as an ANDA\'s basis of submission (see section III.F for further details)). Any other proposed condition-of-use changes would not be acceptable. Examples of proposed condition-of-use changes may include, but are not limited to, citing a sprinkle capsule dosage form as a basis of submission but producing a capsule that cannot be administered in the same manner as the RLD, or proposing alterations to either the amount of active ingredient delivered per dose or the dosing regimen such that neither are consistent with those described in the RLD labeling.\n\nAppendix H Microbiology Considerations\n\nGenerally, FDA will RTR an ANDA if it contains certain deficiencies related to microbiology considerations.\n\nAn ANDA should contain all sterility assurance validation studies for terminally sterilized drug products and aseptically filled drug products, as described below67:Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTerminally sterilized drug products\n\nValidation of production terminal sterilization process\n\nValidation of depyrogenation of product containers and closures\n\nValidation of container-closure package integrity\n\nAseptically filled drug products\n\nValidation of the sterilizing grade filters (bacterial retention studies)\n\nValidation of the sterilization of sterile bulk drug or product contact equipment, components, containers, and closures\n\nValidation of the depyrogenation of product containers and closures\n\nValidation of the aseptic filling process/line/room (media fills/process simulations)\n\nValidation of container-closure package integrity\n\nIn addition, an ANDA should include at the time of submission, at minimum, summaries of validation studies.\n\nVI Bioequivalence and clinical deficiencies\n\nAs a general matter, ANDA applicants should refer to FDA\'s ""Product Specific Recommendations for Generic Drug Development"" website for Bioequivalence (BE) guidances regarding recommended in vivo and/or in vitro BE and other recommended studies.68\n\nFootnote 68: FDA’s BE recommendations for specific products can be found at\n--------------------\nContext title: ANDA Submissions -- Refuse-to-Receive Standards Rev.2'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: ii.1.3 Selection of Batches (2.1.3)\n\nData from formal stability studies should be provided on at least three primary batches of the drug substance. The batches should be manufactured to a minimum of pilot scale by the same synthetic route as production batches and using a method of manufacture and procedure that simulates the final process to be used for production batches. The overall quality of the batches of drug substance placed on formal stability studies should be representative of the quality of the material to be made on a production scale.\n\nOther supporting data can be provided.\n\nii.1.4 Container Closure System (2.1.4)\n\nThe stability studies should be conducted on the drug substance packaged in a container closure system that is the same as or simulates the packaging proposed for storage and distribution.\n\nii.1.5 Specification (2.1.5)\n\nSpecification, which is a list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and proposed acceptance criteria, is addressed in ICH Q6A Specifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Chemical Substances and Q6B__Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSpecifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Biotechnological/Biological Products. In addition, specification for degradation products in a drug substance is discussed in ICH Q3A Impurities in New Drug Substances.\n\nStability studies should include testing of those attributes of the drug substance that are susceptible to change during storage and are likely to influence quality, safety, and/or efficacy. The testing should cover, as appropriate, the physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological attributes. Validated stability-indicating analytical procedures should be applied. Whether and to what extent replication should be performed should depend on the results from validation studies.\n\nTesting Frequency (2.1.6)\n\nFor long-term studies, frequency of testing should be sufficient to establish the stability profile of the drug substance. For drug substances with a proposed retest period of at least 12 months, the frequency of testing at the long-term storage condition should normally be every 3 months over the first year, every 6 months over the second year, and annually thereafter through the proposed retest period.\n\nAt the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of three time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g., 0, 3, and 6 months), from a 6-month study is recommended. Where an expectation (based on development experience) exists that the results from accelerated studies are likely to approach significant change criteria, increased testing should be conducted either by adding samples at the final time point or including a fourth time point in the study design.\n\nWhen testing at the intermediate storage condition is called for as a result of significant change at the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of four time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g., 0, 6, 9, 12 months), from a 12-month study is recommended.\n\nStorage Conditions (2.1.7)\n\nIn general, a drug substance should be evaluated under storage conditions (with appropriate tolerances) that test its thermal stability and, if applicable, its sensitivity to moisture. The storage conditions and the lengths of studies chosen should be sufficient to cover storage, shipment, and subsequent use.\n\nThe long-term testing should cover a minimum of 12 months' duration on at least three primary batches at the time of submission and should be continued for a period of time sufficient to cover the proposed retest period. Additional data accumulated during the assessment period of the registration application should be submitted to the authorities if requested. Data from the accelerated storage condition and, if appropriate, from the intermediate storage condition can be used to evaluate the effect of short-term excursions outside the label storage conditions (such as might occur during shipping).\n\nLong-term, accelerated, and, where appropriate, intermediate storage conditions for drug substances are detailed in the sections below. The general case should apply if the drug substance is not specifically covered by a subsequent section. Alternative storage conditions can be used if justified.\n\nIt is up to the applicant to decide whether long-term stability studies are performed at (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/60\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) or (30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/65\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}).\n\n** If (30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/65\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) is the long-term condition, there is no intermediate condition.\n\nIf long-term studies are conducted at (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/60\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) and significant change occurs at any time during 6 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, additional testing at the intermediate storage condition should be conducted and evaluated against significant change criteria. Testing at the intermediate storage condition should include all tests, unless otherwise justified. The initial application should include a minimum of 6 months' data from a 12-month study at the intermediate storage condition.\n\nSignificant change for a drug substance is defined as failure to meet its specification.\n\nData from refrigerated storage should be assessed according to the evaluation section of this guidance, except where explicitly noted below.\n\nIf significant change occurs between 3 and 6 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, the proposed retest period should be based on the real time data available at the long-term storage condition.\n\nIf significant change occurs within the first 3 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, a discussion should be provided to address the effect of short-term excursions outside the label storage condition (e.g., during shipping or handling). This discussion can be supported, if appropriate, by further testing on a single batch of the drug substance for a period shorter than 3 months but with more frequent testing than usual. It is considered unnecessary to continue to test a drug substance through 6 months when a significant change has occurred within the first 3 months.\n\nFor drug substances intended for storage in a freezer, the retest period should be based on the real time data obtained at the long-term storage condition. In the absence of an accelerated storage condition for drug substances intended to be stored in a freezer, testing on a single batch at an elevated temperature (e.g., (5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 3^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) or (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})) for an appropriate time period should be conducted to address the effect of short-term excursions outside the proposed label storage condition (e.g., during shipping or handling).\n\nDrug substances intended for storage below -20({}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) (2.1.7.4)\n\nDrug substances intended for storage below -20({}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) should be treated on a case-by-case basis.\n\n8 Stability Commitment (2.1.8)\n\nWhen available long-term stability data on primary batches do not cover the proposed retest period granted at the time of approval, a commitment should be made to continue the stability studies postapproval to firmly establish the retest period.\n\nWhere the submission includes long-term stability data on three production batches covering the proposed retest period, a postapproval commitment is considered unnecessary. Otherwise, one of the following commitments should be made:\n\nIf the submission includes data from stability studies on at least three production batches, a commitment should be made to continue these studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nIf the submission includes data from stability studies on fewer than three production batches, a commitment should be made to continue these studies through the proposed retest period and to place additional production batches, to a total of at least three, on long-term stability studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nIf the submission does not include stability data on production batches, a commitment should be made to place the first three production batches on long-term stability studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nThe stability protocol used for long-term studies for the stability commitment should be the same as that for the primary batches, unless otherwise scientifically justified.\n\n9.1.9 Evaluation (2.1.9)\n\nThe purpose of the stability study is to establish, based on testing a minimum of three batches of the drug substance and evaluating the stability information (including, as appropriate, results of the physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological tests), a retest period applicable to all future batches of the drug substance manufactured under similar circumstances. The degree of variability of individual batches affects the confidence that a future production batch will remain within specification throughout the assigned retest period.\n\nThe data may show so little degradation and so little variability that it is apparent from looking at the data that the requested retest period will be granted. Under these circumstances, it is normally unnecessary to go through the formal statistical analysis; providing a justification for the omission should be sufficient.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1A(R2) Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: 4 Stability Requirements\n\nDrug Substance Stability\n\nDrug substance stability data to define a re-test period is not applicable as the drug substance is not isolated and stored in an integrated process. Drug substance stability data may be appropriate\n\nInclude tests that are necessary to ensure the identity, strength, quality and purity of the drug substance and bioavailability of the drug product as per ICH Q6A.\n\nIn this example, crystalline form is considered a critical quality attribute for the drug substance and hence tested periodically. Crystalline form is not tested in the drug product as lack of form change during drug product processing has been demonstrated.\n\nIn this example, chirality is considered a critical quality attribute for the drug substance.\n\nTests that are common to both drug substance and drug product specification need to be tested only at one location; the same test result can be used for the drug substance and drug product.\n\n\\end{table}\nTable 4: Example of a testing approach for an integrated CMfor other aspects, such as to support the storage of in-house reference standards and to gain an understanding of product stability profiles. Institution of a hold time enables temporary storage of drug substance during an interruption in production.\n\nDrug Product Stability\n\nThe ICH stability guidelines and Section 4.5 of the main guideline are applicable to drug product made by an integrated process.\n\n5 Location of Drug Substance and Drug Product Information in the CTD\n\nDrug substance and drug product information could be provided in the respective CTD sections 3.2.S and 3.2.P of the dossier. A description of the process step that integrates the drug substance and drug product could be based on its relevancy to the respective section. For example, in the process example provided in this annex, the continuous filtration process could be described in CTD section 3.2.S as it is related to concentration of the drug substance. The integrated flow diagram can be provided in CTD section 3.2.P and referenced in section 3.2.S.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis annex describes examples of approaches for managing transient disturbances (hereafter referred to as disturbances in this annex) that may occur during CM. The discussion points presented here are not exhaustive. Alternative approaches can be used.\n\n2 Background\n\nDisturbances may result in a variation in material quality. The impact of some variations on material quality in an earlier process step may be resolved by downstream process steps. The extent of variations and the ability to resolve them in subsequent steps are impacted by the amplitude, duration, and frequency of the disturbance. Identification of tolerable ranges for these parameters and establishing appropriate acceptance criteria will enable the development of an effective strategy for managing disturbances.\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_Q13_Step4_Guideline_2022_1116'

What are the components\n\nand composition of the final product? What is the function of each excipient?\n\nWhat is the physical description of the drug product? What are the available strengths, route of administration, release mechanism, as well as any other distinguishable characteristics?\n\nAn example of an appropriate response would be - ""The proposed drug product is available as an oval, round, immediate-release, aqueous film coated tablet in three strengths (5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg).""\n\nWhat is the function of each component in the drug product?\n\nList in tabular format (see example table below). Include all components used in the manufacture of the drug product (such as solvents and processing aids) even if removed during processing. Indicate which components are compendial. For each strength, list the quantitative composition of the finished dosage form. Excipient grade should be discussed in 2.3.P.4 (Control of Excipients). The total amount of material in pilot and production batches goes in 2.3.P.3 (Manufacture).\n\nExample\n\nIngredient Function Weight/Tablet % (w/w)\n\n[Drug substance] Active\n\n[Excipient] Solvent* N/A N/A\n\nTotal weight\n\nRemoved during the manufacturing process.\n\nDoes this product contain multiple processing steps?\n\nFor example: tablet cores or beads.\n\nWhat is the composition of the significant intermediates?\n\nAre there any overages in the formulation of the product? What is the justification for the overages?\n\nIdentify and justify any formulation overages that appear in the final product. Manufacturing overages should be discussed in 2.3.P.3.\n\nFor animal generic drug products, note that, in general, the only acceptable justification for an overage in the final drug product formulation is the demonstration of a similar overage in the reference listed drug (RLD).\n\n2.3.4 Conclusions\n\nDoes this product contain any materials with sizes in the nanometer ranges (<1 (\\mu)m)?\n\nFor generic products, do the differences between this formulation and the reference listed new animal drug (RLNAD) present potential concerns with respect to therapeutic equivalence?\n\nDescribe any efforts taken to ensure the therapeutic equivalence to the RLD. If known, provide the formulation of the RLD.\n\n2.3.5.2 Pharmaceutical Development\n\nWhile the inclusion of a Pharmaceutical Development Report (PDR) is optional, a PDR provides a brief summary of the final drug product development. CVM considers the information in the PDR, such as a description of the research that led to the evolution and selection of components, formulation, specifications, etc. of the final product, very helpful in demonstrating process understanding. This may include information about alternative formulations that were tried and deemed not to be optimal. Important aspects of a useful PDR are described below. It is important to note that a PDR is most informative to CVM in describing why a component or a process was chosen.\n\nThe studies included in a PDR are distinct from the routine control tests conducted according to specifications, such as release or stability testing. Summary results from studies or references to relevant literature should be included in the PDR or as an attachment to the PDR.\n\n2.3.5.2 Components of the Product\n\nApplicants should explain the rationale behind the selection of the components of the drug product--the drug substance and the excipients used.\n\n2.3.5.1 Drug Substance\n\nWhich properties or physical chemical characteristics of the drug substance affect drug product development, manufacture, or performance?\n\nWhat are the key physicochemical characteristics of the drug substance selected, in particular those that can influence the performance or manufacture of the final drug product?\n\nPhysicochemical properties that may be of interest and concern include water content, solubility, particle size distribution, pH, pKa, or the existence of polymorphic forms. If the drug substance has been structurally modified from the active moiety, such as made into a salt, the applicant should discuss whether the modification will impact the manufacture and/or the quality of the drug product.\n\nAre any of the key physicochemical properties determined to potentially influence the performance of the drug product? What studies were conducted to establish and to justify the drug substance specification?\n\nWhat drug substance(s) (including grade) was selected?\n\nIs there more than one drug substance in your product? What evidence supports the compatibility of the drug substances with each other?\n\nIf there is any incompatibility identified, justify the use of the drug substance with summary data, such as stability data or studies examining the impurities that arise from the interaction of the drug substance and the additional drug substance.\n\n2.3.P.2.1.2 Excipients\n\nWhat evidence supports compatibility between the excipients and the drug substance?\n\nWhat compatibility screening was performed during the pre-formulation stage?\n\nDiscuss the issue of compatibility of the drug substance with the excipients in the drug product. The compatibility study should include a simulation of the most extreme conditions that the drug substance and excipients will be subjected to during the actual manufacturing process. The design and results of the screening should be provided and discussed.\n\nWere any excipients found to be incompatible with the drug substance or with each other? Which excipients were found to be incompatible, and how was their selection justified?\n\nAny excipients which were found to be incompatible with the drug substance should be identified. The selection of the excipients used in the final formulation should be justified using the results of the compatibility screening.\n\nFor generic products, were any attempts made to determine what excipients were used in the pioneer product?\n\nIf the excipients in the pioneer product being copied are not defined, describe attempts made to determine what they were. If identification was confirmed, and a decision was made to intentionally use different excipients, provide justification for using the ones ultimately chosen for use in the final formulation. If identification was not attempted or was not possible, provide rationale for the excipients chosen.\n\n2.3.P.2.2 Drug Product\n\nWhat attributes should the drug product possess?\n\nAre there critical attributes that ensure product quality for the intended use and route of administration? Describe the critical attributes.\n\nThis section should identify and describe the formulation and process attributes (critical parameters) that may influence batch reproducibility, product performance and drug product quality.\n\nIs the drug product an immediate release or controlled release? Describe the release mechanism.\n\nThe specific release mechanism should be described and the development studies leading to the final release mechanism should be summarized. The type of information may vary substantially since the development of release mechanisms will vary between different formulations, such as coated tablets versus in-situ forming gels.\n\nHow was the drug product designed to have these attributes?\n\nFor release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n\nFor example, does it use an enteric coating or slow release matrix.\n\nAre any overages used in the drug product? Why is an overage necessary?\n\nThe applicant should describe and justify the amount of the overage if needed to ensure dose delivery. This overage should also be included in the composition and batch formula.\n\nAre there any special design features of the product?\n\nA rationale should be given for these design features to support their appropriateness.\n\nWere alternative formulations or mechanisms investigated?\n\nWhat formulations were used to produce the clinical batches for safety and effectiveness studies?\n\nAre there differences in formulation between the clinical or pilot batches and that proposed for commercial batches? Describe the different formulations.\n\nApplicants should provide the complete list of formulations in the evolution of the final formulation. The rationale or justification should be given for differences in formulations between the commercial and clinical or stability batches. This information may include comparative in vitro or in vivo studies to link the clinical formulation(s) with the proposed commercial formulation.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #234 Question-Based Review for the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Technical Section of Animal Drug Applications'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: It is recommended that these guidelines should also be applied to products that are already being marketed, for example, upon re-registration or upon re-evaluation.\n\n2 Scope of these guidelines\n\nThese guidelines apply to new and existing APIs and address information to be submitted in original and subsequent applications for marketing authorization of their related FPP for human use. These guidelines may generally apply to stability testing for biologists; however, there are additional requirements specific to such products and further guidance can be found in ICH guideline Q5C [2].\n\n3 General principles\n\nThe purpose of stability testing is to provide evidence of how the quality of an API or FPP varies with time under the influence of a variety of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and light. The stability testing programme also includes the study of product-related factors that influence its quality, for example, interaction of the API with excipients, container-closure systems and packaging materials. In fixed-dose combination FPPs (fixed-dose combinations (FDCs)) the interaction between two or more APIs also has to be considered.\n\nAs a result of stability testing, a retest period for the API (in exceptional cases, for example, for unstable APIs, a shelf life is given) or a shelf life for the FPP can be established and storage conditions can be recommended. An API can be considered unstable (under the conditions studied, in a particular type of packaging, etc.) when a significant change is observed.\n\nVarious analyses have been done to identify suitable testing conditions for WHO Member States based on climatic data, to enable each Member State to decide on long-term (real-time) stability testing conditions. Those Member States that have notified WHO of the long-term stability testing conditions they require when requesting a marketing authorization are listed in ""Long-term stability testing conditions as identified by WHO Member States"".2\n\nFootnote 2: http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/quality_assurance/ StabilityConditionsTable2UupdatedMarch2015,pdf?ua=1, accessed 1 March 2017.\n\n2 Guidelines\n\nActive pharmaceutical ingredient\n\n2.1.1 General\n\nInformation on the stability of the API is an integral part of the systematic approach to stability evaluation. Potential attributes to be studied during stability testing of an API are listed in the examples of testing parameters (Appendix 1). The selection of potential attributes and time points to be tested should be justified.\n\nThe retest period or shelf life assigned to the API by the API manufacturer should be derived from stability testing data.\n\n2.1.2 Stress testing\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1F_Stability_Guideline_WHO_2018']",['Per ICH Q1A(R2) the applicant should provide data on three batches of all dosage forms including modified release dosage forms.

A measurable amount is an amount that exceeds the amount that can be declared as ""zero"" in the nutrition label of conventional foods, as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(c). If present in a measurable amount, trans fat must be listed on a separate line underneath the listing of saturated fat by January 1, 2006.\n\nCalories from saturated fat and the amount of polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, sugar alcohol, and other carbohydrate may be declared, but they must be declared when a claim is made about them.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) (see 68 FR 41434 at 41505, July 11, 3003)\n\nMust I declare vitamins and minerals (other than vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron) listed in 21 CFR 101. 9(c)(8)(iv) and (c)(9)?\n\nNo. You are only required to declare them when they are added to the product for purposes of supplementation, or if you make a claim about them.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\n8 Am I required to list any other nutrients if I make a claim about them?\n\nYes. When you make a claim about calories from saturated fat, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated fat, sugar alcohol, monounsaturated fat, other carbohydrate, and soluble fiber, you must list that nutrient.\nYes. Dietary ingredients for which no daily values have been established must be listed by their common or usual names when they are present in a dietary supplement.

You must list the dietary ingredients that have Daily Values in the same order as for the labels of conventional foods, except that vitamins, minerals and electrolytes are grouped together. This results in the following order for vitamins and minerals:\n\nVitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, calcium, iron, phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, and potassium.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)\n\nMay I use synonyms for my dietary ingredients?\n\nYes. You may use the following synonyms in parentheses after your dietary ingredients: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), thiamin (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folate (folacin or folic acid), and calories (energy). Alternatively, you may list ""folic acid"" or ""folacin"" without parentheses in place of ""folate."" You may also express energy content parenthetically in kiljoules immediately following the caloric content.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)(2)\n\n23.8.25.2.37.7221 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 101.9(c)\n\nPercent Of Daily Value (% DV)\n\nWhat is the % DV?\n\nThe % DV is the percent of the Daily Value (i.e., Reference Daily Intakes or Daily Reference Value) of a dietary ingredient that is in a serving of the product.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)\n\nDo I need to list the % DV on my label?\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: The ""Supplement Facts"" nutrition information (referred to as a panel) must be enclosed in a box by using hairlines. The title, ""Supplement Facts,"" must be larger than all other print in the panel and, unless impractical, must be set full width of the panel. The title and all headings must be bolded to distinguish them from other information.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n36. How must I present the information in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n\nYou must present all information using the following:\n\na. A single easy-to-read type style;\n\nb. All black or one color type, printed on a white or neutral contrasting background, whenever practical;3. Upper- and lowercase letters, except that you may use all uppercase lettering on small packages (i.e., packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches); d. At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text); and e. Letters that do not touch.\n37. What are the type size requirements for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n\nExcept as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must set information other than the title, headings, and footnotes in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. You also must use a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label for the title ""Supplement Facts."" You may set the column headings and footnotes in type no smaller than 6 point type. See the section on ""Special Labeling Provisions"" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nMust I use hairlines in the Supplement Facts panel?\n\nExcept for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must use a hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text to separate each dietary ingredient from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it. FDA has provided an exception for certain packages with space constraints. See the section on ""Special Labeling Provisions"" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nHow closely must I follow the ""Examples of graphic enhancements used by the FDA"" in appendix B to Part 101?\n\nYou are not required to follow Appendix B to Part 101. Appendix B and its specifications are a model, which FDA has suggested in the interest of uniformity of presentation. For example, 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(i) requires the use of an ""easy-to-read"" type style, not specifically Helvetica type, as suggested in Appendix B.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)(9)\n\nHow do I provide nutrition labeling when my product contains two or more packets of supplements (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening)?\n\nYou may present the information for each packet (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening) in an individual nutrition label or you may use an aggregate nutrition label. For two packets, this would consist of five columns. List all of the dietary ingredients in the first column. List the amounts and percents of the morning packet in the second and third columns and similar information for the evening packet in the fourth and fifth columns (see the illustration of aggregate nutrition labeling in 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iii)).\n\nCompliance\n\nWhat kind of samples will FDA collect to determine compliance with 21 CFR 101.36?\n\nFDA will collect a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller. FDA will randomly select these packages.\n\nWhat if it is not technically feasible for me to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements?\n\nFDA may permit you to use an alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9). If your firm needs such special allowances, you must make your request in writing to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(f)(2)\n\nMust dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?\n\nFor dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value.\n\nExemptions\n\nWhat are the circumstances in which my dietary supplement products would be exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements? Your dietary supplement product is not required to have a ""Supplement Facts"" panel if: a. Your firm is a small business that has not more than $50,000 gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers or not more than $500,000 per year from total sales in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1); b. You sell less than 100,000 units of the product annually, your firm has fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(2) andyou file an annual notification with FDA as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(18)(iv); or c. You ship the product in bulk form, do not distribute it to consumers in such form, and you supply it for use in the manufacture of other dietary supplements in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(3). The two exemptions for small businesses and low-volume products (a. and b. above) are available to you only if your products\' labels bear no claims or other nutrition information.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(h)(1) - (3)\n\nSpecial Labeling Provisions\n\nWhat are small packages?\n\nSmall packages are those packages having less than 12 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)\n\nWhat is the telephone provision for small packages?\n\nIn lieu of a ""Supplement Facts"" panel, you may print labels for small packages with a telephone number or address that consumers can use to obtain nutrition information. You may use a telephone number or an address in place of the ""Supplement Facts"" panel only if you place no claims or other nutrition information on the product label.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size that I may use for small packages?\n\nYou may use a type size no smaller than 4-5 point for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on the labels of small packages.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(i)\n\nMay I use a tabular or linear format for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on a small package?\n\nYes. You may use a tabular format on small packages. You also may present ""Supplement Facts"" information in a linear (i.e., string) fashion if the label will not accommodate the ""Supplement Facts"" panel in a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j) (13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display.)\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n\nWhat are intermediate-sized packages?\n\nIntermediate-sized packages are those packages having from 12 to 40 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(ii)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size for intermediate-sized packages?The ""Supplement Facts"" panel on the labels of intermediate-sized packages must use type size no smaller than 6 point, except that type no smaller than 4-5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches that list more than 16 dietary ingredients. Also, 4-5 point type may be used on packages with less than 20 square inches that list more than 8 dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the type size used in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on an inner container may be as small as needed to accommodate all required information if the ""Supplement Facts"" on the outer container meets these type size requirements.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv)\n51. May I use a tabular or linear format for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on an intermediate-sized package? You may use a tabular format on an intermediate-sized package if the package shape or size cannot accommodate vertical columns. You may use a linear format if the label will not accommodate a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n52. May I abbreviate on the labels of intermediate- sized packages? You may use the abbreviations in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B) in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel for small and intermediate-sized packages, e.g, ""Serv size"" for ""Serving Size"" and ""Servings"" for ""Servings Per Container.""\n\n21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B)\n53. Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV. Nutrition Labeling'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: How Do the Nutrient Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels Differ?\n\nBoth the content and format of the Supplement Facts label have been updated to correspond to the Nutrition Facts label, wherever possible. However, there are still some differences between the two. On the Supplement Facts label, information on calories and serving size was not made more prominent through increased type size, as it has been on the Nutrition Facts label. While the percentage of the RDI for protein for foods purported to be for infants through 12 months of age is allowed on Nutrition Facts labels, this declaration must be omitted for Supplement Facts labels (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)).\n\nIn addition, the new ordering for vitamins and minerals on the Supplement Facts label is as follows: vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate and folic acid, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, choline, calcium, iron,phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, potassium, and fluoride (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(B)).\n\nHas Nutrient Compliance or the Level of Variance Allowed Changed?\n\nThere are still two classes of nutrients for compliance purposes. Class I covers those added nutrients in fortified or fabricated foods (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(i)), and Class II nutrients are those that are naturally occurring, or indigenous, nutrients (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(ii)). For compliance purposes, if both Class I and Class II nutrients are present in the final food product, then the total amount of the nutrient (both indigenous and exogenous) is subject to class I requirements.\n\nThe updated rule does not change the level of variances allowed in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and 101.9(g)(5), but the rule also now includes soluble fiber and insoluble fiber in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and added sugars in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Therefore, 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) now states that a food with a label declaration of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat will be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the FD&C Act, unless the nutrient content of the composite is formulated to be at least equal to the declared value for the vitamin, mineral, protein, or dietary fiber meeting the definition of a Class I nutrient (potassium has been removed), or the nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to 80 percent of the declared value for the vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber meeting the definition of a Class II nutrient (potassium and ""other carbohydrate"" have been removed). Our regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5), state that a food with a label declaration of calories, sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium will be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the FD&C Act if the nutrient content of the composite is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label. Reasonable excesses of soluble fiber, insoluble fiber and sugar alcohols, and reasonable deficiencies of added sugars are also now acceptable within current good manufacturing practices.\n\nWhich Version of the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International Should be Used?\n\nThe final rule now incorporates by reference the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International, 19th edition (2012) (21 CFR 101.9(l)(1)(i)).\n\nVIII. How Do I Comply with the Formatting Requirements?\n\nThere are required formats for Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels. We strongly recommend that the nutrition information be presented using the graphic specifications below (see also Appendix B to 21 CFR part 101 and Ref. 8).\n\nVIII.1 How Do I Comply with the Standard Version of the Nutrition Facts Label?\n\nFigures 3 through 5 reflect what a standard vertical Nutrition Facts label must look like (see 21 CFR 101.9(d)(12)). This format is to be used except on foods where the tabular display is\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]\n\n11 How Has the Formatting Changed for the ""Nutrition Facts"" Header on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe ""Nutrition Facts"" heading must be in a type size no smaller than all other print size in the nutrition label, except for the numerical information for ""Calories,"" which according to 21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii) must be in a type size no smaller than 22 point for the standard label (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)). It must be set the full width of the nutrient information, unless impractical (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)). It is not required to be set the full width of the nutrient information for labels presented according to the following formats: tabular display, aggregate display, tabular dual column display, tabular display for small or intermediate-sized packages, and linear display for small or intermediate-sized packages (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)).\n\nA thin horizontal line (i.e., a hairline rule) is to be inserted directly beneath the Nutrition Facts heading, before the servings per container statement (except on the linear display discussed below) (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(v)).\n\nFigure 5: Standard Vertical, Mandatory and Voluntary Nutrients\n\n11.2 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declaration of Calories on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe type size has increased for ""Calories"" and the numeric value of ""Calories."" On the standard vertical display of the Nutrition Facts label, the numeric value of ""Calories"" must be listed in a type size no smaller than 22 point, as well as in bold or extra bold type highlighting (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). The word ""Calories"" must be listed in a type size no smaller than 16 point, as well as in bold or extra bold type highlighting (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 3 through 5.\n\n3 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declarations of Serving Size and Servings Per Container on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe "" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container"" declaration now immediately follows the ""Nutrition Facts"" heading and must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i)).\n\nBelow "" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container"" is the declaration of ""Serving size."" ""Serving size"" is to be highlighted in bold or extra bold and in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(ii)). While the ""Serving size"" declaration is still left-justified, the corresponding numerical value is now right-justified on Nutrition Facts labels only (not on Supplement Facts labels), provided that adequate space is available (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(ii)). If the ""Serving size"" declaration does not fit in the allocated space, then a type size no smaller than 8 point may be used on packages of any size.\n\nFor further information on the updates made to the Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed and Serving Size regulations, please reference the Small Entity Compliance Guide entitled ""Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments: Guidance for Industry"" (Ref. 9), as well as the final guidance entitled ""Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Size-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics"" (Ref. 10).\n\n4 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declaration of Vitamins and Minerals on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nNutrient information for vitamins and minerals (except sodium) are to be separated from information regarding other nutrients by a bar (21 CFR 101.9(d)(8)). They may be listed vertically (Figures 3 and 5) or horizontally (Figure 4). If listed horizontally in two columns, then vitamin D and calcium should be listed on the first line, and iron and potassium should be listed on the second line (21 CFR 101.9(d)(8)). Nutrient information must be in a type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)).\n\n11.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhile ""Calories from fat"" can no longer be declared, ""Calories from saturated fat"" is still allowed (21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(ii)). When declared, it is to be indented under the statement of calories and must be in a type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(5)).\n\n11.4 Where, and How, Do I Declare ""Added Sugars"" on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe statement ""Includes \'X\' g Added Sugars"" must be used to declare added sugars content (except on packages of single ingredient sugars), and this statement must be indented directly beneath the listing for ""Total Sugars"" on the Nutrition Facts label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The \'X\' will be filled in with the respective added sugar content (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). In Appendix B to 21 CFR 101, we illustrate our recommendation to shorten the length of the hairline requirement between total sugars and added sugars to help denote that ""added sugars"" are a subcomponent of ""total sugars."" As mentioned above, a DRV has been established for added sugars for most population groups, and the % Daily Value declaration is required as well (21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii)). Added sugars must also be declared on the Supplement Facts label (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAdded sugars content must be expressed to the nearest gram, except in the following circumstances:\n\nThe statement ""Contains less than 1 gram"" or, alternatively, ""less than 1 gram"" may be used if a serving contains less than 1 gram added sugars; or\n\nThe added sugars content may be expressed as zero if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram.\n\nSee 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016 (81 FR 33742), FDA (we) published a final rule entitled ""Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels"" (""the final rule""). The final rule amends the labeling regulations for conventional foods and dietary supplements to provide updated nutrition information on the label to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices and set a compliance date of July 26, 2018, for manufacturers with $10 million or more in annual food sales, and July 26, 2019, for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales. We subsequently extended the compliance dates to January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021, respectively (83 FR 19619). We have prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28). This guidance document restates in plain language the revisions made in the final rule and is intended to help small entities comply with the requirements established in 21 CFR 101.9, 101.30, and 101.36.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in our guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nIn the remainder of this guidance, ""you"" and ""I"" refer to food manufacturers that are subject to the rule. Many answers in this guidance are followed by citations to show where a specific requirement can be found in either the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) or Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nII Who Is Subject to the Rule?\n\nYou are subject to the rule if you manufacture food that is subject to our nutrition labeling requirements. The nutrition labeling requirements apply to both conventional foods under 21 CFR 101.9(a) and dietary supplements under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(6).\n\nIII What Foods Are Covered by the Rule?\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for the General Food Supply?\n\nYes. Foods for the general food supply are foods eaten by persons 4 years of age and older.\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for Infants and Young Children 1 Through 3 Years of Age?\n\nYes. Foods, other than infant formula, represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age are subject to nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(j)(5)(i)). Manufacturers of foods represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months and/or children 1 through 3 years of age must use the Reference Daily Intakes (RDIs) and Daily Reference Values (DRVs) that are specified for this intended group when calculating percent Daily Values (DVs) for labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)). The previous categories of ""infants"" (or ""infants 7 to 12 months"") and ""children less than 4 years"" have been changed to ""infants through 12 months"" and ""children 1 through 3 years of age"" throughout 21 CFR 101.9.\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for Pregnant Women and Lactating Women?\n\nYes. Manufacturers of foods represented or purported to be specifically for pregnant women and lactating women must use the RDIs and DRVs that are specified for this intended group when calculating percent DVs for labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)).\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Dietary Supplements?\n\nYes. Section 201(f) of the FD&C Act defines ""food"" as: ""(1) articles used for food or drink for man or other animals, (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article."" Further, section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act explains that dietary supplements are deemed to be foods within the meaning of the FD&C Act except for the purposes of sections 201(g) (definition of ""drug"") and 417 (reportable food registry) of the FD&C Act. Nutrition labeling information for food must be provided for all products intended for human consumption and offered for sale, unless an exemption is provided (21 CFR 101.9(a)). As dietary supplements fall under the definition of ""food,"" they are therefore subject to nutrition labeling. Specific nutrition labeling requirements and guidelines for dietary supplements can be found in 21 CFR 101.36.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNaturally-occurring sugars found in whole fruits and vegetables or dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them.\n\nThe amount of added sugars declared on the label should never exceed the amount of total sugars on the label.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(i) Do Honey, Maple Syrup, and Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n\nIn the Federal Register of June 20, 2019 (84 FR 28726), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled ""The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products,"" which provides clarity on the labeling of added sugars for such products (Ref. 1). In that guidance, we discuss section 12516 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (""the Farm Bill""), which states that the food labeling requirements cannot require the declaration ""Includes Xg Added Sugars"" in a serving of these single-ingredient products. While these products are not required to have this declaration of the gram amount of added sugars, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet, so the percent DV for added sugars must still be included consistent with 21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii). We stated that we intend to exercise enforcement discretion by permitting the use of the ""+"" symbol immediately following the percent DV declaration for added sugars on packages and containers of single-ingredient sugars and syrups. This symbol would lead to a footnote inside the Nutrition Facts label, explaining the amount of added sugars that one serving of the product contributes to the diet, as well as the contribution of a serving of the product toward the percent DV for added sugars. This symbol and footnote are not required; however, we encourage you to use them.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(ii) Do Added Sugars in Dried Cranberry Products and Cranberry Beverage Products Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels'

This guidance document restates in plain language the legal requirements set forth in a regulation concerning labeling claims for dietary supplements. This is a Level 2 guidance document published for immediate implementation in accordance with FDA\'s good guidance practices (21 CFR 10.115). The regulations are binding and have the force and effect of law. However, this guidance document represents the agency\'s current thinking on this subject and does not, itself, create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute and regulations.\n\nSummary\n\nOn January 6, 2000, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a final rule in the Federal Register defining the types of statements that may be used on the label and in the labeling of dietary supplements without prior review by the agency (65 FR 1000) (http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/(\\sim)lrd/fro00106.html ). Called structure/function claims, these claims are statements that describe the effect a dietary supplement may have on the structure or function of the body. The regulation also provides criteria to assist you in determining when a statement about a dietary supplement is a disease claim, that is, a claim to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease. Disease claims require prior approval by FDA and may be made only for products that are approved drug products or for foods under separate legal provisions that apply to claims called ""health claims.""\n\nThis guidance discusses only the requirements that apply to determining whether a claim is a structure/function claim or a disease claim. It should be noted that other regulations also cover labeling and packaging requirements for dietary supplements. These requirementswere published as final rules in the Federal Registers of September 23, 1997 (62 FR 49826), June 5, 1998 (63 FR 30615), and Jan 15, 1997 (62 FR 2218)\n\n(https://www.federalregister.gov/ (https://www.federalregister.gov/)) (see Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) Parts 101 and 111).(1).\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\nThe regulation added $101.93(f) and (g) to Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 101. These two sections define what types of claims are structure/function claims and what types of claims are disease claims. In addition to these definitions, the regulation includes criteria that are intended to assist you in determining whether a particular statement is or is not a disease claim. Finally, the preamble to this rule clarifies several legal issues that are important to understand if you use structure/function claims on the labels or in the labeling of your products. They are restated below.\n\nBasic Legal Requirements for Structure/Function Claims. What are structure/function claims? The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) added section 403(r)(6) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)2. This section of the law states that a dietary supplement may bear certain statements on its label or in its labeling if the claim meets certain requirements. Section 101.93(f) simply restates part of the definition of the types of claims that may be made under section 403(r)(6) of the FD&C Act. Section 101.93(f) reads: (f) Permitted structure/function statements. Dietary supplement labels or labeling may, subject to the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, bear statements that describe the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans or that characterize the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, provided that such statements are not disease claims under paragraph (g) of this section. If the label or labeling of a product marketed as a dietary supplement bears a disease claim as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, the product will be subject to regulation as a drug unless the claim is an authorized health claim for which the product qualifies. Are there other claims that can be made for dietary supplements under this section of the law? Yes. Section 403(r)(6) also states that dietary supplements can use claims about nutrient deficiency diseases (for example, vitamin C and scurvy) or that describe the effect of the dietary supplement on general well-being. What requirements must I meet to make any of these types of claims for my dietary supplement?There are three requirements you must meet. First, the law says you can make these claims if you have substantiation that the claims are truthful and not misleading. You must have this substantiation before you make the claims. Second, you must notify FDA that you are using the claim within 30 days of first marketing your product. Third, the claim must include a mandatory disclaimer statement that is provided for in the law.\nWhere can I find information on the mandatory disclaimer and the notification I need to send in?\n\nWe have published regulations that describe exactly what the disclaimer must say and what you must include in your notification to us and where you must send it in the September 23, 1997 Federal Register (62 FR 49859 and 49883, respectively). These requirements can be found in 21 CFR 101.93(b) through (e) and 21 CFR 101.93(a), respectively.\nB. When and What You Must Do To Comply With the New Regulation.**\n\nWhen does this rule become effective?\n\nThe rule became effective on February 7, 2000, for any products marketed for the first time after publication of the final rule or for any new claims made for an existing product after publication of the final rule (i.e., new claims made after January 6, 2000).\nIf I have existing inventory, do I need to re-label it now?\n\nLarge businesses had until January 7, 2001, to bring existing claims on products into compliance. FDA granted this period for firms to use up their label inventories. Small businesses had until July 7, 2001, to bring existing claims on products into compliance. Any existing inventory not used up after these dates would need to be relabeled.\nC. How Do I Determine if a Claim is a Structure/Function Claim or a Disease Claim?\n\nIt may not be possible always to draw a bright line between structure/function and disease claims. You should look at the objective evidence in your labeling to assess whether a claim explicitly or implicitly is a disease claim. For example, a statement may not mention a disease but may refer to identifiable characteristic signs or symptoms of a disease such that the intended use of the product to treat or prevent the disease may be inferred. It is important that you keep in mind two things. First, the context of the statement, decided from information on the label and in other labeling, will determine if the statement is considered to be a disease claim. Second, dietary supplements may not bear disease claims, explicit or implied, unless the claim has undergone premarket review by FDA and has been authorized or approved under the rules for health claims or drugs, as appropriate. To assist you in deciding whether a claim is or isn\'t a disease claim, the new regulation contains a definition for disease, and then includes 10 criteria intended to help clarify the types of claims that may be made for dietary supplements without prior authorization or approval by FDA. We are providing that disease definition and an explanation of the 10 criteria below.\n\nWhat is the definition of a disease?Section 101.93(g) defines disease as:\n\n...damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition.\n\nWhat are the criteria for determining if a statement is a disease claim?\n\nThere are 10 criteria in the rule that are useful in determining if a statement is a disease claim.\n\nCriterion 1: Claims an effect on a disease or class of diseases (see section E, starting on page 1012 of the preamble to the rule).\n\nA statement is a disease claim if it mentions a specific disease or class of diseases. For example, a claim that a product is ""protective against the development of cancer"" or ""reduces the pain and stiffness associated with arthritis"" would be a disease claim.\n\nA statement also is a disease claim if it implies that it has an effect on a specific disease or class of diseases by using descriptions of the disease state. Examples of implied disease claims are ""relieves crushing chest pain (angina),"" ""improves joint mobility and reduces inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis),"" or ""relief of bronchospasm (asthma).""\n\nCriterion 2: Claims an effect on characteristic signs or symptoms of disease using scientific or lay terminology (see section F, starting on page 1015 of the preamble to the rule).\n\nHow can I tell if a particular claimed effect is a sign or symptom of a specific disease?\n\nThe test of whether claimed effects are characteristic signs or symptoms depends on 2 questions: (1) Is the condition, to which the signs and symptoms refer, related to a disease; and (2) are the signs and symptoms referred to in the labeling characteristic of the disease and permit the inference that the product is intended to affect that disease.\n\nDoes it matter if I don\'t use every sign or symptom of a condition or if I use layman\'s terms instead of technical language?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide on Structure:Function Claims'

This information would ordinarily be expected in a marketing application. In general, it is preferable to include both nongeriatric and geriatric patients in the same study(ies), which can facilitate observation of age-related differences. In some cases, a separate study in the geriatric population can be preferable. Every effort should be made to include geriatric patients using concomitant therapies and with co-morbidities in the premarketing clinical development program. In some cases, enrollment of these patients can be challenging and it could be appropriate to collect data postmarketing. However, the adequacy of, and the need for, data in these patients should be considered during drug development and discussed in the marketing application submission. Where enrollment of geriatric patients has been insufficient despite the efforts of the applicant, a specific plan to collect data postmarketing should be discussed during development and presented in the marketing application. Information relevant to the geriatric patient population, including any limitations, should be reflected in the product labeling.\n\nQ5: Are there concerns related to the data specific to the geriatric population that could be considered in the planning of the clinical studies?\n\nDepending on the mechanism of action of the drug and/or the characteristics of the disease, certain specific adverse events and age-related efficacy endpoints should be actively sought in the geriatric population, e.g., effects on cognitive function, balance and falls, urinary incontinence or retention, weight loss, and sarcopenia. This may require specific testing, e.g., for cognitive function. Applicants should also refer to disease specific guidances for specific recommendations concerning the evaluation of both efficacy and safety in geriatric patients.\n\nQ6: In light of recent advances in the field of pharmacokinetics and assessment of drug-drug interactions since the ICH E7 guidance was established, what studies should be considered when developing a drug that will be used in geriatric patients?\n\nThe pharmacokinetics in geriatric patients (over the entire spectrum of the geriatric patient population) should be evaluated to identify age-related differences that are not explained by other factors such as reduced renal function or weight differences. The potential influence of impaired renal/hepatic function, as well as potential drug interactions, is often assessed in studies with nongeriatric subjects. Population pharmacokinetic analysis could provide the requested data if a sufficient number of patients in different age ranges (including patients (\\geq)65 and (\\geq)75 years) are included in the clinical trials. The applicability of population pharmacokinetics is dependent on several factors, e.g. the representation of the target population, the pharmacokinetics of the drug, dosing regimens, and analytical requirements. A specific pharmacokinetic study comparing nongeriatric and geriatric subjects in the same study (matched for relevant covariates, e.g., weight, sex) could achieve the same goals. More details on the pharmacokinetic approach (population pharmacokinetics, the appropriate design of a specific pharmacokinetic study) and assessment of drug-drug interactions can be discussed with the regulatory agencies.\n--------------------\nContext title: E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations; Geriatrics; Questions and Answers'

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n--------------------\nContext: It is important to ensure that the experiences, perspectives, needs, and priorities of relevant stakeholders relating to the development and evaluation of the drug throughout its lifecycle are captured and meaningfully incorporated into drug development planning.\n\nClinical development may also feature requirements for co-development of validated biomarkers, diagnostic testing, or devices that facilitate the safe and effective use of a drug.\n\nThe types of studies that can contribute to drug development are described in subsections IV.2 (4.2) and IV.3 (4.3) and summarized in the Annex.\n\nQuality of Investigational Medicinal Product (4.1)\n\nEnsuring adequate quality and characterization of physicochemical properties of investigational medicinal product is an important element in planning a drug development program and is addressed in ICH and regional quality guidances. More extensive characterization may be required for complex or biological products. Formulations should be well characterized in the drug development plan, including information on bioavailability, wherever feasible, and should be appropriate for the stage of drug development and the targeted patient population. Age-appropriate formulation development may be a consideration when clinical studies are planned in pediatric populations (ICH guidances for industry E11 Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population (December 2000) and E11(R1) Addendum: Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population (April 2018)).\n\nEvaluation of the quality of a drug may extend to devices required for its administration or a companion diagnostic to identify the targeted population.\n\nChanges in a product during development should be supported by comparability data to ensure the ability to interpret study results across the development program. This includes establishing links between formulations through bioequivalence studies or other means.\n\nNonclinical Studies (4.2)\n\nGuidance on nonclinical safety studies is provided in the ICH guidance for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals (January 2010), in ICH Safety (S) Guidances and related question-and-answer documents, as well as in regional guidance. The nonclinical assessment usually includes toxicology, carcinogenicity, immunogenicity, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and other evaluations to support clinical studies (and may encompass evidence generated in in vivo and in vitro models, and by modelling and simulation). The scope of nonclinical studies, and their timing with respect to clinical studies, depend on a variety of factors that inform further development, such as the drug's chemical or molecular properties; pharmacological basis of principal effects (mechanism of action); route(s) of administration; absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; physiological effects on organ systems; dose/concentration-response relationships; metabolites; and duration of action and use. Use of the drug in special populations (e.g., pregnant or breast-feeding people, children) may require additional nonclinical assessments. Guidance for nonclinical safety studies to support human clinical studies in special populations should be reviewed (see, e.g., the ICH guidances for industry S5(R3) Detection of Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity for Human Pharmaceuticals (May 2021), S11 Nonclinical Safety Testing in Support of Development of Pediatric Pharmaceuticals (May 2021), and M3(R2).\n\nAssessment of the preclinical characteristics, including physiological and toxicological effects of the drug, serves to inform clinical study design and planned use in humans. Before proceeding to studies in humans, there should be sufficient nonclinical information to support initial human doses and duration of exposure.\n\nClinical Studies (4.3)\n\nClinical drug development, defined as studying the drug in humans, is conducted in a sequence that builds on knowledge accumulated from nonclinical and previous clinical studies. The structure of the drug development program is shaped by many considerations and comprised of studies with different objectives, designs, and dependencies. The Annex provides an illustrative list of example studies and their objectives. Although clinical drug development is often described as consisting of four temporal phases (phases 1 through 4), it is important to appreciate that the phase concept is a description and not a requirement, and that the phases of drug development may overlap or be combined.\n\nTo develop new drugs efficiently, it is essential to identify their characteristics in the early stages of development and to plan an appropriate development program based on this profile. Initial clinical studies may be more limited in size and duration to provide an early evaluation of short-term safety and tolerability, as well as proof of concept of efficacy. These studies may provide pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and other information needed to choose a suitable dosage range and/or administration schedule to inform further clinical studies. As more information is known about the drug, clinical studies may expand in size and duration, may include more diverse study populations, and may include more secondary endpoints in addition to the primary measures of efficacy. Throughout development, new data may suggest the need for additional studies.\n\nThe use of biomarkers has the potential to facilitate the availability of safer and more effective drugs, to guide dose selection, and to enhance a drug's benefit-risk profile (see the ICH guidance for industry E16 Biomarkers Related to Drug or Biotechnology Product Development: Context, Structure, and Format of Qualification Submissions (August 2011)) and can be considered throughout drug development. Clinical studies may evaluate the use of biomarkers to better target patients more likely to benefit and less likely to experience adverse reactions, or as intermediate endpoints that could predict clinical response.\n\nThe following subsections describe the types of studies that typically span clinical development from the first studies in humans through late development and post-approval.\n\n1.1.1 Human Pharmacology (4.3.1)\n\nThe protection of study participants should always be the first priority when designing early clinical studies, especially for the initial administration of an investigational product to humans (usually referred to as phase 1). These studies may be conducted in healthy volunteer participants or in a selected population of patients who have the condition or the disease, depending on drug properties and the objectives of the development program.\n\nThese studies typically address one or a combination of the following aspects:\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nEstimation of Initial Safety and Tolerability (4.3.1.1)\n\nThe initial and subsequent administration of a drug to humans is usually intended to determine the tolerability of the dose range expected to be evaluated in later clinical studies and to determine the nature of adverse reactions that can be expected. These studies typically include both single- and multiple-dose administration.\n\nPharmacokinetics (4.3.1.2)\n\nCharacterization of a drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion continues throughout the development program, but the preliminary characterization is an essential early goal. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies are particularly important to assess the clearance of the drug and to anticipate possible accumulation of parent drug or metabolites, interactions with metabolic enzymes and transporters, and potential drug-drug interactions. Some PK studies are commonly conducted in later phases to answer more specialized questions. For orally administered drugs, the study of food effects on bioavailability is important to inform the dosing instructions in relation to food. Obtaining PK information in subpopulations with potentially different metabolism or excretion, such as patients with renal or hepatic impairment, geriatric patients, children, and ethnic subgroups, should be considered (ICH guidances for industry E4 Dose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration (November 1994), E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations: Geriatrics (August 1994), E11 and E11(R1) Addendum, and E5, respectively).\n\nPharmacodynamics and Early Measurement of Drug Activity (4.3.1.3)\n\nDepending on the drug and the endpoint of interest, pharmacodynamic (PD) studies and studies relating drug levels to response (PK/PD studies) may be conducted in healthy volunteer participants or in patients with the condition or disease. If there is an appropriate measure, PD data can provide early estimates of activity and efficacy and may guide the dosage and dose regimen in later studies.\n\nExploratory and Confirmatory Safety and Efficacy Studies (4.3.2)\n\nAfter initial clinical studies provide sufficient information on safety, clinical pharmacology, and dose, exploratory and confirmatory studies (usually referred to as phases 2 and 3, respectively) are conducted to further evaluate both the safety and efficacy of the drug. Depending on the nature of the drug and the patient population, this objective may be combined in a single or small number of studies. Exploratory and confirmatory studies may use a variety of study designs depending on the objective of the study.\n--------------------\nContext title: E8(R1) General Considerations for Clinical Studies""

Since the E7 guidance was made final, experiences implementing the guidance in the ICH regions have given rise to requests for clarification. This question and answer (Q&A) document is intended to clarify key issues. FDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Questions and Answers\n\nQ1: Why do we need an adequate representation of geriatric patients in the clinical database?\n\nA1: Geriatric patients can respond differently from younger patients to drug therapy in a number of ways, and such differences can be greater in patients 75 years and older: (a) The geriatric population has age-related physiological changes that can affect the pharmacokinetics of the drug and the pharmacodynamic response to the drug, both of which can influence the drug-response and the dose response relationship. (b) Geriatric patients are more prone to adverse effects since they often have comorbidities and are taking concomitant therapies that could interact with the investigational drug. The adverse effects can be more severe, or less tolerated, and have more serious consequences than in the nongeriatric population. With the increasing size of the geriatric population (including patients 75 and older) and in view of the recent advances in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics since the ICH E7 guidance was established in 1993, the importance of geriatric data (from the entire spectrum of the geriatric patient population) in a drug evaluation program has increased. Not all potential differences in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, disease-drug interactions, drug-drug interactions, and clinical response that can occur in the geriatric population can be predicted from nongeriatric populations, as the geriatric patients are far more likely to have multiple illnesses and to be receiving multiple drugs. Therefore, to assess the benefit/risk balance of a drug that will be used in the geriatric population, these patients should be appropriately represented in clinical trials. Q2: What should be taken into account when estimating an adequate representation of geriatric patients to be included in the clinical database?\n\nA2: It is very important to ensure, to the extent possible, that the population included in the clinical development program is representative of the target patient population. As stated in the current ICH E7 guidance, estimates of the prevalence of the disease to be treated by age or examination of the age distribution of usage for other drugs of the same class or for the same indication should be provided by the applicant. This will indicate the expected use of the drug and should influence the number of geriatric patients to be included in the marketing application. The current guidance states, ""for drugs used in diseases not unique to, but present in, the elderly, a minimum of 100 patients would usually allow detection of clinically important differences."" Given the increasing prevalence and the growing recognition of thecomplexity of the geriatric population, including concomitant therapies and co-morbidities, it would usually be appropriate to include more than 100 geriatric patients in the phase 2 and 3 databases and include patients over the entire spectrum of the geriatric patient population. In the marketing application, depending on the numbers of patients, data should be presented for various age groups (for example (<)65, 65-74, 75-84, and (\\geq) 85) to assess the consistency of the treatment effect and safety profile in these patients with the nongeriatric patient population. As single trials may not have sufficient numbers of geriatric patients to allow such analyses, these will often need to be carried out on pooled data. Any such analyses will need to consider consistency across studies.\n\nQ3: Are there any special patient populations or characteristics that are particularly important to address in the planning of the clinical development program?\n\nA3: Geriatric patients often have co-morbidities and concomitant therapies that could interact with the investigational drug and make patients more likely to have undesirable effects and interactions. Therefore, it is important to assess the safety and efficacy of a drug in such patients and to design a study with inclusion/exclusion criteria that allow their participation. There may exist a reluctance to include vulnerable geriatric patients at high risk of adverse outcomes (so-called ""frail"" geriatric patients). However, care in randomization should allow the appropriate attribution of findings either to the investigational drug or to other factors. This applies both to drugs intended for the geriatric patient population and for drugs used in diseases present in, but not unique to, the geriatric population.\n\nQ4: What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n\nA4: An appropriate representation of the geriatric population (including patients with concomitant therapies and co-morbidities) should be enrolled in the clinical development program to adequately characterize efficacy and safety in the geriatric population and allow for comparisons with the nongeriatric population. This information would ordinarily be expected in a marketing application. In general, it is preferable to include both nongeriatric and geriatric patients in the same study(ies), which can facilitate observation of age-related differences. In some cases, a separate study in the geriatric population can be preferable. Every effort should be made to include geriatric patients using concomitant therapies and with co-morbidities in the premarketing clinical development program. In some cases, enrollment of these patients can be challenging and it could be appropriate to collect data postmarketing. However, the adequacy of, and the need for, data in these patients should be considered during drug development and discussed in the marketing application submission. Where enrollment of geriatric patients has been insufficient despite the efforts of the applicant, a specific plan to collect data postmarketing should be discussed during development and presented in the marketing application. Information relevant to the geriatric patient population, including any limitations, should be reflected in the product labeling.\n\nQ5: Are there concerns related to the data specific to the geriatric population that could be considered in the planning of the clinical studies?\n--------------------\nContext title: E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations; Geriatrics; Questions and Answers'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n--------------------\nContext: Will be experienced by only a fraction of the treated patients (e.g., certain preventive therapies administered to healthy populations)\n\nIs of uncertain magnitude (e.g., efficacy determination on a surrogate endpoint)\n\nConcern exists that a product may add to an already significant background rate of morbidity or mortality, and clinical trials should be designed with a sufficient number of patients to provide adequate statistical power to detect prespecified increases over the baseline morbidity or mortality.\n\nThe determination of whether the above provisions of the ICH E1A guidance are appropriate for a particular product development program and how these considerations would best be addressed by that program calls for evaluation on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, FDA recommends that this issue be discussed with the relevant review division at the end-of-phase 2 meeting, if not earlier.\n\nIn addition to the considerations provided in E1A, there are other circumstances in which a larger database may be appropriate.\n\nThe proposed treatment is for a healthy population (e.g., the product under development is for chemoprevention or is a preventive vaccine).\n\nAn effective alternative to the investigational product is already available and has been shown to be safe.\n\nFDA is not suggesting that development of a database larger than that described in E1A is required or should be the norm. Rather, the appropriate database size would depend on the circumstances affecting a particular product, including the considerations outlined above. Therefore, FDA recommends that sponsors communicate with the review division responsible for their product early in the development program (e.g., at the pre-IND meeting) on the appropriate size of the safety database. FDA also recommends that sponsors revisit the issue at appropriate regulatory milestones (e.g., end-of-phase 2 and pre-NDA meetings).\n\nConsiderations for Developing a Premarketing Safety Database\n\nAlthough the characteristics of an appropriate safety database are product-specific, some general principles can be applied. In general, efforts to ensure the quality and completeness of a safety database should be comparable to those made to support efficacy. Because data from multiple trials are often examined when assessing safety, it is particularly critical to examine terminology, assessment methods, and use of standard terms (e.g., use of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)) to be sure that information is not obscured or distorted.\n\nAscertainment and evaluation of the reasons for leaving assigned therapy during study (deaths and dropouts for any reason) are particularly important for a full understanding of a product's safety profile.\n\nThe following elements should be considered by sponsors when developing proposals for their clinical programs as these programs pertain to risk assessment.\n\n.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n.1.1 Long-Term Controlled Safety Studies\n\nIt is common in many clinical programs for much of subject exposure data and almost all of long-term exposure data to come from single-arm or uncontrolled studies. Although these data can be informative, it may be preferable in some circumstances to develop controlled, long-term safety data. Such data allow for comparisons of event rates and facilitate accurate attribution of adverse events. Control groups may be given an active comparator or a placebo, depending on the disease being treated (i.e., the ethical and medical feasibility of using a placebo versus an active comparator will depend on the disease being treated).\n\nThe usefulness of active comparators in long-term safety studies depends on the adverse events of interest.\n\nGenerally, serious events that rarely occur spontaneously (e.g., severe hepatocellular injury or aplastic anemia) would be considered significant and interpretable whenever (1) they are clearly documented and (2) there is no likely alternative explanation, since the expected rate is essentially zero in populations of any feasible size. As a result, the events can usually be appropriately interpreted and regarded as a signal of concern whether or not there is a control group.\n\nOn the other hand, control groups are needed to detect increases in rates of events that are relatively common in the treated population (e.g., sudden death in patients with ischemic cardiac disease). Control groups are particularly important when an adverse event could be considered part of the disease being treated (e.g., asthma exacerbations occurring with inhalation treatments for asthma).\n\nTherefore, FDA decisions as to when long-term comparative safety studies should be conducted for a product should be based on the intended use of the product, the nature of the labeled patient population (e.g., more useful if there is a high rate of serious adverse events), and earlier clinical and preclinical safety assessments. Although it is clear that long-term controlled studies will not usually be conducted, such studies may be particularly useful when a safety issue is identified during earlier development of the drug. In these cases, safety studies designed to test specific safety hypotheses may be appropriate. This would be especially true in situations where the safety issue of concern is more common with cumulative exposure. (See section.4 below for further discussion of comparative trials.)\n\n.1.2 A Diverse Safety Database\n\nPremarketing safety databases should include, to the extent possible, a population sufficiently diverse to adequately represent the expected target population, particularly in phase 3 studies. FDA has previously addressed this issue in a memorandum,7 and the recommendations providedhere are intended to supplement that document. To the extent feasible, only patients with obvious contraindications or other clinical considerations that clearly dictate exclusion should be excluded from study entry. Inclusion of a diverse population allows for the development of safety data in a broad population that includes patients sometimes excluded from clinical trials, such as the elderly (particularly the very old), patients with concomitant diseases, and patients taking concomitant medications. Broadening inclusion criteria in phase 3 enhances the generalizability of the safety (and efficacy) findings. Although some phase 3 efficacy studies may target certain demographic or disease characteristics (and have narrower inclusion and exclusion criteria), overall, the phase 3 studies should include a substantial amount of data from less restricted populations.\n\niii.1.3 Exploring Dose Effects Throughout the Clinical Program\n\nCurrently, it is common for only one dose, or perhaps a few doses, to be studied during drug development beyond phase 2. Yet, a number of characteristics common to many phase 2 studies limit the ability of these trials to provide definitive data on exposure-response or adequate data for definitive phase 3 dose selection. These characteristics of phase 2 studies (in comparison to phase 3 studies) include the following:\n\nShorter durations of exposure\n\nCommon use of pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints, rather than clinical outcomes\n\nSmaller numbers of patients exposed\n\nNarrowly restrictive entry criteria\n\nAlthough phase 3 trials do not necessarily need to examine a range of doses, such an examination is highly desirable, particularly when phase 2 studies cannot reasonably be considered to have established a single most appropriate dose. When a dose is not established in phase 2, more than one dose level should be examined in phase 3 trials of fixed dose products to better characterize the relationship between product exposure and resulting clinical benefit and risk. Dose-response data from phase 3 trials with multiple dose levels will help to better define the relationship of clinical response to dose for both safety and effectiveness. Furthermore, inadequate exploration of a product's dose-response relationship in clinical trials can raise safety concerns, since recommending doses in labeling that exceed the amount needed for effectiveness may increase risk to patients through dose-related toxicities with no potential for gain. Exposure-response data from phase 3 trials can also provide critical information on whether dose adjustments should be made for special populations. Finally, demonstrating a dose-response relationship in late phase clinical trials with meaningful clinical endpoints may aid the assessment of efficacy, since showing a dose ordering to efficacy can be compelling evidence of effectiveness.8 When multiple dose levels are examined in phase 3 trials, the appropriate choice of doses to be included in these studies would be based on prior efficacy and safety information, including prior dose-ranging studies. In these circumstances, an end-of-phase 2 meeting with the appropriate review division would be particularly useful.\n\nDetecting Unanticipated Interactions as Part of a Safety Assessment\n\nEven a well-conducted and reasonably complete general clinical pharmacology program does not guarantee a full understanding of all possible risks related to product interactions. Therefore, risk assessment programs should examine a number of interactions during controlled safety and effectiveness trials and, where appropriate, in specific, targeted safety trials. This examination for unanticipated interactions should include the potential for the following:\n--------------------\nContext title: Premarketing Risk Assessment Guidance for Industry""

This document has been endorsed by the ICH Steering Committee at Step 4 of the ICH process, June 24, 1993. At Step 4 of the process, the final draft is recommended for adoption to the regulatory bodies of the European Union, Japan and the USA. This guidance was published in the Federal Register on August 2, 1994 (59 FR 39398) and is applicable to drug and biological products. In the past, guidelines have generally been issued under SS 10.90(b) [21 CFR 10.90(b)], which provides for the use of guidelines to state procedures or standards of general applicability that are not legal requirements but that are acceptable to FDA. The agency is now in the process of revising SS10.90(b). Therefore, this guideline is not being issued under the authority of SS10.90(b), and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges or benefits for or on any person, nor does it operate to bind FDA in any way. For additional copies of this guideline contact the Executive Secretariat Staff, HFD-8, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 7500 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855, 301-594-1012. An electronic version of this guideline is also available via Internet by connecting to the CDER FTP server (CDVS2.CDER.FDA.GOV) using the FTP protocol.\n\nDrugs should be studied in all age groups, including the elderly, for which they will have significant utility. Patients entering clinical trials should be reasonably representative of the population that will be later treated by the drug.\n\n3 SCOPE OF GUIDELINE\n\nThis guideline is directed principally toward new molecular entities that are likely to have significant use in the elderly, either because the disease intended to be treated is characteristically a disease of aging (e.g., Alzheimer\'s disease) or because the population to be treated is known to include substantial numbers of geriatric patients (e.g., hypertension). The guideline applies also to new formulations and new combinations of established medicinal products when there is specific reason to expect that conditions common in the elderly (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment, impaired cardiac function, concomitant illnesses or concomitant medications) are likely to be encountered and are not already dealt with in current labeling. It likewise applies when the new formulation or new combination is likely to alter the geriatric patient\'s response (with regard to either safety/tolerability or efficacy) compared with that of the non-geriatric patient in a way different from previous formulations. The guideline also applies to new uses that have significant potential applicability to the elderly.\n\nIt is recommended that exemptions from the guideline be determined in advance either by sponsors or, where feasible, by the sponsor and drug registration authorities, based, e.g., on estimates of the disease prevalence by age or through examination of the age distribution of usage for other drugs of the same class or drugs used for the same indication.\n\n4 Definition of the population\n\nThe geriatric population is arbitrarily defined, for the purpose of this guideline, as comprising patients aged 65 years or older. It is important, however, to seek patients in the older age range, 75 and above, to the extent possible. Protocols should not ordinarily include arbitrary upper age cutoffs. It is also important not to exclude unnecessarily patients with concomitant illnesses; it is only by observing such patients that drug-disease interactions can be detected. The older the population likely to use the drug, the more important it is to include the very old.\n\n5 Clinical experience\n\nGeriatric patients should be included in the Phase 3 database (and in Phase 2, at the sponsor\'s option) in meaningful numbers. The geriatric subpopulation should be represented sufficiently to permit the comparison of drug response in them to that of younger patients. For drugs used in diseases not unique to, but present in, the elderly, a minimum of 100 patients would usually allow detection of clinically important differences. For drugs to treat relatively uncommon diseases, smaller numbers of the elderly would be expected. Where the disease to be treated is characteristically associated with aging (e.g., Alzheimer\'s disease) it is expected that geriatric patients will constitute the major portion of the clinical database.\n\nThe overall database of the dossier should be examined for the presence of age-related differences, e.g., in adverse event rates, in effectiveness, and in dose-response. If these relatively crude overview analyses show important differences, further evaluation may be needed.\n\nThe geriatric data used in the overview can come either from the inclusion of elderly patients in all or most of the main Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 studies or from studies conducted exclusively in geriatric patients, at the sponsor\'s option. Inclusion of both groups in the same studies has the advantage of allowing direct comparisons of younger and older patients using data collected in similar ways. Such comparisons are more difficult when separate studies of young and old patients are used. Certain assessments, however, e.g., studies of cognitive function, require special planning and can be best accomplished in separate studies.\n\n6 Pharmacokine Studies\n\nMost of the recognized important differences between younger and older patients have been pharmacokinetic differences, often related to impairment of excretory (renal or hepatic) function or to drug-drug interactions. It is important to determine whether or not the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug in elderly subjects or patients is different from that in younger adults and to characterize the effects of influences, such as abnormal renal or hepatic function, that are more common in the elderly even though they can occur in any age group. Information regarding age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of the drug can come, at the sponsor\'s option, either from a Pharmacokine Screen (as described subsequently) or from formal pharmacokinetic studies, in the elderly and in patients with excretory functional impairment.\n\nIt is recognized that for certain drugs and applications (e.g., some topically-applied agents, some proteins) technical limitations such as low systemic drug levels may preclude or limit exploration of age-related pharmacokinetic differences.\nFormal PK studies can be done either in healthy geriatric subjects or in patient volunteers with the disease to be treated by the drug.\n\nThe initial PK study can be a pilot trial of limited size conducted under steady-state conditions to look for sizable differences between older and younger subjects or patients. A larger, single-dose PK study of sufficient size to permit statistical comparisons between geriatric and younger subjects\' or patients\' pharmacokinetic profiles is also acceptable.\n\nIn either case, if large (i.e., potentially medically important) age-related differences are found, the initial PK study may need to be followed by a multiple-dose PK study of sufficient size to permit statistical comparisons (geriatric vs. younger) at steady-state.\n\nB. Pharmacokine Screening Approach\n\nSponsors may opt, instead of conducting a separate PK evaluation of the elderly, to utilize a pharmacokinetic screen in conjunction with the main Phase 3 (and Phase 2, if the sponsor wishes) clinical trials program. This screening procedure involves obtaining, under steady-state conditions, a small number (one or two) of drug blood level determinations at ""trough"" (i.e., just prior to the next dose) or other defined times from sufficient numbers of Phase 2/3 clinical trials patients, geriatric and younger, to detect age-associated differences in pharmacokinetic behavior, if they are present. It is important to record time of dosing prior to blood concentration measurements, and relation of dosing to meals, and to examine the influence of demographic and disease factors, such as gender renal function, presence of liver disease, gastrointestinal disease or heart disease, body size and composition, and concomitant illnesses.\n\nSmall differences are unlikely to be of medical importance. Where the screen detects large differences, formal pharmacokinetic studies may be indicated unless the screen\'s results are sufficiently informative.\n\nThe advantage of a pharmacokinetic screen is that it can assess the effects, not only of age itself, but also of other factors associated with age (altered body composition, other drugs, concomitant illness) and their interactions.\n\n7 Pharmacokineics in Renaly or Hepatically Impaired Patients\n\nRenal impairment is an aging-associated finding that can also occur in younger patients. Therefore, it is a general principle, not specific to these guidelines, that drugs excreted (parent drug or active metabolites) significantly through renal mechanisms should be studied to define the effects of altered renal function on their pharmacokinetics. Such information is needed for drugs that are the subject of this guideline but it can be obtained in younger subjects with renal impairment.\n--------------------\nContext title: E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics']","['An appropriate representation of the geriatric population (including patients with concomitant therapies and co-morbidities) should be enrolled in the clinical development program to adequately characterize efficacy and safety in the geriatric population and allow for comparisons with the nongeriatric population.

FDA anticipates that early discussions with FDA about product development plans and about approaches to providing adequate scientific justifications will facilitate biosimilar development.13\n\nFootnote 12: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See the draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants for a detailed discussion. When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\n4 Complexities of Protein Products\n\nA sponsor should consider the complexities of protein products and related scientific issues when designing a development program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.\n\nNature of Protein Products and Related Scientific Considerations\n\nUnlike small molecule drugs, whose structure can usually be completely defined and entirely reproduced, proteins are typically more complex and are unlikely to be shown to be structurally identical to a reference product. Many potential differences in protein structure can arise. Because even minor structural differences (including certain changes in glycosylation patterns) can significantly affect a protein\'s safety and/or effectiveness, it is important to evaluate these differences.\n\nIn general, proteins can differ in at least three ways: (1) primary amino acid sequence; (2) modification to amino acids, such as sugar moieties (glycosylation) or other side chains; and (3) higher order structure (protein folding and protein-protein interactions). Modifications to amino acids may lead to heterogeneity and can be difficult to control. Protein modifications and higher order structure can be affected by formulation and environmental conditions, including light, temperature, moisture, packaging materials, container closure systems, and delivery device materials. Additionally, process- as well as product-related impurities may increase the likelihood and/or the severity of an immune response to a protein product, and certain excipients may limit the ability to characterize the protein product.\n\nAdvances in analytical sciences enable some protein products to be extensively characterized with respect to their physicochemical and biological properties, such as higher order structures and functional characteristics. These analytical methodologies have increasingly improved the ability to identify and characterize not only the drug substance of a protein product but also excipients and product- and process-related impurities.\n\nDespite such significant improvements in analytical techniques, however, current analytical methodology may not be able to detect all relevant structural and functional differences between two protein products. In addition, there may be incomplete understanding of the relationship between a product\'s structural attributes and its clinical performance. Thus, as set forth in the PHS Act, data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies are required to demonstrate biosimilarity unless FDA determines an element unnecessary.14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nManufacturing Process Considerations\n\nDifferent manufacturing processes may alter a protein product in a way that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the product. For example, differences in biological systems used to manufacture a protein product may cause different posttranslational modifications, which in turn may affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the product. Thus, when the manufacturing process for a marketed protein product is changed, the application holder must assess the effects of the change and demonstrate--through appropriate analytical testing, functional assays, and/or in some cases animal and/or clinical studies--that the change does not have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they relate to the safety oreffectiveness of the product.15 The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process (ICH Q5E) describes scientific principles in the comparability assessment for manufacturing changes.\n\nFootnote 15: See 21 CFR 601.12 and 21 CFR 314.70 for regulatory requirements for changes (including manufacturing changes) made to a licensed biologics license application (BLA) and an approved NDA, respectively.\n\nDemonstrating that a proposed product is biosimilar to a reference product typically will be more complex than assessing the comparability of a product before and after manufacturing changes made by the same manufacturer. This is because a manufacturer that modifies its own manufacturing process has extensive knowledge and information about the product and the existing process, including established controls and acceptance parameters. By contrast, the manufacturer of a proposed product is likely to have a different manufacturing process (e.g., different cell line, raw materials, equipment, processes, process controls, and acceptance criteria) from that of the reference product and no direct knowledge of the manufacturing process for the reference product. Therefore, even though some of the scientific principles described in ICH Q5E may also apply in the demonstration of biosimilarity, in general, FDA anticipates that more data and information will be needed to establish biosimilarity than would be needed to establish that a manufacturer\'s post-manufacturing change product is comparable to the pre-manufacturing change product.\n\nV U.S.-LICENSED Reference Product and Other Comparators\n\nTo obtain licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act, a sponsor must demonstrate that the proposed product is biosimilar to a single reference product that previously has been licensed by FDA.16 In general, a sponsor needs to provide information to demonstrate biosimilarity based on data directly comparing the proposed product with the reference product. As a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical PK study and, if appropriate, at least one PD study, intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity for purposes of section 351(k) of the PHS Act must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed. However, a sponsor may seek to use data derived from animal or clinical studies comparing a proposed product with a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act. In such a case, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.17 Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program their plans to provide an adequate scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of such justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFootnote 16: Sections 7002(a)(2) and (b)(3) of the Affordable Care Act, adding sections 351(k), 351(i)(2), and 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act.\n\nVI Approaches to developing and assessing evidence to demonstrate biosimilarity\n\nFDA recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to develop the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity. FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence provided by a sponsor when the Agency evaluates the sponsor\'s demonstration of biosimilarity, consistent with a longstanding Agency approach to evaluating scientific evidence.18\n\nFootnote 18: See footnote 4.\n\nUsing a Stepwise Approach to Demonstrate Biosimilarity\n--------------------\nContext title: Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product'

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if that approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist sponsors in deciding whether a study of marketed drugs or biological products for treating cancer falls within the exemption under SS 312.2(b)(1) (21 CFR 312.2(b)(1)) from the general requirement to submit an investigational new drug application (IND). The guidance discusses the Agency\'s current thinking on when studies of marketed cancer products are exempt from IND regulation based on a risk assessment. The Agency hopes that clarifying its policy will help sponsors identify which studies are exempt, thus saving them from submitting unnecessary IND applications.\n\nThis guidance revises the guidance of the same title published in September 2003. In the September 2003 version, the Agency\'s final statement was that it believed that most randomized studies of a size that could support a labeling supplement would likely not be exempt from IND regulation under SS 312.2(b)(1)(i), (ii). This is because they would be intended to support approval of a new indication, a significant change in the product labeling, or a significant change in advertising. Experience has shown that this interpretation was formulated too broadly and inappropriately referred to size alone. The Agency has decided to revise this guidance by removing that statement (the last sentence in section V.B). Whether a study could support a change in labeling is a complex determination, based on study design, size, and other factors.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements arecited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nGenerally, regulations in part 312 (21 CFR part 312) require sponsors who wish to study a drug or biological product in humans to submit an IND to the Agency.2 However, these regulations also provide for the exemption of some studies from the requirement to submit an IND if they meet certain criteria. Each year, many INDs for cancer drugs are submitted that contain studies that the Agency determines are exempt. This guidance is intended to help applicants identify which studies may be exempt.\n\nFootnote 2: Part 312 applies to all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) or to the licensing provisions of the Public Health Service Act (58 Stat. 632, as amended (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.)).\n\nRegulations\n\nRegulations in SS 312.2(b)(1) provide for the exemption of some studies for some drugs from IND regulations if the studies meet the following five criteria:\n\nThe study is not intended to support FDA approval of a new indication or a significant change in the product labeling.\n\nThe study is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the product.\n\nThe investigation does not involve a route of administration or dosage level or use in a patient population or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug product.\n\nThe study is conducted in compliance with institutional review board (IRB) and informed consent regulations set forth in parts 56 and 50 (21 CFR parts 56 and 50).\n\nThe study is conducted in compliance with SS 312.7 (promotion and charging for investigational drugs).\n\nRequirements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are not directly related to the specific protocol submitted, and their interpretation is similar for oncologic and nononcologic therapies. Requirement 3 is protocol related and has special meaning in the oncology therapy setting, particularly with respect to doses above the labeled dose, use with other treatments, and use in different populations.\n\nIn the preamble to the IND regulations, which published in the Federal Register on March 19, 1987, the Agency explained that the exemption was not necessarily intended to tie the investigator to the doses and routes of administration and patient population described in the approved labeling, but to permit deviations from the approved labeling to the extent that such changes are supported by the scientific literature and generally known clinical experience. The Agency recognizes that a considerable amount of professional judgment is exercised in determining whether the planned investigation significantly increases the risk associated with the use of the drug. FDA maintains that ""because the assessment of risks involved in a therapeutic procedure is an everyday part of the practice of medicine, the individual investigator should usually be able to determine the applicability of the exemption.""3\n\nFootnote 3: New Drug, Antibiotic, and Biologic Drug Product Regulations, Federal Register, March 19, 1987, Vol. 52, Nr. 53, p. 8802.\n\n1996 Agency Cancer Initiative\n\nIn 1996, as part of the President\'s National Performance Review, the Agency launched its Reinventing the Regulation of Cancer Drugs initiative with the goal of accelerating the approval of and expanding patient access to cancer drugs.4 As part of this initiative, the Agency explained that many sponsor-investigators were submitting INDs for exploratory studies for so-called off-label indications for two reasons: (1) IRBs incorrectly believe an IND is required, or (2) the pharmaceutical manufacturer agrees to provide a drug free of charge, but mistakenly concludes that the FDA will view this as promotional activity. With the intent of clarifying the Agency\'s policy and decreasing the number of unnecessary submissions, the Agency emphasized that it would no longer accept INDs considered exempt under SS 312.2(b)(1). (See SS 312.2(b)(4).) Furthermore, FDA stated that providing a drug for study would not, in and of itself, be viewed as a promotional activity if the manufacturer or distributor provides the product for a physician-initiated, bona fide clinical investigation. The Agency explained that it is the responsibility of the investigator to determine whether an IND is necessary.\n\nFootnote 4: Reinventing the Regulation of Cancer Drugs – Accelerating Approval and Expanding Access (March 1996), CBER, Office of Communication, Training, and Manufacturer Assistance, Voice Information System at 1-800-835-4709 or 301-827-1800, document ID number 0281. Available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cber/genadmin/reincanc.htm\n\nDespite the Agency\'s attempts to clarify its policy on IND exemptions, many cancer drug IND applications that the Agency determines are exempt from IND regulation are still being submitted unnecessarily. From 1997 to 1999, a majority of investigator IND submissions for marketed cancer drugs were considered exempt (204, 205, and 140 applications in 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively).\n\nIII Risk/Benefit analysis in the practice of oncology\n\nAs noted above, a critical question in determining whether a study is exempt involves criterion 3 in the exemption regulations (SS 312.2(b)(1)(iii)): The investigation may not significantly increase the risk associated with use of a drug product. The question of increased risk is determined by assessing the deviation in the planned investigation from the use described in the approved label. In oncology, modifications of labeled dosing recommendations are common and occur as part of oncologists\' clinical practice. As outlined below, oncologists are familiar with evaluating the risk of off-label dosing regimens for cancer drug and biological products.\n\nTreatment with cancer drugs may be associated with significant risk from known toxicity. Because effectiveness is often related to dose, a dose close to the maximal tolerated dose is often selected for studies of cancer drugs. This same dose usually becomes the recommended dose in labeling when the new cancer drug is approved with the knowledge that the dose may be altered if it is not tolerated by a patient. Because it is not generally possible to have maximal efficacy in a population without inducing toxicity in some patients, it is not uncommon to observe severe or even lethal side effects from cancer drugs in some patients. In general, these circumstances mean that the toxicity, even potentially lethal toxicity, of cancer drugs is described in approved labeling.\n--------------------\nContext title: IND Exemptions for Studies of Lawfully Marketed Drug or Biological Products for the Treatment of Cancer Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n--------------------\nContext: As noted in sections I and II of this guidance, the purpose of this guidance is to recommend a more efficient and flexible model to evaluate multiple versions of an investigational product that would otherwise be evaluated in separate clinical studies. For a single clinical study of different versions of an investigational product where each version is submitted in a separate IND, it may be challenging to determine how to structure and organize the INDs, and how to submit changes or new information as the study progresses. The framework described here is intended to provide clarity on these topics and, as feasible, to minimize submission of the same information to multiple INDs by facilitating cross-referencing to shared information in the INDs. Sponsors may discuss their specific clinical study and planned submission approach with OTAT, CBER prior to submitting an IND (e.g., by requesting an INitial Targeted Engagement for Regulatory Advice on CBER producTs (INTERACT)3 or pre-IND meeting4).\n\nFootnote 3: For additional information about INTERACT meetings, please see https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/industry-biologics/interact-meetings.\n\nFootnote 4: See Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products, Draft Guidance for Industry, December 2017, https://www.fda.gov/media/109951/download. When finalized, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nOverview\n\nFor purposes of the framework outlined in this guidance, we refer to INDs either as ""Primary"" or ""Secondary"". The purpose of this nomenclature is to distinguish which INDs will include clinical information about the umbrella trial (Primary INDs) and which INDs will not include clinical information about the umbrella trial (Secondary INDs). For example, an IND amendment that contains only clinical information about the umbrella trial (e.g., no CMC or P/T information) would only need to be submitted to the Primary IND.\n\nFor a clinical study with two different versions of the investigational product (Product A and Product B), we recommend that the sponsor submit two separate INDs, IND A and IND B. One of the INDs, IND A, will be considered the ""Primary"" IND, and should include CMC and P/T information for Product A. IND B will be considered a ""Secondary"" IND, and will include CMC and P/T information for Product B. Primary IND A should also include complete clinical information for the umbrella\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]\n\nbetween the product versions may be submitted solely to the Primary IND and incorporated into the Secondary IND(s) by cross-reference.\n* In some cases, sponsors may decide to develop additional versions of a product after an IND has already been submitted. If the sponsor wishes to evaluate the original and additional versions of a product together in an umbrella trial, we recommend that sponsors submit an amendment to the existing IND specifying that it is a Primary IND and follow the steps in the section IV.B of this guidance to submit Secondary IND(s) and add arm(s) to the study.\n\nAppendix B Adding Arms to the Study\n\nIf the arm to be added includes a new version of the investigational cellular or gene therapy product, (e.g., Product C), we recommend that the sponsor submit:\n\nIND C with CMC and P/T information for Product C. IND C will be considered a Secondary IND. We recommend that the cover letter for a Secondary IND clearly state that the IND is a Secondary IND and specify the Primary IND number. The Secondary IND should cross-reference the Primary IND for clinical information.\n\nAn amendment to IND A with the updated clinical protocol, which now includes an arm for Product C. We recommend that the cover letter for the amendment to IND A clearly state that the IND is a Primary IND and specify the Secondary IND number(s), including IND C. We recommend that the Primary IND also be updated to include a cross-reference to the Secondary IND for CMC and P/T information related to Product C. It should be noted that the new Secondary IND C cannot go into effect until 30 days after FDA receives the new IND (21 CFR 312.40(b)(1)), unless FDA provides earlier notification that the clinical investigations in the IND may begin (21 CFR 312.40(b)(2)). Administration of Product C cannot begin until IND C goes into effect and IRB approval of the modified protocol has been granted (21 CFR 56.103).\n\nIf the arm to be added does not include a new version of the investigational cellular or gene therapy (e.g., a new arm that will study Product B in combination with a marketed product, or a new arm that will study investigational Products A and B together), then we recommend that the sponsor submit:\n\nAn amendment to the Primary IND with the updated clinical protocol (i.e., with the new arm); and\n\nAny additional P/T information supporting the new arm, if applicable, submitted to the relevant IND(s).\n\nSubmitting Other Types of Changes or New Information\n\nFor revisions to the umbrella trial clinical protocol that do not add a new arm or for other types of new clinical information, the sponsor should submit the revised protocol or new clinical information to the Primary IND. The sponsor does not need to submit any information to the Secondary INDs.\n\nFor new CMC or P/T information (e.g., changes to the CMC information, new P/T study report): if the new information is specific to one product (e.g., Product B), then that information should be submitted to IND B only. If the new information is for multiple products (e.g., Products A and B), then the new information should be submitted to INDs A and B (or submitted to IND A and cross-referenced by IND B, as mentioned previously). For new P/T information, the sponsor should also submit an updated investigator brochure to the Primary IND.\n\nClinical Holds and Responses to Hold\n\nIf only one arm (e.g., arm studying Product B) will be placed on hold, then the Primary IND would be placed on partial hold and the relevant Secondary IND would be placed on hold (or partial hold, if appropriate).\n\nIn the event that FDA issues an order placing the entire study on clinical hold (e.g., due to a safety issue that applies to all product versions), then all Primary and Secondary INDs would be placed on hold (or partial hold, if appropriate). 21 CFR 312.42(a).\n\nTo respond to a clinical hold, the sponsor will need to submit a response to each IND that was placed on hold. However, detailed information responding to each hold comment does not need to be submitted to multiple INDs. For example, if the Primary IND was placed on partial hold due to CMC concerns with a product in a Secondary IND, the sponsor should submit the CMC information responding to the hold comments to the Secondary IND. The response to hold for the Primary IND can refer to the Secondary IND for detailed information.\n\nReporting\n\nIND safety reporting must be performed in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32.7 The sponsor must submit safety reports for an investigational product to all of the sponsor\'s INDs that are relevant to that product. At a minimum, safety reports must be submitted to both the Primary IND and any Secondary IND that contains the CMC and P/T information for that product. In cases where a safety report for one product is relevant to the safety of multiple related products, the safety report must be submitted to all of the relevant INDs (21 CFR 312.32(c)).

 '--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsors may request advice from FDA regarding proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product development programs that identify a biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as the intended reference product. A sponsor will be able to submit a 351(k) BLA that references the biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as its reference product after the NDA for the biological product is deemed to be a 351(a) BLA.\n\nQ19. Can an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a ""deemed"" 351(a) BLA seek a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act to another biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act?\n\nAny person (including an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a ""deemed"" 351(a) BLA) may seek to establish the biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product to another biological product licensed or deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. FDA intends to work with applicants to address scientific or regulatory issues that may arise in the context of these 351(k) development programs, and to provide additional procedural information. Any sponsor or applicant may contact the relevant review division within the Office of New Drugs in FDA\'s CDER to request advice on a 351(k) development program.\n\nD. Transition of Biological Products from the Orange Book to the Purple Book\n\nQ20. Will any therapeutic equivalence evaluations for biological products previously listed in the Orange Book be reflected in the Purple Book?\n\nNo, the Purple Book does not include therapeutic equivalence evaluations as reflected in the Orange Book. The Purple Book identifies, among other things, whether a biological product licensed under section 351(k) of the PHS Act has been determined by FDA to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product.\n\nE. Designation of Proper Name\n\nQ21. What will be the proper name for a biological product that has be en approved in an NDA that is deemed to be a BLA?\n\nThe (proper\\,name) is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)). FDA does not intend to apply the nonproprietary naming convention (in which the proper name is composed of a core name and a four-letter distinguishing suffix) to biological products that are the subject of an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act that is deemed to be a license under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. This is consistent with what was previously communicated in FDA\'s draft guidance for industry (Nonproprietary\\,Naming) of Biological Products: Update_ (March 2019).20\n\nIV Compliance Policy for Requirements Related to Labeling\n\nTo minimize possible disruption to the distribution of biological products that are the subject of the transition provision and to minimize burden on holders of deemed BLAs, FDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA with labeling that does not conform to certain labeling requirements for BLAs until March 23, 2025, provided that all other applicable labeling requirements are met. The compliance policy set forth in this guidance would apply only as described below.\n\nFDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA and that are introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce between March 23, 2020, and March 22, 2025, where the package is not marked with:\n\nThe proper name of the biological product contained in the package (provided that the current packaging is plainly marked with the established name of the biological product);\n\nThe name and address of the manufacturer of the biological product (provided that the current packaging is plainly marked with the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor as required in 21 CFR 201.1);\n\nThe applicable license number; or\n\nOther information required by 21 CFR 610.60 through 610.64, for which there is not a corresponding requirement under 21 CFR 201.1.\n\nFDA also generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA and that are introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce between March 23, 2020, and March 22, 2025, where the content and format of labeling required by 21 CFR 201.56, 201.57, 201.80, and/or 208.20, as applicable, does not include the following information:\n\nThe proper name of the biological product, including any appropriate descriptors (provided that the current labeling uses the established name of the biological product);\n\nThe name and address of the manufacturer of the biological product (provided that the current labeling includes the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor as required by 21 CFR 201.1);\n\nThe applicable license number; or\n\nFor biological products with approved labeling in the format described by 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57 (PLR format), the year of Initial U.S. Approval of the new biological product (provided that the current labeling includes the year of Initial U.S. Approval of the new molecular entity).\n\nFDA notes that the timing of BLA-specific revisions to the prescribing information should be coordinated with the corresponding revisions to the container labels, carton labeling, and any FDA-approved patient labeling for the biological product to ensure consistency among the different types of product labeling.\n\nIf the holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product has an administratively converted supplement that includes proposed revisions to product labeling or submits a supplement that includes proposed revisions to product labeling before March 22, 2025 (i.e., the end of the compliance period), and the required BLA-specific labeling revisions to container labels, carton labeling, and prescribing information referenced in this guidance have not already been addressed, such revisions would need to be addressed before the supplement could be approved (see, e.g., 21 CFR 610.60). A changes-being-effected (CBE-0) supplement may be submitted prior to submission of a prior approval supplement that includes the BLA-specific labeling revisions. However, the prior approval supplement would need to be approved before or concurrent with approval of the CBE-0 supplement. Under this approach, holders of deemed BLAs may coordinate BLA-specific labeling updates with their plans for other proposed revisions to product labeling.\n\nAfter FDA approval of a supplement for the BLA-specific labeling revisions, FDA understands that application holders may need to wait to implement these labeling revisions until their next printing of the labels and labeling. Accordingly, to enable such application holders to exhaust existing inventory, FDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA where FDA has already approved a supplement that includes the BLA-specific labeling revisions but the labels and labeling do not include the BLA-specific labeling revisions prior to March 22, 2025.\n--------------------\nContext title: The “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n--------------------\nContext: Appendix A Approaches to Product Identification\n\nIn biosimilar product labeling, the approach to product identification depends on the context of the information being presented. FDA acknowledges that there will be variations on the general concepts outlined in this section because the approach to product identification will depend on the specific statements. The illustrative examples in this section use a fictional reference product JUNEXANT (replicamab-hyxf) and a fictional biosimilar product NEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen use of the biosimilar product name is recommended:\n\nThe biosimilar product name should be used in labeling text that is specific to the biosimilar product or that refers solely to the biosimilar product. If a biosimilar product has a proprietary name, the proprietary name (e.g., NEXSYMEO) should be used in the appropriate sections. However, if a proprietary name is not available, or if referring to the drug substance (as discussed below), the biosimilar product\'s proper name (e.g., replicamab-cznm) should be used.13\n\nFootnote 13: The proper name is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (see section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)).\n\nThe biosimilar product\'s proprietary name (or, if a proprietary name is not available, the biosimilar product\'s proper name) should be used in circumstances such as the following:\n\nIn sections where the information described is specific to the biosimilar product -- This includes, but is not limited to, the following sections: INDICATIONS AND USAGE, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, DESCRIPTION, and HOW SUPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING.\n\nFor directive statements and recommendations for preventing, monitoring, managing, or mitigating risks (e.g., ""Discontinue NEXSYMEO in patients with [adverse reaction]"") -- Such statements are typically included in, but are not limited to, the BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, and DRUG INTERACTIONS sections.\n\nThe biosimilar product\'s proper name should be used when referring to the drug substance. An example would be to use the biosimilar product\'s proper name in the DESCRIPTION section.\n\nWhen use of the reference product name is recommended:\n\nWhen clinical studies or data derived from studies with the reference product are described in biosimilar product labeling, the reference product\'s proper name (e.g., replicamab-hjsf) should be used. This information would typically be included in sections such as, but not limited to, ADVERSE REACTIONS (Clinical Trials Experience subsection) and CLINICAL STUDIES.\n\nWhen use of the core name is recommended:14\n\nFootnote 14: Two examples of a core name are filgrastim and epoetin alfa. The proper name for biological products will include a distinguishing suffix composed of four lowercase letters attached to the core name with a hyphen.\n\nThe overall risk-benefit profile of the reference product is relevant to the biosimilar product, even if a particular serious adverse reaction or other risk included in the reference product labeling may not have been reported with the biosimilar product at the time of licensure. In labeling sections where the risk applies to both the biosimilar product and the reference product (e.g., BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, Warnings and PRECAUTIONS, ADVERSE REACTIONS (Postmarketing Experience subsection)), it would be appropriate to use the core name of the reference product followed by the word ""products"" (e.g., replicamab products) to convey, for instance, that a risk or other information necessary for the safe use of the product applies to both the biosimilar product and the reference product (see section IV.B of this guidance).\n\nFor example, in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\nReference Product Labeling & Biosimilar Product Labeling \\ \\hline Treatment with JUNEXANT increases & Treatment with replicamab products \\ the risk of serious infections involving & increases the risk of serious infections \\ various organ systems and sites that may & involving various organ systems and sites \\ lead to hospitalization or death. & that may lead to hospitalization or death. \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n4. When use of more than one product name is recommended:\n\nThere may be text appropriately based on the reference product labeling where more than one of these product identification approaches should be used to convey information accurately.\n\nTherefore, all text in biosimilar product labeling, even sections that have been based on reference product labeling, should be carefully evaluated for the most appropriate product identification approach. In some cases, such as the following example, more than two of the approaches may be used:\n\nReplicamab products can cause hepatotoxicity and acute hepatic failure. In clinical trials of replicamab-hjxf, 10% of patients developed elevated ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of normal and 5% progressed to acute hepatic failure. Evaluate serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin at baseline and monthly during treatment with NEXSYMEO...\n\nApproaches to Content Presentation\n\nThe labeling for the biosimilar product should be specific to the conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)) sought for the biosimilar product and should be consistent with language previously approved for the reference product for those conditions of use.\n\nWhen a biosimilar product applicant obtains licensure for fewer than all conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)) for which the reference product is licensed, certain text in the reference product labeling related to condition(s) of use for the reference product that are not licensed for the biosimilar product would generally not be included in the biosimilar product labeling.15 However, in certain circumstances it may be necessary to include information in the biosimilar product labeling relating to an indication(s) for which the biosimilar product is not licensed, in order to help ensure safe use (e.g., when safety information in the reference product labeling is related to use of the product and is not specific to a particular licensed indication(s) or when information specific to only the biosimilar product\'s indication(s) cannot be easily extracted).16 Such text should be written in a manner that does not imply that the biosimilar product is licensed for a reference product indication(s) or use(s) that has not been licensed for the biosimilar product. In these circumstances, specific sections of labeling that could be affected include BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, ADVERSE REACTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS, and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS.\n\nFootnote 16: See also 21 CFR 201.57(c)(6)(i).\n\nFor example, for sections such as WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS, the reference product labeling may pool and categorize events from all the reference product clinical trials for all the indications for which the reference product is licensed. In cases where the biosimilar product applicant is not seeking licensure for all the indications for which the reference product is licensed, the pooled data described in the reference product labeling should be included in the biosimilar product labeling in a manner that is not indication-specific. However, any text that refers to an indication for which the biosimilar product applicant is not currently seeking licensure and is included to ensure safe use of the biosimilar product should be revised to avoid an implication that the biosimilar has been licensed for that indication(s).\n\nApproaches to Specific Sections of Biosimilar Product Labeling\n\nHIGHLIGHTS OF PRESCRIBING INFORMATION (Highlights) a. Initial U.S. approval\n\nThe initial U.S. approval in the Highlights section is the year that the biosimilar product is licensed.\n\nb. Biosimilarity statement\n\nFDA recommends including a statement, placed on the line immediately beneath the initial U.S. approval in the Highlights section, that the product is biosimilar to the reference product. It should read as follows:\n\n[BIOSIMIIAR PRODUCT\'S PROPRIETARY NAME (biosimilar product\'s proper name)] is biosimilar* to [REFERENCE PRODUCT\'S PROPRIETARY NAME (reference product\'s proper name)].\n\nThe asterisk should appear as a footnote symbol inserted after the word ""biosimilar.""For example, for the fictitious product NEXSYMEO, the statement should read as follows:\n\nNEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm) is biosimilar* to JUNEXANT (replicamab-hjxf).\n\nThe footnote should appear at the end of the Highlights section (but above the Revision Date) and state the following:\n\nBiosimilar means that the biological product is approved based on data demonstrating that it is highly similar to an FDA-approved biological product, known as a reference product, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product. Biosimilarity of [BIOSIMILAR PRODUCT\'S PROPRIETARY NAME] has been demonstrated for the condition(s) of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)), strength(s), dosage form(s), and route(s) of administration described in its Full Prescribing Information.\n\n2 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\n\nInformation in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section should be specific to the licensed indications for the biosimilar product and should be consistent with information previously approved for the reference product. The biosimilar product labeling should include text from the reference product labeling regarding any Limitations of Use relevant to the biosimilar product\'s indication(s) (see section IV.B of this guidance for recommendations regarding text that refers to an indication for which licensure has not been sought by the biosimilar product applicant).\n\n3 ADVERSE REACTIONS, Immunogenicity\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry'

It does not create any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist sponsors in demonstrating that a proposed therapeutic protein product (hereinafter proposed product2) is biosimilar to a reference product for purposes of the submission of a marketing application under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act).3 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) amends the PHS Act and other statutes to create an abbreviated licensure pathway in section 351(k) of the PHS Act for biological products shown to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed biological reference product (see sections 7001 through 7003 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) (Public Law 111-148). Although the 351(k) pathway applies generally to biological products, this guidance focuses on therapeutic protein products and gives an overview of important scientific considerations for demonstrating biosimilarity. The scientific principles described in this guidance may also apply to other types of proposed biosimilar biological products.\n\nFootnote 2: In Section II (Scope) of this document, the term proposed product is also used to describe a product that is the subject of a new drug application (NDA) submitted through the pathway described by section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).\n\nFootnote 3: The statutory definition of biosimilar and definitions of selected other terms used in this guidance are provided in the glossary at the end of the document.\n\nThis guidance is one in a series of guidances that FDA is developing to implement the BPCI Act. These guidances address a broad range of issues, including:\n\nQuality Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity of a Therapeutic Protein Product to a Reference Product\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\n2.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAdditional topics discussed include the following:\n\nConsiderations of the complexities of therapeutic protein products when designing a biosimilar development program, including manufacturing process considerations\n\nUse of data derived from studies comparing a proposed product with a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product\n\nPostmarketing safety monitoring considerations\n\nThis guidance applies to applications submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. However, some scientific principles described in this guidance may be informative for the development of certain biological products under section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act.5 Section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act and section 351(k) of the PHS Act are two separate statutory schemes. This guidance is not intended to describe any relationship between the standards for approval under these schemes.\n\nFootnote 5: A 505(b)(2) application is an NDA that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use (e.g., the Agency’s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug or published literature). A 505(b)(2) application that seeks to rely on a listed drug (i.e., the reference product) must contain adequate data and information to demonstrate that the proposed product is sufficiently similar to the listed drug to justify reliance, in part, on FDA’s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for the listed drug. Any aspects of the proposed product that differ from the listed drug must be supported by adequate data and information to support the safety and effectiveness of the proposed product.\n\n3 Background\n\nThe BPCI Act was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act on March 23, 2010. The BPCI Act creates an abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products demonstrated to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference product. Section 351(k) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)), added by the BPCI Act, sets forth the requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product and an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product.6 Section 351(i) of the PHS Act defines biosimilarity to mean ""that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components"" and that ""there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product.""7 The BPCI Act also amended the definition of biological product to include ""protein (except any chemically synthesized polypeptide).""8\n\nFootnote 6: General scientific issues relating to the demonstration of interchangeability will be addressed separately.\n\nFootnote 7: Section 7002(b)(3) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 8: Section 7002(b)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, amending section 351(i) of the PHS Act.\n\nUnder section 351(k) of the PHS Act, a proposed biological product that is demonstrated to be biosimilar to a reference product can rely on certain existing scientific knowledge about thesafety, purity, and potency9 of the reference product to support licensure. FDA will license a proposed biological product submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act if FDA ""determines that the information submitted in the application.(\\ldots) is sufficient to show that the biological product is biosimilar to the reference product (\\ldots)"" and the 351(k) applicant (or other appropriate person) consents to an inspection of the facility that is the subject of the application (i.e., a facility in which the proposed biological product is manufactured, processed, packed, or held).10\n\nFootnote 9: The standard for licensure of a biological product as potent under section 351(a) of the PHS Act has long been interpreted to include effectiveness (see 21 CFR 600.3(s) and the guidance for industry on Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products). In this guidance, we use the terms safety and effectiveness and safety, purity, and potency interchangeably in the discussions pertaining to biosimilar products.\n\nAn application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that ""the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product"" based upon data derived from:11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(3) of the PHS Act.\n\nAnalytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;\n\nAnimal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and\n\nA clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.\n\nThe Agency has the discretion to determine that an element described above is unnecessary in a 351(k) application.12 FDA advises sponsors intending to develop biosimilar products to meet with FDA to present their product development plans and establish a schedule of milestones that will serve as landmarks for future discussions with the Agency. FDA anticipates that early discussions with FDA about product development plans and about approaches to providing adequate scientific justifications will facilitate biosimilar development.13\n\nFootnote 12: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n--------------------\nContext title: Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product']","['A sponsor may submit a single IND application for a development program that is intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act and includes use of a non-U.S.-licensed product. The sponsor should submit information supporting the proposed clinical investigation with the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product under the IND application. This scenario may occur, for example, if a sponsor seeks to use data from a clinical study comparingits proposed biosimilar product to a non-U.S.-licensed product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act, and proposes to conduct a clinical PK study, with PD data, as appropriate, in the United States with all three products (i.e., the proposed biosimilar product, the U.S.-licensed reference product, and the non-U.S.-licensed product) to support establishment of a bridge between all three products and scientific justification for the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity to the U.S.-licensed reference product.\n\nA non-U.S.-licensed comparator product is considered an investigational new drug in the United States, and thus would require an IND application for importation and use in the United States (see 21 CFR 312.110(a)). If a sponsor intends to conduct a clinical investigation in the United States using a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product, the IND requirements in 21 CFR part 312 also would apply to this product (see, e.g., 21 CFR 312.2).\n\nWith respect to chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) information, a sponsor should submit to the IND application as much of the CMC information required by 21 CFR 312.23(a)(7) as is available. However, FDA recognizes that a sponsor may not be able to obtain all of the CMC information required by 21 CFR 312.23(a)(7) for a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product for which it is not the manufacturer. In these circumstances, the sponsor can request in an IND submission that FDA waive the regulatory requirements related to CMC information on the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product (21 CFR 312.10). The waiver request must include at least one of the following:\n\n* An explanation why compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.23(a)(7) is unnecessary or cannot be achieved\n* Information that will satisfy the purpose of the requirement by helping to ensure that the investigational new drug will have the proper identity, strength, quality, and purity\n* Other information justifying a waiver15 Footnote 15: See 21 CFR 312.10(a).\n\nInformation that is relevant to whether the investigational new drug will have the proper identity, strength, quality, and purity may include, for example, information indicating whether the investigational new drug has been licensed by a regulatory authority that has similar scientific and regulatory standards as FDA (e.g., ICH countries). This should include, to the greatest extent possible, summary approval information and current product labeling made public by the foreign regulatory authority. In addition, a sponsor should also provide information on the conditions and containers that will be used to transport the drug product to the U.S. clinical site(s) and information on the relabeling and repackaging operations that will be used to relabel the drug product vials for investigational use. This should include information on how exposure of the product to light and temperature conditions outside of the recommended storage conditions will be prevented. A risk assessment on the impact the relabeling operations may have on drug product stability should also be included.\n\nThe sponsor should consult with the appropriate FDA review division regarding the CMC information necessary to support the proposed clinical study.']",0.0,0.3396226415094339

Parametric release is defined as a sterility assurance release program where demonstrated control of the sterilization process enables a firm to use defined critical process controls, in lieu of the sterility test, to fulfill the intent of 21 CFR 211.165(a), and 211.167(a).5 Under this strategy, market release of terminally sterilized products can be based upon meeting the defined sterilization parameters and not on performing an approved sterility test. Meeting the requirements of the parametric release process can provide greater assurance that a batch meets the sterility requirement than can be achieved with a sterility test of finished units drawn from the batch.\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 CFR 211.167(a) for drug products or 21 CFR 610.12 for biologic products. In addition, refer to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapters: (<)1(>) (Injections), (<)71(>) (Sterility), and (<)1041(>) (Biologicals). Short-lived radiopharmaceuticals, including positron emission tomography (PET) drugs, are subject to sterility testing; however, they may be released prior to completion of this test (21 CFR 211.165(a)).\n\nFootnote 5: For information on how current good manufacturing practices will be applied for products subject to parametric release that are within the scope of this guidance, see the FDA Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 460.800.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\n[150] Risk Assessment, Process Understanding, and Prior Knowledge\n\n[152] Successful parametric release systems are based on the reliability of the control strategy of the sterility assurance program. We recommend that your risk assessment focus on the risk of failure to achieve the minimum required probability of a non-sterile unit for each unit of every batch. The risk assessment should include the following:\n\n[153] Consistency of performance of the terminal sterilization cycle within the validated limits.\n\n[154] A discussion of risk to the sterility of the product relative to the following: (1) the production terminal sterilization cycle, (2) the production loading patterns, (3) the container closure system (including secondary packaging), and (4) any potential contamination risks from the environment (as appropriate). For an approved application, you should indicate any changes to the above items and provide an assessment of the risk to the sterility of the product associated with those changes. For example, although the established minimum sterilization time cannot be lowered, the maximum sterilization time can be increased if the appropriate stability data are provided to support the increase.\n\n[167] Experience with the proposed or similar product (and container closure system) and proposed or similar sterilization process, the overall risks to sterility, and the steps you have taken to assess and control these risks. For new products, prior knowledge from developmental and registration/exhibit batches may suffice.\n\n[168] A discussion of your overall prior knowledge and production and testing experience relevant to the drug product that will be subject to parametric release.\n\n[169] Documentation for Parametric Release Process\n\n[170] The following information specific to the proposed parametric release process should also be included in your submission:\n\n[171] A citation to a complete and detailed description of the current relevant terminal sterilization cycle.\n\n[172] Identification of the critical process parameters (process/cycle parameters and appropriate load monitors essential for product release) for the product(s) proposed for parametric release, including the minimum and maximum limits for these critical parameters. The critical process parameters should be within the limits that have been validated and approved for sterility assurance of the subject product(s).\n\n[173] **Acknowledgement that adherence to the critical parameters of the parametric release program will substitute for the performance of a sterility test as the primary release criterion for the product and that sterility test results from the finished product will not be used to overrule any failure to meet the acceptance criteria of the parametric release program. In the event of failure, the specific sterilizer load will be rejected by the quality control unit and will not be released unless there is a provision for reprocessing.\n\nAcknowledgement that regardless of the batch release technique used, any specimen tested according to the reference test method for sterility (e.g., compendium or FDA regulations) will meet the criteria for sterility (such as during testing for stability or postmarketing investigations).\n\nA description of the sterilization load monitor that indicates the following: (1) the type of monitor being proposed, (2) how the load monitor will be used and analyzed, (3) what functions are being measured by the monitor, and (4) the rationale for the location of the monitor. Additionally, for indirect monitors, we recommend that you include a statement justifying the classification of the indirect indicator that you are using as defined by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI 2008). In certain circumstances a Class 3 indicator may be appropriate; however, a Class 5 indicator is recommended for most situations.\n\nDocumentation of the control system to verify exposure of the load to the sterilization process.\n--------------------\nContext title: Submission of Documentation in Applications for Parametric Release of Human and Veterinary Drug Products Terminally Sterilized by Moist Heat Processes Guidance for Industry""

INTRODUCTION\n\nA. Purpose\n\nThis document is intended to provide guidance for the submission of information and data in support of the efficacy of sterilization processes in drug applications for both human and veterinary drugs. The recommendations in the guidance apply to applications for sterile drug products (new drug applications, new animal drug applications, abbreviated new drug applications, abbreviated antibiotic applications, and abbreviated new animal drug applications). These recommendations also apply to previously approved applications when supplements associated with the sterile processing of approved drugs are submitted. Information and data in support of sterility assurance may also be necessary in investigational new drug and investigational new animal drug applications.\n\nIn the FEDERAL REGISTER of October 11, 1991 (56 FR 51354), the agency published a proposed rule entitled ""Use of Aseptic Processing and Terminal Sterilization in the Preparation of Sterile Pharmaceuticalsfor Human and Veterinary Use."" This guidance is not a substitution for or a supplement to that proposed rule. Regardless of whether the applicant uses terminal sterilization or aseptic processing to manufacture a drug product that is purported to be sterile, certain information about the validation of that process should be submitted for both of those types of sterilization.\n\nAppendix B Documenting Sterilization Process Validation\n\nThe efficacy of a given sterilization process for a specific drug product is evaluated on the basis of a series of protocols and scientific experiments designed to demonstrate that the sterilization process and associated control procedures can reproducibly deliver a sterile product. Data derived from experiments and control procedures allow conclusions to be drawn about the probability of nonsterile product units (sterility assurance level). Based on the scientific validity of the protocols and methods, as well as on the scientific validity of the results and conclusions, the agency concludes that the efficacy of the sterilization process is validated.\n\nWhether a drug product is sterilized by a terminal sterilization process or by an aseptic filling process, the efficacy of the sterilization process may be validated without the manufacture of three production batches.\n\nSterilization process validation data, however, should be generated using procedures and conditions that are fully representative and descriptive of the procedures and conditions proposed for manufacture of the product in the application.\n\nThe Center for Drug Evaluation and Research\'s (CDER\'s) and the Center for Veterinary Medicine\'s (CVM\'s) review of the validation of the sterilization process consists of a scientific evaluation of the studies submitted in the applications. This review is conducted by FDA\'s review staff, and is part of a cooperative effort between the review staff, compliance staff, and field investigators to ensure the overall state of control of the sterile processing of human and veterinary drug products. Information and data in support of sterility assurance may be provided directly to the application or by specific reference to a drug master file (DMF), a veterinary master file (VMF), or another application. Letters of authorization to refer to the referenced files should be included.\n\nAppendix C Remarks\n\nThis guidance is intended to provide recommendations for the types of information applicants should include in human and animal drug applications. Regulatory requirements for the submission of information and data in various applications are specified in the sections listed below:Human Drugs:\n\nInvestigational new drug applications\n\nNew drug applications\n\nAbbreviated new drug and abbreviated\n\nantibiotic drug applications\n\nSupplements to NDA\'s and ANDA\'s\n\nAnimal Drugs:\n\nInvestigational new animal drug applications\n\nNew animal drug applications\n\nSupplements to NADA\'s\n\n21 CFR 312.23(a)(7)\n\n21 CFR 314.50\n\n21 CFR 314.94 and 314.50\n\nSupplements to NADA\'s\n\n21 CFR 314.70\n\nII Information for terminal moist heat sterilization processes\n\nThe following types of information should be submitted in support of sterility assurance for products produced using terminal moist heat sterilization. Although the following outline directly addresses moist heat processes, the same types of information would generally pertain to other terminal sterilization processes (e.g., ethylene oxide or radiation). (See section III of this guidance.) The following information should be submitted for each facility to be used in the manufacture of the proposed drug product:\n\nDescription of the Process and Product\n\nThe Drug Product and Container-Closure System\n\nDescriptions of the drug product and the container-closure system(s) to be sterilized (e.g., size(s), fill volume, or secondary packaging).\n2. The Sterilization Process\n\nA description of the sterilization process used to sterilize the drug product in its final container-closure system, as well as a description of any other sterilization process(es) used to sterilize delivery sets, components, packaging, bulk drug substance or bulk product, and related items.

Results from a minimum of three consecutive, successful cycles should be provided to ensure that the results are consistent and meaningful.\n2. Thermal Monitors The number of thermal monitors used and their location in the chamber should be described. A diagram is helpful.\n3. The Effects of Loading on Thermal Input Data should be generated with minimum and maximum load to demonstrate the effects of loading on thermal input to product. Additional studies may be necessary if different fill volumes are used in the same container line. Data summaries are acceptable for these purposes. A summary should consist of, for example, high and low temperatures (range), average temperature during the dwell period, minimum and maximum (F_{0}) values, dwell time, run date and time, and identification of the autoclave(s) used. These data should have been generated from studies carried out in production autoclave(s) that will be used for sterilization of the product that is the subject of the application.\n4. Information Included in the Batch Record The batch record supplied with the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls section of the application should identify the validated processes to be used for sterilization and for depyrogenation of any container-closure components. This information can be included in the batch record by reference to the validation protocol or standard operating procedure (SOP). Validation information should be provided as described above.\n\nMicrobiological Efficacy of the Cycle Validation studies that demonstrate the efficacy (Iethality) of the production cycle should be provided. A sterility assurance of 10-6 or better should be demonstrated for any terminal sterilization process. This level of sterility assurance should be demonstrated for all parts of the drug product (including the container and closure, if applicable), which are claimed to be sterile. The specific type of study and the methods used to carry out the study (or studies) are product and process specific and may vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. In general, the following types of information and data should be provided.\n\nIdentification and Characterization of Bioburden Organisms Describe the methods and results from studies used to identify and characterize bioburden organisms. The amount and type of information supplied may be dependent on the validation strategy chosen. For example, more information may be needed for bioburden-based autoclave processes than for overkill processes. Information concerning the number, type, and resistance of bioburden organisms may be necessary, including those organisms associated with the product solution and the container and closure. It may be necessary to identify the most heat-resistant bioburden organisms.\n\nSpecifications for Bioburden Specifications (alert and action levels) for bioburden should be provided. A description should be included of the program for routinely monitoring bioburden to ensure that validated and established limits are not exceeded (e.g., frequency of analysis and methods used in bioburden screening). The methods provided should be specific.\n\nIdentification, Resistance, and Stability of Biological Indicators Information and data concerning the identification, resistance (D and Z values), and stability of biological indicators used in the biological validation of the cycle should be provided. If biological indicators are purchased from a commercial source, it may be necessary to corroborate the microbial count and resistance, and provide performance specifications.\n\nThe Resistance of the Biological Indicator Relative to That of Bioburden Studies characterizing the resistance of the biological indicator relative to that of bioburden may be necessary. Resistance in or on the product (i.e., in the product solution, or on the surface of container or closure parts or interfaces) should be determined as necessary. If spore carriers are used (e.g., spore strips), the resistance of spores on the carrier relative to that of directly inoculated product should be determined, if necessary.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]\n\nunits that have been exposed to the maximum sterilization cycle(s). If a product is exposed to more than one process, then exposure to the maximum cycle of all processes should be incorporated into the study design.\n3. Multiple Barriers Each barrier that separates areas of the drug product claimed to be sterile should be separately evaluated and validated.\n4. The Sensitivity of the Test The sensitivity of the experimental method used for container-closure integrity testing should be specified and provided.\n5. Integrity Over the Product Shelf Life Microbial integrity of the container-closure system should be demonstrated over the shelf life of the product. (See section V.A. of this guidance.)\n\nF. Bacterial Endotoxins Test and Method The bacterial endotoxins test used for the product should be described. The description should include qualification of the laboratory, inhibition and enhancement testing and results, determination of noninhibitory concentration and maximum valid dilution. For further information see the agency guidance entitled ""Guideline on Validation of the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Test As An End-Product Endotoxin Test for Human And Animal Parenteral Drugs, Biological Products, and Medical Devices.""\n6. Sterility Testing Methods and Release Criteria Sterility test methods should be described and should include the protocol for the selection of representative units during production. When test methods differ significantly from compendial test methods, a demonstration of the equivalency to the compendial method should be provided. Testing performed within barrier systems should be described, and information concerning validation of the barrier system may be necessary.\n\nH. Evidence of Formal, Written ProceduresSection 211.113(b) of the Code of Federal Regulations requires that written procedures, designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile, be established and followed. Such procedures should include validation of any sterilization process. Therefore, evidence should be provided that there are formal, written procedures describing the elements listed above and that these procedures are followed. Such evidence may consist of SOP\'s, listing of SOP\'s, and protocols submitted as part of these elements.\n\n3 Other Terminal Sterilization Processes\n--------------------\nContext title: Submission Documentation for Sterilization Process Validation in Applications for Human and Veterinary Drug Products Guidance for Industry'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to applicants on preparing and using comparability protocols for postapproval changes in chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC). The guidance applies to comparability protocols that would be submitted in new animal drug applications (NADAs), abbreviated new animal drug applications (ANADAs), or supplements to these applications. Well-characterized synthetic peptides submitted in these applications are included within the scope of this guidance. This guidance also applies to comparability protocols submitted in investigational new animal drug (INAD), generic investigational new animal drug (JINAD) and veterinary master file (VMF) submissions that are referenced in applications. The FDA is providing this guidance in response to requests from those interested in using comparability protocols.\n\nFDA guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nAs an applicant, you are responsible for assessing, prior to distribution of a product, the effect of any postapproval CMC changes on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the product as these factors relate to the safety or efficacy of the product (section 506A(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act)). Such an assessment often includes demonstration that the pre- and postchange products (i.e., products manufactured prior to and subsequent to a change) are equivalent. Postapproval CMC changes must be reported to FDA in one of four reporting categories (Section 506A of the Act):* Annual Report (AR)1\n\nFootnote 1: The annual report is the Minor Changes and Stability Report (MCSR) according to 21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iii).\n\nThe annual submission to the approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having minimal potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product.\n\nChange-Being-Efficected Supplement (CBE)\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having moderate potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A CBE supplement must be received by FDA before or concurrently with distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nChange-Being-Efficed-in-30-Days Supplement (CBE-30).\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having moderate potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A CBE-30 supplement must be received by FDA at least 30 days before distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nPrior Approval Supplement (PAS)\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having a substantial potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A PAS supplement must be received and approved by FDA prior to distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nIn many cases, using a comparability protocol will facilitate the subsequent implementation and reporting of CMC changes, which could result in moving a product into distribution sooner than if a protocol was not used.\n\nThis guidance describes the general principles and procedures associated with developing and submitting a comparability protocol to the FDA. The guidance also describes the basic elements of a comparability protocol and specific issues to consider when developing comparability protocols for changes in:* the manufacturing process\n* analytical procedures2\n* manufacturing equipment\n* manufacturing facilities\n* container closure systems\n* process analytical technology (PAT)\n\nFootnote 2: The term analytical procedure, as used in this guidance, includes chemical, physical, microbiological, and biological test procedures.\n\nThe guidance also discusses submitting comparability protocols as investigational new animal drug submissions, generic investigational new animal drug submissions and veterinary master file submissions.\n\nAppendix A What is a Comparability Protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs""

These approaches are detailed in the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Guidance for Industry (GFI), ""Q8(R2) Pharmaceutical Development"" (International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use [ICH]) Q8(R2)) (November 2009).1 Product specifications are linked directly to the in vitro release test method.\n\nFootnote 1: https://www.cds.org/\n\nProduct in vitro drug release specifications provide a metric for confirming that the in vivo drug release characteristics will be consistent with the intended therapeutic objectives. Empirical (minimal) approaches base product specifications on batch data at the time of registration, and these specifications then serve as the primary means of product control. In this approach, the prognostic potential of the drug-release method is constrained by the limits of the information about which the specifications can be based. In contrast, the systematic (enhanced) quality-by-design (QbD) approach incorporates product specifications as a component of the overall quality-control (QC) strategy. The QbD approach establishes specifications based upon the design space.\n\nA greater understanding of the product and its manufacturing process may create a basis for flexible and innovative regulatory approaches. But the scope of that flexibility will depend, in part, on the relevant scientific knowledge provided in the registration application. It is the knowledge gained and submitted to the authorities that forms the basis for science- and risk-based submissions and regulatory evaluations.\n\n3 Scope\n\nThis document provides:\n\nSuggestions for development of an in vitro drug release test method\n\nA discussion of the components of a drug release method\n\nThe role of an in vivo/in vitro correlation (IVIVC) or an in vivo/in vitro relationship (IVIVR) in a product application. Throughout this document, we use the term ""IVIVC/R"" to denote text pertaining to IVIVC and/or IVIVR.\n\nMethods for establishing IVIVC/R for a parenteral product\n\nSuggestions for establishing clinically relevant in vitro drug release specifications\n\nMethods for using in vitro product specifications for setting expiry and for supporting batch release\n\nRecommendations for filing information for in vitro drug release methods and data as well as material for the Pharmaceutical Development Report, and Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls technical section for modified-release parenteral dosage forms.\n\nThis guidance does not describe post-approval changes of in vitro methods or development of suitable correlation for oral modified release dosage forms and nanotechnology products.\n\nIV General Considerations for the Development of a Drug Release Method\n\nThe in vitro drug release test method should be established during the early phases of product development so that it can be used to characterize the preliminary formulations, the formulations used in the Target Animal Safety and Effectiveness studies,[20] and to provide the assessment of the stability lots. The establishment of product release specifications should be based upon in vitro performance of those lots used during the pivotal studies used to demonstrate drug product safety and effectiveness. However, a widening of the specifications may be deemed acceptable based upon additional in vivo and in vitro data gathered during product development.\n\nPrior to proceeding with development of the drug release method, the following information should be considered and discussed with CVM:\n\nFormulation development, including assessment of the need for an initial burst release (loading dose) and rate and duration of drug release\n\nAssessment of the excipient(s) or dosage form that may impact the rate and duration of drug release\n\nDevelopment of an in vitro test that adequately describes the formulation attributes\n\nEvaluation of the method as a QC test to support batch release at the initial time point and ensure product performance throughout expiry\n\nEvaluation of the impact of manufacturing process changes on product performance\n\nEvaluation of the impact of changes in supplier of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and critical excipients\n\nSubstantiation of CMC-associated label claims (such as product drug release characteristics).\n\nV In vitro Drug Release Test Method Parameters:\n\nThe in vitro drug release method should be capable of identifying formulation differences that affect in vivo product performance. This necessitates that the method is sensitive to the rate limiting factor impacting in vivo drug release. [11] Method sensitivity can be confirmed during the formulation screening stage. Often, this evaluation compares the results provided across several in vitro release methods. Once a sponsor develops a discriminating system, a consistent set of testing conditions should be maintained across all formulations and manufacturing lots used during target animal safety and clinical effectiveness trials.\n\nIn most circumstances, the in vitro method should employ sink conditions to reflect the relationship between product formulation and the rate and extent of drug release. In those rare situations where sink conditions cannot be achieved, justification for an assay that does not achieve sink conditions should be submitted in a protocol or with the application.\n\nCVM recommends the following information to support the proposed drug release method and apparatus of choice:\n\nDescription of the apparatus used: United States Pharmacopeia (USP) chapters (<)711(>)iv or (<)724(>)v can be referenced if a sponsor uses one of the USP apparatus. If the sponsor selects a different apparatus, the description should include the vessel (shape, dimension, and its material, etc.), motor, shaft, collection basket or device, water bath or heating device, and how a sponsor performs sampling throughout the duration of the test.\n\nDescription of physical design and set up conditions of the apparatus. A picture of the equipment and set up with identification of the specific parts of the equipment is helpful. Include the dimensions and tolerances of the specific components and their related position to the whole assembly.\n\nCharacterization of temperature conditions of the vessel and how they can be maintained consistently during the run.\n\nJustification of apparatus suitability: 1. Determination of the apparatus suitability. This information should include conformance to the measurements (width, length, etc.) and specifications (degree of tolerance) of the specific components. 2. Performance validation and verification of the apparatus: 1. If the apparatus is a USP apparatus, follow the USP procedure as described in (<)711(>) or (<)724(>) to demonstrate the suitability of the apparatus.\n\nIf the apparatus is not described in the USP, information from the manufacturer can be used as a point of reference. 3. Acceptable performance of the apparatus assembly should be verified periodically and the conditions by which the apparatus is deemed acceptable for use should be described.\n\nDescription of the type of media and justification for its selection.\n6 Description of sample and standard preparation, including storage conditions and any precaution in handling and sampling techniques.\n7 Description of other assay parameters; i.e., temperatures, mix rates, duration of the test, degradation rate, release rate, sampling points and techniques, etc.\n\nDemonstration of sink conditions: Provide data that defines the volume of fluid necessary to insure that the concentration of drug in the medium at 100% release does not exceed one-third of the saturation concentration, where saturation concentration is defined by the maximum mg/mL of drug that can be solubilized in the release medium.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #238 Modified Release Veterinary Parenteral Dosage Forms- Development, Evaluation, and Establishment of Specifications'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the guidance for submission of documentation in applications for parametric release of human and veterinary drug products terminally sterilized by moist heat processes?\n--------------------\nContext: Appendix B Public Master Files (PMF'S):\n\nThese files usually contain safety and efficacy information and data that has been generated with public funds. This information is available to the public without the concern for trade secret and confidentiality associated with other types of master files. Public master files do not usually contain manufacturing information. The existence of a public master file is made known through a notice of availability in the Federal Register.\n\nV Submissions to Veterinary Master Files\n\nA. Format, Assembly of Master File Documents\n\nThe information in a master file may be used to support multiple applications (INADA's, NADA's, ANADA's, another VMF or DMF, an export application, or amendments or supplements to any of these).\n\nEach veterinary master file submission should contain a transmittal letter, administrative information about the submission, and the specific information to be included in the VMF.\n\nThe master file should be written in the English language. Whenever a submission contains information in another language, an accurate certified English translation should also be included.\n\nEach page of each copy of the VMF should be consecutively numbered. An updated table of contents should be included with each submission.\n\nAn original and duplicate are to be submitted for all VMF submissions.\n\nVeterinary Master File holders and their agents/representatives should retain a complete reference copy that is identical to, and maintained in the same chronological order as, their submission to FDA.\n\nThe original and duplicate copies must be collated, fully assembled, and individually jacketed. Each volume of a VMF should, in general, be no more than 2 inches thick. For multivolume submissions, each volume should be numbered. For example, for a 3-volume submission, the volumes would be numbered 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3. Additionally, U.S. standard paper size (8 1/2 by 11 inches) is preferred. Paper length should not be less than 10 inches nor more than 12 inches. However, it may occasionally be necessary to use individual pages larger than standard paper size to present a floor plan (for a facility manufacturing sterile drug products), synthesis diagram, etc. Those pages should be folded and mounted to allow the page to be opened for review without disassembling the jacket and refolded without damage when the volume is shelved. The Center's system for filing VMF's provides for assembly on the left side of the page. The left margin should be at least three-fourths of an inch to assure that text is not obscured in the fastened area. The right margin should be at least one-half of an inch. The submitter should punch holes 8 1/2 inches apart in each page.\n\nVeterinary Master File submissions and correspondence should be addressed to:\n\nDocument Control Unit\n\nHFV-199\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Veterinary Medicine\n\nMetro Park North 2 - Room N 403\n\n7500 Standish Place\n\nRockville, MD 20855\n\nDelivery charges to the above address must be prepaid.\n\nThe submission of an original master file will be acknowledged by letter with the designation of a document number, VMF-XXXX.\n\nAppendix B Transmittal Letter\n\nOriginal Submission\n\nThe transmittal letter should contain the following:\n\nIdentification of submission: Original, the type of VMF (II-V), and its subject.\n\nIdentification of the applications, if known, that the VMF is intended to support, including the name and address of each sponsor, and relevant document numbers.\n\nSignature of the holder or the authorized representative.\n\nTypewritten name and title of the signer.\n\n2. Amendments\n\nThe transmittal letter should contain the following:\n\nIdentification of submission: Amendment, the VMF number,\n\nType of VMF, and the subject of the amendment.\n\nA description of the purpose of the submission (e.g., update,\n\nrevised formula, revised process, etc.).\n\nSignature of the holder or the authorized representative.\n\nTypewritten name and title of the signer.\n\nC. Administrative Information\n\nAdministrative information should include the following:\n\n1. Original Submissions: Administrative information for original\n\nsubmissions (Type II-V) should include the following names and\n\naddresses:\n\no VMF holder\n\no Corporate headquarters\n\no Manufacturing/processing facility\n\no Contact for FDA correspondence\n\no Agents, if any\n\no Statement of commitment - A signed statement by the holder\n\ncertifying that the VMF is current and that the VMF holder will\n\ncomply with the statements made in it.\n\n2. Amendments: Administrative information for amendments (Type\n\nII-V) should include the following:\n\no VMF holder\n\no VMF number\n\no Contact for FDA correspondence o Affected section and/or page numbers of the VMF\n\no The name and address of each person whose INADA,\n\nNADA, ANADA, VMF or DMF, or Export application relies\n\non the subject amendment.\n\nVI. Master File Review/Holder obligations\n\nThe contents of a master file (VMF or DMF) will be reviewed by the Center only when the master file holder provides appropriate authorization permitting the FDA to refer to it on behalf of the sponsor. Authorization must be in the form of a letter, a copy of which should be available in the application\n\n(INADA, NADA, ANADA, Export Application, or amendments and\n\nsupplements to any of these).\n\nBefore making significant changes in processes covered in the master file (VMF or DMF), the master file holder must notify each sponsor. The sponsor is required by regulation to supplement or amend the affected application(s).\n\nA Veterinary Master File will only be reviewed in conjunction with an\n\napplication (INADA, NADA, ANADA, Export Application, or amendments\n\nand supplements to these applications). Previously, the Center routinely\n\nreviewed submissions (original and amendments to VMF's) that were not\n\nnecessarily linked to a specific application, but for which authorization for\n\nFDA review were provided. In some instances, these master files were never\n\nreferenced in support of a pending application. The Center has concluded that\n\nthe routine review and evaluation of Veterinary Master Files not specifically\n\nreferenced in applications may be a waste of resources. Therefore, the routine\n\nevaluation of updates and amendments to Veterinary Master Files will be\n\ndiscontinued. This change in the Center's review process only serves to\n\nemphasize that the affected applicants must be notified of significant changes\n\nin a Veterinary Master File that require the submission of an amendment or\n\nsupplemental application. At that time, the Center (with appropriate\n\nauthorization) will refer to the Veterinary Master File and evaluate the change in process, etc., and the impact of these changes on the affected application.\n\nAcceptance of a master file is granted only upon the satisfactory review of the file contents. During the course of the review of a master file, should the information be considered deficient, the holder will be notified by the Center.Communications relevant to the contents of the master file are made by the Center directly with the responsible holder of the master file. At the same time, the Center will notify the person who relies on the information in a deficient DMF or VMF that additional information is needed in the supporting master file, and that separate communication detailing the deficiencies has been sent to the master file holder. While the general subject of the deficiencies may be identified, the details of the master file deficiencies are disclosed only to the master file holder. When the holder submits the requested information to the master file in response to the Center's deficiency letter, the holder should also send a copy of the accompanying transmittal letter to the affected persons relying on the master file. The transmittal letter will provide notice that the deficiencies have been addressed.\n\nThe master file should be routinely updated on an annual basis to assure that operations are current and information correct. A current list of authorized users of the file should be maintained.\n\nVII. Confidentiality of Information\n\nAll information contained in a master file (DMF or VMF) is considered confidential. Further, it is Center policy not to make known the existence of specific master files. Rather, it is the responsibility of a sponsor to make sure that a master file (DMF or VMF) is available and request authorization for FDA referral.\n\nVIII.

34,"As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?","[""--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.2.1 Premarket Approval Applications (PMA)\n\nPMA approval is required by FDA before devices that are class III25 can be legally marketed.26 PMA approval is based on a determination by FDA that the PMA contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to reasonably assure that the device or device-led combination product is safe and effective for its intended use(s).27 Sponsors should ensure that PMA applications for device-led combination products contain sufficient data to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the combination product as a whole, including data regarding all constituent part(s). The PMA includes sections containing, among other things, technical data, non-clinical laboratory studies, and clinical investigations.28 Before approving or denying a PMA, the appropriate FDA advisory committee29 may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide FDA with the committee's recommendation on whether FDA should approve the submission.30\n\nFootnote 25: Class III devices are devices (1) for which there is insufficient information to determine that general controls and special controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, and (2) which are purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury (see section 513(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act).\n\n2.2.2 De Novo Classification Requests\n\nDevices of a new type that FDA has not previously classified or reclassified based on the criteria in section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act are automatically classified into class III by operation of section 513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, and may be classified into class I or class II under the De Novo classification process.\n\nIf a sponsor believes its product is appropriate for classification into class I31 or class II,32 it may submit a request for De Novo classification.33 If the sponsor demonstrates that the criteria in section 513(a)(1)(A) or (B) of the FD&C Act are met, FDA grants the request for De Novo classification and issues a written order classifying the specific product and product type in class I or class II. If the product is classified as class II, it is granted marketing authorization subject to general controls, as well as identified special controls which provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.34 Such a product may serve as a legally marketed (predicate)35 product for future 510(k) submissions. If the product cannot be classified as class I or II, the De Novo request is declined and the product remains in class III and subject to PMA approval.\n\nFootnote 31: Class I products are subject to a set of regulatory authorities called general controls (see section 513(a)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act). General controls include, but are not limited to, provisions that relate to establishment registration and listing, premarket notification, prohibitions against adulteration and misbranding, records and reports, and good manufacturing practices.\n\nFootnote 32: Class II products are products for which general controls, by themselves, are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the product, and for which there is sufficient information to establish special controls necessary to provide such assurance (see section 513(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act). Special controls are product type-specific and may include promulgation of performance standards, requirements for postmarket surveillance, patient registries, labeling, and performance testing and clinical/non-clinical data.\n\nFootnote 33: See section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 860, subpart D (86 FR 54826, October 5, 2021). See also the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff De Novo Classification Process (Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation)(October 2021).\n\nFootnote 34: Such special controls will generally be established through consultation and alignment with the non-lead center.\n\nFootnote 35: A legally marketed (predicate) device to which a new device may be compared for a determination regarding substantial equivalence is a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, or a device which has been reclassified from class III to class II or I, or a device which has been found to be substantially equivalent through the 510(k) premarket notification process (see 21 CFR 807.92(a)(3)).\n\nFootnote 36: See sections 513(a)(1)(B), 513(f)(1), 513(i), and 515(a)(2) of the FD&C Act; S. REP. NO. 105-43 at 35 (1997).\n\nFootnote 37: See section 513(f)(2)(A)(ii) and (iv) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 38: For example, blood, gene therapies, or human cellular or tissue products.\n\nSpecial controls set forth criteria for class II products that are necessary to provide the assurance of safety and effectiveness to justify classification in class II. To be class II by being within the same type as the product that was the subject of the De Novo, future products must be found substantially equivalent and comply with general controls and applicable special controls for the product type; a failure to comply with special controls will cause the product to be class III and subject to PMA approval.36\n\nFootnote 36: See sections 513(a)(1)(B), 513(f)(1), 513(i), and 515(a)(2) of the FD&C Act; S. REP. NO. 105-43 at 35 (1997).\n\nA sponsor may request De Novo classification without submitting a 510(k) first; FDA may decline to undertake such request if FDA identifies a predicate product that could provide a reasonable basis for review of substantial equivalence, or if FDA determines either that the product submitted is not of low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls to mitigate the risks cannot be developed.37 Among other considerations, understanding of the biological product or drug constituent parts, including limitations of such understanding, need to be considered when determining the suitability of the De Novo pathway for such device-led combination products. Because certain products present unique concerns (such as, for certain biological products,38 considerations associated with infectious disease transmission and challenges associated with ensuring reproducibility of such biological products), management of such concerns should be considered in determining the suitability of the De Novo pathway.\n\nSee annex for illustrative examples on how these principles can be applied.\n\niii.1.3 Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions\n\nThe 510(k) review standard (substantial equivalence of a new product to a predicate product) differs from the PMA and De Novo review standards. The 510(k) review standard is comparative, whereas the PMA and De Novo review standards rely on an independent demonstration of safety and effectiveness. Nonetheless, the principles of safety and effectiveness underlie the substantial equivalence determination in every 510(k) review.\n\nThe standard for a determination of substantial equivalence in a 510(k) review is set out in section 513(i) of the FD&C Act. A product is substantially equivalent to a predicate product if it:\n\nhas the same intended use as the predicate product; and\n\nhas the same technological characteristics as the predicate product;\n\nor\n\nhas the same intended use as the predicate product;\n\nhas different technological characteristics39; and\n\nthe information submitted to FDA, including appropriate clinical or scientific data if deemed necessary, demonstrates that the product:\n\nFootnote 39: Different technological characteristics are defined as “significant change in the materials, design, energy source, or other features” from the predicate. Section 513(i)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 807.100(b)(2)(ii)(A).\n\ndoes not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate product; and\n\ndemonstrates that the product is as safe and effective as the predicate product.40\n\nFootnote 40: See section 513(i)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act; 21 CFR 807.100(b). See also the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications [510(k)].\n\nFDA considers the product's relative safety and effectiveness in the substantial equivalence determination, and safety and effectiveness considerations are also critical to the Agency's evaluation of compliance with any applicable special controls, all of which FDA has determined to be necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the product type.\n\nThe following products cannot be cleared in a 510(k) submission:\n\nProduct with a new intended use as compared to the predicate product\n\nProduct with different technological characteristics than the predicate product if such differences raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate product.41\n\nFootnote 41: Ibid.\n\nGenerally, a device that is not combined with a drug or biological product constituent part could not be successfully used as a predicate for a 510(k) for a device-led combination product. This is because the addition of the drug or biological product constituent part would likely result in a new intended use and/or constitute a different technological characteristic that raises different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate. In addition, a product with a different active ingredient from a predicate would differ significantly in features such as design and materials, which would likely raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as well.42\n\nFootnote 42: In certain instances, it may be possible for special controls to specify multiple specific active ingredients or an active ingredient class, provided general and special controls are sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the product.\n--------------------\nContext title: Principles of Premarket Pathways for Combination Products Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff""

FDA believes that data and information gathered in the postmarket setting are critical to our continued confidence in the safety and effectiveness of the marketed device. Annual reports are one of the important tools that FDA relies on to gather information about the device in its post-approval setting.\n\nAnnual reports contain a variety of information, including information about manufacturing changes, design changes, and labeling changes that were made during the preceding year for the PMA product. This guidance recommends that this and other information be analyzed and presented in annual reports in a way that will be most useful to both the applicant and FDA. For example, the guidance recommends that the applicant describe in detail the rationale for changes made to the device, including, for example, whether the changes were the result of device improvement/enhancement, product complaints, or adverse events. This explanation will give FDA a more complete picture of the post-market safety profile of the device. The guidance also recommends that the applicant include a summary of all changes that were made to the device during the reporting period, including listing all supplements submitted during the reporting period and, if approved, their approval date. Having the information submitted in this way will help ensure that limited Agency resources are devoted to assessing meaningful information rather than requiring FDA to sift through vast amounts of data that have not been systematically reviewed by the firm.\n\nAnnual reports that contain clear descriptions and meaningful information are an important tool for the Agency and the industry to assure postmarket safety and protect the public. When applicants prepare and provide to FDA in annual reports the type of analysis this guidance describes, industry and FDA are better positioned to recognize and address possible safety issues.\n\nRegulatory Background\n\nIn PMA approval orders, FDA requires that PMA applicants submit post-approval periodic reports (e.g., annual reports at intervals of 1 year (unless otherwise specified) from the date of approval of the original PMA) to FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 814.82(a)(7) and 814.84(b). Section 814.84(b) describes the information required to be included in periodic reports.\n\nUnless FDA specifies otherwise, a periodic report must:\n\nIdentify changes described in 21 CFR 814.39(a) and changes required to be reported to FDA under 21 CFR 814.39(b); and\n\nContain a summary and bibliography of the following information not previously submitted as part of the PMA:1. Unpublished reports of data from any clinical investigations or nonclinical laboratory studies involving the device or related devices and known to or that reasonably should be known to the applicant. ii. Reports in the scientific literature concerning the device and known to or that reasonably should be known to the applicant.\n\nIf, after reviewing the summary and bibliography, FDA concludes that the Agency needs a copy of the unpublished or published reports, FDA will notify the applicant that copies of such reports shall be submitted.\n\nThe PMA applicant is primarily responsible for determining whether changes to the device design, labeling, or manufacturing processes impact safety or effectiveness and, thus, require a PMA Supplement or 30-Day Notice. This guidance is not intended to define when a PMA applicant should submit a new original PMA or any type of PMA Supplement. For that type of guidance, please refer to the FDA guidance, ""Modifications to Devices Subject to\n\nPremarket Approval (PMA) - The PMA Supplement Decision-Making Process.""1\n\nFootnote 1: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/modifications-devices-subject-premarket-approval-pma-pma-supplement-decision-making-process\n\nPMA applicants are also subject to other reporting requirements. In accordance with 21 CFR 814.84(a), the applicant must comply with Medical Device Reporting (MDR) requirements, 21 CFR Part 803, and any applicable requirements in other regulations or by order approving the device, including Post-Approval Study Reports if FDA has imposed continuing evaluation (post-approval study) requirements on the device in the PMA approval order, 21 CFR 814.82(a)(2).\n\nFDA believes that the types of information described in this guidance and the types of review, summary, and analyses we are recommending should be readily available to applicants because they currently collect this information and conduct these analyses as part of their compliance with the quality system regulations (21 CFR Part 820). For example, design controls already require the type of look back and assessment that we are suggesting be part of the annual report (21 CFR 820.30).\n\nIII. Scope\n\nIn the PMA approval orders, we typically specify that PMA applicants submit a report one (1) year from the date of approval of the original PMA and annually thereafter. Therefore, the periodic report is usually referred to as an ""annual report."" There may be circumstances, however, where FDA specifies more frequent periodic reports that provide all of the same information that is reported annually. This guidance addresses FDA\'s expectations concerning annual and other periodic reports. This guidance addresses but does not describe in detail Post-Approval Study reports (see Section VI).\n\nIV Contents of an Annual Report\n\nA complete annual report (in an acceptable eCopy format)2 should include all of the information described below. The eCopy must be accompanied by a single paper copy of your signed cover letter.\n\nFootnote 2: Please refer to the FDA guidance, “eCopy Program for Medical Device Submissions” (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/ecopy-program-medical-device-submissions), for additional information on the eCopy program.\n\nCover Letter for an Annual Report\n\nFDA recommends that the applicant include a cover letter for the PMA annual report. The cover letter should include:\n\nPMA Number\n\nDevice Name (including device family name or model names and numbers)\n\nCompany Name\n\nDate of Report\n\nReporting Period (i.e., the dates the reporting period begins and ends)\n\nIdentification of the Changes Made During the Reporting Period\n\nFor changes that are the subject of an approved or pending PMA Supplement or 30-Day Notice submitted in the reporting year, we recommend that the applicant identify the document number assigned by FDA and status of the document (e.g., approved with approval date, or pending).\n\nCertain changes related to the device documentation or manufacturing process documentation, such as rewording for clarification, translating from one language to another, correcting typographical errors, and moving component characteristics from a notation in an engineering drawing to a different document, such as an Standard Operating Procedure, generally do not need to be reported in the annual report (21 CFR 814.39(b)). In general, such changes do not affect the design, performance, labeling, or processing of the device, and affect only how the characteristics are documented. These types of changes have been commonly referred to as ""document to file"" by industry and should be kept in your design history file.\n\nFor each change that was identified as an annual reportable change that did not require a PMA Supplement or 30-Day Notice under 21 CFR 814.39(b), we recommend you identify the following, as applicable:\n\ndescription of the change made, including a comparison to the previously approved version;\n--------------------\nContext title: Annual Reports for Approved Premarket Approval Applications (PMA) Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nAppendix I Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this guidance document is to provide industry and FDA staff with information regarding the premarket approval application (PMA) modular review program and to outline the procedures for submitting or reviewing a modular PMA.\n\nThis guidance supersedes and replaces the documents entitled, ""A Modular Approach to PMA Review,"" dated January 29, 1998, and ""Guidance for the Medical Device Industry on PMA Shell Development and Modular Review,"" issued on November 6, 1998 (hereinafter referred to as the 1998 Guidances).\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nAppendix II Background\n\nIn a traditional PMA, the applicant submits all PMA data, as outlined in 21 CFR 814.20, at the same time, regardless of when testing is completed. FDA begins its review only upon receipt of all the required information In 1998, however, as part of CDRH\'s reengineering effort, FDA issued the above mentioned guidances. In these documents, FDA described a new policy whereby applicants could submit ""Modular PMAs."" The goal of FDA\'s 1998 Guidances was to increase the efficiency of the PMA review process by allowing applicants to submit discrete sections (modules) of the PMA to FDA for review soon after completing the testing and analysis.\n\nFDA intends the modular review approach to provide a mechanism by which applicants may submit preclinical data and manufacturing information for review while still collecting, compiling, and analyzing the clinical data. Therefore, a modular PMA is a compilation of sections or ""modules"" submitted at different times that together become a complete application. Additionally, the modular approach allows the applicant to potentially resolve any deficiencies noted by FDA earlier in the review process than would occur with a traditional PMA application.\n\nOn October 26, 2003, the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUMFA), Pub lic Law 107-250 was enacted. Section 209 of MDUFMA amended the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the act) to codify the modular review approach.1 In recognition that the agency would need to issue updated guidance to reflect the new statutory provision n, FDA requested comments on its modular PMA review program. On February 4, 2003, FDA published a Federal Register notice entitled, ""Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, Establishment of a Public Docket (68 FR 5643)(hereinafter referred to as the MDUFMA Docket). In addition, FDA issued a guidance entitled, ""Assessing User Fees: PMA Supplement Definitions, Modular PMA Fees, BLA and Efficacy Supplement Definitions, Bundling Multiple Devices in a Single Application, and Fees for Combination Products.""2 In the guidance, FDA asked for comments on the various topics discussed in the document, including modular review of PMAs.\n\nFootnote 1: Section 515(c) of the act, as amended by section 209 of MDUFMA.\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance was issued on February 25, 2003 and can be found at www.fda.gov/cdrh/mdufma/guidance/1201.html (hereinafter referred to as the Assessing User Fees guidance.)\n\nSince 1998, FDA has gained considerable experience with modular PMA submissions. Based on FDA\'s experience prior to the enactment of MDUFMA and comments submitted to the MDUFMA Docket, FDA is issuing this guidance to replace the 1998 Guidances. These changes include:\n\nclarifying that modular review should be limited to original PMAs (i.e., modular review is not ordinarily appropriate for PMA supplements)\n\nmodifying the procedures for preparing and submitting a modular PMA\n\nexplaining the significance of timing for submission of the modules\n\nrevising the sample shell and specifying the expected content of the modules\n\nsuggesting limitations to the total number of modules that should be submitted.\n\nThe agency expects these changes to: 1) help clarify which PMAs are appropriate for modular review, 2) simplify submission procedures, and 3) improve the efficiency of FDA\'s review. Additionally, we have added guidance addressing user fee payment procedures for modular PMAs.\n\nThe Least Burdensome Approach\n--------------------\nContext title: Premarket Approval Application Modular Review Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'

The additional funds obtained from user fees will enable FDA, with the cooperation of industry, to improve the device review process to meet certain performance goals and implement improvements for the medical device review process.\n\nFootnote 1: See Title II of the FDA User Fee Reauthorization Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-180).\n\nPerformance goals were negotiated and agreed to under MDUFA V for PMAs received in FY 2023-2027. These performance goals and process improvements are outlined in the letter from the Secretary of Health and Human Services to Congress2 (MDUFA V Commitment Letter) and are further described below.\n\nFootnote 2: See 168 CONG. REC. S5194-S5203 (daily ed. September 28, 2022) (Food and Drug Administration User Fee Reauthorization). The MDUFA V Commitment Letter is also available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/media/158308/download.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. Scope\n\nThis guidance document describes:\n\nthe different FDA actions that may be taken on premarket approval applications (PMAs);\n\n2027); and\n\nthe different industry actions that may be taken on PMAs.\n\nIII. FDA Actions\n\nThe PMA regulation outlines the various actions FDA may take on an original PMA or PMA supplement during the course of our review.3 For original PMAs, panel-track supplements, and 180-day supplements,4 the following responses are considered FDA actions:\n\nFootnote 3: See 21 CFR Part 814, Subpart C.\n\nFootnote 4: For more detailed information, see FDA’s guidance document, “User Fees and Refunds for Premarket Approval Applications and Device Biologics Licences Applications,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/user-fees-and-refunds-premarket-approval-applications-and-device-biologics-license-applications or the guidance document entitled, “Modifications to Devices Subject to Premarket Approval (PMA) - The PMA Supplement Decision-Making Process,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/modifications-devices-subject-premarket-approval-pma-pma-supplement-decision-making-process.\n\napproval order;\n\napprovable letter;\n\nmajor deficiency letter;\n\nnot approvable letter; and\n\ndenial order.\n\nFor real-time supplements, all of the above responses apply with the exception of a major deficiency letter.\n\nFurthermore, of these FDA actions, all but a major deficiency letter are a ""MDUFA decision"" under FDA\'s commitment letters and are measured against a MDUFA IV/V goal. These FDA actions are described below.\n\nAppendix A Approval Order\n\nFDA will issue an approval order (letter) informing the applicant that the PMA is approved and that the applicant may begin commercial distribution of the device in accordance with any prescribed conditions of approval after we have completed our review and:\n\nnone of the reasons listed in 21 CFR 814.45 for denying approval applies;\n\nthere is reasonable assurance the device is safe and effective (using the criteria provided in 21 CFR 860.7) for its intended use as prescribed in the product labeling; and\n\nthe device manufacturing facilities, methods, and controls were found to be in compliance with the Quality System regulation (21 CFR Part 820).\n\nAn approval order shuts off the review clock, marks the end of FDA review, and is considered a final action.\n\nAppendix B Approvable Letter\n\nFDA will issue an approvable letter informing the applicant that we have completed our review of the application and determined that there needs to be:\n\nresolution of minor deficiencies,5 which are identified in the approvable letter (21CFR 814.44(e)); and/or Footnote 5: Minor deficiencies may include, for example, clarifications of previously submitted information, revisions to the labeling, and revisions/development of a post approval study protocol.\n\ncompletion of an FDA inspection that finds the manufacturing facilities, methods, and controls in compliance with the Quality System (QS) regulation, 21 CFR Part 820, and, if applicable, verifies records pertinent to the PMA as per 21 CFR 814.44(e)(1)(iii). When this is the case, the approvable letter states that the device is ""approvable pending GMP inspection.""\n\nWhen FDA issues an approvable letter pending resolution of minor deficiencies, we stop the review clock and place the application on hold. When FDA receives a complete response to an approvable letter, we will resume the clock with a new FDA response timeframe to reach a final decision. FDA will issue a decision within 60 calendar days of the sponsor\'s response to the approvable letter, as resources permit, but not to the detriment of meeting the quantitative review timelines and statutory obligations.\n\nWhen FDA issues an approvable pending GMP inspection letter, we stop the review clock. Once FDA determines that the device manufacturing facilities, methods, and controls arefound to be in compliance with the Quality System regulation, 21 CFR part 820, we will issue an approval order.\n\nAppendix C Major Deficiency Letter\n\nFDA will issue a major deficiency letter6 informing the applicant that the PMA lacks significant information necessary for FDA to complete our review and requests the applicant to amend the application to provide the necessary information regarding the device (21 CFR 814.37(b)), such as:\n\nFootnote 6: For additional information about deficiencies, see FDA’s guidance document, “Developing and Responding to Deficiencies in Accordance with the Least Burdensome Provisions,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/developing-and-responding-deficiencies-accordance-least-burdensome-provisions.\n\na detailed re-analysis of previously submitted data (e.g., alternative statistical method);\n\nadditional test data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the device (e.g., electromagnetic compatibility, electrical safety, biocompatibility, reliability, software, labeling, animal testing, sensitivity and specificity in a certain population);\n\nscientific rationale for test data critical to determining reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device provided in the submission; or\n\nnew validation data and analyses (e.g., due to device modifications made during the course of the PMA review).\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA and Industry Actions on Premarket Approval Applications (PMAs)- Effect on FDA Review Clock and Goals Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: 3 Glossary\n\nExempt device\n\nA device that is used in a manner consistent with the criteria for an exempt investigation as outlined in 21 CFR 812.2(c).\n\nInvestigational in vitro diagnostic (IVD)\n\nAn investigational IVD is an IVD ""that is the object of an investigation"" (21 CFR 812.3(g)). An investigation is defined as a ""clinical investigation or research involving one or more subjects to determine the safety or effectiveness of a device"" (21 CFR 812.3(h)). A subject is defined as ""a human who participates in an investigation, either as an individual on whom or on whose specimen an investigational device is used on or as a control"" and ""may be in normal health or may have a medical condition or disease"" (21 CFR 812.3(p)).\n\nInvestigational device exemption (21 CFR 812)\n\nAn exemption that permits a sponsor to lawfully ship a device that otherwise would be required to comply with a performance standard or to have premarket approval. The exemption is for the purpose of conducting investigations of that device.\n\nInvestigational new drug (21 CFR 312.3)\n\nA new drug or biological product used in a clinical investigation. The term also refers to a biological product that is also an IVD used in a clinical investigation.\n\nNoninvasive\n\nAs defined in 21 CFR 812.3(k), noninvasive, when applied to a diagnostic device or procedure, means one that does not by design or intention: (1) Penetrate or pierce the skin or mucous membranes of the body, the ocular cavity, or the urethra, or (2) enter the ear beyond the external auditory canal, the nose beyond the nares, the mouth beyond the pharynx, the anal canal beyond the rectum, or the vagina beyond the cervical os. For purposes of this part, blood sampling that involves simple venipuncture is considered noninvasive, and the use of surplus samples of body fluids or tissues that are left over from samples taken for noninvestigational purposes is also considered noninvasive.\n\nNonsignificant risk device\n\nA device that does not meet the definition of a significant risk device (see below and 21 CFR 812.3(m)).1 FDA may consider certain nonexempt investigational IVDs in a therapeutic product trial to present risks that are not considered significant. In such cases, the investigational IVD is considered to be nonsignificant risk.\n\nFootnote 1: For more information about nonsignificant risk studies, see the information sheet guidance for institutional review boards, clinical investigators, and sponsors Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies (January 2006). FDA has also issued the draft guidance for industry, FDA staff, sponsors, and IRBs Investigational IVDs Used in Clinical Investigations of Therapeutic Products (December 2017), for commenting purposes. When final, this guidance will represent the FDA’s current thinking on factors to consider in making a risk determination. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nSignificant risk device\n\nUnder 21 CFR 812.3(m), a significant risk device means an investigational device that:Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigational In Vitro Diagnostics in Oncology Trials- Streamlined Submission Process for Study Risk Determination Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: YourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketApprovalPMA/ucm142714.htm\n\n20. How do I arrange to reference a MAF?\n\nYou, the sponsor, should contact the company that owns the information you would like to incorporate by reference in your premarket submission to FDA, and find out if this information is currently in a master file. If it is, you should obtain a written authorization from the master file holder (or an authorized designated agent/representative) on company letterhead. You should include the original authorization letter in the original copy of the premarket submission to FDA, and a copy of the authorization letter in each subsequent copy of the premarket submission. The master file holder should not send the authorization letter directly to FDA for inclusion in the master file or for inclusion in your premarket submission.\n\nIf the information you, the sponsor, would like to incorporate by reference in yourpremarket submission to FDA is not already in a master file, you should request that the company that owns this information submit a master file to FDA.\n\nFor more information on referencing MAFs see the CDRH website at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarke\n\ntYourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketApprovalPMA/ucm142714.htm.\n\nIV. Investigational Studies\n\n1. What does FDA consider to be valid scientific evidence?\n\nValid scientific evidence is defined in the ""Medical Device Classification Procedures"" regulation, 21 CFR Part 860, as:\n\nEvidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience with a marketed device, from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device under its conditions of use (21 CFR 860.7(c)(2)).\n\nThe intended use of the IVD, the level and quality of information in the literature relevant to the device use, and FDA knowledge of the technology obtained from reviewing other premarket applications determine the type of study and the level of evidence you may need to demonstrate reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness. For example, if you are studying an IVD device that uses a well-characterized technology and has an intended use that falls within a type of device that has been classified into Class I or Class II, the study may consist of a comparison of analytic performance to that of a legally marketed (i.e., predicate) device. On the other hand, if your IVD uses novel or unproven technology or has a new intended use, you may need to conduct a well-planned clinical study of the device in the target population defined by your intended use. You may contact the Division in the appropriate Center if you have questions regarding the type of study you need to conduct for your device.\n\nWe recommend that sponsors and investigators of all studies, including exempt studies under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3), conduct the studies with the following goals in mind: producing valid scientific evidence of the product\'s safety and effectiveness and protecting the rights and welfare of study subjects. Sponsors and investigators of significant and non-significant risk studies must comply with the regulation requirements in 21 CFR Part 812. FDA recommends that sponsors and investigators of studies exempt from the majority of requirements under 21 CFR Part 812 use the relevant sections of 21 CFR Part 812 regarding the general conduct of device studies as guidance. (General Regulatory Issues, Section III of this guidance, discusses how 21 CFR Part 812 may apply to a particular IVD study.)\n\n2. Why should I review the information regarding the conduct of device studies found in the IDE regulation even if, after considering the exemption criteria in the regulation, I determine that my proposed studies are exempt from most IDE requirements?\n\nSome studies are exempt from most of 21 CFR Part 812 because of the low risk they pose to study subjects. However, studies that will support a PMA or other premarket submission should have the same goals as all other device studies: 1) to produce valid scientific evidence to support reasonable assurance of a product\'s safety and effectiveness, and 2) to protect study subjects. Therefore, the information in 21 CFR Part 812 will also be useful to sponsors and investigators of device studies exempt under 21 CFR 812.2(c). In addition, all studies that will support applications to FDA are subject to 21 CFR 812.119(c) as well as to 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56.\n\n3. Should I review the ""International Conference on Harmonization; Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline"" (""ICHGCP"") published in the Federal Register Vol. 62, No. 90, May 9, 1997, pp. 25691-25709 or the draft ISO 14155, ""Clinical Investigation of Medical Devices for Human Subjects,"" when developing studies for devices that fall within the exemption at 21 CFR 812.2(c)?\n\nAlthough the ICH document was written for studies of pharmaceuticals, sections of the guidance address study issues common to all investigational products. Thus, these sections of the ICH GCP provide a useful reference regarding the proper conduct of studies.\n\nThe draft ISO document specifically states that it does not apply to IVD devices. The draft ISO document is an international document intended to reflect basic practices appropriate to clinical trials worldwide. It does not include all of FDA\'s specific requirements for clinical studies and is not presently a standard that FDA has officially recognized; therefore, we do not recommend that you rely on it.\n\n4. Is FDA willing to review and discuss a study protocol even if the study is exempt from most of the 21 CFR Part 812 requirements?\n\nYes. Both CDRH and CBER have developed processes that allow sponsors to obtain early FDA input and review of proposed studies by submission of the protocol and other study materials in the form of a ""pre-IDE"" document and/or a discussion in the form of a ""pre-IDE"" meeting. While we refer to this early input as a ""pre-IDE"" process, it is also available for studies that are exempt from most IDE requirements under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3) or that will be conducted under the abbreviated IDE regulations for NSR studies (21 CFR 812.2). FDA encourages use of the pre-IDE submission and/or meeting whenever the sponsor desires early feedback for clinical studies, particularly those for novel or high risk (Class III) devices. If you (the sponsor) are interested in submitting a pre-IDE, werecommend that you contact the Division that will review your device before you initiate your studies (See Introduction, Section II, question # 4 of this guidance). Use of the pre-IDE process does not obligate you in any way to future submission of an IDE. FDA also encourages continued communication throughout the course of the study. This communication can be in the form of an informational meeting/telephone call or status reports to the pre-IDE file.\n\n5. Can I obtain a more formal evaluation of my study design or investigational plan through a determination and/or agreement meeting?\n\nYes, for Class III IVDs. (See the Glossary for definition of terms.) A guidance document regarding these meetings, ""Early Collaboration Meetings Under the FDA Modernization Act (FDAMA); Final Guidance for Industry and for CDRH Staff,"" is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo\n\ncuments/ucm073604.htm. CBER also follows this meeting guidance document when determination and/or agreement meetings are requested.\n\n6. Under 21 CFR Part 812, what are the sponsor\'s and investigator\'s responsibilities for studies of a non-significant risk device conducted under the abbreviated requirements in 21 CFR Part 812?\n\nThe majority of the sponsor\'s and investigator\'s responsibilities in a study of a nonsignificant risk device are found in 21 CFR 812.2(b)(1) of the IDE regulation and are summarized below:\n\na. Label the device in accordance with 21 CFR 812.5;\n\nb. Obtain IRB approval of the investigation after presenting the reviewing IRB with a brief explanation of why the device is not a significant risk device, and maintain such approval.\n\nc. Ensure that each investigator participating in an investigation of the device obtains from each subject under the investigator\'s care, informed consent under part 50 and documents it, unless documentation is waived by an IRB under 21 CFR 56.109(c).\n\nd. Comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 812.46 with respect to monitoring investigations;\n\ne. Maintain the records required under 21 CFR 812.140(b)(4) and (5) and make the reports required under 21 CFR 812.150 (b)(1) through (3) and (5) through (10);\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff']",['A premarket approval (PMA) application is the most stringent type of device marketing application for medical devices.

To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended for domestic and foreign facilities that are required to register as food facilities under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) because they manufacture, process, pack, or hold animal food for consumption in the U.S. This guidance contains information to help these facilities determine whether they need to comply with the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements for animal food established in the Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals final rule published on September 17, 2015 (80 FR 56170) (the final rule). This guidance also provides additional information and recommendations for compliance with the CGMP requirements for animal food, as well as compliance with related requirements such as training and recordkeeping. The CGMP requirements are codified in 21 CFR part 507, subpart B (subpart B), and some related requirements are codified in 21 CFR part 507, subparts A and F (subparts A and F).\n\nFDA\'s (hereinafter also referred to as ""Agency"", ""we"", or ""our"") guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance describes the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nOn January 4, 2011, President Obama signed into law the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) (Pub. L. 111-353). This law enables FDA to better protect public health by helping to ensure the safety and security of the animal food supply by focusing on prevention of food safety problems rather than reacting to problems after they occur. As part of our implementation of FSMA, we established risk-based preventive control requirements for the production of animal food by food facilities required to register under section 415 of the FD&C Act (see section 418 of the FD&C Act). At the same time, we established Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (CGMPs) for the manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding of animal food under section 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act and sections 311, 361, and 368 of the Public Health Service Act.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]\n\nthe hazard is not a ""hazard requiring a preventive control,"" the facility does not need to establish preventive controls, or preventive control management components, for these hazards.1\n\nFootnote 1: We intend to provide more information regarding our current thinking on the evaluation and documentation of prerequisite programs in a hazard analysis in Draft Guidance for Industry (GFI) #245 – Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals.\n\nIn some situations, implementation of a prerequisite program alone may not be sufficient for a facility to determine that a hazard does not require a preventive control. If a facility determines that a hazard requires a preventive control, the facility must identify and implement a preventive control to significantly minimize or prevent the hazard and include that preventive control in its written food safety plan (21 CFR 507.34(a)(1) and (b)). The hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls in 21 CFR part 507, subpart C require a facility to identify and control hazards specific to the facility and the animal food it produces which, based on the hazard analysis, are not sufficiently mitigated by CGMPs or other prerequisite programs in place at the facility. In establishing a preventive control for a hazard, the facility may choose to use a procedure that it is already performing, such as a CGMP procedure alone or in combination with other procedures, as the preventive control. This procedure would then be subject to all of the applicable requirements for a preventive control, including monitoring, corrective actions, verification, and validation (21 CFR 507.39).\n\nFor example, a facility may use a flushing procedure as a sanitation measure to clean and maintain equipment surfaces to meet CGMP requirements. If a facility determines that cross-contamination between batches of certain types of animal foods may result in a hazard requiring a preventive control, the facility may wish to use a flushing procedure as their preventive control. In that situation, the flushing procedure would need to be identified as the preventive control in the food safety plan. The flushing procedure would then need to be monitored, verified, and validated when it is being used as a preventive control.\n\n2 Flexible CGMPs for a diverse industry\n\nThe CGMPs serve as baseline standards for producing safe animal food for various types of animal food facilities and animal foods. As the CGMPs were developed, we considered the diversity of the industry and the ultimate goal of animal food safety. We added flexibility where appropriate to address the diversity of facilities, the wide range of animal food activities a facility might engage in, and the potential safety risks posed by some animal foods. These flexible CGMP requirements can be applied in various animal food production settings. In particular, there may be significant differences in how these CGMPs are implemented in facilities where undesirable microorganisms are a food safety concern for the type of animal food produced compared to facilities producing an animal food that is not as likely to be affected by undesirable microorganisms. This guidance provides additional explanation and examples for facilities to implement these CGMPs based on their unique facility and type of animal food.\n\nComplying with the CGMPs\n\nCGMPs serve as baseline standards for producing safe animal food, including preventing insanitary conditions in the production of animal food. Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held according to CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a)(1)(i-ii) and section 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act). Full compliance with the CGMP provisions should reduce the likelihood that the animal food will be manufactured/processed, packed, or held under insanitary conditions (conditions that may cause the animal food to become contaminated or rendered injurious to health) or be otherwise unfit for food. An animal food does not need to contain a harmful substance to be adulterated.\n\nCompliance with CGMPs also should reduce the likelihood that the animal food will be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the FD&C Act.2 FDA will consider the risk and impact to public health in determining whether to pursue regulatory action because of a CGMP violation.\n\nFootnote 2: Section 402(a)(1) of the FD&C Act states: “A food shall be deemed to be adulterated if it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health; but in case the substance is not an added substance such food shall not be considered adulterated under this clause if the quantity of such substance in such food does not ordinarily render it injurious to health.”\n\nThe FD&C Act prohibits introducing or delivering for introduction into interstate commerce adulterated animal food (section 301(a) of the FD&C Act). The FD&C Act also prohibits doing an act (e.g., violating CGMPs) that causes animal food to become adulterated after receipt of that food or its components in interstate commerce while the food is held by a facility for sale (section 301(k) of the FD&C Act). Among other remedies, the government has authority to file actions in court to remove adulterated animal food from the marketplace (seizure) and/or to prevent a firm from continuing to manufacture and distribute adulterated food (injunction) (sections 304 and 302 of the FD&C Act). Following the CGMP requirements for animal food is important because it may help prevent you from producing and distributing adulterated animal food.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #235 Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is issuing this guidance to provide establishments that manufacture animal cells, tissues, and cell- and tissue-based products (ACTPs) with recommendations for meeting current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements. All new animal drugs, including ACTPs, must be manufactured in accordance with CGMP to ensure that such drugs meet the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) as to safety, and have the identity, strength, quality, and purity characteristics which they purport to or are represented to possess.1\n\nFootnote 1: See section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B)]\n\nThere are both statutory and regulatory requirements for CGMP. The CGMP statutory requirements are found in section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act. The CGMP regulatory requirements are found in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, parts 210 and 211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211).\n\nFDA recognizes that the manufacture of ACTPs presents unique considerations for complying with regulatory CGMP and that these CGMP regulations do not specifically or fully address all aspects of the manufacture of ACTPs, including early stages of the ACTP manufacturing process. This document is specific to ACTPs to help establishments that manufacture ACTPs meet statutory and applicable regulatory CGMP. New animal drugs not manufactured in conformity with statutory and regulatory CGMP are adulterated under the relevant provisions of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn this guidance, we address the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing ACTPs, including steps in recovery, processing, storage, labeling, packaging, and distribution. The recommendations in this document should be applied to consistently produce quality ACTPs and to ensure that ACTPs are not contaminated and do not become contaminated during manufacturing. Generally, when we refer to CGMP in this document, we are referring either to statutory CGMP including those ACTP-specific recommendations provided in this document for meeting statutory CGMP, or applicable regulatory CGMP, or both.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nPredistribution shipment means the conveyance or shipment of an ACTP within your establishment or between establishments before it has met its product release criteria (i.e., it is not released for distribution).\n\nProcess control means controls put in place to address variability and to ensure product quality. Controls can consist of material analysis and equipment monitoring at significant processing points.\n\nProcessing means any activity performed on an ACTP, other than recovery, donor screening, donor testing, storage, labeling, packaging, or distribution. Processing includes activities such as testing for microorganisms, preparation, sterilization, steps to inactivate or remove adventitious agents, preservation for storage, and removal from storage.\n\nQuarantine of ACTP means the storage or identification of an ACTP, to prevent improper release, in a physically separate area clearly identified for such use or through use of other procedures, such as automated designation.\n\nRecovery means obtaining from a donor (live or deceased) cells or tissues that are intended for use in implantation, transplantation, infusion, transfer, or other means of administration to an animal recipient.\n\nValidation means confirmation by examination and provision of objective evidence that particular requirements can consistently be fulfilled (e.g., a process consistently produces an ACTP that meets its predetermined specifications).\n\nValidated methods means analytical methods confirmed to be suitable for their intended use through parameters such as accuracy, precision, robustness, linearity, range, specificity, limit of quantitation, and limit of detection.\n\nVerification means confirmation by examination and provision of objective evidence that specific requirements have been fulfilled.\n\nYou means the establishment that performs a manufacturing step or the establishment that performs a manufacturing step under contract, agreement, or other arrangement for another establishment.\n\nIII Purpose and SCOPE\n\nThis guidance is intended for any establishment that performs a manufacturing step for production of an ACTP, including autologous, allogeneic, and xenogeneic ACTPs. Preserving cellular function and integrity, ensuring consistency of the process and product, and preventing contamination are critical aspects of manufacturing ACTPs. The safety, effectiveness, and quality of an ACTP are dependent on appropriate control of the manufacturing process.\n\nEstablishments performing any part of a manufacturing process or any establishment utilized under a contract, agreement, or other arrangement for performing any step in the process must comply with applicable statutory and regulatory CGMP.\n\n2.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWe are providing these recommendations to help ensure that establishments are in compliance with statutory and regulatory CGMP. In some cases, regulatory CGMP does not fully or specifically address those aspects of ACTP manufacturing necessary to ensure the safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity of the product. For example, regulatory CGMP does not address critical items that we consider necessary to meet statutory CGMP such as donor eligibility or recovery of ACTPs.\n\nEstablishments performing part of a manufacturing process must comply with CGMP that are appropriate for the manufacturing steps they perform with the ACTP. Prior to entering into any contract, agreement, or other arrangement with another establishment, the ACTP sponsor should ensure that the establishment is following the recommendations for meeting CGMP in this document or is otherwise ensuring that the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of ACTPs complies with CGMP.\n\nCategory A Establishments\n\nEstablishments that manufacture finished ACTPs, other than Type II finished ACTPs,3 are Category A establishments.\n\nFootnote 3: Autologous ACTPs are Type II products if they meet all of the following criteria:\n\na. The ACTP is minimally manipulated;\n\nb. The ACTP is for homologous use;\n\nc. The ACTP is for use in nonfood-producing animals;\n\nd. The manufacture of the ACTP does not involve the combination of the cells with another article, except for water, crystalloids, or a sterilizing, preserving, or storage agent, provided that the addition of water, crystalloids, or the sterilizing, preserving, or storage agent does not raise new safety concerns with respect to the product; and\n\ne. The finished ACTP is not combined with or modified by the addition of any component that is a drug or device.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes FDA\'s current thinking on defining, establishing, and documenting manufacturing activities of the parties involved in contract drug manufacturing subject to current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements. In particular, we describe how parties involved in contract drug manufacturing can use quality agreements to delineate their manufacturing activities to ensure compliance with CGMP.\n\nFor purposes of this guidance, we use certain terms with the following specific meanings:\n\nCurrent Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) refers to requirements in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), section 501(a)(2)(B), for all drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). For finished human and animal drugs, the term includes applicable requirements under 21 CFR parts 210 and 211. For biologics, the term includes additional applicable requirements under 21 CFR parts 600-680.\n\nCommercial manufacturing refers to manufacturing processes that result in a drug or drugs intended to be marketed, distributed, or sold.\n\nCommercial manufacturing does not include research and development activities, manufacturing of material for investigational new drug studies (e.g., clinical trials, expanded access), or manufacturing of material for veterinary investigational drugs. Although this guidance does not explicitly apply to the manufacture of investigational, developmental, or clinical trial materials, FDA believes that quality agreements can be extremely valuable in delineating the activities of all parties involved in contract research and development arrangements. Many of the principles described in this guidance could be applied in pre-commercial stages of the pharmaceutical life cycle.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nManufacturing includes processing, packing, holding, labeling operations, testing, and quality unit operations.\n\nA manufacturer is an entity that engages in CGMP activities, including implementation of oversight and controls over the manufacture of drugs to ensure quality.2 Footnote 2: See section 501 of the FD&C Act, as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (Public Law 112-144, title VII, section 711).\n\nQuality unit is defined as synonymous with the term quality control unit.3\n\nFootnote 3: For quality control unit, see 21 CFR 210.3.\n\nThis guidance covers commercial manufacturing of the following categories of drugs: human drugs, veterinary drugs, certain combination products, biological and biotechnology products, finished products, APIs, drug substances, in-process materials, and drug constituents of combination drug/device products.4 This guidance does not cover the following types of products: Type A predicated articles and medicated feed, medical devices, dietary supplements, or human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR part 1271.\n\nFootnote 4: Combination product manufacturers can apply this guidance to their quality agreements because they are subject to requirements under 21 CFR part 211 and/or 21 CFR part 820 (see 21 CFR 4.3). In addition to facilitating compliance with requirements under 21 CFR part 211, manufacturers can use quality agreements with contract facilities to demonstrate compliance, in part, with 21 CFR 820.50 (purchasing controls) and with 21 CFR 820.80(b) (receiving acceptance activities) for combination products.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Defining the Who and What of Contract Manufacturing\n\nThis guidance describes how contract manufacturing operations fit within the larger scheme of pharmaceutical quality systems. It also presents the Agency\'s current thinking on the roles and manufacturing activities of the parties involved in contract manufacturing arrangements.\n\nSpecifically, this guidance addresses the relationship between owners and contract facilities. For purposes of this guidance, we define owners as manufacturers of APIs, drug substances, in-process materials, finished drug products, including biological products, and combination products. The term owner does not apply to retail pharmacies, drug stores, supermarkets, discount warehouse stores, or other retailers who purchase finished drug products to sell over the counter as a store brand. For purposes of this guidance, we define contract facilities as parties that perform one or more manufacturing operations on behalf of an owner or owners.5\n\n2.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nDrug manufacturing encompasses many discrete operations and activities. One manufacturer may perform all operations and activities or may engage an outside party or parties to perform some or all of the operations and activities under contract. Contract facilities perform a variety of manufacturing operations and activities, including but not limited to:\n\nFormulation\n\nFill and finish\n\nChemical synthesis\n\nCell culture and fermentation, including for biological products\n\nAnalytical testing and other laboratory services\n\nPackaging and labeling\n\nSterilization or terminal sterilization\n\nHowever, agreements between owners and contract facilities sometimes do not clearly define the CGMP-related roles and manufacturing operations and activities of each of the parties. When all parties clearly understand their CGMP-related roles and manufacturing responsibilities, the owners who use contract facilities, contract facilities that provide services to owners, and, ultimately, patients who take the drugs manufactured under these arrangements may benefit in many ways. Contracting can enhance speed and efficiency, provide technological expertise, and expand capacity.\n\nWe encourage entities that engage in manufacturing related solely to drug distribution (e.g., distributors, brokers, private label distributors, own label distributors) to follow the recommendations in this guidance document, as appropriate. Our focus here, however, is on the roles and manufacturing activities of the owner and contract facility.\n\nIII Responsibilities of parties involved in contract manufacturing\n\nEach party engaged in the manufacture of a drug is responsible for ensuring compliance with CGMP for the manufacturing activities it performs.6 For both owners and contract facilities that conduct manufacturing operations, CGMP ""includes the implementation of oversight and controls over the manufacture of drugs to ensure quality, including managing the risk of and establishing the safety of raw materials, materials used in the manufacturing of drugs, and finished drug products.""7 Drugs not manufactured in compliance with CGMP are adulterated.8\n\nFootnote 6: Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act; 21 CFR parts 210 and 211; and 21 CFR part 600.\n\nFootnote 7: Section 501 of the FD&C Act as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (Public Law 112-144, Title VII, section 711).\n\nFootnote 8: Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe FD&C Act also prohibits any person from introducing or delivering for introduction an adulterated or misbranded drug into interstate commerce.9 In addition, it prohibits anyone from the ""doing of any... act with respect to, a... drug... if such act is done while such article is heldfor sale... after shipment in interstate commerce and results in such article being adulterated or misbranded.""10\n\nFDA\'s regulations recognize that owners commonly use contract facilities to perform some drug manufacturing activities.11 When an owner uses a contract facility, the owner\'s quality unit is legally responsible for approving or rejecting drug products manufactured by the contract facility, including for final release.12 The regulations require that the quality unit\'s responsibilities and procedures be in writing and that they be followed.13\n\nFootnote 10: Section 301(k) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR 200.10(b) and 211.22(a).\n--------------------\nContext title: Contract Manufacturing Arrangements for Drugs- Quality Agreements Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations  Does FDA have guidelines for animal bedding?\n--------------------\nContext: Products approved under the Animal Rule are subject to postmarketing recordkeeping and safety reporting applicable to all approved drug and biological products.21 Information on withdrawal procedures, submission of promotional materials, and termination of certain requirements for products approved under the Animal Rule is specified in the regulations.22\n\nFootnote 21: See 21 CFR 314.630 for drugs and 21 CFR 601.93 for biological products.\n\nFootnote 22: See 21 CFR 314.620, 21 CFR 314.640, and 21 CFR 314.650, respectively, for drugs and 21 CFR 601.92, 21 CFR 601.94, and 21 CFR 601.95, respectively, for biological products.\n\nIII Regulatory Considerations\n\nDrug Development Plan\n\nObtaining the body of evidence necessary to support approval of a drug using the Animal Rule is a complex and iterative process. FDA strongly encourages sponsors to establish early and ongoing communications with the Agency. Sponsors also may wish to seek input from public health officials and/or the military about the potential need for, and operational use of, the investigational drug and discuss this with FDA. Developing a drug development plan will support the discussion of important issues, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\nThe proposed indication and whether a drug can be developed under the Animal Rule\n\nThe design of an animal study as it relates to the anticipated clinical use of the drug during an incident\n\nThe development and/or selection of the animal models, including, when necessary, the design of the natural history studies\n\nThe results of the proof-of-concept studies\n\nThe proposed methods for selecting an effective dose and regimen in humans\n\nThe design of the adequate and well-controlled animal efficacy studies intended to provide the primary evidence of effectiveness of the drug\n\nThe proposed approach for ensuring the quality and integrity of data23 Footnote 23: In issuing the Animal Rule, FDA stated that “ (\\ldots) studies subject to this rule must be conducted in accordance with preexisting requirements under the good laboratory practices (21 CFR part 58) regulations (\\ldots)” (67 FR 37988 at 37989, May 31, 2002). The good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations, however, were developed as a quality system for nonclinical safety studies. FDA’s current expectations are described in section IV.B.\n\nThe size and composition of the human safety database\n\n2.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPlans or approaches for conducting the required postmarketing studies (e.g., field studies) to demonstrate safety and clinical benefit when such studies are feasible and ethical24 Footnote 24: See 21 CFR 314.610(b)(1) for drugs and 21 CFR 601.91(b)(1) for biological products.\n\nTimelines and/or milestones for FDA feedback or meetings\n\nEligibility for expedited development and review designation programs\n\nAdditional issues critical to the sponsor's funding agencies25\n\nFootnote 25: Product development plans required by funding agencies for medical countermeasures against CBRN agents may dictate certain proof-of-concept studies and an accelerated timeline for efficacy studies in animals. The sponsor’s relationship with its funding agency is independent of its relationship with FDA.\n\nDrug development is data-driven; any development plan should allow for modification or refinement as data are gathered and analyzed and projections or expectations change. It is the sponsor's responsibility to provide complete and accurate submissions. Sponsors should explain any proposed deviations from the recommendations expressed in this guidance. The potential impact of these deviations on the drug development program should be discussed with FDA before the conduct of the relevant studies.\n\nFDA strongly recommends that sponsors obtain Agency concurrence on the design of the adequate and well-controlled animal efficacy studies because these substitute for the efficacy trials in humans (see sections VI and X). Sponsors should allow adequate time for FDA review, comment, and agreement before initiating these studies to ensure that the study design is adequate to support the proposed indication.\n\nThe protocols for animal efficacy studies intended to provide primary evidence of effectiveness are eligible for evaluation under special protocol assessment (SPA) provisions.26({}^{,})27 Before submitting a Request for SPA, the sponsor should have FDA concurrence on the model proposed for use in the efficacy study (including, but not limited to, the species, the details of the challenge agent, the conditions of exposure) and the method that will be used to extrapolate from the animal data to select an effective dose and regimen in humans.\n\nFootnote 26: Section 505(b)(5)(B) of the FD&C Act (as amended by the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013, Public Law 113-5) provides for the use of SPA provisions “in the case where human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible, of animal and any associated clinical trials which, in combination, are intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim.”\n\nDrugs developed under the Animal Rule may be eligible for two of the expedited development and review programs28 (fast track and priority review) or other FDA programs, such as orphan drug designation.29 Sponsors requesting these designations should use established procedures. Drugs being developed under the Animal Rule do not meet the statutory requirement forbreakthrough therapy designation, which specifically requires clinical evidence of a treatment effect.30 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA)31 and the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA)32 may also apply to drugs developed under the Animal Rule.\n\nFootnote 30: See section 506 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 356) (as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), Public Law 112-144).\n\nFootnote 31: See Public Law 107-109.\n\nFootnote 32: See Public Law 108-155.\n\nSponsors should note that FDA may seek input from advisory committees for various issues related to the Animal Rule. Issues for discussion can include whether the Animal Rule is the appropriate regulatory development pathway for drugs intended for a specific indication, concurrence on the animal model of a disease or condition, the acceptability of the use of an animal model with a specific investigational drug, the design of adequate and well-controlled animal efficacy studies, and whether the data obtained support approval. In some instances, more than one advisory committee meeting may be warranted at different times in a single development program.\n\nAccess to Investigational Drugs During a Public Health Emergency\n\nData collected from animal efficacy studies may support the emergency use of drugs under an investigational new drug application (IND)33 or an emergency use authorization (EUA).34 FDA's decision to allow emergency use of a drug under an IND or EUA will be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the anticipated or actual emergency, size of the affected population, data included in the submission, and risk-benefit analysis. A decision to allow emergency use of the drug under an IND or EUA, based on data submitted in support of either mechanism, should not be viewed as an FDA determination on approvability of the drug or a final drug development goal. FDA emphasizes that drug development and systematic data collection should be continued to obtain the body of evidence to support drug approval and associated postmarketing requirements. In the event of an unexpected increase or occurrence of a disease or condition, sponsors should discuss with FDA if field studies have become feasible and ethical (see related discussion in section II).\n\nCommunications With FDA\n\nSponsors are encouraged to hold discussions with FDA in the early stages of a drug development program. Sponsors unsure of the appropriate regulatory review division or office for their investigational drugs can inquire through the electronic mailbox, CDER-CBER-ARJurisdiction@ftda.hhs.gov, provided by CDER and CBER for this sole purpose.\n\nSponsors should consult Agency guidance regarding the process and expectations for formal meetings.35 The sponsor and review division should discuss the avenues and expectations for obtaining Agency concurrence on the design of the adequate and well-controlled animal efficacy studies and for addressing extenuating or unforeseen circumstances. It is the sponsor's responsibility to build sufficient time into the development plan to permit the review, discussion, and resolution of issues prior to the initiation of relevant studies. FDA will try to accommodate the sponsor should unforeseen circumstances arise.\n\nFootnote 35: See FDA’s guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants (Revision 1). In the Federal Register of March 11, 2015 (80 FR 12822), FDA published a notice announcing the availability of a draft guidance Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products (Revision 2). The revised draft guidance updates the guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants (Revision 1) and, when finalized, will represent the Agency’s current thinking on the topic.\n\nSome of the drug development issues that should be the subject of meetings with FDA36 will differ from those for drugs developed under other regulatory pathways.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe purpose of this document is to provide guidance to animal drug sponsors on specific areas of the approval process where the available scientific literature may be useful to support the approval of a new animal drug application (NADA), an abbreviated new animal drug application (ANADA), or a conditionally approved new animal drug application (CNADA), as well as methodologies to ensure the validity of conclusions drawn by animal drug sponsors from the scientific literature to support an approval.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nDefinitions of key terms may be found in section V.Glossary. The Appendix to this guidance provides example tables for organizing published studies and the data they provide to assist with screening and eligibility for analysis and data extraction.\n\nII Background\n\nThe original GFI #106 was published in 2000. Since its publication, animal drug sponsors have used literature to support various aspects of animal drug development and approval, including early stages of drug development, dosage characterization, microbial food safety, design of the target animal safety evaluation, prediction of potential adverse effects, and substantial evidence of effectiveness.\n\nAnimal drug sponsors have expressed interest in further leveraging information published in the scientific literature to support new animal drug approvals. Use of published scientific literature is of interest because it makes use of existing knowledge and may reduce the number of animals needed for studies to support approval, and in some cases may provide greater inferential value compared to individual studies conducted for the purpose of supporting an approval. Scientific literature may also be used to respond to specific regulatory questions, identify data gaps, and inform protocol design.\n\nHowever, use of scientific literature to support drug approval has its limitations. Although there may be a wealth of published data on a drug or drug class, underlying study protocols and original study data and records generally are not available, making it difficult to determine the quality of studies and confirm aspects of study conduct or design necessary to make a safety or effectiveness determination. Implementation of systematic methods to screen and analyze information across multiple publications may reduce the uncertainty resulting from analyzing limited information in individual studies.\n\n3 Considerations for using published literature\n\nThe Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) considers the quality of journals used in literature reviews when determining the validity of the review. CVM needs high-quality data to have confidence in its regulatory decisions.\n\nChanges in the publishing industry have brought more opportunities to publish research and greater access to such research. Because of the vast number of research journals that publish on topics relevant to many aspects of new animal drug approvals, sponsors should consider the quality and integrity of sources of published literature. For published studies conducted outside the United States, sponsors should consider factors that could affect the generalizability of study results to the U.S. target population and conditions of use.1\n\nFootnote 1: See CVM GFI #265, “Use of Data from Foreign Investigational Studies to Support Effectiveness of New Animal Drugs,” (October 2021).\n\nNew reporting guidelines, such as described by the REFLECT statement,2 CONSORT,3 STROBE,4 and ARRIVE,5 which are designed to improve the reporting of animal research studies, may increase the utility of such literature for regulatory purposes.\n\nFootnote 2: REFLECT stands for Reporting guidElines For randomized controLled trials for livEstoCk and food safeTy. (https://meridian.cvm.iastate.edu/reflect/ - Accessed on March 2, 2023).\n\nFootnote 3: CONSORT stands for Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials (http://www.consort-statement.org/ and as reported in https://www.bmi.com/content/355/bmi.i5239 - Accessed on March 13, 2023).\n\nFootnote 4: STROBE stands for STrengthening the Reporting of OBervational studies in Epidemiology (https://www.strobbe-statement.org/index.php?id=strobbe-home - Accessed on March 2, 2023).\n\nSome journals and scientific publications may be found in or as part of mainstream scientific databases. Certain journals may not scrutinize the studies and data they publish. CVM recommends consultation with subject matter experts to assess journal or publisher practices (e.g., robustness of the editorial or peer-review process and standards). Prior to submitting any published literature to support regulatory decisions, sponsors should confirm they have identified any retractions for literature included in their submission.\n\nSubmission of a Single Published Study as the Only Supporting Documentation for a Safety, Effectiveness, or Product Quality6 Decision\n\nFootnote 6: Section 512(d)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360b(d)(1)).\n\nStudies to support new animal drug approvals are ordinarily conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) (21 CFR part 58) or Good Clinical Practices (GCP) (GFI #85 (VICH7 GL9), ""Good Clinical Practice""8 (May 2001)). Sponsors are required to follow GLP regulations that establish requirements for non-clinical studies including safety and bioequivalence studies. Substantial evidence of effectiveness requirements consists of one or more adequate and well-controlled studies conducted in accordance with an appropriate standard of conduct (21 CFR 514.117). The standard of conduct generally used for effectiveness studies is GCP. Although GCP is a guidance rather than a regulation, studies conducted in accordance with the GCP guidance are more likely to meet requirements for substantial evidence.\n\nWhile publications may describe a drug\'s safety, effectiveness, and chemical or pharmacological characteristics, most published studies are not designed or conducted to specifically address regulatory requirements for new animal drugs. Most studies published in the peer-reviewed literature aim to explore whether a drug or treatment may have an effect, and the discussion is often focused on the generation of hypotheses for further investigation. Studies conducted to support a new animal drug approval are required to demonstrate that the drug is effective, safe, and/or can be manufactured to meet quality standards. Further, guidelines for peer review and editorial decisions are not necessarily designed with regulatory review requirements in mind. An article that summarizes a single study may not contain sufficient details about the study plans, study conduct, quality assurance measures, clinical end-point descriptions, or methods of data analysis. All of these are needed to assess the reliability of the results and their applicability to the target animal population.\n\nGenerally missing from published literature are original study data and records, extensive documentation9 of the study design, the study protocol, details of study conduct, data handling and storage information, and data analysis and interpretation. Where present, these additional details and documentation may allow a single published study to be considered adequate for making population-level inferences and ultimately a regulatory decision.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #106 The Use of Published Literature in Support of New Animal Drug Approvals']","['No, but the GLPs prohibit the use of bedding which can interfere with the objectives of the study.']",0.0,0.0909090909090909

If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to help manufacturers implementing modern quality systems and risk management approaches to meet the requirements of the Agency's current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations (2l CFR parts 210 and 211). The guidance describes a comprehensive quality systems (QS) model, highlighting the model's consistency with the CGMP regulatory requirements for manufacturing human and veterinary drugs, including biological drug products. The guidance also explains how manufacturers implementing such quality systems can be in full compliance with parts 210 and 211. This guidance is not intended to place new expectations on manufacturers, nor to replace the CGMP requirements. Readers are advised to always refer to parts 210 and 211 to ensure full compliance with the regulations.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background and Purpose\n\nBackground\n\nIn August 2002, the FDA announced the Pharmaceutical CGMPs for the 21st Century Initiative. In that announcement, the FDA explained the Agency's intent to integrate quality systems and risk management approaches into its existing programs with the goal of encouraging industry to adopt modern and innovative manufacturing technologies. The CGMP initiative was spurred by the fact that since 1978, when the last major revision of the CGMP regulations was published,there have been many advances in manufacturing science and in our understanding of quality systems. In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers are already implementing comprehensive, modern quality systems and risk management approaches. This guidance is intended to help manufacturers implementing modern quality systems and risk management approaches to meet the requirements of the Agency's CGMP regulations. The Agency also saw a need to harmonize the CGMPs with other non-U.S. pharmaceutical regulatory systems and with FDA's own medical device quality systems regulations. This guidance supports these goals. It also supports the objectives of the Critical Path Initiative, which intends to make the development of innovative medical products more efficient so that safe and effective therapies can reach patients sooner.\n\nThe CGMPs for the 21st Century Initiative steering committee created a Quality System Guidance Development working group (QS working group) to compare the current CGMP regulations, which call for some specific quality management elements, to other existing quality management systems. The QS working group mapped the relationship between CGMP regulations (parts 210 and 211 and the 1978 Preamble to the CGMP regulations2) and various quality system models, such as the Drug Manufacturing Inspections Program (i.e., systems-based inspectional program),3 the Environmental Protection Agency's Guidance for Developing Quality Systems for Environmental Programs, ISO Quality Standards, other quality publications, and experience from regulatory cases. The QS working group determined that, although the CGMP regulations do provide great flexibility, they do not incorporate explicitly all of the elements that today constitute most quality management systems.\n\nFootnote 2: See Reference #1.\n\nFootnote 3: See Reference #2.\n\nThe CGMP regulations and other quality management systems differ somewhat in organization and in certain constituent elements; however, they are very similar and share underlying principles. For example, the CGMP regulations stress quality control. More recently developed quality systems stress quality management, quality assurance, and the use of risk management tools, in addition to quality control. The QS working group decided that it would be very useful to examine exactly how the CGMP regulations and the elements of a modern, comprehensive quality system fit together in today's manufacturing world. This guidance is the result of that examination.\n\nGoal of the Guidance\n\nThis guidance describes a comprehensive quality systems model, which, if implemented, will allow manufacturers to support and sustain robust, modern quality systems that are consistent with CGMP regulations. The guidance demonstrates how and where the elements of this comprehensive model can fit within the requirements of the CGMP regulations. The inherent flexibility of the CGMP regulations should enable manufacturers to implement a quality system in a form that is appropriate for their specific operations.\n\nThe overarching philosophy articulated in both the CGMP regulations and in robust modern quality systems is:Quality should be built into the product, and testing alone cannot be relied on to ensure product quality.\n\nThis guidance is intended to serve as a bridge between the 1978 regulations and our current understanding of quality systems. In addition to being part of the FDA's CGMP initiative, this guidance is being issued for a number of reasons:\n\nA quality system addresses the public and private sectors' mutual goal of providing a high-quality drug product to patients and prescribers. A well-built quality system should reduce the number of (or prevent) recalls, returned or salvaged products, and defective products entering the marketplace.\n\nIt is important that the CGMP regulations are harmonized to the extent possible with other widely used quality management systems, including ISO 9000, non-U.S. pharmaceutical quality management requirements, and FDA's own medical device quality system regulations. This guidance serves as a first step to highlight common elements between the CGMP regulations and Quality Management Systems. With the globalization of pharmaceutical manufacturing and the increasing prevalence of drug- and biologic-device combination products, the convergence of quality management principles across different regions and among various product types is very desirable.\n\nThe FDA has concluded that modern quality systems, when coupled with manufacturing process and product knowledge and the use of effective risk management practices, can handle many types of changes to facilities, equipment, and processes without the need for prior approval regulatory submissions. Manufacturers with a robust quality system and appropriate process knowledge can implement many types of improvements. In addition, an effective quality system, by lowering the risk of manufacturing problems, may result in shorter and fewer FDA inspections.\n\nA quality system can provide the necessary framework for implementing quality by design4 (building in quality from the development phase and throughout a product's life cycle), continual improvement, and risk management in the drug manufacturing process. A quality system adopted by a manufacturer can be tailored to fit the specific environment, taking into account factors such as scope of operations, complexity of processes, and appropriate use of finite resources.

A quality system adopted by a manufacturer can be tailored to fit the specific environment, taking into account factors such as scope of operations, complexity of processes, and appropriate use of finite resources. Footnote 4: See ICH Q8 Pharmaceutical Development.\n\nScope of the Guidance\n\nThis guidance applies to manufacturers of drug products (finished pharmaceuticals), including products regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). It may also be useful to manufacturers of components (including active pharmaceutical ingredients) used in the manufacture of these products.\n\nThis document is not intended to create new requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturing that go beyond those established in the current regulations, nor is the guidance intended to be a guide for the conduct of FDA inspections. Rather, the document explains how implementing comprehensive quality systems can help manufacturers achieve compliance with 21 CFR parts210 and 211. Although the QS working group found that many of the quality system elements correlate with specific CGMP requirements, some do not. The Agency expects compliance with CGMP regulations, and FDA's inspection program will remain focused on compliance with those regulations.\n\nOrganization of this Guidance\n\nTo provide a reference familiar to industry, the quality systems model described in section IV of this guidance is organized -- in its major sections -- according to the structure of international quality standards. Major sections of the model include the following:\n\nManagement Responsibilities\n\nResources\n\nManufacturing Operations\n\nEvaluation Activities\n\nUnder each of these sections the key elements found in modern quality systems are discussed. When an element correlates with a CGMP regulatory requirement, that correlation is noted. In some cases, a specific CGMP regulation is discussed in more detail as it relates to a quality system element. At the end of each section, a table is included listing the quality system elements of that section and the specific CGMP regulations with which they correlate. A glossary is included at the end of the document.\n\nIII CGMPS and the Concepts of Modern Quality Systems\n\nSeveral key concepts are critical for any discussion of modern quality systems. The following concepts are used throughout this guidance as they relate to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.\n\nQuality\n\nEvery pharmaceutical product has established identity, strength, purity, and other quality characteristics designed to ensure the required levels of safety and effectiveness. For the purposes of this guidance document, the phrase achieving quality means achieving these characteristics for a product.\n\nQuality by Design and Product Development\n\nQuality by design means designing and developing a product and associated manufacturing processes that will be used during product development to ensure that the product consistently attains a predefined quality at the end of the manufacturing process.5 Quality by design, in conjunction with a quality system, provides a sound framework for the transfer of product knowledge and process understanding from drug development to the commercial manufacturing processes and for post-development changes and optimization. The CGMP regulations, when viewed in their entirety, incorporate the concept of quality by design. This guidance describes how these elements fit together.\n\nAppendix C Quality Risk Management\n\nQuality risk management is a valuable component of an effective quality systems framework.6 Quality risk management can, for example, help guide the setting of specifications and process parameters for drug manufacturing, assess and mitigate the risk of changing a process or specification, and determine the extent of discrepancy investigations and corrective actions.\n\nFootnote 6: See ICH Q9 Quality Risk Management.\n\nCAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action)\n\nCAPA is a well-known CGMP regulatory concept that focuses on investigating, understanding, and correcting discrepancies while attempting to prevent their recurrence. Quality system models discuss CAPA as three separate concepts, all of which are used in this guidance.\n\nRemedial corrections of an identified problem\n\nRoot cause analysis with corrective action to help understand the cause of the deviation and potentially prevent recurrence of a similar problem\n\nPreventive action to avert recurrence of a similar potential problem\n\nChange Control\n\nChange control is another well-known CGMP concept that focuses on managing change to prevent unintended consequences. The CGMP regulations provide for change control primarily through the assigned responsibilities of the quality control unit. Certain major manufacturing changes (e.g., changes that alter specifications, a critical product attribute or bioavailability) require regulatory filings and prior regulatory approval (21 CFR 314.70, 514.8, and 601.12).\n\nEffective change control activities (e.g., quality planning and control of revisions to specifications, process parameters, procedures) are key components of any quality system. In this guidance, change is discussed in terms of creating a regulatory environment that encourages change towards continual improvement. This means a manufacturer is empowered to make changes subject to the regulations based on the variability of materials used in manufacturing and process improvements resulting from knowledge gained during a product's lifecycle.\n\nAppendix F The Quality Unit\n\nMany of the modern quality system concepts described here correlate very closely with the CGMP regulations (refer to the charts later in the document). Current industry practice generally divides the responsibilities of the quality control unit (QCU), as defined in the CGMP regulations, between quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) functions.\n\nQC usually involves (1) assessing the suitability of incoming components, containers, closures, labeling, in-process materials, and the finished products; (2) evaluating the performance of the manufacturing process to ensure adherence to proper specifications and limits; and (3) determining the acceptability of each batch for release.\n\nQA primarily involves (1) review and approval of all procedures related to production and maintenance, (2) review of associated records, and (3) auditing and performing/evaluating trend analyses.\n\nThis guidance uses the term quality unit7 (QU) to reflect modern practice while remaining consistent with the CGMP definition in SS 210.3(b)(15). The concept of a quality unit is also consistent with modern quality systems in ensuring that the various operations associated with all systems are appropriately planned, approved, conducted, and monitored.\n\nFootnote 7: Generally, the term quality unit is used in this guidance. However, quality control unit is used when directly quoting parts 210 and 211.\n\nThe CGMP regulations specifically assign the QU the authority to create, monitor, and implement a quality system. Such activities do not substitute for, or preclude, the daily responsibility of manufacturing personnel to build quality into the product. The QU should not take on the responsibilities of other units of a manufacturer's organization, such as the responsibilities handled by manufacturing personnel, engineers, and development scientists.8 Manufacturing personnel and the QU are both critical in fulfilling the manufacturer's responsibility to produce quality products.\n\nFootnote 8: See Reference #1, comment 91.\n\nOther CGMP assigned responsibilities of the QU are consistent with modern quality system approaches (SS 211.22):\n\nEnsuring that controls are implemented and completed satisfactorily during manufacturing operations\n\nEnsuring that developed procedures and specifications are appropriate and followed, including those used by a firm under contract to the manufacturer\n\nApproving or rejecting incoming materials, in-process materials, and drug products\n\nReviewing production records and investigating any unexplained discrepancies\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations""]","[""If unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll written comments should be identified with this document's docket number: FDA-2017-D-6821""]",0.999999999975,0.3636363636363636

Biosimilarity statement\n\nFDA recommends including a statement, placed on the line immediately beneath the initial U.S. approval in the Highlights section, that the product is biosimilar to the reference product. It should read as follows:\n\n[BIOSIMIIAR PRODUCT\'S PROPRIETARY NAME (biosimilar product\'s proper name)] is biosimilar* to [REFERENCE PRODUCT\'S PROPRIETARY NAME (reference product\'s proper name)].\n\nThe asterisk should appear as a footnote symbol inserted after the word ""biosimilar.""For example, for the fictitious product NEXSYMEO, the statement should read as follows:\n\nNEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm) is biosimilar* to JUNEXANT (replicamab-hjxf).\n\nThe footnote should appear at the end of the Highlights section (but above the Revision Date) and state the following:\n\nBiosimilar means that the biological product is approved based on data demonstrating that it is highly similar to an FDA-approved biological product, known as a reference product, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product. Biosimilarity of [BIOSIMILAR PRODUCT\'S PROPRIETARY NAME] has been demonstrated for the condition(s) of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)), strength(s), dosage form(s), and route(s) of administration described in its Full Prescribing Information.\n\n2 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\n\nInformation in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section should be specific to the licensed indications for the biosimilar product and should be consistent with information previously approved for the reference product. The biosimilar product labeling should include text from the reference product labeling regarding any Limitations of Use relevant to the biosimilar product\'s indication(s) (see section IV.B of this guidance for recommendations regarding text that refers to an indication for which licensure has not been sought by the biosimilar product applicant).\n\n3 ADVERSE REACTIONS, Immunogenicity\n\nImmunogenicity information for therapeutic protein products is usually placed in a subsection in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section entitled Immunogenicity. To help health care providers interpret the significance of the information, the following or a similar statement should be included as the first paragraph in the subsection, preceding the immunogenicity data based on the reference product labeling:\n\nAs with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other [core name] products may be misleading.\n\nFda-Approved Patient Labeling\n\nIf a Medication Guide is required, applicants must follow existing Medication Guide regulations for biosimilar product labeling.17 If the FDA-approved patient labeling for the reference product includes Patient Information, applicants should develop Patient Information for the biosimilar product, incorporating relevant information from the Patient Information for the reference product, with appropriate modifications.\n\nFootnote 17: See 21 CFR part 208.\n\nIf the FDA-approved patient labeling for the reference product includes Instructions for Use (IFU), the IFU for the proposed biosimilar product should incorporate relevant information from the IFU for the reference product and present the information in a similar manner. The proposed IFU may differ from the IFU for the reference product where, for example, modified language or images are needed to describe the biosimilar product accurately. If other changes are proposed beyond those necessary to describe the biosimilar product accurately, applicants should discuss proposed changes with the Agency, including whether such changes are appropriate and whether additional data to support such changes are warranted. Additionally, if there are plans to conduct a human factors study and the applicant intends to submit a protocol for FDA\'s review, the applicant should seek FDA input on the proposed IFU when the human factors study protocol is submitted for FDA review. A full and final review of proposed product labeling, including the IFU, will occur in the context of the planned 351(k) application and may be informed by any human factors study findings submitted or other relevant data included in the application.\n\nVI Revising Biosimilar Product Labeling\n\nUpdating Safety Information\n\nDuring the lifecycle of a biological product, changes in the labeling may be necessary to provide updated information needed for the safe and effective use of the product. As the reference product and biosimilar product are used more widely or under diverse conditions, new information may become available. This may include new risks or new information about known risks. A biosimilar product application holder must comply with applicable requirements regarding adverse experience review, reporting, and recordkeeping (see 21 CFR 600.80).\n\nWhen new information becomes available that causes information in labeling to be inaccurate, false, or misleading, the application holder must take steps to change the content of its product labeling, in accordance with 21 CFR 601.12.18 All holders of marketing applications for biological products have an ongoing obligation to ensure their labeling is accurate and up to date.19 A biological product is misbranded, in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and CosmeticAct (FD&C Act), when its labeling is false or misleading; does not provide adequate directions for use and adequate warnings; or prescribes, recommends, or suggests a dosage, manner, frequency, or duration of use of the drug that is dangerous to health (see 21 U.S.C. 331(a) through (b) and 352(a), (f), and (j)).\n\nAdditional Conditions of Use\n\nFDA recognizes that a biosimilar product application holder may be interested in seeking licensure for an additional condition(s) of use after product licensure in the following scenarios:\n\nThe biosimilar product applicant originally obtained licensure for fewer than all of the conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and is seeking licensure for one or more of the remaining licensed conditions of use of the reference product.\n\nThe biologics license application (BLA) holder for the reference product received licensure for a new condition of use for the reference product after the original licensure of the biosimilar product.\n\nThe biosimilar product applicant may seek licensure for an additional condition(s) of use of the reference product in these scenarios by submitting a prior approval supplement(s) to the 351(k) application that contains the necessary data and information, including draft labeling revised to include the additional condition(s) of use sought. For more information on how to support licensure of the biosimilar product for an additional condition(s) of use for which the reference product is licensed, refer to the guidance documents on biosimilar product development on FDA\'s website.20\n\nFootnote 20: https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm290967.htm\n\nVII How to submit initial and revised labeling\n\nNew BLAs and supplement submissions for biosimilar product labeling should include the following:\n\nA clean version of reference product labeling that was used to develop the biosimilar product labeling\n\nA tracked changes and annotated version of proposed biosimilar product labeling explaining the differences from the reference product labeling\n\nA clean version of the proposed biosimilar product labeling_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nVIII Interchangeable Products\n\nAny specific recommendations for labeling for interchangeable products, including any interchangeability statement similar to the biosimilarity statement described in section IV.C.1.b of this guidance, will be provided in future guidance.\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: Appendix A Approaches to Product Identification\n\nIn biosimilar product labeling, the approach to product identification depends on the context of the information being presented. FDA acknowledges that there will be variations on the general concepts outlined in this section because the approach to product identification will depend on the specific statements. The illustrative examples in this section use a fictional reference product JUNEXANT (replicamab-hyxf) and a fictional biosimilar product NEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen use of the biosimilar product name is recommended:\n\nThe biosimilar product name should be used in labeling text that is specific to the biosimilar product or that refers solely to the biosimilar product. If a biosimilar product has a proprietary name, the proprietary name (e.g., NEXSYMEO) should be used in the appropriate sections. However, if a proprietary name is not available, or if referring to the drug substance (as discussed below), the biosimilar product\'s proper name (e.g., replicamab-cznm) should be used.13\n\nFootnote 13: The proper name is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (see section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)).\n\nThe biosimilar product\'s proprietary name (or, if a proprietary name is not available, the biosimilar product\'s proper name) should be used in circumstances such as the following:\n\nIn sections where the information described is specific to the biosimilar product -- This includes, but is not limited to, the following sections: INDICATIONS AND USAGE, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, DESCRIPTION, and HOW SUPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING.\n\nFor directive statements and recommendations for preventing, monitoring, managing, or mitigating risks (e.g., ""Discontinue NEXSYMEO in patients with [adverse reaction]"") -- Such statements are typically included in, but are not limited to, the BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, and DRUG INTERACTIONS sections.\n\nThe biosimilar product\'s proper name should be used when referring to the drug substance. An example would be to use the biosimilar product\'s proper name in the DESCRIPTION section.\n\nWhen use of the reference product name is recommended:\n\nWhen clinical studies or data derived from studies with the reference product are described in biosimilar product labeling, the reference product\'s proper name (e.g., replicamab-hjsf) should be used. This information would typically be included in sections such as, but not limited to, ADVERSE REACTIONS (Clinical Trials Experience subsection) and CLINICAL STUDIES.\n\nWhen use of the core name is recommended:14\n\nFootnote 14: Two examples of a core name are filgrastim and epoetin alfa. The proper name for biological products will include a distinguishing suffix composed of four lowercase letters attached to the core name with a hyphen.\n\nThe overall risk-benefit profile of the reference product is relevant to the biosimilar product, even if a particular serious adverse reaction or other risk included in the reference product labeling may not have been reported with the biosimilar product at the time of licensure. In labeling sections where the risk applies to both the biosimilar product and the reference product (e.g., BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, Warnings and PRECAUTIONS, ADVERSE REACTIONS (Postmarketing Experience subsection)), it would be appropriate to use the core name of the reference product followed by the word ""products"" (e.g., replicamab products) to convey, for instance, that a risk or other information necessary for the safe use of the product applies to both the biosimilar product and the reference product (see section IV.B of this guidance).\n\nFor example, in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\nReference Product Labeling & Biosimilar Product Labeling \\ \\hline Treatment with JUNEXANT increases & Treatment with replicamab products \\ the risk of serious infections involving & increases the risk of serious infections \\ various organ systems and sites that may & involving various organ systems and sites \\ lead to hospitalization or death. & that may lead to hospitalization or death. \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n4. When use of more than one product name is recommended:\n\nThere may be text appropriately based on the reference product labeling where more than one of these product identification approaches should be used to convey information accurately.\n\nTherefore, all text in biosimilar product labeling, even sections that have been based on reference product labeling, should be carefully evaluated for the most appropriate product identification approach. In some cases, such as the following example, more than two of the approaches may be used:\n\nReplicamab products can cause hepatotoxicity and acute hepatic failure. In clinical trials of replicamab-hjxf, 10% of patients developed elevated ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of normal and 5% progressed to acute hepatic failure. Evaluate serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin at baseline and monthly during treatment with NEXSYMEO...\n\nApproaches to Content Presentation\n\nThe labeling for the biosimilar product should be specific to the conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)) sought for the biosimilar product and should be consistent with language previously approved for the reference product for those conditions of use.\n\nWhen a biosimilar product applicant obtains licensure for fewer than all conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)) for which the reference product is licensed, certain text in the reference product labeling related to condition(s) of use for the reference product that are not licensed for the biosimilar product would generally not be included in the biosimilar product labeling.15 However, in certain circumstances it may be necessary to include information in the biosimilar product labeling relating to an indication(s) for which the biosimilar product is not licensed, in order to help ensure safe use (e.g., when safety information in the reference product labeling is related to use of the product and is not specific to a particular licensed indication(s) or when information specific to only the biosimilar product\'s indication(s) cannot be easily extracted).16 Such text should be written in a manner that does not imply that the biosimilar product is licensed for a reference product indication(s) or use(s) that has not been licensed for the biosimilar product. In these circumstances, specific sections of labeling that could be affected include BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, ADVERSE REACTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS, and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS.\n\nFootnote 16: See also 21 CFR 201.57(c)(6)(i).\n\nFor example, for sections such as WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS, the reference product labeling may pool and categorize events from all the reference product clinical trials for all the indications for which the reference product is licensed. In cases where the biosimilar product applicant is not seeking licensure for all the indications for which the reference product is licensed, the pooled data described in the reference product labeling should be included in the biosimilar product labeling in a manner that is not indication-specific. However, any text that refers to an indication for which the biosimilar product applicant is not currently seeking licensure and is included to ensure safe use of the biosimilar product should be revised to avoid an implication that the biosimilar has been licensed for that indication(s).\n\nApproaches to Specific Sections of Biosimilar Product Labeling\n\nHIGHLIGHTS OF PRESCRIBING INFORMATION (Highlights) a. Initial U.S. approval\n\nThe initial U.S. approval in the Highlights section is the year that the biosimilar product is licensed.\n\nb. Biosimilarity statement\n\nFDA recommends including a statement, placed on the line immediately beneath the initial U.S. approval in the Highlights section, that the product is biosimilar to the reference product. It should read as follows:\n\n[BIOSIMIIAR PRODUCT\'S PROPRIETARY NAME (biosimilar product\'s proper name)] is biosimilar* to [REFERENCE PRODUCT\'S PROPRIETARY NAME (reference product\'s proper name)].\n\nThe asterisk should appear as a footnote symbol inserted after the word ""biosimilar.""For example, for the fictitious product NEXSYMEO, the statement should read as follows:\n\nNEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm) is biosimilar* to JUNEXANT (replicamab-hjxf).\n\nThe footnote should appear at the end of the Highlights section (but above the Revision Date) and state the following:\n\nBiosimilar means that the biological product is approved based on data demonstrating that it is highly similar to an FDA-approved biological product, known as a reference product, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product. Biosimilarity of [BIOSIMILAR PRODUCT\'S PROPRIETARY NAME] has been demonstrated for the condition(s) of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)), strength(s), dosage form(s), and route(s) of administration described in its Full Prescribing Information.\n\n2 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\n\nInformation in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section should be specific to the licensed indications for the biosimilar product and should be consistent with information previously approved for the reference product. The biosimilar product labeling should include text from the reference product labeling regarding any Limitations of Use relevant to the biosimilar product\'s indication(s) (see section IV.B of this guidance for recommendations regarding text that refers to an indication for which licensure has not been sought by the biosimilar product applicant).\n\n3 ADVERSE REACTIONS, Immunogenicity\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: An application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that ""the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product"" based upon data derived from:11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(3) of the PHS Act.\n\nAnalytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;\n\nAnimal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and\n\nA clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.\n\nThe Agency has the discretion to determine that an element described above is unnecessary in a 351(k) application.12 FDA advises sponsors intending to develop biosimilar products to meet with FDA to present their product development plans and establish a schedule of milestones that will serve as landmarks for future discussions with the Agency. FDA anticipates that early discussions with FDA about product development plans and about approaches to providing adequate scientific justifications will facilitate biosimilar development.13\n\nFootnote 12: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See the draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants for a detailed discussion. When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\n4 Complexities of Protein Products\n\nA sponsor should consider the complexities of protein products and related scientific issues when designing a development program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.\n\nNature of Protein Products and Related Scientific Considerations\n\nUnlike small molecule drugs, whose structure can usually be completely defined and entirely reproduced, proteins are typically more complex and are unlikely to be shown to be structurally identical to a reference product. Many potential differences in protein structure can arise. Because even minor structural differences (including certain changes in glycosylation patterns) can significantly affect a protein\'s safety and/or effectiveness, it is important to evaluate these differences.\n\nIn general, proteins can differ in at least three ways: (1) primary amino acid sequence; (2) modification to amino acids, such as sugar moieties (glycosylation) or other side chains; and (3) higher order structure (protein folding and protein-protein interactions). Modifications to amino acids may lead to heterogeneity and can be difficult to control. Protein modifications and higher order structure can be affected by formulation and environmental conditions, including light, temperature, moisture, packaging materials, container closure systems, and delivery device materials. Additionally, process- as well as product-related impurities may increase the likelihood and/or the severity of an immune response to a protein product, and certain excipients may limit the ability to characterize the protein product.\n\nAdvances in analytical sciences enable some protein products to be extensively characterized with respect to their physicochemical and biological properties, such as higher order structures and functional characteristics. These analytical methodologies have increasingly improved the ability to identify and characterize not only the drug substance of a protein product but also excipients and product- and process-related impurities.\n\nDespite such significant improvements in analytical techniques, however, current analytical methodology may not be able to detect all relevant structural and functional differences between two protein products. In addition, there may be incomplete understanding of the relationship between a product\'s structural attributes and its clinical performance. Thus, as set forth in the PHS Act, data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies are required to demonstrate biosimilarity unless FDA determines an element unnecessary.14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nManufacturing Process Considerations\n\nDifferent manufacturing processes may alter a protein product in a way that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the product. For example, differences in biological systems used to manufacture a protein product may cause different posttranslational modifications, which in turn may affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the product. Thus, when the manufacturing process for a marketed protein product is changed, the application holder must assess the effects of the change and demonstrate--through appropriate analytical testing, functional assays, and/or in some cases animal and/or clinical studies--that the change does not have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they relate to the safety oreffectiveness of the product.15 The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process (ICH Q5E) describes scientific principles in the comparability assessment for manufacturing changes.\n\nFootnote 15: See 21 CFR 601.12 and 21 CFR 314.70 for regulatory requirements for changes (including manufacturing changes) made to a licensed biologics license application (BLA) and an approved NDA, respectively.\n\nDemonstrating that a proposed product is biosimilar to a reference product typically will be more complex than assessing the comparability of a product before and after manufacturing changes made by the same manufacturer. This is because a manufacturer that modifies its own manufacturing process has extensive knowledge and information about the product and the existing process, including established controls and acceptance parameters. By contrast, the manufacturer of a proposed product is likely to have a different manufacturing process (e.g., different cell line, raw materials, equipment, processes, process controls, and acceptance criteria) from that of the reference product and no direct knowledge of the manufacturing process for the reference product. Therefore, even though some of the scientific principles described in ICH Q5E may also apply in the demonstration of biosimilarity, in general, FDA anticipates that more data and information will be needed to establish biosimilarity than would be needed to establish that a manufacturer\'s post-manufacturing change product is comparable to the pre-manufacturing change product.\n\nV U.S.-LICENSED Reference Product and Other Comparators\n\nTo obtain licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act, a sponsor must demonstrate that the proposed product is biosimilar to a single reference product that previously has been licensed by FDA.16 In general, a sponsor needs to provide information to demonstrate biosimilarity based on data directly comparing the proposed product with the reference product. As a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical PK study and, if appropriate, at least one PD study, intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity for purposes of section 351(k) of the PHS Act must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed. However, a sponsor may seek to use data derived from animal or clinical studies comparing a proposed product with a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act. In such a case, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.17 Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program their plans to provide an adequate scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of such justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFootnote 16: Sections 7002(a)(2) and (b)(3) of the Affordable Care Act, adding sections 351(k), 351(i)(2), and 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act.\n\nVI Approaches to developing and assessing evidence to demonstrate biosimilarity\n\nFDA recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to develop the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity. FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence provided by a sponsor when the Agency evaluates the sponsor\'s demonstration of biosimilarity, consistent with a longstanding Agency approach to evaluating scientific evidence.18\n\nFootnote 18: See footnote 4.\n\nUsing a Stepwise Approach to Demonstrate Biosimilarity\n--------------------\nContext title: Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product'

It does not create any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist sponsors in demonstrating that a proposed therapeutic protein product (hereinafter proposed product2) is biosimilar to a reference product for purposes of the submission of a marketing application under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act).3 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) amends the PHS Act and other statutes to create an abbreviated licensure pathway in section 351(k) of the PHS Act for biological products shown to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed biological reference product (see sections 7001 through 7003 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) (Public Law 111-148). Although the 351(k) pathway applies generally to biological products, this guidance focuses on therapeutic protein products and gives an overview of important scientific considerations for demonstrating biosimilarity. The scientific principles described in this guidance may also apply to other types of proposed biosimilar biological products.\n\nFootnote 2: In Section II (Scope) of this document, the term proposed product is also used to describe a product that is the subject of a new drug application (NDA) submitted through the pathway described by section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).\n\nFootnote 3: The statutory definition of biosimilar and definitions of selected other terms used in this guidance are provided in the glossary at the end of the document.\n\nThis guidance is one in a series of guidances that FDA is developing to implement the BPCI Act. These guidances address a broad range of issues, including:\n\nQuality Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity of a Therapeutic Protein Product to a Reference Product\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\n2.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAdditional topics discussed include the following:\n\nConsiderations of the complexities of therapeutic protein products when designing a biosimilar development program, including manufacturing process considerations\n\nUse of data derived from studies comparing a proposed product with a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product\n\nPostmarketing safety monitoring considerations\n\nThis guidance applies to applications submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. However, some scientific principles described in this guidance may be informative for the development of certain biological products under section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act.5 Section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act and section 351(k) of the PHS Act are two separate statutory schemes. This guidance is not intended to describe any relationship between the standards for approval under these schemes.\n\nFootnote 5: A 505(b)(2) application is an NDA that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use (e.g., the Agency’s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug or published literature). A 505(b)(2) application that seeks to rely on a listed drug (i.e., the reference product) must contain adequate data and information to demonstrate that the proposed product is sufficiently similar to the listed drug to justify reliance, in part, on FDA’s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for the listed drug. Any aspects of the proposed product that differ from the listed drug must be supported by adequate data and information to support the safety and effectiveness of the proposed product.\n\n3 Background\n\nThe BPCI Act was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act on March 23, 2010. The BPCI Act creates an abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products demonstrated to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference product. Section 351(k) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)), added by the BPCI Act, sets forth the requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product and an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product.6 Section 351(i) of the PHS Act defines biosimilarity to mean ""that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components"" and that ""there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product.""7 The BPCI Act also amended the definition of biological product to include ""protein (except any chemically synthesized polypeptide).""8\n\nFootnote 6: General scientific issues relating to the demonstration of interchangeability will be addressed separately.\n\nFootnote 7: Section 7002(b)(3) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 8: Section 7002(b)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, amending section 351(i) of the PHS Act.\n\nUnder section 351(k) of the PHS Act, a proposed biological product that is demonstrated to be biosimilar to a reference product can rely on certain existing scientific knowledge about thesafety, purity, and potency9 of the reference product to support licensure. FDA will license a proposed biological product submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act if FDA ""determines that the information submitted in the application.(\\ldots) is sufficient to show that the biological product is biosimilar to the reference product (\\ldots)"" and the 351(k) applicant (or other appropriate person) consents to an inspection of the facility that is the subject of the application (i.e., a facility in which the proposed biological product is manufactured, processed, packed, or held).10\n\nFootnote 9: The standard for licensure of a biological product as potent under section 351(a) of the PHS Act has long been interpreted to include effectiveness (see 21 CFR 600.3(s) and the guidance for industry on Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products).

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: An applicant may use endpoints that are different from those in the listed drug's clinical trials if they are scientifically justified. For example, response rate may be an appropriate endpoint for a non-inferiority trial in the oncology setting where the listed drug was approved based on a progression-free survival endpoint. Certain endpoints that are effectively PD biomarkers, as discussed above, also may be acceptable.\n\nIt is generally appropriate for the applicant of a proposed drug product containing nanomaterials to seek approval only for indications that have been previously approved for the listed drug relied upon, unless new clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy are conducted in the proposed new indication.\n\n505(j) Submissions\n\nAn applicant may seek approval of a generic product that references a drug product containing nanomaterials by submitting an ANDA under section 505(j) of the FD&C Act. An ANDA applicant must demonstrate, among other things, that the generic drug product is bioequivalent to the reference listed drug (RLD) (section 505(j)(2)(A)(iv) of the FD&C Act).37 In addition, an ANDA must contain sufficient information to show that the proposed generic drug has the same active ingredient(s), previously approved conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, strength, and (with certain exceptions) labeling as the RLD, and has adequate information to assure and preserve the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug.38 BE studies are conducted with the goal of demonstrating that the generic drug has the same rate and extent of absorption at the site of action as the RLD (21 CFR 314.3, 320.21(b)(1)).\n\nFootnote 37: Under the FD&C Act, “[a] drug shall be considered to be bioequivalent to a listed drug if (\\ldots) the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug when administered at the same molar dose of the therapeutic ingredient under similar experimental conditions in either a single dose or multiple doses.” See section 505(j)(8)(B)(i); see also implementing regulations at 21 CFR part 320.\n\nFootnote 38: See, e.g., sections 505(j)(2)(A) and (j)(4) of the FD&C Act; see also 21 CFR 314.94 and 21 CFR 314.127.\n\nNanomaterials range from simple nanocrystals, organic nanomaterials (e.g., liposome, polymeric nanoparticle), and inorganic nanomaterials (e.g., gold nanoparticles), to complex-structure integrated nanoparticles (e.g., core-shell, surface modified nanoparticles). In general, an ANDA applicant is responsible for providing sufficient scientific evidence based on a comprehensive in vivo PK evaluation and in vitro physicochemical characterization to demonstrate bioequivalence between a proposed generic drug and its nanomaterial-containing RLD. In addition, for an active ingredient that is a nanomaterial, comprehensive characterization of the RLD and understanding of the fundamental chemistry used to form the active ingredient may be needed to demonstrate active ingredient sameness. Current thinking is that any critical structural change in the multiple components of nanomaterial-based products may influence the BE, pharmacology, and toxicology profiles.\n\nTherefore, there are additional challenges that should be considered for demonstrating BE for a drug product containing nanomaterials. First, the active ingredients of some nanomaterials are generally heterogeneous mixtures which may require considerable characterization to demonstrate active ingredient sameness. Second, some excipients in drug products containing nanomaterials are complex and available from different sources (e.g., naturally sourced, semi-synthetic, or synthetic). These excipients should be sufficiently controlled to ensure their intended properties. Third, the properties of nanomaterials can be dependent on the manufacturing processes, which can be complicated and involve lengthy steps. Fourth, after administration, the therapeutic moiety often exists in multiple forms, e.g., free drug39 or nanomaterial-associated drug, both in systemic circulation and at the site of action. Therefore, it is critical to identify the most therapeutically relevant moiety for establishing BE.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nDue to the diversity of nanomaterial formulations, drug release mechanisms, and unique bio-distribution, evidence of comparable PK parameters in blood/plasma in conventional BE studies alone may or may not be sufficient to establish BE of the proposed generic drug product and the RLD. Drug levels in systemic circulation may not always reflect drug concentration at the site of action. However, the type of BE studies sufficient to satisfy the requirements for generic drug approval depend on the route of administration and nanomaterials employed.\n\nFor orally-administered drug products containing nanomaterials that have relatively low risk, PK studies in blood/plasma and BE criteria generally are considered sufficient to demonstrate BE between the generic and the RLD. ANDA applicants can refer to FDA's draft guidance for industry on Bioequivalence Studies with Pharmacokine Endpoints for Drugs Submitted Under an ANDA (December 2013)40 for recommendations on BE study design. Generally, both fasted and fed BE studies are recommended to demonstrate BE of orally administered drug products.\n\nFootnote 40: When final, this guidance will represent the FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nANDAs referencing oral drug products using nanomaterials to improve BA for poorly water-soluble drugs need not use that particular nanomaterial or any nanomaterial, but may use alternative strategies to achieve the same BA enhancement. There are a number of effective technologies that exist to improve drug BA, including the use of amorphous solid dispersions, introduction of surfactants or co-solvents, and others. If the ANDA applicant uses a different type of nanomaterial than the RLD (e.g., nanocrystal versus nanomaterials other than nanocrystals) that may potentially affect nanoparticle distribution in the GI tract, additional characterization and evidence supporting non-specific drug uptake by Peyer's patch or other GI tissues, should be provided.\n\nFor drug products containing nanomaterials administered non-orally, it is generally recommended that the generic applicant conduct appropriate in vitro tests as part of demonstrating BE and conduct in vivo BE studies when necessary. In addition, for certain non-oral drug products the applicant should, or in some cases must, demonstrate that the generic product contains the same inactive ingredients (i.e., is qualitatively the same (Q1)) in the same concentration (i.e., is quantitatively the same (Q2)) as the RLD.41 The inclusion of additional measures, such as comparative physicochemical testing (i.e., as in vitro elements of a BE study), may be needed as a scientific matter to ensure similar bioavailability, since comparable PK parameters in blood/plasma alone may not be sufficient to do so. Examples of such physicochemical characterizations include particle morphology, particle size and distribution, surface charge, in vitro drug release, free and nanomaterial-associated drug, and others. These in vitro characterizations should be conducted on at least three different batches of each of the generic and reference drug products and compared using appropriate methods. For example, it might be appropriate to demonstrate comparable size and distribution of nanomaterials using a statistical equivalence approach, such as population BE.42 As for the most therapeutically relevant moietyfor in vivo BE studies, the ANDA applicant should provide concentration-time curves for all clinically relevant entities (e.g., free drug and/or nanomaterial-associated drug) relating to the drug release from nanoparticles, in order to enable an accurate assessment of the PK of the generic product. Generally, the PK of both the free drug and nanomaterial-associated drug in the blood/plasma should be comparable between the generic and the RLD, based on adequate and validated bioanalytical methods.[43]\n\nThe potential multi-component structure of drug products containing nanomaterials allows great flexibility of drug delivery designs. Due to the complexity and diversity of materials, structures, and functionalities of nanomaterials in drug products, FDA currently examines these drug products and develops product-specific guidances on a product-by-product basis.[44] A number of product-specific guidances for generic drug development, including draft product-specific guidances with BE recommendations for doxorubicin hydrochloride liposomal injection, sodium ferric gluconate colloidal complex, and others have been published.\n\n351(k) Submissions\n\nThe development of a biosimilar to a biological reference product containing nanomaterials should generally follow current guidance on biosimilars.[45] The contribution of the nanomaterial to product safety, purity, and potency should be assessed as part of the product development and the demonstration of biosimilarity or interchangeability. Applicants are encouraged to contact FDA early during the development of biosimilars containing nanomaterials.\n\nBioanalytical Methods\n\nAll clinically relevant entities, i.e., parent drug and major active metabolites, if possible, should be measured in the appropriate biologic matrices after administration of products containing nanomaterials. In general, total, free, and nanomaterial-associated drug should be measured separately or indirectly derived. This may require separation of free and nanomaterial-associated drug prior to detection or simultaneous analysis. The concentrations of free parent drug and major active metabolite(s) may be low. The use of validated, specific, and highly sensitive methods is recommended.\n\nIn Vitro Tests With Human Biomaterials\n--------------------\nContext title: Drug Products, Including Biological Products, that Contain Nanomaterials - Guidance for Industry""

Column headings (e.g., ""Amount Per Serving"" and ""% Daily Value"") and footnotes (e.g., ""Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet"") must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Because many dietary supplement products may contribute a negligible amount of calories, we do not require information about calories to be displayed in a larger type size or highlighted on Supplement Facts labels (81 FR 33742 at 33939).\n\nFor small packages which have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, all information within the nutrition label must be in type size no smaller than 4.5 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(i)).\n\nIntermediate-sized packages, which have from 12 to 40 square inches of surface area available to bear labeling, have different type size requirements. All information within the nutrition label must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)). However, type size no smaller than 4.5 point may be used on packages that have less than 20 square inches available for labeling and more than eight dietary ingredients to be listed (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)). Similarly, type size no smaller than 4.5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches available for labeling and more than 16 dietary ingredients to be listed (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)).\n\nThe footnote stating that the ""Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet"" is required if the percent DV is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, protein, or added sugars (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D)). On labels of products represented or purported to be for use by children 1 through 3 years of age, the footnote statement must read: ""Percent Daily Values are based on a 1,000 calorie diet"" if the % Daily Value is declared for total fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, protein, or added sugars (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D)).\n\nIf there is inadequate space to list the required information vertically, the list may be split. The list to the right must be set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the dietary ingredients and percent DV information given to the left (21 CFR 101.36(e)(12)). The column headings are also repeated (21 CFR 101.36(e)(12)). Figure 17 reflects this label formatting.\n\nIX When Must I Comply with the Rule?\n\nIf you have $10 million or more in annual food sales, your compliance date is January 1, 2020.

For two packets, this would consist of five columns. List all of the dietary ingredients in the first column. List the amounts and percents of the morning packet in the second and third columns and similar information for the evening packet in the fourth and fifth columns (see the illustration of aggregate nutrition labeling in 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iii)).\n\nCompliance\n\nWhat kind of samples will FDA collect to determine compliance with 21 CFR 101.36?\n\nFDA will collect a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller. FDA will randomly select these packages.\n\nWhat if it is not technically feasible for me to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements?\n\nFDA may permit you to use an alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9). If your firm needs such special allowances, you must make your request in writing to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(f)(2)\n\nMust dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?\n\nFor dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value.\n\nExemptions\n\nWhat are the circumstances in which my dietary supplement products would be exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements? Your dietary supplement product is not required to have a ""Supplement Facts"" panel if: a. Your firm is a small business that has not more than $50,000 gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers or not more than $500,000 per year from total sales in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1); b. You sell less than 100,000 units of the product annually, your firm has fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(2) andyou file an annual notification with FDA as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(18)(iv); or c. You ship the product in bulk form, do not distribute it to consumers in such form, and you supply it for use in the manufacture of other dietary supplements in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(3). The two exemptions for small businesses and low-volume products (a. and b. above) are available to you only if your products\' labels bear no claims or other nutrition information.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(h)(1) - (3)\n\nSpecial Labeling Provisions\n\nWhat are small packages?\n\nSmall packages are those packages having less than 12 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)\n\nWhat is the telephone provision for small packages?\n\nIn lieu of a ""Supplement Facts"" panel, you may print labels for small packages with a telephone number or address that consumers can use to obtain nutrition information. You may use a telephone number or an address in place of the ""Supplement Facts"" panel only if you place no claims or other nutrition information on the product label.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size that I may use for small packages?\n\nYou may use a type size no smaller than 4-5 point for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on the labels of small packages.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(i)\n\nMay I use a tabular or linear format for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on a small package?\n\nYes. You may use a tabular format on small packages. You also may present ""Supplement Facts"" information in a linear (i.e., string) fashion if the label will not accommodate the ""Supplement Facts"" panel in a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j) (13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display.)\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n\nWhat are intermediate-sized packages?\n\nIntermediate-sized packages are those packages having from 12 to 40 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(ii)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size for intermediate-sized packages?The ""Supplement Facts"" panel on the labels of intermediate-sized packages must use type size no smaller than 6 point, except that type no smaller than 4-5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches that list more than 16 dietary ingredients. Also, 4-5 point type may be used on packages with less than 20 square inches that list more than 8 dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the type size used in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on an inner container may be as small as needed to accommodate all required information if the ""Supplement Facts"" on the outer container meets these type size requirements.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv)\n51. May I use a tabular or linear format for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on an intermediate-sized package? You may use a tabular format on an intermediate-sized package if the package shape or size cannot accommodate vertical columns. You may use a linear format if the label will not accommodate a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n52. May I abbreviate on the labels of intermediate- sized packages? You may use the abbreviations in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B) in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel for small and intermediate-sized packages, e.g, ""Serv size"" for ""Serving Size"" and ""Servings"" for ""Servings Per Container.""\n\n21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B)\n53. Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(v)\n54. Are there special requirements that I must follow for the labeling of dietary supplements for children? Yes. On products for children less than 2 years of age, other than infant formula, you must not declare calories from fat, calories from saturated fat, saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and cholesterol. Also, on products for children less than 4 years of age, you may not include % DVs for total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, vitamin K, selenium, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, or potassium.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:17]\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What are intermediate-sized packages?\n--------------------\nContext: Figure 8: Tabular Display\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:28]\n\n11.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe third modification is the use of abbreviations, as listed in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B). We now allow for the following additional abbreviations on labels for small and intermediate-sized packages: ""vitamin"" may be abbreviated as ""Vit.,"" ""potassium"" may be abbreviated as ""Potas.,"" and ""Includes"" may be abbreviated as ""Incl."" These abbreviations will further conserve label space. In addition, we allow the abbreviations of ""Total carb."" and ""Incl."" to be used on dual-column display labels (see section VIII.D).\n\n3.3 What Type Size Must be Used for the Declaration of Calories on the Tabular or Linear Displays for Small or Intermediate-Sized Packages?\n\nThe numeric value for ""Calories"" must be in a type size no smaller than 14 point, and the word ""Calories"" must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n3.4 How Do the Declarations of Serving Size and Servings Per Container on the Tabular or Linear Displays for Small or Intermediate-Sized Packages Differ from the Standard Label Version?\n\nThe "" -- servings per container"" declaration immediately follows the ""Nutrition Facts"" heading, as in the standard label version; however, it must be in a type size no smaller than 9 point on the tabular or linear display for small packages (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i)). If a linear display is used, then the actual number of servings (i.e., ""Servings"" as shown in Fig 10) may be listed instead of the servings per container declaration.\n\nThe declaration of ""Serving size,"" which follows below the "" -- servings per container"" or ""servings"" declaration, is to be highlighted in bold or extra bold and in a type size no smaller than 9 point on the tabular or linear display for small or intermediate-sized packages. See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n11.3.5 Is the ""% Daily Value*"" Footnote Required on Foods in Small and Intermediate-Sized Packages?\n\nFor products in small and intermediate-sized packages that qualify for the use of the tabular or linear format as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) and (2), there is no longer a requirement to place an asterisk, followed by the statement ""Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet,"" at the bottom of the label if the footnote corresponding to ""% Daily Value"" is omitted. If ""Daily Value"" is not spelled out in the heading, then an asterisk can be placed at the bottom of the label followed by the statement ""% DV = % Daily Value"" in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n3.6 VIII.D How Do I Comply with the Nutrition Labeling Formatting Requirements when Dual Column Labeling is Required or Provided Voluntarily?\n\nDual column labeling is required under certain conditions, and can be used in other situations. In the Federal Register of March 2, 2018 (83 FR 9003), we announced the availability of a separate Small Entity Compliance Guide entitled ""Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That CanReasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments: Guidance for Industry,"" which, among other topics, discusses a new requirement regarding the use of dual-column labeling (Ref. [9]). In the Federal Register of December 31, 2019 (84 FR 72230), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled ""Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Sizes-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics."" This final guidance also discusses formatting issues for dual-column labeling (Ref. [10]).\n\nRegarding specific formatting for dual column labeling, the final rule updates certain requirements. Directly following the serving size declarations, each column of nutrition information must contain a heading that accurately describes why a dual column is being utilized. For example, a product may provide nutrition information for two different RDI groups, like in Figure 11 below. A product may also provide nutrition information for two different forms of the same food (e.g., ""Per 1/4 cup mix"" and ""Per prepared portion""), as in Figure 12 below (21 CFR 101.9(e)). The quantitative information by weight and percent DV must be presented for each column, and the columns are to be separated by vertical lines (21 CFR 101.9(e)(3)). Nutrient information for vitamins and minerals must be separated from the information on other nutrients by a bar and be arrayed vertically in the required order (21 CFR 101.9(e)(4)). Note that the ""Amount per serving"" statement is not required for the dual column formats (21 CFR 101.9(d)(4)). See Figures 11 through 15 (see also 21 CFR 101.9(e)(5) and (e)(6)(i)).\n\nFigure 11: Dual Column Display for 2 different RDI Groups (101.9(e)(5))\n\nFigure 12: Dual Columns, Two Forms of the Same Food (101.9(e)(5))\n\nFigure 13: Dual Column Display, Per Serving and Per Container (101.9(e)(6)(i))\n\nFigure 15 shows the use of dual columns in a tabular display format for products. As mentioned above, ""Calories"" must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point, and the numeric amount for ""Calories"" must be in a type size no smaller than 22 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). ""Serving size"" declaration must be in a type size no smaller than 9 point; however, the "" - servings per container"" declaration must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point, as with the standard label version (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i) and (ii)). ""Amount per serving"" is not required (21 CFR 101.9(d)(4)).\n\nVIIILE When Can the Simplified Format Be Used?\n\nYou can use the simplified format when a food product contains insignificant amounts of eight or more of the following: Calories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium (21 CFR 101.9(f)). For foods intended for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age, you can use the simplified format when a food product contains insignificant amounts of six or more of the following: Calories, total fat, sodium, total\n\nFigure 14: Dual Column Display, Per Serving and Per Unit (101.9(e)(6)(i))\n\nFigure 15: Tabular Dual Column Display (101.9(e)(6)(ii))\n\ncarbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, or potassium (21 CFR 101.9(f)). The definition of ""insignificant amount"" has not changed.\n\nThe footnote requirement which states, ""Not a significant source of (\\underline{\\ })"" (listing the name(s) of any nutrients listed in this paragraph that are present in insignificant amounts) still exists (21 CFR 101.9(f)(4)). While the full ""% Daily Value"" footnote (see 21 CFR 101.9(d)(9)) is not required for the simplified format, the column header ""% Daily Value"" can be abbreviated as ""% DV."" If this abbreviation is used, then an asterisk must be placed at the end of the abbreviation and the corresponding footnote must read, ""% DV = % Daily Value"" (21 CFR 101.9(f)(5)). No footnote is required if ""Daily Value"" is spelled out in the column header (21 CFR 101.9(f)(5)). Figure 16 displays an example of a simplified format label.\n\nVIIILF Are Foods in Small Packages with a Total Surface Area Available to Bear Labeling of Less than 12 Square Inches Exempt from the Nutrition Facts Labeling Requirements?\n\nNot always. Foods in small packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches are not exempt from bearing a Nutrition Facts label if a nutrition claim or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising (21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)) is used or as outlined for covered vending machine food (see 21 CFR 101.8(c)). However, as previously allowed, if your product qualifies for and uses the exemption (i.e., claims or other nutrition information are not presented on the label or in labeling or advertising), then you must list an address or telephone number that a consumer can use to obtain the required nutrition information (21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)(A)).\n\nVIIILG How Do These New Formatting Rules Affect the Percentage Juice Declaration?\n\nFigure 16: Simplified Format Label (101.9(f))\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWith the changes to some type size requirements on the Nutrition Facts label, it is permissible if the percentage juice declaration for foods purporting to be beverages that contain fruit or vegetable juice is smaller in height than the declaration of ""Serving size,"" ""Calories,"" and the numerical value for ""Calories,"" in addition to already being permitted to be smaller in height than the brand name, product name, logo, universal product code, and ""Nutrition Facts"" heading (21 CFR 101.30(e)(2)).\n\n4.2.3 VIII.H Are There Specific Formatting Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels?\n\nInformation other than the title, headings, and footnotes must be in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Column headings (e.g., ""Amount Per Serving"" and ""% Daily Value"") and footnotes (e.g., ""Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet"") must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Because many dietary supplement products may contribute a negligible amount of calories, we do not require information about calories to be displayed in a larger type size or highlighted on Supplement Facts labels (81 FR 33742 at 33939).\n\nFor small packages which have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, all information within the nutrition label must be in type size no smaller than 4.5 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(i)).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What are intermediate-sized packages?\n--------------------\nContext: Small Entity Compliance Guide on Structure/Function Claims\n\nJANUARY 2002\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (P.L. 104-121). This guidance document restates in plain language the legal requirements set forth in a regulation concerning labeling claims for dietary supplements. This is a Level 2 guidance document published for immediate implementation in accordance with FDA\'s good guidance practices (21 CFR 10.115). The regulations are binding and have the force and effect of law. However, this guidance document represents the agency\'s current thinking on this subject and does not, itself, create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute and regulations.\n\nSummary\n\nOn January 6, 2000, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a final rule in the Federal Register defining the types of statements that may be used on the label and in the labeling of dietary supplements without prior review by the agency (65 FR 1000) (http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/(\\sim)lrd/fro00106.html ). Called structure/function claims, these claims are statements that describe the effect a dietary supplement may have on the structure or function of the body. The regulation also provides criteria to assist you in determining when a statement about a dietary supplement is a disease claim, that is, a claim to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease. Disease claims require prior approval by FDA and may be made only for products that are approved drug products or for foods under separate legal provisions that apply to claims called ""health claims.""\n\nThis guidance discusses only the requirements that apply to determining whether a claim is a structure/function claim or a disease claim. It should be noted that other regulations also cover labeling and packaging requirements for dietary supplements. These requirementswere published as final rules in the Federal Registers of September 23, 1997 (62 FR 49826), June 5, 1998 (63 FR 30615), and Jan 15, 1997 (62 FR 2218)\n\n(https://www.federalregister.gov/ (https://www.federalregister.gov/)) (see Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) Parts 101 and 111).(1).\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\nThe regulation added $101.93(f) and (g) to Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 101. These two sections define what types of claims are structure/function claims and what types of claims are disease claims. In addition to these definitions, the regulation includes criteria that are intended to assist you in determining whether a particular statement is or is not a disease claim. Finally, the preamble to this rule clarifies several legal issues that are important to understand if you use structure/function claims on the labels or in the labeling of your products. They are restated below.\n\nBasic Legal Requirements for Structure/Function Claims. What are structure/function claims? The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) added section 403(r)(6) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)2. This section of the law states that a dietary supplement may bear certain statements on its label or in its labeling if the claim meets certain requirements. Section 101.93(f) simply restates part of the definition of the types of claims that may be made under section 403(r)(6) of the FD&C Act. Section 101.93(f) reads: (f) Permitted structure/function statements. Dietary supplement labels or labeling may, subject to the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, bear statements that describe the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans or that characterize the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, provided that such statements are not disease claims under paragraph (g) of this section. If the label or labeling of a product marketed as a dietary supplement bears a disease claim as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, the product will be subject to regulation as a drug unless the claim is an authorized health claim for which the product qualifies. Are there other claims that can be made for dietary supplements under this section of the law? Yes. Section 403(r)(6) also states that dietary supplements can use claims about nutrient deficiency diseases (for example, vitamin C and scurvy) or that describe the effect of the dietary supplement on general well-being. What requirements must I meet to make any of these types of claims for my dietary supplement?There are three requirements you must meet. First, the law says you can make these claims if you have substantiation that the claims are truthful and not misleading. You must have this substantiation before you make the claims. Second, you must notify FDA that you are using the claim within 30 days of first marketing your product. Third, the claim must include a mandatory disclaimer statement that is provided for in the law.\nWhere can I find information on the mandatory disclaimer and the notification I need to send in?\n\nWe have published regulations that describe exactly what the disclaimer must say and what you must include in your notification to us and where you must send it in the September 23, 1997 Federal Register (62 FR 49859 and 49883, respectively). These requirements can be found in 21 CFR 101.93(b) through (e) and 21 CFR 101.93(a), respectively.\nB. When and What You Must Do To Comply With the New Regulation.**\n\nWhen does this rule become effective?\n\nThe rule became effective on February 7, 2000, for any products marketed for the first time after publication of the final rule or for any new claims made for an existing product after publication of the final rule (i.e., new claims made after January 6, 2000).\nIf I have existing inventory, do I need to re-label it now?\n\nLarge businesses had until January 7, 2001, to bring existing claims on products into compliance. FDA granted this period for firms to use up their label inventories. Small businesses had until July 7, 2001, to bring existing claims on products into compliance. Any existing inventory not used up after these dates would need to be relabeled.\nC. How Do I Determine if a Claim is a Structure/Function Claim or a Disease Claim?\n\nIt may not be possible always to draw a bright line between structure/function and disease claims. You should look at the objective evidence in your labeling to assess whether a claim explicitly or implicitly is a disease claim. For example, a statement may not mention a disease but may refer to identifiable characteristic signs or symptoms of a disease such that the intended use of the product to treat or prevent the disease may be inferred. It is important that you keep in mind two things. First, the context of the statement, decided from information on the label and in other labeling, will determine if the statement is considered to be a disease claim. Second, dietary supplements may not bear disease claims, explicit or implied, unless the claim has undergone premarket review by FDA and has been authorized or approved under the rules for health claims or drugs, as appropriate. To assist you in deciding whether a claim is or isn\'t a disease claim, the new regulation contains a definition for disease, and then includes 10 criteria intended to help clarify the types of claims that may be made for dietary supplements without prior authorization or approval by FDA. We are providing that disease definition and an explanation of the 10 criteria below.\n\nWhat is the definition of a disease?Section 101.93(g) defines disease as:\n\n...damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition.\n\nWhat are the criteria for determining if a statement is a disease claim?\n\nThere are 10 criteria in the rule that are useful in determining if a statement is a disease claim.\n\nCriterion 1: Claims an effect on a disease or class of diseases (see section E, starting on page 1012 of the preamble to the rule).\n\nA statement is a disease claim if it mentions a specific disease or class of diseases. For example, a claim that a product is ""protective against the development of cancer"" or ""reduces the pain and stiffness associated with arthritis"" would be a disease claim.\n\nA statement also is a disease claim if it implies that it has an effect on a specific disease or class of diseases by using descriptions of the disease state. Examples of implied disease claims are ""relieves crushing chest pain (angina),"" ""improves joint mobility and reduces inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis),"" or ""relief of bronchospasm (asthma).""\n\nCriterion 2: Claims an effect on characteristic signs or symptoms of disease using scientific or lay terminology (see section F, starting on page 1015 of the preamble to the rule).\n\nHow can I tell if a particular claimed effect is a sign or symptom of a specific disease?\n\nThe test of whether claimed effects are characteristic signs or symptoms depends on 2 questions: (1) Is the condition, to which the signs and symptoms refer, related to a disease; and (2) are the signs and symptoms referred to in the labeling characteristic of the disease and permit the inference that the product is intended to affect that disease.\n\nDoes it matter if I don\'t use every sign or symptom of a condition or if I use layman\'s terms instead of technical language?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide on Structure:Function Claims'

Detailed discussion of experimental design (i.e., choice of species, dose and dosing frequency justifications, etc.) is outside the scope of this guidance. However, dosages should be appropriate to address any identified cause for concern or to provide exposure margins that are clinically relevant (e.g., when conducting a study with two early stage agents). & Because of the potential complexity of performing and interpreting a combination toxicity study with more than two entities, it is generally more practical for initial studies to evaluate combinations of no more than two entities.

What are ""data to support a rationale for the combination study""? (3.6)\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 4: See the appendix for additional information.\n\nWhen a delivery or mixing device is used, sponsors should describe the drug-delivery device and reference an approved or cleared device or device application. Sponsors should also ensure that the performance characteristics of the syringe are maintained throughout the shelf life. Sponsors should consider in-use testing.\n\nNonclinical Development\n\nNonclinical development of anticancer pharmaceuticals is described in the following guidance documents:\n\nICH guidance for industry S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals (March 2010) (ICH S9)\n\nICH guidance for industry S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals: Questions and Answers (June 2018)\n\nICH guidance for industry S6(R1) Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals (May 2012) (ICH S6(R1))\n\nGuidance for industry Oncology Pharmaceuticals: Reproductive Toxicity Testing and Labeling Recommendations (May 2019)\n\nSponsors should include pharmacology studies supporting the proposed trial with the initial IND. It is important for sponsors to test the formulation in an animal model for dose finding and chemistry and manufacturing consistency before initiating clinical trials.5 In general, sponsors should provide nonclinical, general toxicology studies in rodents and nonrodents of up to 1 month\'s duration to support early clinical development, and they should provide studies of 3 months\' duration to support pivotal registration trials. Safety pharmacology and toxicokinetic endpoints can be included in these studies rather than using stand-alone studies. The general toxicology studies should use a route of administration similar to the route of administration in the intended clinical trial and should follow the recommendations described in Table 1 of ICH S9. Consistent with ICH S6(R1), if the 1-month studies show a consistent toxicological profile, then a 3-month study in a single species may be sufficient. Because GnRH analogues are peptides with expected high specificity, secondary pharmacology studies are usually not warranted.\n\nFootnote 5: We support the principles of the 3Rs (reduce/refine/replace) for animal use in testing when feasible. FDA encourages sponsors to consult with review divisions when considering a nonanimal testing method believed to be suitable, adequate, validated, and feasible. FDA will consider if the alternative method could be assessed for equivalency to an animal test method.\n\nConsistent with the FDA guidance on reproductive testing for oncology pharmaceuticals, no embryo-fetal toxicology study or other reproductive toxicology study is needed to support the indication of advanced prostate cancer (see ICH S9, ICH S6(R1), and guidance for industry Oncology Pharmaceuticals: Reproductive Toxicity Testing and Labeling Recommendations). Unless there are unnatural amino acids (i.e., amino acids not normally found in mammals) in the GnRH product, the sponsor does not need to evaluate genotoxicity or carcinogenicity.\n\nIn general, it is not necessary to evaluate phototoxicity or immunotoxicity to support developing or marketing GnRH analogues to treat advanced prostate cancer.\n\nRegistrational Trial Considerations\n\n3.3.1 Trial Design\n\nSingle-arm trials using T levels as pharmacodynamic/response biomarkers are conducted to support the approval of GnRH analogues. These trials should demonstrate the following:\n\nAttainment of a castrate (less than 50 nanogram (ng)/deciliter (dL)) T level\n\nMaintenance of castrate T levels until the end of a dosing interval\n\nMaintenance of castrate T levels immediately after subsequent doses of the study drug product\n\nTo demonstrate these effects of the study drug product on T levels, the treatment period should be at least twice as long as the dosing interval. For drug products that act over a relatively short period (e.g., 1 month), the treatment period should extend over several (three to four) dosing intervals.\n\nSponsors should discuss with the division randomized designs intended to support comparative claims (efficacy and/or safety) among GnRH analogues.\n\n3.3.2 Trial Population\n\nParticipants enrolled in trials intended to support an indication for treating advanced prostate cancer should have normal T levels and either metastatic or biochemically recurrent disease. Sponsors could consider excluding participants with bone metastases in weight-bearing bone who are at risk for developing symptoms associated with T flare. We recommend that sponsors record information concerning the participant\'s history of prostate cancer, including the date of diagnosis, current stage, extent of metastatic disease at baseline, and prior therapies.\n\n3.3.3 Dose Selection\n\nThe study drug product dose used in the clinical trial should be informed by nonclinical testing. Sponsors should consider using early dose-finding studies or enrolling participants at multiple dose levels in the registrational trial. The adequacy of data for the selected dose for the new drug product will be assessed based on one or more clinical trials that demonstrate an adequate bridge to support the ability to rely on the safety and effectiveness of the listed drug for the new drug product.\n\n3.3.4 Trial Procedures and Timing of Assessments\n\nGnRH agonists are expected to achieve castrate T levels by Day 28, and T levels should be measured at this time. GnRH antagonists are expected to achieve more rapid development of castrate T levels than GnRH agonists. To document when castrate T levels occur, sponsors should consider weekly assessment of T levels until Day 28. Although the final analyses shoulduse T levels assessed at a central laboratory, T levels should also be assessed at local laboratories so that participants who do not have castrate T levels (on or after Day 28) can be promptly removed from the trial for safety reasons.\n\nTo ensure that castrate T levels are maintained over the dosing interval, sponsors developing GnRH agonists or antagonists should measure T levels before each dose of the study drug product. Sponsors could consider additional measurement of T levels at other time points, including the midpoint of the dosing interval, to help guide further drug product development if the predose level fails to show castrate T levels.\n\nTo assess for potential T surges following subsequent doses of a GnRH agonist, sponsors should obtain T levels at 1 hour, 4 hours, and 3 days after subsequent doses in all trial participants and provide these results as supportive efficacy data. Sponsors could consider an additional T measurement between 3 and 7 days after the additional dose. Sponsors should justify and discuss the appropriateness of the timing of T-level assessments with FDA before initiating the study.\n\nWe recommend that sponsors assess the effect of the study drug product on tumors by measuring prostate specific antigen at a central laboratory and reviewing bone scans and scans of known sites of disease (e.g., computed tomography (CT) scans). For participants with metastatic disease, tumor measurements would normally be obtained every 3 to 6 months during the treatment period, and we recommend that these results be included in the application database.\n\nSponsors should collect information on the dates of use and dose of herbal medications and dietary supplements, if they were used, at trial entry and throughout the treatment period because some herbal or alternative medications may affect T levels. Sponsors should also provide participants with a list of medications that they should not use during the trial period.\n\nAdverse event collection should solicit events using open-ended questions and known adverse events for this class of drugs, such as hot flushes, breast pain, bone pain, difficulty sleeping, and injection site reactions. After collecting data on injection site reactions, sponsors should report all terms related to this concept (e.g., injection site swelling, redness, pain) under a single term. The incidence of injection site reactions has varied markedly between trials, and this may be related to a lack of uniformity in ascertainment and assessment. Sponsors should assess adverse events throughout the treatment period and for 30 days after the end of the dosing interval. For example, sponsors should assess adverse events for 4 months after the last dose of a 3-month formulation of a GnRH analogue.\n\nSafety monitoring should include measurement of hemoglobin A1C and a lipid panel at screening and at the end of treatment, at minimum. Multiple trials have demonstrated an association between GnRH agonist use and adverse effects on insulin sensitivity and dyslipidemia, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.6 If the treatment period exceeds 1 year, these tests should be repeated annually. If the treatment period exceeds 2 years, bone density should also be measured at baseline and every 2 years.\n\nBefore trial initiation, sponsors should discuss with the division the potential use of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) to support labeling claims.7\n\nFootnote 7: See the guidance for industry Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims(December 2009) and the draft guidance for industry Core Patient-Reported Outcomes in Cancer Clinical Trials(June 2021).

What are ""data to support a rationale for the combination study""? (3.6)\n--------------------\nContext: Scope of the Guideline\n\nThis addendum does not alter the scope of the original ICH S6 Guideline. For biotechnology-derived products intended to be used in oncology the Guidance on Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmacoeticals (ICH S9 Guideline) should be consulted.\n\n2 Species Selection\n\nGeneral Principles\n\nA number of factors should be taken into account when determining species relevancy. Comparisons of target sequence homology between species can be an appropriate starting point, followed by in vitro assays to make qualitative and quantitative cross-species comparisons of relative target binding affinities and receptor/ligand occupancy and kinetics.\n\nAssessments of functional activity are also recommended. Functional activity can be demonstrated in species-specific cell-based systems and/or in vivo pharmacology or toxicology studies. Modulation of a known biologic response or of a pharmacodynamic (PD) marker can provide evidence for functional activity to support species relevance.\n\nConsideration of species differences in target binding and functional activity in the context of the intended dosing regime should provide confidence that a model is capable of demonstrating potentially adverse consequences of target modulation. When the target is expressed at very low levels in typical healthy preclinical species (e.g., inflammatory cytokines or tumour antigens), binding affinity and activity in cell-based systems can be sufficient to guide species selection.\n\nAssessment of tissue cross reactivity in animal tissues is of limited value for species selection (see Note 1). However, in specific cases (i.e., where the approaches described above cannot be used to demonstrate a pharmacologically relevant species) tissue cross-reactivity (TCR) studies can be used to guide selection of toxicology species by comparison of tissue binding profiles in human and those animal tissues where target binding is expected.\n\nAs described in ICH S6 Guideline, when no relevant species can be identified because the biopharmaceutical does not interact with the orthologous target in any species, use of homologous molecules or transgenic models can be considered.\n\nFor monoclonal antibodies and other related antibody products directed at foreign targets (i.e., bacterial, viral targets etc.), a short-term safety study (see ICH S6 Guideline) in one species (choice of species to be justified by the sponsor) can be considered; no additional toxicity studies, including reproductive toxicity studies, are appropriate. Alternatively, when animal models of disease are used to evaluate proof of principle, a safety assessment can be included to provide information on potential target-associated safety aspects. Where this is not feasible, appropriate risk mitigation strategies should be adopted for clinical trials.\n--------------------\nContext title: S6_R1_Guideline_0'

Careful evaluation of the priorities\n\n(17) involved in each trial and the risks associated with the priorities will help ensure efficiency by focusing on activities critical to achieving the trial objectives.\n\n(19) Guideline Scope\n\n(20) This guideline applies to interventional clinical trials of investigational products1 that are\n\n(21) intended to be submitted to regulatory authorities. This guideline may also be applicable to\n\n(22) other interventional clinical trials of investigational products that are not intended to support\n\n(23) marketing authorisation applications in accordance with local requirements.\n\n(24) Guideline Structure\n\n(25) This ICH GCP Guideline is composed of principles and annexes that expand on the principles,\n\n(26) with specific details for different types of clinical trials. The principles are intended to apply\n\n(27) across clinical trial types and settings and to remain relevant as technological and\n\n(28) methodological advances occur. The principles outlined in this guideline may be satisfied using\n\n(29) differing approaches and should be applied to fit the intended purpose of the clinical trial.\n\n(30) Annex-(1) is intended to provide information on how the principles can be appropriately applied\n\n(31) to clinical trials.

This guideline should be read in\n\n(33) conjunction with other ICH guidelines relevant to the design and conduct of clinical trials,\n\n(34) including multiregional trials.\n\n1 Principles of ICH GCP\n\nClinical trials are a fundamental part of clinical research that support the development of new medicines or uses of existing medicines. Well-designed and conducted clinical trials help answer key questions in healthcare and drug development. Their results are essential for evidence-based healthcare decisions. Trials with inadequate design and/or poorly conducted trials may place participant safety at risk and yield inadequate or unreliable evidence and are unethical. They waste resources and the efforts and time of investigators and participants.\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_E6(R3)_DraftGuideline_2023_0519'

It was also influenced by \'Guidelines on the Statistical Analysis of Clinical Studies\' (March, 1992) from the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration document entitled \'Guideline for the Format and Content of the Clinical and Statistical Sections of a New Drug Application\' (July, 1988).

The document will also assist scientific experts charged with preparing application summaries or assessing evidence of efficacy and safety, principally from clinical trials in later phases of development.\n\nScope and Direction\n\nThe focus of this guidance is on statistical principles. It does not address the use of specific statistical procedures or methods. Specific procedural steps to ensure that principles are implemented properly are the responsibility of the sponsor.

What are ""data to support a rationale for the combination study""? (3.6)\n--------------------\nContext: It is important to ensure that the experiences, perspectives, needs, and priorities of relevant stakeholders relating to the development and evaluation of the drug throughout its lifecycle are captured and meaningfully incorporated into drug development planning.\n\nClinical development may also feature requirements for co-development of validated biomarkers, diagnostic testing, or devices that facilitate the safe and effective use of a drug.\n\nThe types of studies that can contribute to drug development are described in subsections IV.2 (4.2) and IV.3 (4.3) and summarized in the Annex.\n\nQuality of Investigational Medicinal Product (4.1)\n\nEnsuring adequate quality and characterization of physicochemical properties of investigational medicinal product is an important element in planning a drug development program and is addressed in ICH and regional quality guidances. More extensive characterization may be required for complex or biological products. Formulations should be well characterized in the drug development plan, including information on bioavailability, wherever feasible, and should be appropriate for the stage of drug development and the targeted patient population. Age-appropriate formulation development may be a consideration when clinical studies are planned in pediatric populations (ICH guidances for industry E11 Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population (December 2000) and E11(R1) Addendum: Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population (April 2018)).\n\nEvaluation of the quality of a drug may extend to devices required for its administration or a companion diagnostic to identify the targeted population.\n\nChanges in a product during development should be supported by comparability data to ensure the ability to interpret study results across the development program. This includes establishing links between formulations through bioequivalence studies or other means.\n\nNonclinical Studies (4.2)\n\nGuidance on nonclinical safety studies is provided in the ICH guidance for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals (January 2010), in ICH Safety (S) Guidances and related question-and-answer documents, as well as in regional guidance. The nonclinical assessment usually includes toxicology, carcinogenicity, immunogenicity, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and other evaluations to support clinical studies (and may encompass evidence generated in in vivo and in vitro models, and by modelling and simulation). The scope of nonclinical studies, and their timing with respect to clinical studies, depend on a variety of factors that inform further development, such as the drug\'s chemical or molecular properties; pharmacological basis of principal effects (mechanism of action); route(s) of administration; absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; physiological effects on organ systems; dose/concentration-response relationships; metabolites; and duration of action and use. Use of the drug in special populations (e.g., pregnant or breast-feeding people, children) may require additional nonclinical assessments. Guidance for nonclinical safety studies to support human clinical studies in special populations should be reviewed (see, e.g., the ICH guidances for industry S5(R3) Detection of Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity for Human Pharmaceuticals (May 2021), S11 Nonclinical Safety Testing in Support of Development of Pediatric Pharmaceuticals (May 2021), and M3(R2).\n\nAssessment of the preclinical characteristics, including physiological and toxicological effects of the drug, serves to inform clinical study design and planned use in humans. Before proceeding to studies in humans, there should be sufficient nonclinical information to support initial human doses and duration of exposure.\n\nClinical Studies (4.3)\n\nClinical drug development, defined as studying the drug in humans, is conducted in a sequence that builds on knowledge accumulated from nonclinical and previous clinical studies. The structure of the drug development program is shaped by many considerations and comprised of studies with different objectives, designs, and dependencies. The Annex provides an illustrative list of example studies and their objectives. Although clinical drug development is often described as consisting of four temporal phases (phases 1 through 4), it is important to appreciate that the phase concept is a description and not a requirement, and that the phases of drug development may overlap or be combined.\n\nTo develop new drugs efficiently, it is essential to identify their characteristics in the early stages of development and to plan an appropriate development program based on this profile. Initial clinical studies may be more limited in size and duration to provide an early evaluation of short-term safety and tolerability, as well as proof of concept of efficacy. These studies may provide pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and other information needed to choose a suitable dosage range and/or administration schedule to inform further clinical studies. As more information is known about the drug, clinical studies may expand in size and duration, may include more diverse study populations, and may include more secondary endpoints in addition to the primary measures of efficacy. Throughout development, new data may suggest the need for additional studies.\n\nThe use of biomarkers has the potential to facilitate the availability of safer and more effective drugs, to guide dose selection, and to enhance a drug\'s benefit-risk profile (see the ICH guidance for industry E16 Biomarkers Related to Drug or Biotechnology Product Development: Context, Structure, and Format of Qualification Submissions (August 2011)) and can be considered throughout drug development. Clinical studies may evaluate the use of biomarkers to better target patients more likely to benefit and less likely to experience adverse reactions, or as intermediate endpoints that could predict clinical response.\n\nThe following subsections describe the types of studies that typically span clinical development from the first studies in humans through late development and post-approval.\n\n1.1.1 Human Pharmacology (4.3.1)\n\nThe protection of study participants should always be the first priority when designing early clinical studies, especially for the initial administration of an investigational product to humans (usually referred to as phase 1). These studies may be conducted in healthy volunteer participants or in a selected population of patients who have the condition or the disease, depending on drug properties and the objectives of the development program.\n\nThese studies typically address one or a combination of the following aspects:\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nEstimation of Initial Safety and Tolerability (4.3.1.1)\n\nThe initial and subsequent administration of a drug to humans is usually intended to determine the tolerability of the dose range expected to be evaluated in later clinical studies and to determine the nature of adverse reactions that can be expected. These studies typically include both single- and multiple-dose administration.\n\nPharmacokinetics (4.3.1.2)\n\nCharacterization of a drug\'s absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion continues throughout the development program, but the preliminary characterization is an essential early goal. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies are particularly important to assess the clearance of the drug and to anticipate possible accumulation of parent drug or metabolites, interactions with metabolic enzymes and transporters, and potential drug-drug interactions. Some PK studies are commonly conducted in later phases to answer more specialized questions. For orally administered drugs, the study of food effects on bioavailability is important to inform the dosing instructions in relation to food. Obtaining PK information in subpopulations with potentially different metabolism or excretion, such as patients with renal or hepatic impairment, geriatric patients, children, and ethnic subgroups, should be considered (ICH guidances for industry E4 Dose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration (November 1994), E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations: Geriatrics (August 1994), E11 and E11(R1) Addendum, and E5, respectively).\n\nPharmacodynamics and Early Measurement of Drug Activity (4.3.1.3)\n\nDepending on the drug and the endpoint of interest, pharmacodynamic (PD) studies and studies relating drug levels to response (PK/PD studies) may be conducted in healthy volunteer participants or in patients with the condition or disease. If there is an appropriate measure, PD data can provide early estimates of activity and efficacy and may guide the dosage and dose regimen in later studies.\n\nExploratory and Confirmatory Safety and Efficacy Studies (4.3.2)\n\nAfter initial clinical studies provide sufficient information on safety, clinical pharmacology, and dose, exploratory and confirmatory studies (usually referred to as phases 2 and 3, respectively) are conducted to further evaluate both the safety and efficacy of the drug. Depending on the nature of the drug and the patient population, this objective may be combined in a single or small number of studies. Exploratory and confirmatory studies may use a variety of study designs depending on the objective of the study.\n--------------------\nContext title: E8(R1) General Considerations for Clinical Studies']","['A scientific rationale should be provided to justify a combination clinical study.

40,"After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?","['--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?\n--------------------\nContext: IV SCOPE OF GUIDANCE\n\nThis guidance is intended to help manufacturers and repackagers understand and satisfy the requirements of section 582(b)(2) and (e)(2) of the FD&C Act, respectively, to affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product that they intend to introduce in a transaction into commerce. The recommendations in this guidance are intended to assist manufacturers and repackagers in developing standardized formats for the human- and machine-readable information that is contained in the product identifier. The requirements set forth in the DSCSA do not change the linear barcode requirements under 21 CFR 201.25.\n\nV Product Identifiers under the DSCSA\n\nAs noted in Section II of this guidance, a product identifier is defined under section 581(14) of the FD&C Act as a standardized graphic that includes the product\'s standardized numerical identifier (composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number), lot number, and expiration date, in both human- and machine-readable formats. The machine-readable format must be on a data carrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization.10 The product identifier data is specifically required under section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act to be in a ""2-dimensional data matrix barcode"" for packages and in a ""linear or 2-dimensional data matrix barcode"" for homogenous cases, which can be verified using ""human-readable or machine-readable methods.""11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 581(14) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act. As described in section 582(a)(9)(A), FDA may decide in the future to allow the use of other technologies for data instead of, or in addition to, the 2-dimensional data matrix barcode or linear barcode.\n\nUnder section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act, manufacturers are required to ""affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce"" beginning no later than November 27, 2017. Under section 582(e)(2) of the FD&C Act, repackagers are required to ""affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction in commerce"" beginning no later than November 27, 2018. Therefore, each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce must include the NDC, unique serial number, lot number, and expiration date in both human- and machine-readable formats.\n\nVI Compliance Policy for Product Identifier Requirements\n\nIn the guidance titled ""Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Compliance Policy,"" FDA stated that it did not intend to take enforcement action against manufacturers who did not, prior to November 27, 2018, affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction intocommerce as required by section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.12 As the time frame described in this compliance policy has since ended, it no longer represents the Agency\'s thinking in terms of enforcement policy.\n\nFootnote 12: See guidance for industry Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy (September 2018).

The linear barcode requirements were established for different purposes than the DSCSA requirements and apply to additional FDA-regulated products and packaging in some instances, and are still in effect. In the Federal Register of February 26, 2004 (69 FR 9120), FDA published a final rule requiring certain human drug and biological product labels to have a linear barcode that contains, at a minimum, the drug\'s NDC number (SS 201.25).18 Manufacturers, repackers (also known as ""repackagers""), relabelers, and private label distributors of human prescription drug products, biological products, and over-the-counter (OTC) drug products dispensed pursuant to an order and commonly used in hospitals, are subject to the linear barcode requirement. The linear barcode must appear on the drug\'s label as defined by section 201(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(k)). FDA has interpreted that requirement to mean the linear barcode should be on the outside container or wrapper, as well as on the immediate container unless the barcode is readily visible and machine-readable through the outside container or wrapper.19\n\nFootnote 18: See 69 FR 9120 at 9140 (Feb. 26, 2004), https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2004-02-26/pdf/04-4249.pdf.\n\nAs stated in the preamble to the final rule:\n\nBar codes can help reduce or detect potential medication errors by enabling health care professionals to check whether they are giving the right drug via the right dose and right route of administration to the right patient at the right time.20\n\nFootnote 20: Id. at 9120.\n\nThe preamble contemplated that linear barcodes, the use of scanning equipment, and computerized databases would be part of a system that could help reduce the number of medication errors that occur in hospitals and other health care settings.21\n\nFootnote 21: Id. at 9120.\n\nManufacturers, repackers, relabelers, and private label distributors of drug products who are subject to the establishment registration and drug listing requirements in section 510 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360) are responsible for placing the appropriate barcode on the product.22 The following prescription drug products, however, are exempted under SS 201.25 from the linear barcode requirements:\n\nFootnote 22: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products. Private label distributors who do not also manufacture, repack, relabel, or salvage drugs are not required to register under part 207.\n\nFootnote 23: For the purposes of the linear barcode requirements, radiopharmaceuticals are considered “radioactive drugs” or “radioactive biological products”, as defined in 21 CFR 310.3(n) and 21 CFR 600.3(ce), respectively.\n\nFootnote 24: § 201.25(b)(1)(ii).\n\nprescription drug samples\n\nallergenic extracts\n\nintrauterine contraceptive devices regulated as drugs\n\nmedical gases\n\nradiopharmaceuticals23\n\nlow-density polyethylene form fill and seal containers that are not packaged with an overwrap.\n\nFootnote 23: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products. Private label distributors who do not also manufacture, repack, relabel, or salvage drugs are not required to register under part 207.\n\nIn addition, the linear bar code requirement does not apply to prescription drugs that are sold by a manufacturer, repacker, relabeler, or private label distributor directly to patients, unless versions of that same drug are also sold to or used in hospitals.24\n\nIX Questions and Answers\n\nAgency Contacts\n\nWho should be contacted for questions related to barcode requirements for drug packages and homogenous cases under the DSCSA?\n\nFor CDER-regulated products, inquiries should be emailed to:\n\nCDER BarcodeQuestions(@fda.hhs.gov.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 18: See section 582(b)(2) of the FD&C Act. Product Identifier is defined in section 581(14) and includes the product’s standardized numerical identifier, which is composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number (see section 581(20)).\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(b)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 20: See section 582(b)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nProduct Tracing and Verification\n\nUnder section 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act, trading partners are required to provide the subsequent purchaser with product tracing information22 for each transaction23 involving a DSCSA-covered MMA product. For example, if the manufacturer transfers ownership of a DSCSA-covered MMA product to a wholesale distributor, the wholesale distributor generally shall not accept ownership of a product unless the manufacturer has, prior to or at the time of the transaction, provided the transaction history, transaction information, and a transaction statement for the product.24\n\nFootnote 21: See FDA Guidance for Industry Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (Sept. 2018). This guidance and other guidance documents on the DSCSA are available on FDA’s website at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nFootnote 22: For purposes of this guidance, the term product tracing information refers to the transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statement defined in section 581(26), (25), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nTrading partners also are required to have verification systems in place for the DSCSA-covered MMA products to comply with the requirements under section 582(b)(4), (c)(4), (d)(4), and (e)(4) of the FD&C Act. These requirements include steps to handle suspect and illegitimate product.25\n\nFootnote 23: Suspect product is defined in section 581(21), and illegitimate product is defined in section 581(8), of the FD&C Act.\n\nVIII. Importation of MMA Products\n\nThis section sets forth recommendations intended to assist importers of MMA products by facilitating an efficient and effective admissibility review. Following the procedures in this section will also assist FDA in determining that the importation is authorized and not, for example, a counterfeit.\n\nImportant Entries for MMA Products\n\nTo help FDA verify that a shipment that purports to contain an MMA product is one in which the manufacturer26 has, in fact, authorized the drug to be marketed in the United States and has caused the drug to be labeled to be marketed in the United States, we strongly encourage the filing of an electronic entry in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). If a manufacturer plans to use or authorize another process for making entry of an MMA product other than ACE, such as a paper entry, we strongly encourage the manufacturer to inform FDA in advance. FDA\'s view is that international mail is not appropriate for the importation of MMA products.\n\nFootnote 26: As noted in footnote 5, above, for purposes of this guidance, the manufacturer is the NDA or BLA holder for the MMA product.\n\nACE is currently the sole Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system authorized by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to process electronic entry and entry summary filings for FDA-regulated products. Submitting complete, accurate information in ACE facilitates effective and efficient admissibility review by FDA. FDA regulations set forth the required data elements that must be submitted in an electronic entry in ACE, or any other EDI system authorized by CBP, for any entry that includes FDA-regulated products (21 CFR Part 1, Subpart D).27\n\nFootnote 27: FDA published its final rule, “Submission of Food and Drug Administration Import Data in the Automated Commercial Environment,” on November 29, 2016 (81 FR 85854), and the rule was effective December 29, 2016.\n\nAt the time of filing entry in ACE, a filer must submit, among other elements, a Drug Listing Number, which is currently the NDC for drugs, including biological products and combination products, regulated by CDER (21 CFR 1.74). For drugs, biological products and combination products, regulated by CBER, the Drug Listing Number is not required. Although not required, FDA strongly encourages filers to submit the Drug Listing Number for CBER-regulated MMA products in ACE at the time of entry because this information will assist FDA\'s initial screening and further review of the entry, which can significantly increase the likelihood that the entry line will receive an automated ""May Proceed"" from FDA.\n\nManufacturer Authorization for MMA Products\n\nAs stated above, section 801(d)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act provides that, with limited exceptions:\n\n[N]o drug that is subject to section 503(b)(1) [of the FD&C Act] may be imported into the United States for commercial use if such drug is manufactured outside the United States, unless the manufacturer has authorized the drug to be marketed in the United States and has caused the drug to be labeled to be marketed in the United States.\n\nUnder this provision, any shipment of a purported MMA product that is offered for importation would be subject to refusal unless the manufacturer has authorized the MMA product to be marketed in the United States. It is essential that FDA be provided the information needed to confirm that each shipment of a purported MMA product offered for importation has been authorized for marketing in the United States by the manufacturer. To help ensure that a particular shipment is authorized, and to help mitigate the potential for counterfeiting, the manufacturer should provide information that is sufficient for FDA to verify that each shipmentof an MMA product has, in fact, been authorized by the manufacturer to be marketed in the United States. This information is described in the following paragraph.\n\nFDA strongly encourages manufacturers to submit a report via the Electronic Submissions Gateway (ESG) (or to an alternative transmission point identified by FDA) notifying the Agency of the importation of an MMA product 10 business days in advance of the first import entry of an MMA product covered by the report, which will facilitate FDA\'s timely admissibility review when the MMA product is offered for import. This report should include: the MMA product name, dosage form, and quantity of the MMA product; the name, address, and telephone number of the authorized importer; and any temporal or other limitations the manufacturer has placed on the authorized importation. For example, a report could authorize multiple shipments of an MMA product for a specified period of time. An updated report should be timely submitted by the manufacturer each time there is a change to the material information in the report; this updated report would be submitted before any additional imports affected by the changes are entered into ACE. Manufacturers who choose to submit this report must do so electronically in Portable Document Format (PDF) using the Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) format and the ESG (or to an alternative transmission point identified by FDA).28 The report should be referenced and placed in Module 1. For further information regarding eCTD, please refer to FDA\'s website at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/Electr\n\nonicSubmissions/ucm153574.htm.\n\nFootnote 28: FDA Guidance for Industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format — Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specifications (Jan. 2019). For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIX Other Requirements applicable to an MMA product\n\nAn MMA product is subject to all relevant requirements of applicable statutes, including those implemented by FDA such as the FD&C Act and the PHS Act; applicable implementing regulations under those authorities; and other relevant statutes, including the Social Security Act, the Poison Prevention Packaging Act, and the Controlled Substances Act. The provisions implemented by FDA include, but are not limited to, provisions related to adulteration and misbranding, and requirements related to adverse event reporting (or postmarketing safety reporting for combination products under 21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B), recalls, and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAppendix A: Dear Healthcare Provider Letter\n\nDear Healthcare Provider\n\nMonth Year\n\nIMPORTED PRODUCT FOLLOWING PROCEDURES IN: ""Importation of Certain FDA-\n\nApproved Human Prescription Drugs, Including Biological Products, and Combination Products\n\nunder Section 801(d)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act: Guidance for\n\nIndustry"" - MODEL LETTER\n\nSubject: Importation of TRADENAME (nonproprietary name for drugs/proper name for\n\nbiological products) (NDC #1, NDC #2): Availability of an FDA-approved prescription drug/biological product/combination product that was originally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and authorized for sale in that foreign country.\n\nDear Health Care Provider:\n\nThe purpose of this letter is to inform you that TRADENAME (NDC #1, NDC #2), an FDA-\n\napproved prescription drug(s)/biological product(s)/combination product(s) that was/were\n\noriginally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and authorized for sale in that foreign\n\ncountry, will be available in the United States.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 10: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(d)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 12: For this guidance, (tradangpartner) is defined as described in section 581(23)(A) of the FD&C Act. Although third-party logistics providers are also considered trading partners under section 581(23)(B) of the FD&C Act, they are not subject to the same product tracing requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nThe Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public Law 113-54) was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier, authorized trading partner, and verification requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers, and dispensersto facilitate the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act is prohibited under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nOne requirement of the verification scheme outlined in the DSCSA is the verification of saleable returned product. Under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act, wholesale distributors must have systems in place that will enable them to verify the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, on each sealed homogeneous case of saleable returned product, or, if such product is not in a sealed homogeneous case, on each package of saleable returned product. A saleable returned product may not be further distributed until the product identifier is verified.13 The product should be handled as suspect product if the product identifier is not successfully verified (i.e., it should be quarantined and investigated).14. 15 FDA published the 2019 Compliance Policy on September 24, 2019, announcing a 1-year delay in enforcement against wholesale distributors who do not verify the product identifier of saleable returned product prior to further distributing such product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 14: See Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs (October 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIn addition, section 582 of the FD&C Act requires certain trading partners (manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers) to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and a transaction statement when engaging in transactions involving certain prescription drugs.16({}^{,})17 A transaction statement must include a statement that the entity transferring ownership in a transaction had systems and processes in place to comply with verification requirements under section 582 of the FD&C Act.18 In the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA acknowledged that wholesale distributors may not have systems in place by November 27, 2019, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, the 2019 Compliance Policy indicated FDA\'s intent to take no enforcement action prior to November 27, 2020, against a wholesale distributor that provided a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor did not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(c)(4)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act details how wholesale distributors must handle suspect product.\n\nFootnote 17: Transaction, transaction history, transaction information, and transaction statement are defined under sections 581(24), (25), (26), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582 also includes requirements for dispensers to verify product identifiers when investigating suspect or illegitimate product. Specifically, section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act provides that, effective November 27, 2020, dispensers must verify ""the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, of at least 3 packages or 10 percent of such suspect product, whichever is greater, or all packages, if there are fewer than 3, corresponds with the product identifier for such product [in the dispenser\'s possession or control]"".19 Section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act requires dispensers to verify product as described in 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act when they have received a notification of illegitimate product from FDA or a trading partner.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIII Compliance Policy for Wholesale Distributor Verification of Saleable Returned Product\n\nAfter publishing the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA has received comments and feedback from wholesale distributors, as well as other trading partners and stakeholders, expressing additional concern with industry-wide readiness for implementation of the verification of saleable returned product requirement for wholesale distributors. Stakeholders have explained that the primary factors FDA considered when issuing the 2019 Compliance Policy still exist: (1) the very large volume of saleable returned products requiring verification; (2) the need to refine and test verification systems during actual production using real-time volumes of saleable returned product rather than simply in pilots; and (3) the complexities of building an interoperable, electronic system with the capabilities to timely and efficiently verify the large volume of saleable returned products amid immature technologies.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some wholesale distributors may still need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, when the delay in enforcement set forth in the 2019 Compliance Policy expires, before they can begin verifying returned products prior to resale or other further distribution as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act in an efficient, secure, and timely manner. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against wholesale distributors who do not verify a product identifier prior to resale or other further distribution of a package or sealed homogenous case of product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAdditionally, FDA recognizes that wholesale distributors may still not have systems in place by November 27, 2020, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, prior to November 27, 2023, FDA does not intend to take action against a wholesale distributor for providing a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor does not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.20\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPolicy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (September 2018), addresses such returns.28_\n\nFootnote 28: For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page.\n\nIV Compliance Policy for the Dispenser Verification Requirements\n\nIn the years since the passage of the DSCSA, FDA has received comments and feedback from dispensers expressing concern with readiness for implementation of certain requirements under section 582(d) of the FD&C Act, including the verification requirements addressed in this compliance policy. Specifically, dispensers have described challenges with implementation of these provisions in the DSCSA due to the time necessary to develop technologies and processes that would support a robust verification system.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some dispensers may need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, before they can begin to verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect and illegitimate products as described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect product as required by section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act. In addition, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify, as required by section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act, the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of product that is the subject of an illegitimate product notification by FDA or a trading partner.\n--------------------\nContext title: Wholesale Distributor Verification Requirement for Saleable Returned Drug Product and Dispenser Verification Requirements When Investigating a Suspect or Illegitimate Product—Compliance Policies'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes FDA\'s compliance policy with regard to a requirement related to product identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. Specifically, this guidance addresses the requirement in section 582(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360eee-1(b)(2)) that manufacturers ""affix or imprint a product identifier2 to each package3 and homogenous case4 of a product5 intended to be introduced in a transaction6 into commerce"" beginning not later than November 27, 2017.7\n\nFootnote 2: Product identifier is defined in section 581(14) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee(14)) as a standardized graphic that includes, in both human-readable formand on a machine-readable datacarrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization, the standardized numerical identifier, lot number, and expiration date of the product.\n\nFootnote 3: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 4: Homogeneous case is defined in section 581(7) of the FD&C Act. The terms “homogeneous” and “homogenous” are used interchangeably throughout the DSCSA. FDA has chosen to use only the term “homogenous” throughout this guidance.\n\nFootnote 5: Product is defined in section 581(13) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 6: Transaction is defined in section 581(24) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 7: See section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe compliance policy set forth in this guidance applies only to the requirement regarding product identifiers described above. In brief, FDA does not intend to take action against manufacturers who do not affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product before November 27, 2018. This represents a one year delay in enforcement of the requirement for manufacturers to affix or imprint product identifiers.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances  means that something  is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe Drug Supply  Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public  Law 113-54)  was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier,  authorized trading partner, and verification  requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors,  repackagers, and dispensers  to facilitate  the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution  supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 is prohibited  under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nAn important  requirement of the product tracing scheme outlined  in the DSCSA is the product identifier.  Section 582 requires that each package and homogenous  case of product in the pharmaceutical distribution  supply chain bear a product identifier  in both a human-readable  form and on a machine-readable  data carrier. The product identifier includes  the product\'s standardized  numerical identifier,8 lot number, and expiration  date. Manufacturers are required  to begin affixing  or imprinting  a product identifier  to each package and homogenous  case of a product intended to be introduced  in a transaction into commerce no later than November 27, 2017. Repackagers are required to do the same no later than November 27, 2018.9\n\nFootnote 8: Standardized numerical identifier is defined in section 581(20) of the FD&C Act as a set of numbers or characters used to uniquely identify each package or homo genus case that is composed of the National Drug Code that corresponds to the specific product (including the particular package configuration) combined with a unique alphanumeric serial number of up to 20 characters.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 582(e)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSince product packaged by a manufacturer during  the one year delay in enforcement of the product identifier requirement is also subject to the policy  set forth in the final guidance Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (grandfathering policy),  trading partners should  read that final  guidance to understand how to treat such product for the purposes of the product identifier  and verification requirements.10\n\nFootnote 10: Final guidance for industry Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended for trading partners (manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and repackagers) who must provide and capture certain product tracing information, as required under section 582 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360eeee-1). This guidance addresses the readiness of the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain to comply with the provisions in section 582 of the FD&C Act related to the exchange of product tracing information. Requirements for the tracing of products through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain go into effect on January 1, 2015, for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and repackagers, and on July 1, 2015, for dispensers.\n\nThis guidance announces the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) intention with regard to enforcement of the product tracing information requirements under section 582 of the FD&C Act. FDA does not intend to take action against trading partners (manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and repackagers) who do not, prior to May 1, 2015, provide or capture the transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statement required by section 582 of the FD&C Act (product tracing information) associated with each transaction of certain human, finished prescription drugs, as defined in section 581 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee).\n\nFDA's guidance documents do not typically establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nOn November 27, 2013, the DSCSA was signed into law. Section 202 of the DSCSA, which adds new sections 581 and 582 to the FD&C Act, sets forth new definitions and requirements related to product tracing. The DSCSA outlines critical steps to build an electronic, interoperable system by November 27, 2023, which will identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed within the United States. This system will enhance FDA's ability to help protect U.S. consumers by improving detection and removal of potentially dangerous products from the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain.\n\nStarting in 2015, trading partners are required under section 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act to provide the subsequent purchaser with product tracing information when engaging in transactions involving certain prescription drugs. Trading partners are also required to capture the product tracing information and maintain the applicable information for not less than 6 years after the date of the transaction.\n\nFDA, in consultation with other appropriate Federal officials and pharmaceutical distribution supply chain stakeholders, published a draft guidance as required under section 582(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act, entitled DSCSA Standards for the Interoperable Exchange of Information for Tracing of Certain Human, Finished, Prescription Drugs: How to Exchange Product Tracing Information (November 2014).2 This draft guidance established initial standards for the interoperable exchange of the product tracing information related to each transaction of certain human, finished, prescription drugs covered by the statute, in paper or electronic format, through the extension and/or use of current systems and processes.\n\nFootnote 2: This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance Web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nIII Scope of this guidance\n\nThis guidance applies to certain trading partners (manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and repackagers) engaged in transactions3 involving products, as defined in section 581(13) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 3: Transaction is defined in section 581(24) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIV Product tracing requirements - compliance policy\n\nThe product tracing requirements in sections 582(b), (c), and (e) of the FD&C Act take effect for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and repackagers on January 1, 2015. However, some trading partners have expressed concern that unforeseen complications with the exchange of the required information may result in disruptions in the supply chain, and ultimately could impactpatients' access to needed prescription drugs. FDA recognizes that some manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and repackagers may need additional time beyond January 1, 2015, to work with trading partners to ensure that all of the product tracing information required under section 582 of the FD&C Act is provided to and captured by the recipient trading partner. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action against trading partners who do not, prior to May 1, 2015, provide or capture the product tracing information required by section 582(b)(1), (c)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act. This compliance policy is limited to the requirements that trading partners provide and capture product tracing information; it does not extend to other requirements in section 582 of the FD&C Act, such as verification related to suspect and illegitimate product (including quarantine, investigation, notification and recordkeeping) and requirements related to engaging in transactions only with authorized trading partners.\n--------------------\nContext title: DSCSA Implementation- Product Tracing Requirements — Compliance Policy""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?\n--------------------\nContext: The Product Identifier Requirement of the DSCSA and the Linear Barcode Requirement Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nIs my product package required to have both a linear barcode and a 2D data matrix barcode?\n\nIt depends. There will be instances when a product package is required to have both a linear barcode, pursuant to SS 201.25, and a 2D data matrix barcode, pursuant to the DSCSA. For a product for which a manufacturer, under the DSCSA, has identified the smallest individual saleable unit intended for ultimate sale to a dispenser--which is a ""package"" under FD&C Act section 581(11)--the package would generally require a 2D data matrix barcode to comply with the DSCSA48 in addition to the requisite linear barcode under SS 201.25. See Section E of this guidance for examples of when a 2D data matrix barcode may not be required.\n\nFootnote 48: See FD&C Act sections 582(b)(2)(A) and 582(a)(9).\n\nWith the enactment of the DSCSA, is the guidance for industry ""Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers"" (August 2011) still applicable for the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25?\n\nYes. The guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers remains applicable to the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25 unless or until such time the guidance is revised, replaced, or withdrawn. This guidance should be consulted for questions specific to the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.49\n\nFootnote 49: See guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers (August 2011), available at https://www.fda.gov/files/vaccines%2C%20blood%20%26%20biologies/published/Guidance-for-Industry–Bar-Code-Label-Requirements.pdf).\n\nCan I put only a 2D data matrix barcode on my product as required under the DSCSA in lieu of the linear barcode that is required under SS 201.25, since it also includes the NDC number?\n\nNo. At this time, a 2D data matrix barcode may not be used as a substitution for a linear barcode when one is required under SS 201.25 for packages of product.\n\nCan a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n\nYes. A manufacturer or repackager may voluntarily put the 2D data matrix barcode on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container, if the product remains compliant with all other labeling requirements, including the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.\n\nExamples of When the Product Identifier Is Required Under the DSCSA and the Linear Barcode Is Required Under SS 201.25\n\nFor each of their products, manufacturers and repackagers are responsible for determining the smallest individual saleable unit that they intend for ultimate sale to a dispenser. Under the DSCSA, both a 2D data matrix barcode and the human-readable portion of the product identifier are required to be affixed or imprinted on each such individual saleable unit. While other levels of product packaging may exist that do not require a 2D data matrix barcode, as noted in Question and Answer #19, manufacturers and repackagers may voluntarily affix or imprint a 2D data matrix barcode if the product remains compliant with all other labeling requirements, including the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.\n\nThe following table provides examples of different units of a package or case and what barcode would be required under the DSCSA and under SS 201.25.

If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to provide advice to sponsors, clinical investigators, and institutional review boards (IRBs) on how to determine the differences between significant risk and nonsignificant risk medical device studies. This document supersedes Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies (September 1998) Office of Health Affairs, Food and Drug Administration. This document was revised to update the list of examples of significant and nonsignificant risk devices, to clarify the IRB\'s responsibilities when making the risk determination for investigational medical devices, and to make the guidance consistent with the Agency\'s good guidance practices regulations (21 CFR 10.115).\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) regulation (21 CFR 812) describes three types of device studies: significant risk (SR), nonsignificant risk (NSR), and exempt studies. In this guidance, we discuss the two types of studies that are subject to the IDE regulation - the SR and NSR studies. For information on studies that are exempt from the IDE regulation, see the Information Sheet Guidance entitled, ""Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Devices.""\n\nIII.SIGNIFICANT RISK AND NON-SIGNIFICANT RISK DEVICE STUDIES\n\nAppendix A What is a Significant Risk Device Study?\n\nUnder 21 CFR 812.3(m), an SR device means an investigational device that:\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for use supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n\nB.What is a Nonsignificant Risk Device Study?\n\nAn NSR device study is one that does not meet the definition for an SR device study.\n\nAppendix C Who Decides Whether A Device Study is SR or NSR?\n\nSponsors are responsible for making the initial risk determination and presenting it to the IRB. FDA is also available to help the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB in making the risk determination.2\n\nFootnote 2: See the guidance entitled, “Procedures for Handling Inquiries Regarding the Need for an Investigational Device Exemptions Application for Research Involving Medical Devices.” This guidance may be found at:\n\nwww.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulatonandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm126598.\n\nUnless FDA has already made a risk determination for the study, the IRB must review the sponsor\'s SR or NSR determination for every investigational medical device study reviewed and modify the determination if the IRB disagrees with the sponsor. If FDA has already made the SR or NSR determination for the study, the agency\'s determination is final. FDA is available to help the IRB when making its risk determination. (Also, see section VII. ""How does an IRB document the SR or NSR determination?"")FDA is the final arbiter as to whether a device study is SR or NSR and makes the determination when an IDE is submitted to FDA or if asked by the sponsor, clinical investigator, or IRB. See 21 CFR SS 812.2(b)(1)\n\n4 What are the Major Differences Between SR And NSR Device Studies?\n\nThe major differences between SR and NSR studies are in the IDE approval process and in the sponsor\'s record keeping and reporting requirements, as outlined below.\n\nSignificant Risk (SR) Device Studies\n\nSR device studies must follow all the IDE regulations at 21 CFR 812.\n\nSR device studies must have an IDE application approved by FDA before they may proceed.\n\nNonsignificant Risk (NSR) Device Studies\n\nNSR device studies must follow the abbreviated requirements at 21 CFR 812.2(b).\n\nThese abbreviated requirements address labeling, IRB approval, informed consent, monitoring, records, reports, and prohibition against promotion. However, there is no need to make progress reports or final reports to FDA.\n\nNSR device studies do not have to have an IDE application approved by FDA.\n\nSponsors and IRBs do not have to report the IRB approval of an NSR device study to FDA. This means that an IRB may approve an NSR device study and an investigator may conduct the study without FDA knowing about it.\n\nAn IRB\'s NSR determination is important because the IRB serves as the FDA\'s surrogate for review, approval, and continuing review of the NSR device studies. An NSR device study may start at the institution as soon as the IRB reviews and approves the study and without prior approval by FDA.\n\nWHAT ARE THE SPONSOR\'S RESPONSIBILITIES WHEN INITIATING A DEVICE STUDY?\n\n5 For Nonsignificant Risk Device Studies\n\nIf the sponsor identifies a study as NSR, the sponsor must provide the reviewing IRB an explanation of its determination (21 CFR 812.2(b)(1)(ii)) and should provide any other information that may help the IRB in evaluating the risk of the study. For example, a description of the device, reports of prior investigations with the device, the proposed investigational plan, subject selection criteria, and other information the IRB may need.\n\nIf FDA has determined that the study is NSR, the sponsor should so inform the IRB. By providing such risk determination information to the IRB, the IRB\'s workload should be reduced and the review process should be facilitated.\n\nFor Significant Risk Device Studies\n\nThe sponsor must submit an IDE application to FDA and obtain the agency\'s approval of the study. (See 21 CFR 812.20(a)(1) and (2))\n\nThe sponsor must advise its clinical investigators about the SR status and obtain their agreement to comply with the applicable regulations governing such studies (i.e., 21 CFR Parts, 50, 56, 812) (See 21 CFR 812.43(c)(4)(i)). Sponsors should provide the IDE number and/or a copy of the IDE approval letter to the IRB when requested.\n\nSponsors may send their SR device study to an IRB for review before the IDE application is approved by FDA. However, FDA cautions that an SR device study may not begin until FDA approves the IDE.\n\nV What Are the IRB\'s responsibilities when it receives a device study for review?\n\nIRBs should have standard operating procedures that explain how the IRB makes SR and NSR determinations and that the decision should be documented. FDA considers this determination to be part of the IRB\'s responsibilities for conducting its initial review of a study. (See 21 CFR 56.108)\n\nIRBs should make the SR or NSR determination about a study by reviewing relevant information at a convened meeting. This information includes the description of the device, reports of prior investigations conducted with the device, the proposed investigational plan, and subject selection criteria. The sponsor should provide the IRB with a risk assessment and the rationale used in making its SR or NSR determination.\n\nAn IRB may agree or disagree with the sponsor\'s initial NSR assessment.\n\nIf the IRB determines the study is NSR, the IRB may approve the study using the criteria at 21 CFR 56.111. The study may begin without submission of an IDE application to FDA.\n\nIf the IRB disagrees with the sponsor\'s NSR assessment and decides the study is SR, the IRB must tell the clinical investigator, and where appropriate, the sponsor. (See 21 CFR 812.66)* An IRB may approve the study as an SR device study, but the study may not begin until FDA approves the sponsor\'s IDE application.\n--------------------\nContext title: Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA is committed to improving U.S. patient access to new devices by strengthening and streamlining the clinical trial enterprise so that medical device clinical trials are conducted in the U.S. in an efficient and cost-effective manner, while maintaining appropriate patient and research participant protections.\n\nThe purpose of this guidance is to provide greater clarity for FDA staff and investigational device exemption (IDE) sponsors and sponsor-investigators1 regarding the principal factors that FDA considers when assessing the benefits and risks of IDE applications for human clinical studies.\n\nConsistent with applicable laws and regulations, FDA may disapprove an IDE application if, among other reasons, ""[t]here is reason to believe that the risks to the subjects are not outweighed by the anticipated benefits to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained.""2 In many cases, the Agency believes that effective risk management, including the application of risk controls, which includes risk mitigation measures, can result in a favorable IDE benefit-risk determination.\n\nFDA recognizes that in assessing risks and anticipated benefits, the medical device total product lifecycle should be considered, and that earlier stages of device development and investigational clinical study are typically associated with greater uncertainty (i.e., a lower level of evidence). A primary goal of this guidance is to clarify the factors that FDA considers when assessing risks and anticipated benefits as significant contributors to the decision to approve IDE studies, and how uncertainty may be offset by a variety of risk mitigation measures which can ensure appropriate patient and research participant protections in investigational research settings. For proposed IDE studies, at earlier stages of device development, FDA considers appropriate mitigation measures for anticipated possible risks and unanticipated risks, whereas in later stages, FDA considers whether risk mitigation measures focus on the most probable risks.\n\nFootnote 2: 21 CFR 812.30(b)(4).\n\nAnother important goal of this guidance is to characterize benefits in the context of investigational research, which includes direct benefits to the subject and benefits to others (to the extent there are indirect benefits to subjects such as knowledge to be gained from the study or information that may contribute to developing a treatment).\n\nAs with the benefit-risk framework for evaluating marketing applications, FDA assessment of benefits and risks for an IDE application takes into account the contextual setting in which the study is being proposed, including but not limited to characterization of the disease or condition being treated or diagnosed, the availability of and risks associated with alternative treatments or diagnostics. When available, information characterizing subject tolerance for risk and their perspective on benefit may provide useful context during this assessment. See for more information FDA Guidance, Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications (http://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm517504.pdf).\n\nFDA believes use of this benefit-risk framework will facilitate the incorporation of evidence and knowledge from different domains--clinical, nonclinical, and patient--to support a comprehensive, balanced decision-making approach. FDA envisions this will facilitate a common understanding between FDA and sponsors/sponsor-investigators by highlighting which factors are critical in the benefit-risk assessment for a specific application, and clearly explaining how these factors influence FDA\'s decisions. This guidance document will also help improve the predictability, consistency, and transparency of the review process for IDE applications.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this one, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Scope\n\nThis guidance document explains the principal factors that FDA considers when assessing benefits and risks of original IDE applications, IDE amendments and IDE supplements for human clinical investigations of certain medical devices to determine safety and effectiveness. The approach discussed in this guidance is applicable to studies subject to the IDE requirements in 21 CFR part 812, including postmarket studies. In general, IDE applications are required for clinical investigations of significant risk devices to determine safety and effectiveness.3 This guidance applies to both diagnostic and therapeutic devices. This guidance is not intended to provide recommendations regarding device-specific data or study requirements.\n\nFootnote 3: 21 CFR 812.2 and 20.\n\n3 Informed Consent and IDE Decisions\n\nThe purpose of the IDE regulations, as set forth in Title 21 CFR part 812, is to encourage, to the extent consistent with the protection of public health and safety and with ethical standards, the discovery and development of useful devices intended for human use, and to maintain optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of this purpose.4 Title 21 CFR part 812 applies to all clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness with some exceptions, as described in 21 CFR 812.2(c).\n\nFootnote 4: 21 CFR 812.1.\n\nFDA approval of an IDE application prior to study initiation is typically required for a clinical investigation conducted in the U.S. of a significant risk device that is not approved or cleared for the indication being studied.5 As defined in 21 CFR 812.3(m), a significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nFootnote 5: See section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 812.2(b) for conditions under which an IDE application is required prior to study initiation.\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations for Medical Device Investigational Device Exemptions Guidance for Investigational Device Exemption Sponsors, Sponsor-Investigators and Food and Drug Administration Staff'

The analysis plan should describe the futility analyses to be conducted. FDA recommends designs, such as the Simon two-stage design, that limit exposure to an ineffective drug (Simon 1989). However, other statistical approaches may be acceptable and, if proposed, should be described in detail in the SAP. If a sponsor anticipates that the results would form the basis of an efficacy claim in a marketing application, the clinical protocol and SAP should ensure that collected data are of adequate quality for this purpose. If preliminary results from a substudy or substudies suggest a major advance over available therapy, the sponsor should meet with the review division to discuss modifications to the protocol (e.g., to propose interim analyses for efficacy or consider early termination of the trial) or to modify the development program (e.g., discuss potential for breakthrough therapy designation).\n\nRandomized Designs\n\nIf a sponsor incorporates randomization into an umbrella trial design, FDA recommends use of a common control arm when possible. The general comments about generation of an appropriate SAP and information about futility analysis in the previous section (VII. A., Nonrandomized, Activity-Estimating Design) also apply to randomized trials. Before initiating the proposed substudy, the sponsor should meet with the division to discuss the SAP with regard to how the strength of evidence will be assessed and how potential sources of bias will be controlled.\n\nMaster Protocols Employing Adaptive/Bayesian Design\n\nIn master protocols that incorporate adaptive designs, the SAP should provide all information described in the guidances for industry Adaptive Designs for Clinical Trials of Drugs and Biologics and Enrichment Strategies for Clinical Trials to Support Determination of Effectiveness of Human Drugs and Biological Products. The SAP should also describe plans for futility analyses.22 Master protocols can use a Bayesian statistical method or other methods for planning or modifying the sample size, dropping an arm, and other adaptive strategies. The SAP should include details on implementation of Bayesian or other methods.\n\nFootnote 22: See also the ICH guidance for industry E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials and the guidance for clinical trial sponsors Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees.\n\nMaster Protocols With Biomarker-Defined Subgroups\n\nIn master protocols with basket or complex design, where human subject assignment to a treatment arm is based on the presence of a specific biomarker of interest, the protocol should clearly specify how subjects with more than one biomarker of interest will be assigned tosubstudies. There are two approaches to making such assignments that FDA recommends from a clinical trial design perspective, but other approaches may also be appropriate. One approach is to prioritize biomarkers or treatments. For example, in the BATTLE-1 trial, investigators ranked the biomarker groups based on their predictive values and assigned human subjects with multiple biomarkers to the group for one of their biomarkers that has the highest predictive value (Kim et al. 2011). The other approach is based on a prespecified randomization ratio. For example, the Lung-MAP trial uses a reversed ratio of prevalence rates. Using reverse prevalence ratios, subjects in the trial with tumors that have biomarkers with low prevalence have a greater likelihood to be assigned to a substudy for the lower prevalence population.23 Consideration should be given to the clinical relevance, if any, of low-prevalence passenger mutations that coexist with driver mutations, for which adjustment to randomization may not be needed. Sponsors should provide justification for the selected approach and should state in the justification whether the proposed approach of assigning subjects with more than one biomarker of interest to a particular substudy would impact the prevalence of the biomarkers in each subpopulation and whether any statistical methods to address this potential issue/bias are needed.\n\nFootnote 23: See the guidance for industry Developing Targeted Therapies in Low-Frequency Molecular Subsets of a Disease (October 2018).\n\nVIII Safety Considerations\n\nSafety Monitoring and Reporting Plans\n\nThe sponsor of the master protocol IND is required to ensure proper monitoring of the investigations and to ensure that the investigations are conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols contained in the IND (21 CFR 312.50).24 Similarly, the sponsor of the investigational product IND for a drug that will be administered under a master protocol IND is responsible for monitoring the safety of its drug and evaluating all accumulating safety data, including data from trials not conducted by the sponsor of the investigational product IND (21 CFR 312.32(b)). The sponsor of the master protocol IND should establish a systematic approach that ensures rapid communication of serious safety issues to all participating clinical investigators and FDA under IND safety reporting regulations.25 Additionally the master protocol IND sponsor should ensure rapid communication of serious safety issues to the sponsors of all products used in the master protocol, according to the established safety reporting plan. In addition, the approach should describe the process for rapid implementation of protocol amendments to address serious safety issues.26\n\nFootnote 24: See the guidance for industry Oversight of Clinical Investigations — A Risk-Based Approach to Monitoring (August 2013).\n\nFootnote 25: 21 CFR 312.32.\n\nSafety monitoring and reporting obligations of the sponsor of the master protocol IND and sponsors of each IND covered by the master protocol remain unchan\n\n3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThese reporting obligations are described, along with recommendations to help sponsors comply with expedited safety reporting requirements, in the draft guidance for industry Sponsor Responsibilities--Safety Reporting Requirements and Safety Assessment for IND and Bioavailability/Bioequivalence Studies (June 2021).27\n\nFootnote 27: When final, this guidance will represent the FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nFor master protocols in oncology, FDA may expect a sponsor to conduct aggregate analyses of all SAEs at intervals based on the volume of safety data collected or based on the number of subjects accrued into the master protocol in order to fulfill its review obligations under 312.32(b). A sponsor would then be required to submit events that qualify for reporting under 312.32(c) and as described in the draft guidance for industry Sponsor Responsibilities--Safety Reporting Requirements and Safety Assessment for IND and Bioavailability/Bioequivalence Studies. The frequency of the cumulative aggregate safety analyses should be discussed with the Agency at a pre-IND meeting, taking into account specific program needs.\n\nGiven the complexity of and the generally rapid accrual to these trials, resulting in increased risks to subjects should there be a failure to promptly identify suspected and unexpected serious adverse reactions, sponsors should select medical monitors who have training and experience in cancer research and in the conduct of clinical trials so that safety information can be promptly assessed.\n\nIndependent Safety Assessment\n--------------------\nContext title: Master Protocols- Efficient Clinical Trial Design Strategies to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: If a clinical study is needed to demonstrate substantial equivalence, i.e., conducted prior to obtaining 510(k) clearance of the device, the study should generally be conducted under the Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) regulation, 21 CFR 812. Generally, we believe PTA balloon catheters and specialty catheters addressed by this guidance document are significant risk devices subject to all requirements of 21 CFR part 812. Please see the FDA guidance, ""Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies.""13 In addition to the requirements of 21 CFR part 812, sponsors of such trials must comply with the regulations governing institutional review boards (21 CFR part 56) and informed consent (21 CFR part 50). When data from clinical investigations conducted outside the United States are submitted to FDA for PTA and specialty catheters, the requirements of 21 CFR 812.28 may apply.14 21 CFR 812.28 outlines the conditions for FDA acceptance of clinical data from investigations conducted outside the US when submitted to support premarket submissions. For more information, see the FDA guidance, ""Acceptance of Clinical Data to Support Medical Device Applications and Submissions: Frequently Asked Questions.""15\n\nFootnote 13: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/significant-risk-and-nonsignificant-risk-medical-device-studies\n\nFootnote 14: Applies to data from clinical investigations that began on or after February 21, 2019 and are submitted to support a premarket submission, including IDEs, PMAs, and 510(k)s.\n\nFootnote 15: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/acceptance-clinical-data-support-medical-device-applications-and-submissions-frequently-asked\n\nFootnote 16: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-real-world-evidence-support-regulatory-decision-making-medical-devices\n\nIn some cases, ""real-world data"" (RWD) may be used to support expansion of the indication for a device for which 510(k) clearance has already been obtained. Whether the collection of RWD for a legally-marketed device requires an IDE depends on the particular facts of the situation. Specifically, if a cleared device is being used in the normal course of medical practice, an IDE would likely not be required. For additional information regarding this topic, please refer to the FDA Guidance entitled ""Use of Real-World Evidence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Medical Devices.""16\n\nFootnote 16: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-real-world-evidence-support-regulatory-decision-making-medical-devices\n\nAppendix J Labeling\n\nThe regulatory submission must include proposed labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy the requirements of 21 CFR 807.87(e) for premarket notifications. Labeling for PTA balloon catheters and specialty balloons should include all applicable information, including indications, contraindications, warnings, product information, a summary of the clinical data (if applicable), and directions for use.\n\nAs prescription devices, PTA balloon and specialty catheters are exempt from having adequate directions for lay use under section 502(f)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) as long as the conditions in 21 CFR 801.109 are met. For instance, labeling must include adequate information for practitioner use of the device, including indications, effects, routes, methods, frequency and duration of administration (e.g., infusion time, inflation duration), and any relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects and precautions (21 CFR 801.109(d)).\n\nAppendix K Modifications\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3), a device change or modification ""that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device"" or represents ""a major change or modification in the intended use of the device"" requires a new 510(k).17 The changes or modifications listed below are examples of changes that may require submission of a new 510(k). Note that this list is not exhaustive but provides examples of modifications that are likely to require submission of a new 510(k). For additional details, please see FDA guidance ""Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device.""18\n\nFootnote 17: Section 3308 of the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, Title III of Division FF of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328 (“FDORA”), enacted on December 29, 2022, added section 515C “Predetermined Change Control Plans for Devices” to the FD&C Act (section 515C). Under section 515C, FDA can approve or clear a predetermined change control plan (PCCP) for a device that describes planned changes that may be made to the device and that would otherwise require a supplemental premarket approval application or premarket notification. For example, section 515C provides that a supplemental premarket approval application (section 515C(a)) or a premarket notification (section 515C(b)) is not required for a change to a device if the change is consistent with a PCCP that is approved or cleared by FDA. Section 515C also provides that FDA may require that a PCCP include labeling for safe and effective use of a device as such device changes pursuant to such plan, notification requirements if the device does not function as intended pursuant to such plan, and performance requirements for changes made under the plan. If you are interested in proposing a PCCP in your marketing submission, we encourage you to submit a Pre-Submission to engage in further discussion with CDRH.

However, IDE studies must comply with the applicable requirements set forth in 21 CFR part 812, including requirements for informed consent under 21 CFR part 50, labeling of devices for investigational use only, study monitoring, records and reporting, and approval by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with 21 CFR part 56.6\n\nFootnote 6: Section 520(g)(3) of the FD&C Act.\n\nii.1.4 Informed Consent\n\nA key tenet of FDA\'s IDE benefit-risk framework is appropriate protection of human subjects and a key principle of human subject protection in clinical investigations is the informed consent process.7 This process goes beyond obtaining a signature on an informed consent form. The informed consent process provides the prospective subject or his or her legally authorized representative with adequate information about the study, including pertinent information about the investigational device, its risks and benefits, alternatives, and what is expected of the subject in order to participate in the study (e.g., study visits, procedures, maintaining subject diaries).8\n\nFootnote 7: See generally, 21 CFR part 50.\n\nThe subject or his or her legally authorized representative must be given sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate in the clinical study under circumstances that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.9\n\nFootnote 8: See 21 CFR 50.25.\n\nAn informed consent process should allow an individual to decide to accept potential risks associated with a study in exchange for the potential for anticipated benefits to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained. The informed consent process allows individuals to exercise their personal tolerance of risks as weighed against other factors, including the reasonably expected benefits and the alternatives to the study.\n\nThe informed consent process ensures that each individual makes a determination about study participation after being informed of the study, including the risks and benefits of study participation, and, if applicable, the possibility of receiving no direct benefit. The informed consent regulations in 21 CFR part 50 describe the informed consent aspects of human subject protection in clinical investigations subject to FDA regulations. For example 21 CFR 50.20, states the following:\n\n_""Except as provided in 50.23 and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative.""_In addition, 21 CFR 50.25(a)(2) states that the informed consent must include ""a description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject.""\n\nRegulatory Standard for IDE Decisions\n\nUnder section 520(g)(4)(B) of the FD&C Act, an IDE application may only be disapproved if FDA finds that the investigation does not conform to the procedures and conditions prescribed under regulations. The purpose of the IDE process is ""to encourage, to the extent consistent with the protection of the public health and safety and with ethical standards, the discovery and development of useful devices intended for human use and to that end to maintain optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of that purpose.""10\n\nFDA\'s decision-making process for IDE applications was modified with the passage of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) of 2012 (Pub. L. No. 112-144). Section 601 of FDASIA amended Section 520(g) of the FD&C Act to specify certain situations in which FDA cannot disapprove an IDE application. Section 520(g)(4)(C) of the FD&C Act states that, consistent with section 520(g)(1), FDA shall not disapprove an IDE application because:\n\nFootnote 10: Section 520(g)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nthe investigation may not support a substantial equivalence or de novo classification determination or approval of the device;\n\nthe investigation may not meet a requirement, including a data requirement, relating to the approval or clearance of a device; or\n\nan additional or different investigation may be necessary to support clearance or approval of the device.\n\nConsidering the above criteria, when the objective of a proposed study is to support a marketing submission, the sponsor may benefit from learning whether there are protocol modifications that FDA believes are needed for the study to adequately support product approval or clearance. FDA intends to convey such considerations to the sponsor to provide greater clarity and predictability. For more information, see the FDA Guidance, FDA Decisions for Investigational Device\n\nExemption (IDE) Clinical Investigations,\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocumen\n\nts/ucm279107.pdf), issued August 19, 2014 (hereinafter, FDA Decisions for IDE Guidance).\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 812.30(b), FDA may disapprove or withdraw approval of an IDE application for any of the following reasons:\n\n(1) There has been a failure to comply with any requirement of this part or the act, any other applicable regulation or statute, or any condition of approval imposed by an IRB or FDA.\n\n(2) The application or a report contains an untrue statement of a material fact, or omits material information required by this part.__(3) The sponsor fails to respond to a request for additional information within the time prescribed by FDA.\n\n(4) There is reason to believe that the risks to the subjects are not outweighed by the anticipated benefits to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained [emphasis added], or informed consent is inadequate, or the investigation is scientifically unsound, or there is reason to believe that the device as used is ineffective.\n\n(5) It is otherwise unreasonable to begin or to continue the investigation owing to the way in which the device is used or the inadequacy of:\n\n(i) The report of prior investigations or the investigational plan;\n\n(ii) The methods, facilities, and controls used for the manufacturing, processing, packaging, storage, and, where appropriate, installation of the device; or\n\n(iii) Monitoring and review of the investigation.\n\nConsistent with this regulation, FDA will generally disapprove an IDE application if potential risks of the proposed study are not justified, or if data provided are insufficient to adequately characterize the safety profile of the device such that, based on the data contained in the IDE application, human clinical investigation is not considered reasonable.\n\nThis guidance document provides greater clarity regarding regulatory assessment of:\n\nrisks and benefits associated with clinical investigational device use proposed in IDE applications;11 and\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR 812.30(b)(4).\n\ninadequacy or uncertainty regarding the clinical or nonclinical data from prior investigations, the proposed study, the manufacturing, transport and storage of a device, or monitoring oversight of the proposed study.12\n\nFootnote 12: 21 CFR 812.30(b)(5).\n\nTypes of IDE Decisions\n\nFDA regulations13 provide for three major categories of decision on an IDE application - approval, approval with conditions, and disapproval.\n\nFootnote 13: 21 CFR 812.30(a).\n\nIf FDA approves an IDE application the sponsor may begin subject enrollment upon receipt of IRB approval and in accordance with the limits described in FDA\'s decision letter, including the maximum numbers of U.S. subjects and investigational sites.

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 16: See FDA Decisions for IDE Guidance\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviccregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm279107.pdf) for more information on the topic of SDCs.\n\nIV. IDE APPLICATION ASSESSMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF A DEVICE DEVELOPMENT Pathway\n\nStages of Device Development\n\nWhen making IDE benefit-risk assessments, FDA considers: 1) the stage of development of the device, 2) the maturity of the proposed technology, and 3) the availability of non-clinical testing to complement or replace the need for clinical testing.\n\nFDA's Early Feasibility Guidance (page 6) defines the following device study types:\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFirst in Human (FIH): A first in human study is a type of study in which a device for a specific indication is evaluated for the first time in human subjects.\n\nEarly Feasibility: An early feasibility study is a limited clinical investigation of a device early in development, typically before the device design has been finalized, for a specific indication (e.g. innovative device for a new or established intended use, marketed device for a novel clinical application).\n\nTraditional Feasibility: A traditional feasibility study is a clinical investigation that is commonly used to capture preliminary safety and effectiveness information on a near-final or final device design to adequately plan an appropriate pivotal study.\n\nPivotal Study: A pivotal study is a clinical investigation designed to collect definitive evidence of the safety and effectiveness of a device for a specified intended use, typically in a statistically justified number of subjects.\n\nIn some cases, IDE studies may also be designed for investigation of marketed products. For example, an IDE study may be conducted to expand the indications for use or update the device labeling.\n\nThe approach to benefit-risk assessment in IDE applications should be tailored to the stage of device development, because device investigations during different stages of development are generally associated with different types of risk, and different levels of uncertainty. Specifically, a greater degree of uncertainty is expected for novel technologies, and at earlier stages of device development, such as first in human or early feasibility trials, while relatively more certainty is expected in traditional feasibility and pivotal trials. At earlier stages, the focus is on whether the proposed investigation has appropriate risk control measures for anticipated possible risks and unanticipated risks, whereas in later stages focus shifts increasingly to mitigating the most probable risks. Additionally, early development clinical studies are typically designed to assess initial safety and proof of concept about the proposed device use. Later stage studies, particularly those intended to support future regulatory applications, are typically designed to assess safety and effectiveness outcomes in an intended patient population, with additional information to quantify uncertainty in each of these outcomes. IDE benefit-risk assessments should take into consideration whether the level of uncertainty is appropriate to the stage of development for the investigational device. It should be noted that regardless of the stage of development, risk mitigation measures may be needed for certain serious events that have a low rate of occurrence in order to support a favorable benefit-risk assessment.\n\nFor IDE benefit-risk determinations throughout all stages of device development, it is also important to recognize that non-clinical and prior clinical data play a critical role. Medical devices often have attributes that cannot be tested by clinical methods alone and that play a major role in the performance, safety or effectiveness of the device. In some cases, non-clinical testing (e.g., in vitro tests, animal studies, and computer modeling and simulation) can obviate or reduce the need for additional clinical testing to evaluate certain aspects of device design or performance. Both clinical and non-clinical testing methods may be used to assess the likelihood/probability or severity of a given risk, and/or the success of risk control measures,including risk mitigation measures. Data from early clinical studies and/or studies conducted outside the U.S. may inform the benefit/risk assessment and the appropriate risk mitigation and control measures for future IDE studies.\n\nFor a reference guide to the information FDA considers when assessing benefit-risk in the context of a device development pathway, refer to Appendix A.\n\nApplying Benefit-Risk Framework to IDE Decision-Making\n\nA benefit-risk framework is used both for supporting IDE decision-making, as well as decisions related to marketing submissions (e.g., PMA, de novo, and for certain aspects of 510(k) substantial equivalence determinations). Importantly, however, benefit-risk decision-making is fundamentally different for IDE applications because clinical investigations, by their very definition, are research studies with inherent uncertainty regarding the relative benefits and risks of a given device, technology, or treatment.\n\nTherefore, FDA intends to permit appropriate latitude for the conduct of IDE studies within the boundaries of applicable laws and regulations. In considering whether risks outweigh the potential benefits to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained, absence of definitive evidence of benefit or the presence of purely hypothetical risks are not sufficient justification, in and of themselves, to disapprove an IDE application (see Section III.B. of this guidance).\n\nGiven the more limited level of evidence typically associated with IDE applications compared to marketing applications - especially for earlier stages of investigation - decisions about IDE applications are made in settings involving relatively greater uncertainty and a lower level of evidence. The inherent uncertainty present in clinical investigations can often be offset by appropriately tailored risk control / risk mitigation measures which can help ensure appropriate patient and research participant protections in investigational research settings (some forms of risk controls that may be applied to IDE studies are listed in Section III.A.4.). In considering benefits of investigational research, FDA considers direct benefits to the subject and benefits to others (to the extent there are indirect benefits to subjects such as knowledge to be gained from the study or information that may contribute to developing a treatment).\n\n4.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAs with the benefit-risk framework for marketing applications,17 FDA assessment of benefits and risks for an IDE application takes into account the contextual setting, including characterization of the disease or condition being treated or diagnosed; and the availability of alternative therapies, including their associated benefits and risks. When available, information characterizing subject tolerance for risk and perspective on benefit may provide useful context during this assessment.\n\nFootnote 17: See FDA Guidance. Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device\n\nPremarket Approval and De Novo Classifications (http://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm517504.pdf).\n\nV Assessing Benefits and Risks for IDE Applications\n\nThe approach outlined in this section describes FDA's key considerations when assessing benefits and risks of IDE studies. FDA recommends using a benefit-risk framework to facilitate the incorporation of evidence and knowledge from different domains--clinical, nonclinical, and patient--to support a comprehensive, balanced decision-making approach. The framework should focus on relevant facts, uncertainties, and key areas of judgment to add clarity and predictability to the regulatory process. FDA envisions that these factors will facilitate common understanding between sponsors and FDA by highlighting which factors are critical in the benefit-risk assessment for a specific application, and clearly explaining how these factors should influence FDA's decision.\n\nFDA recommends IDE sponsors provide as part of the IDE application a section that summarizes the key considerations for the IDE benefit-risk assessment For an outline of the general framework for IDE benefit-risk assessment, please refer to Appendix A. Appendix B contains generic examples of IDE benefit-risk determinations for illustrative purposes.\n\nPatient Preferences\n\nWhen applying a benefit-risk framework to decisions on IDE applications, FDA's assessment depends on the value assigned to various risks and anticipated benefits to the patients. In the context of a clinical study, anticipated benefits include not only direct benefits to the patient but also societal benefits in terms of knowledge to be gained from the study.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that individual patient preferences vary, and that a patient may not assign the same values to various risks and anticipated benefits as their physician, family member, or other individual. Furthermore, patient preferences vary, both in preferred modality of treatment/diagnostic procedure (often devices are one option to be considered in a treatment care path which may include surgery or medication), as well as in risk tolerance. Some patients are willing to take on higher risks to potentially achieve a small benefit, whereas others are more risk averse. In certain circumstances, some patients may be willing to participate in clinical studies that offer no or limited direct benefit to subjects, but have anticipated societal benefits in advancing medical science.

Under a quality system, selected data are used to evaluate the quality of a process or product. In addition, data collection can provide a means to encourage and analyze potential suggestions for improvement. A quality systems approach calls for the manufacturer to develop procedures that monitor, measure, and analyze the operations (including analytical methods and/or statistical techniques). Monitoring of the process is important due to the limitations of testing. Knowledge continues to accumulate from development through the entire commercial life of a product. Significant unanticipated variables should be detected by a well-managed quality system and adjustments implemented. Procedures should be revisited as needed to refine operational design based on new knowledge. Process understanding increases with experience and helps identify when change will lead to continual improvement. When implementing data collection procedures, consider the following:\n\nAre data collection methods documented?\n\nWhen in the product life cycle will the data be collected?\n\nHow and to whom will measurement and monitoring activities be assigned?\n\nWhen should analysis and evaluation (e.g. trending) of laboratory data be performed? (see IV.D.1)What records should be collected?\n\nA modern quality system approach indicates that change control is warranted when data analysis or other information reveals an area for improvement. Changes to an established process must be controlled and documented to ensure that desired attributes for the finished product will be met (SS 211.100(a)).\n\nChange control with regard to pharmaceuticals is addressed in more detail in the CGMP regulations. When developing a process change, it is important to keep the process design and scientific knowledge of the product in mind. If major design issues are encountered through process experience, a firm may want to revisit the adequacy of the design of the manufacturing facility (SS 211.42), the design of the manufacturing equipment (SS 211.63), the design of the production and control procedures (SS 211.100), or the design of laboratory controls (SS 211.160). When implementing a change, its effect should be determined by monitoring and evaluating those specific elements that may be affected based on an understanding of the process. This approach allows the steps taken to implement a change and the effects of the change on the process to be considered systematically. Application of risk analysis may facilitate evaluating the potential effect of the change. Evaluating the effects of a change can entail additional tests or examinations of subsequent batches (e.g., additional in-process testing or additional stability studies). The quality system elements identified in this guidance, if implemented and maintained, will help a manufacturer manage change and implement continual improvement in manufacturing.\n\nUnder a quality systems approach, procedures should be in place to ensure the accuracy of test results. Test results that are out of specification may be due to testing problems or manufacturing problems and should be investigated. Any invalidation of a test result should be scientifically sound and justified.\n\nTo maintain quality, the Agency recommends that prior to completion of manufacturing, the manufacturer should consider storage and shipment requirements to meet special handling needs (in the case of pharmaceuticals, one example might be refrigeration).\n\nUnder a quality system, trends should be continually identified and evaluated. One way of accomplishing this is the use of statistical process control. The information from trend analyses can be used to continually monitor quality, identify potential variances before they become problems, bolster data already collected for the annual review, and facilitate improvement throughout the product life cycle. Process capability assessment can serve as a basis for determining the need for changes that can result in process improvements and efficiency (see IV.D.1.).\n\niv.3.4 Address Nonconformities\n\nA key component in any quality system is handling nonconformities and/or deviations. The investigation, conclusion, and follow-up must be documented (SS 211.192). To ensure that a product conforms to requirements and expectations, it is important to measure the process and the product attributes (e.g., specified control parameters, strength) as planned. Discrepancies may be detected during any stage of the process or during quality control activities. Not all discrepancies will result in product defects; however, it is important to document and handle discrepancies appropriately. A discrepancy investigation process is critical when a discrepancy is found that affects product quality (CGMP also requires this; see SS 211.192).\n\nIn a quality system, it is important to develop and document procedures that define who is responsible for halting and resuming operations, recording non-conformities, investigating discrepancies, and taking remedial action. Under a quality system, if a product or process does not meet requirements, it is essential to identify and/or segregate the product so that it is not distributed to the customer. Remedial action can include any of the following:\n\nCorrect the non-conformity\n\nWith proper authorization, allow the product to proceed with justification of the conclusions regarding the problem's impact\n\nUse the product for another application where the deficiency does not affect the products' quality\n\nReject the product\n\nThe corrected product or process should also be re-examined for conformance and assessed for the significance of the non-conformity (see, e.g., SS 211.115). If the non-conformity is significant, based on consequences to process control, process efficiency, product quality, safety, efficacy, and product availability, it is important to evaluate how to prevent recurrence (see IV.D.4.). If an individual product that does not meet requirements has been released, the product can be recalled.18 Customer complaints must be reviewed and then investigated if a discrepancy is identified (SS 211.198).\n\nFootnote 18: See 21 CFR Part 7.\n\nThe following table shows how the CGMP regulations correlate to specific elements in the quality systems model. Manufacturers should always refer to the specific regulations to ensure that they are comp\n\nAppendix D Evaluation Activities\n\nAs in the previous section, the elements of a quality system correlate closely with the requirements in the CGMP regulations. See the table at the end of the section for the specifics.\n\nd.0.1 Analyze Data for Trends\n\nQuality systems call for continually monitoring trends and improving systems. This can be achieved by monitoring data and information, identifying and resolving problems, and anticipating and preventing problems.\n\nQuality systems procedures involve collecting data from monitoring, measurement, complaint handling, or other activities, and tracking this data over time, as appropriate. Analysis of data can provide indications that controls are losing effectiveness. The information generated will be essential to achieving problem resolution or problem prevention (see IV.D.3.).\n\nAlthough the CGMP regulations (SS 211.180(e)) require product review on at least an annual basis, a quality systems approach calls for trending on a more frequent basis as determined by risk. Trending enables the detection of potential problems as early as possible to plan corrective and preventive actions. Another important concept of modern quality systems is the use of trending to examine processes as a whole; this is consistent with the annual review approach. Trending analyses can help focus internal audits (see IV.D.2.).\n\nd.0.2 Conduct Internal Audits\n\nA quality systems approach calls for audits to be conducted at planned intervals to evaluate effective implementation and maintenance of the quality system and to determine if processes and products meet established parameters and specifications. As with other procedures, auditprocedures should be developed and documented to ensure that the planned audit schedule takes into account the relative risks of the various quality system activities, the results of previous audits and corrective actions, and the need to audit the complete system. Procedures should describe how auditors are trained in objective evidence gathering, their responsibilities, and auditing procedures. Procedures should also define auditing activities such as the scope and methodology of the audit, selection of auditors, and audit conduct (audit plans, opening meetings, interviews, closing meeting and reports). It is critical to maintain records of audit findings and assign responsibility for follow-up to prevent problems from recurring (see IV.D.3.).\n\nThe quality systems model calls for managers who are responsible for the areas audited to take timely action to resolve audit findings and ensure that follow-up actions are completed, verified, and recorded. (FDA's policy is to refrain from both reviewing and copying reports or records that result from internal audits per Compliance Policy Guide 130.300.19)\n\nFootnote 19: See Reference #8.\n\niv.3.3 Quality Risk Management\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: It is important that the CGMP regulations are harmonized to the extent possible with other widely used quality management systems, including ISO 9000, non-U.S. pharmaceutical quality management requirements, and FDA's own medical device quality system regulations. This guidance serves as a first step to highlight common elements between the CGMP regulations and Quality Management Systems. With the globalization of pharmaceutical manufacturing and the increasing prevalence of drug- and biologic-device combination products, the convergence of quality management principles across different regions and among various product types is very desirable.\n\nThe FDA has concluded that modern quality systems, when coupled with manufacturing process and product knowledge and the use of effective risk management practices, can handle many types of changes to facilities, equipment, and processes without the need for prior approval regulatory submissions. Manufacturers with a robust quality system and appropriate process knowledge can implement many types of improvements. In addition, an effective quality system, by lowering the risk of manufacturing problems, may result in shorter and fewer FDA inspections.\n\nA quality system can provide the necessary framework for implementing quality by design4 (building in quality from the development phase and throughout a product's life cycle), continual improvement, and risk management in the drug manufacturing process. A quality system adopted by a manufacturer can be tailored to fit the specific environment, taking into account factors such as scope of operations, complexity of processes, and appropriate use of finite resources. Footnote 4: See ICH Q8 Pharmaceutical Development.\n\nScope of the Guidance\n\nThis guidance applies to manufacturers of drug products (finished pharmaceuticals), including products regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). It may also be useful to manufacturers of components (including active pharmaceutical ingredients) used in the manufacture of these products.\n\nThis document is not intended to create new requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturing that go beyond those established in the current regulations, nor is the guidance intended to be a guide for the conduct of FDA inspections. Rather, the document explains how implementing comprehensive quality systems can help manufacturers achieve compliance with 21 CFR parts210 and 211. Although the QS working group found that many of the quality system elements correlate with specific CGMP requirements, some do not. The Agency expects compliance with CGMP regulations, and FDA's inspection program will remain focused on compliance with those regulations.\n\nOrganization of this Guidance\n\nTo provide a reference familiar to industry, the quality systems model described in section IV of this guidance is organized -- in its major sections -- according to the structure of international quality standards. Major sections of the model include the following:\n\nManagement Responsibilities\n\nResources\n\nManufacturing Operations\n\nEvaluation Activities\n\nUnder each of these sections the key elements found in modern quality systems are discussed. When an element correlates with a CGMP regulatory requirement, that correlation is noted. In some cases, a specific CGMP regulation is discussed in more detail as it relates to a quality system element. At the end of each section, a table is included listing the quality system elements of that section and the specific CGMP regulations with which they correlate. A glossary is included at the end of the document.\n\nIII CGMPS and the Concepts of Modern Quality Systems\n\nSeveral key concepts are critical for any discussion of modern quality systems. The following concepts are used throughout this guidance as they relate to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.\n\nQuality\n\nEvery pharmaceutical product has established identity, strength, purity, and other quality characteristics designed to ensure the required levels of safety and effectiveness. For the purposes of this guidance document, the phrase achieving quality means achieving these characteristics for a product.\n\nQuality by Design and Product Development\n\nQuality by design means designing and developing a product and associated manufacturing processes that will be used during product development to ensure that the product consistently attains a predefined quality at the end of the manufacturing process.5 Quality by design, in conjunction with a quality system, provides a sound framework for the transfer of product knowledge and process understanding from drug development to the commercial manufacturing processes and for post-development changes and optimization. The CGMP regulations, when viewed in their entirety, incorporate the concept of quality by design. This guidance describes how these elements fit together.\n\nAppendix C Quality Risk Management\n\nQuality risk management is a valuable component of an effective quality systems framework.6 Quality risk management can, for example, help guide the setting of specifications and process parameters for drug manufacturing, assess and mitigate the risk of changing a process or specification, and determine the extent of discrepancy investigations and corrective actions.\n\nFootnote 6: See ICH Q9 Quality Risk Management.\n\nCAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action)\n\nCAPA is a well-known CGMP regulatory concept that focuses on investigating, understanding, and correcting discrepancies while attempting to prevent their recurrence. Quality system models discuss CAPA as three separate concepts, all of which are used in this guidance.\n\nRemedial corrections of an identified problem\n\nRoot cause analysis with corrective action to help understand the cause of the deviation and potentially prevent recurrence of a similar problem\n\nPreventive action to avert recurrence of a similar potential problem\n\nChange Control\n\nChange control is another well-known CGMP concept that focuses on managing change to prevent unintended consequences. The CGMP regulations provide for change control primarily through the assigned responsibilities of the quality control unit. Certain major manufacturing changes (e.g., changes that alter specifications, a critical product attribute or bioavailability) require regulatory filings and prior regulatory approval (21 CFR 314.70, 514.8, and 601.12).\n\nEffective change control activities (e.g., quality planning and control of revisions to specifications, process parameters, procedures) are key components of any quality system. In this guidance, change is discussed in terms of creating a regulatory environment that encourages change towards continual improvement. This means a manufacturer is empowered to make changes subject to the regulations based on the variability of materials used in manufacturing and process improvements resulting from knowledge gained during a product's lifecycle.\n\nAppendix F The Quality Unit\n\nMany of the modern quality system concepts described here correlate very closely with the CGMP regulations (refer to the charts later in the document). Current industry practice generally divides the responsibilities of the quality control unit (QCU), as defined in the CGMP regulations, between quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) functions.\n\nQC usually involves (1) assessing the suitability of incoming components, containers, closures, labeling, in-process materials, and the finished products; (2) evaluating the performance of the manufacturing process to ensure adherence to proper specifications and limits; and (3) determining the acceptability of each batch for release.\n\nQA primarily involves (1) review and approval of all procedures related to production and maintenance, (2) review of associated records, and (3) auditing and performing/evaluating trend analyses.\n\nThis guidance uses the term quality unit7 (QU) to reflect modern practice while remaining consistent with the CGMP definition in SS 210.3(b)(15). The concept of a quality unit is also consistent with modern quality systems in ensuring that the various operations associated with all systems are appropriately planned, approved, conducted, and monitored.\n\nFootnote 7: Generally, the term quality unit is used in this guidance. However, quality control unit is used when directly quoting parts 210 and 211.\n\nThe CGMP regulations specifically assign the QU the authority to create, monitor, and implement a quality system. Such activities do not substitute for, or preclude, the daily responsibility of manufacturing personnel to build quality into the product. The QU should not take on the responsibilities of other units of a manufacturer's organization, such as the responsibilities handled by manufacturing personnel, engineers, and development scientists.8 Manufacturing personnel and the QU are both critical in fulfilling the manufacturer's responsibility to produce quality products.\n\nFootnote 8: See Reference #1, comment 91.\n\nOther CGMP assigned responsibilities of the QU are consistent with modern quality system approaches (SS 211.22):\n\nEnsuring that controls are implemented and completed satisfactorily during manufacturing operations\n\nEnsuring that developed procedures and specifications are appropriate and followed, including those used by a firm under contract to the manufacturer\n\nApproving or rejecting incoming materials, in-process materials, and drug products\n\nReviewing production records and investigating any unexplained discrepancies\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 9: For purposes of this guidance, the term quality unit is synonymous with the term quality control unit. For the definition of quality control unit, see § 210.3(b)(15).\n\n3 Does each CGMP workflow on a computer system need to be validated?\n\nYes, a CGMP workflow, such as creation of an electronic master production and control record (MPCR), is an intended use of a computer system to be checked through validation (see SSSS 211.63, 211.68(b), and 211.110(a)). The extent of validation studies should be commensurate with the risk posed by the automated system. When the same system is used to perform both CGMP and non-CGMP functions, the potential for non-CGMP functions to affect CGMP operations should be assessed and mitigated appropriately.10\n\nFootnote 10: See note 8.\n\nIf you validate the computer system but you do not validate it for its intended use, you cannot know if your workflow runs correctly.11 For example, qualifying the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) platform, a computer system, ensures that it meets its relevant requirements and specifications; however, it does not demonstrate that a given MPCR generated by the MES contains the correct calculations. In this example, validating the workflow ensures that the intended steps, requirements, and calculations in the MPCR are accurate and perform properly. This is similar to reviewing a paper MPCR and ensuring all supporting procedures are in place before the MPCR is implemented in production (see SSSS 211.100, 211.186, and 212.50(b) and the guidance for industry PET Drugs--Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP)).\n\nFDA recommends you implement appropriate controls to manage risks associated with each element of the system. Controls that are appropriately designed to validate a system for its intended use address software, hardware, personnel, and documentation.\n\n4 How should access to CGMP computer systems be restricted?\n\nYou must exercise appropriate controls to assure that changes to computerized MPCRs or other CGMP records or input of laboratory data into computerized records can be made only by authorized personnel (SS 211.68(b)). Other examples of records for which control should be restricted to authorized personnel include automated visual inspection records, electronic materials management system records, and automated dispensing system weighing records. FDA recommends that you restrict the ability to alter specifications, process parameters, data, or manufacturing or testing methods by technical means where possible (e.g., by limiting permissions to change settings or data).\n\nThe system administrator role, including any rights to alter files and settings, should be assigned to personnel independent from those responsible for the record content. To assist in controlling access, it is important that manufacturers establish and implement a method for documenting authorized personnel's access privileges for each CGMP computer system in use (e.g., by maintaining a list of authorized individuals) (see SS 211.68(b)).\n\n5 Why is FDA concerned with the use of shared login accounts for computer systems?\n\nWhen login credentials are shared, a unique individual cannot be identified through the login and the system would not conform to the CGMP requirements in parts 211 and 212. FDA requires that system controls, including documentation controls, be designed in accordance with CGMP to assure product quality (e.g., SSS 211.100 and 212.50). For example, you must implement documentation controls that ensure that the actions as described in question 4 are attributable to a specific individual (see SSS 211.68(b), 211.188(b)(11), 211.194(a)(7) and (8), and 212.50(c)(10)).\n\nShared, read-only user accounts that do not allow the user to modify data or settings are acceptable for viewing data, but they do not conform with the part 211 and 212 requirements for actions, such as second person review, to be attributable to a specific individual.\n\n6 How should blank forms be controlled?\n\nThere must be document controls in place to assure product quality (see SSS 211.100, 211.160(a), 211.186, 212.20(d), and 212.60(g)). For example, bound paginated notebooks, stamped for official use by a document control group, provide good document control because they allow easy detection of unofficial notebooks as well as any gaps in notebook pages. If used, blank forms (e.g., electronic worksheets, laboratory notebooks, and MPCRs) should be controlled by the quality unit or by another document control method. As appropriate, numbered sets of blank forms may be issued and should be reconciled upon completion of all issued forms. Incomplete or erroneous forms should be kept as part of the permanent record along with written justification for their replacement (see, e.g., SSS 211.192, 211.194, 212.50(a), and 212.70(f)(1)(vi)). All data required to recreate a CGMP activity should be maintained as part of the complete record.\n\n7 Who should review audit trails?\n\nAudit trail review is similar to assessing cross-outs on paper when reviewing data. Personnel responsible for record review under CGMP should review the audit trails that capture changes to data associated with the record as they review the rest of the record (e.g., SS SS 211.22(a), 211.101(c) and (d), 211.103, 211.182, 211.186(a), 211.192, 211.194(a)(8), and 212.20(d)). For example, all production and control records, which includes audit trails, must be reviewed and approved by the quality unit (SS 211.192). The regulations provide flexibility to have some activities reviewed by a person directly supervising or checking information (e.g., SS 211.188). FDA recommends a quality system approach to implementing oversight and review of CGMP records.12\n\nFootnote 12: See guidance for industry Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical CGMP Regulations. See also guidance for industry Contract Manufacturing Arrangements for Drugs: Quality Agreements for information about auditing as it relates to contract facilities.\n\n8 How often should audit trails be reviewed?\n\nIf the review frequency for the data is specified in CGMP regulations, adhere to that frequency for the audit trail review. For example, SS 211.188(b) requires review after each significant step in manufacture, processing, packing, or holding, and SS 211.22 requires data review before batch release. In these cases, you would apply the same review frequency for the audit trail.\n\nIf the review frequency for the data is not specified in CGMP regulations, you should determine the review frequency for the audit trail using knowledge of your processes and risk assessment tools. The risk assessment should include evaluation of data criticality, control mechanisms, and impact on product quality.13\n\nFootnote 13: Risks to data include, but are not limited to, the potential to be deleted, amended, or excluded without authorization or without detection. Examples of audit trails that may be appropriate to review on a risk-based frequency include audit trails that capture instrument operational status, instrument communication logs, and alert records.\n\nYour approach to audit trail review and the frequency with which you conduct it should ensure that CGMP requirements are met, appropriate controls are implemented, and the reliability of the review is proven.\n\nSee the audit trail definition in 1.c. above for further information on audit trails.\n\n9 Can electronic copies be used as accurate reproductions of paper or electronic records?\n\nYes. Electronic copies can be used as true copies of paper or electronic records, provided the copies preserve the content and meaning of the original record, which includes all metadatarequired to reconstruct the CGMP activity and the static or dynamic nature of the original records.\n\nTrue copies of dynamic electronic records may be made and maintained in the format of the original records or in a format that allows for the content and meaning of the original records to be preserved if a suitable reader and copying equipment (e.g., software and hardware, including media readers) are readily available (SSSS 211.180(d) and 212.110).\n\nIs it acceptable to retain paper printouts or static records instead of original electronic records from stand-alone computerized laboratory instruments, such as an FT-IR instrument?\n\nA paper printout or static record may satisfy retention requirements if it is the original record or a true copy of the original record (see SSSS 211.68(b), 211.188, 211.194, and 212.60). During data acquisition, for example, pH meters and balances may create a paper printout or static record as the original record. In this case, the paper printout or static record, or a true copy, must be retained (SS 211.180).\n\nHowever, electronic records from certain types of laboratory instruments--whether stand-alone or networked--are dynamic, and a printout or a static record does not preserve the dynamic record format that is part of the complete original record. For example, the spectral file created by FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) is dynamic and can be reprocessed.\n\nHowever, a static record or printout is fixed and would not satisfy CGMP requirements to retain original records or true copies (SS 211.180(d)). Also, if the full spectrum is not displayed in the printout, contaminants may be excluded.\n\nYou must ensure that original laboratory records, including paper and electronic records, are subject to second-person review (SS 211.194(a)(8)) to make certain that all test results and associated information are appropriately reported. Similarly, in microbiology, a contemporaneous written record is maintained of the colony counts of a petri dish, and the record is then subject to second-person review.\n\nDocument control requirements in SS 211.180 pertain only to CGMP records.\n--------------------\nContext title: Data Integrity and Compliance With Drug CGMP- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.1.3 Commercial Manufacturing\n\nThe goals of manufacturing activities include achieving product realisation, establishing and maintaining a state of control and facilitating continual improvement. The pharmaceutical quality system should assure that the desired product quality is routinely met, suitable process performance is achieved, the set of controls are appropriate, improvement opportunities are identified and evaluated, and the body of knowledge is continually expanded.\n\n3.1.4 Product Discontinuation\n\nThe goal of product discontinuation activities is to manage the terminal stage of the product lifecycle effectively. For product discontinuation, a pre-defined approach should be used to manage activities such as retention of documentation and samples and continued product assessment (e.g., complaint handling and stability) and reporting in accordance with regulatory requirements.\n\nPharmaceutical Quality System Elements\n\nThe elements described below might be, required in part under regional GMP regulations. However, the Q10 model's intent is to enhance these elements in order to promote the lifecycle approach to product quality. These four elements are:\n\nProcess performance and product quality monitoring system;\n\nCorrective action and preventive action (CAPA) system;\n\nChange management system;Management review of process performance and product quality.\n\nThese elements should be applied in a manner that is appropriate and proportionate to each of the product lifecycle stages, recognising the differences among, and the different goals of, each stage. Throughout the product lifecycle, companies are encouraged to evaluate opportunities for innovative approaches to improve product quality.\n\nEach element is followed by a table of example applications of the element to the stages of the pharmaceutical lifecycle.\n\n3.2.1 Process Performance and Product Quality Monitoring System\n\nPharmaceutical companies should plan and execute a system for the monitoring of process performance and product quality to ensure a state of control is maintained. An effective monitoring system provides assurance of the continued capability of processes and controls to produce a product of desired quality and to identify areas for continual improvement. The process performance and product quality monitoring system should:\n\nUse quality risk management to establish the control strategy. This can include parameters and attributes related to drug substance and drug product materials and components, facility and equipment operating conditions, in-process controls, finished product specifications, and the associated methods and frequency of monitoring and control. The control strategy should facilitate timely feedback / feedforward and appropriate corrective action and preventive action;\n\nProvide the tools for measurement and analysis of parameters and attributes identified in the control strategy (e.g., data management and statistical tools);\n--------------------\nContext title: Q10 Guideline""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: Under a quality system, continued training is critical to ensure that the employees remain proficient in their operational functions and in their understanding of CGMP regulations. Typical quality systems training should address the policies, processes, procedures, and written instructions related to operational activities, the product/service, the quality system, and the desired work culture (e.g., team building, communication, change, behavior). Under a quality system (and the CGMP regulations), training should focus on both the employees' specific job functions and the related CGMP regulatory requirements.\n\nUnder a quality system, managers are expected to establish training programs that include the following:\n\nEvaluation of training needs\n\nProvision of training to satisfy these needs\n\nEvaluation of effectiveness of training\n\nDocumentation of training and/or re-training\n\nWhen operating in a robust quality system environment, it is important that managers verify that skills gained from training are implemented in day-to-day performance.\n\niv.1.3 Facilities and Equipment\n\nUnder a quality system, the technical experts (e.g., engineers, development scientists), who have an understanding of pharmaceutical science, risk factors, and manufacturing processes related to the product, are responsible for defining specific facility and equipment requirements.\n\nUnder the CGMP regulations, the quality unit (QU) has the responsibility of reviewing and approving all initial design criteria and procedures pertaining to facilities and equipment and any subsequent changes (SS 211.22(c)).\n\nUnder the CGMP regulations, equipment must be qualified, calibrated, cleaned, and maintained to prevent contamination and mix-ups (SSSS 211.63, 211.67, 211.68). Note that the CGMP regulations require a higher standard for calibration and maintenance than most non-pharmaceutical quality system models. The CGMP regulations place as much emphasis on process equipment as on testing equipment (SSSS 211.160, 211.63, 211.67, and 211.68) while most quality systems focus only on testing equipment.11\n\nFootnote 11: See Reference # 4.\n\nii.2.4 Control Outsourced Operations\n\nOutsourcing involves hiring a second party under a contract to perform the operational processes that are part of a manufacturer's inherent responsibilities. For example, a manufacturer may hire another firm to package and label or perform CGMP regulatory training. Quality systems call for contracts (quality agreements) that clearly describe the materials or service, quality specification responsibilities, and communication mechanisms.\n\nUnder a quality system, the manufacturer should ensure that a contract firm is qualified before signing a contract with that firm. The contract firm's personnel should be adequately trained and monitored for performance according to their quality system, and the contract firm's and contracting manufacturer's quality standards should not conflict. It is critical in a quality system to ensure that the management of the contractor be familiar with the specific requirements of the contract. However, under the CGMP requirements, the manufacturer's QU is responsible for approving or rejecting products or services provided under a contract (SS 211.22(a)).\n\nAs the following table illustrates, the CGMP regulations are consistent with the elements of a quality system in many areas in this section. However, manufacturers should always refer to the specific regulations to ensure that they are complying with all regulations.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\n21 CER CGMP Regulations Related to Resources \\ \\hline \\hline \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{1.

It is important to emphasize again that FDA's enforcement programs and inspectional coverage remain based on the CGMP regulations. When quality system elements in this section do not correlate to the CGMP regulations, the guidance makes recommendations to help facilitate compliance with the CGMP regulations. The language in this section has been tailored to the pharmaceutical manufacturing environment.\n\n3.3.1 Design, Develop, and Document Product and Processes\n\nIn a modern quality systems manufacturing environment, the significant characteristics of the product being manufactured should be defined from design to delivery, and control should be exercised over all changes. In addition, quality and manufacturing processes and procedures -- and changes to them -- must be defined, approved, and controlled (SS 211.100). It is important to establish responsibility for designing or changing products. Documenting processes, associated controls, and changes to these processes will help ensure that sources of variability are identified.\n\nDocumentation includes:\n\nResources and facilities used\n\nProcedures to carry out the process\n\nIdentification of the process owner who will maintain and update the process as needed\n\nIdentification and control of important variables\n\nQuality control measures, necessary data collection, monitoring, and appropriate controls for the product and process\n\nAny validation activities, including operating ranges and acceptance criteria\n\nEffects on related process, functions, or personnel\n\nAs discussed under section IV.A., above, the model calls for managers to ensure that product specifications and process parameters are determined by the appropriate technical experts (e.g., engineers, development scientists). In the pharmaceutical environment, experts would have an understanding of pharmaceutical science, equipment, facilities, and process types and of how variations in materials and processes can ultimately affect the finished product.\n\nPackaging and labeling controls, critical stages in the pharmaceutical manufacturing process, are not specifically addressed in quality systems models. However, the Agency recommends that manufacturers always refer to the packaging and labeling control regulations at SS 211 Subpart G. In addition -- and this is consistent with modern quality systems -- FDA recommends that, aspart of the design process, before commercial production, the controls for all processes within the packaging and labeling system be planned and documented in written procedures. The procedures should outline quality control activities and the responsible positions. Specifications and controls for the packaging and labeling materials should also be determined before commercial production. Distinct labels with discriminating features for different products, such as a product marketed with different strengths, should be included to prevent mislabeling and resulting recalls.\n\n2.2.2 Examine Inputs\n\nIn a modern quality systems model, the term input includes any material that goes into a final product, no matter whether the material is purchased by the manufacturer or produced by the manufacturer for the purpose of processing. Materials can include items such as components (e.g., ingredients, process water, and gas), containers, and closures. A robust quality system will ensure that all inputs to the manufacturing process are reliable because quality controls will have been established for the receipt, production, storage, and use of all inputs.\n\nThe CGMP regulations require either testing or use of a certificate of analysis (COA) plus an identity analysis (SS 211.84) for the release of materials for manufacturing. In the preamble to the CGMP regulations, these requirements were explicitly interpreted.12 The preamble states that reliability can be validated by conducting tests or examinations and comparing the results to the supplier's COA. Sufficient initial tests should be done to establish reliability and to determine a schedule for periodic reassessment. As an essential element of purchasing controls, it is recommended that data trends for acceptance and rejection of materials be analyzed for information on supplier performance.13\n\nFootnote 12: See Reference #1, comment 239.\n\nFootnote 13: The Agency recommends that manufacturers have a measure of the variability of materials that could affect their process controls. For example, certain changes in physical properties may affect the process, which may affect a finished product’s dissolution characteristics.\n\nThe quality systems approach also calls for periodic auditing of suppliers based on risk assessment. During the audit, a manufacturer can observe the testing or examinations conducted by the supplier to help determine the reliability of the supplier's COA. An audit should also include a systematic examination of the supplier's quality system to ensure that reliability is maintained. It is recommended that a combination approach be used (i.e., verify the suppliers' COA through analysis and audits of the supplier). Under a quality systems approach, if full analytical testing is not done, the audit should cover the supplier's analysis (i.e., a specific identity test is still required under SS 211.84(d)(2)).\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations""

You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\n1 Introduction and Scope\n\nFDA seeks to encourage medical device research and innovation to address important clinical needs and improve patient care. In many cases, device development and evaluation include clinical investigation. This guidance document has been developed to facilitate the initiation of clinical investigations to evaluate medical devices under FDA's Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) regulations, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 812.\n\nFDA approval of an IDE submission allows the initiation of subject enrollment in a clinical investigation of a significant risk1 device. This guidance is intended to provide clarification regarding the regulatory implications of the decisions that FDA may render based on review of an IDE as well as a general explanation of the reasons for those decisions.\n\nFootnote 1: 21 CFR 812.3(m): A significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\n(1) Is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\n(2) Is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\n(3) Is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\n(4) Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n\nand communication of outstanding issues related to the IDE through Study Design Considerations and Future Considerations, are described in this guidance.2\n\nFDA's decision-making for IDEs was modified with passage of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) (Pub. L. No. 112-144). Section 601 of FDASIA amended Section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to specify certain situations in which FDA cannot disapprove an IDE. Section 520(g)(4)(C) of the FD&C Act states that, consistent with section 520(g)(1), FDA shall not disapprove an IDE because:\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance does not offer specific information related to the design of a clinical investigation, nor does this guidance discuss the specific content that should be provided in an IDE application. For additional information on those topics, please refer to FDA’s regulations (21 CFR Part 812) and to FDA’s “Guidance on IDE Policies and Procedures”\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm080202.htm).\n\n(i): the investigation may not support a substantial equivalence or de novo classification determination or approval of the device; (ii): the investigation may not meet a requirement, including a data requirement, relating to the approval or clearance of a device; or (iii): an additional or different investigation may be necessary to support clearance or approval of the device.\n\nHowever, the Agency recognizes that some IDE sponsors may wish to ensure that the pivotal study design may support a marketing application if it is successfully executed, meets its stated endpoints, and does not raise unforeseen safety concerns. Through mechanisms such as the Pre-Submission3 process, FDA wishes to work interactively with sponsors interested in addressing important limitations with such a study that might impair its ability to support a future marketing application.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nFootnote 3: For more information, see FDA’s Guidance “Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff - Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.”\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM311176.pdf\n\n2 IDE Decisions\n\nFDA's regulations4 provide for three FDA actions on IDE applications:\n\nFootnote 4: 21 CFR 812.30.\n\nApproval5* Approval with Conditions6\n\nDisapproval\n\nFDA must inform the sponsor7 or sponsor-investigator8 of its decision, or must notify the sponsor that the investigation may not begin, within 30 days from the date of receipt of the IDE application, or the IDE application will be deemed approved. If an IDE application is approved or approved with conditions, the sponsor may begin subject enrollment, up to the number of subjects and investigational sites specified in FDA's decision letter, upon receipt of Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, which may occur prior to FDA approval.\n\nFootnote 6: As discussed in Section 5, enrollment for an IDE application that is Approved or Approved with Conditions may in some cases be limited to a portion of the total expected enrollment (i.e., “Staged Approval”) while certain outstanding questions are answered concurrently with enrollment in the clinical investigation.\n\nFootnote 7: FDA has traditionally referred to IDE approvals that have conditions as “Conditional Approvals.” FDA believes that the term “Approval with Conditions” is more appropriate because the term conveys that the IDE has been approved and may begin without awaiting further FDA review.\n\nFootnote 8: 21 CFR 812.3(n): Sponsor means a person who initiates, but who does not actually conduct, the investigation, that is, the investigational device is administered, dispensed, or used under the immediate direction of another individual. A person other than an individual that uses one or more of its own employees to conduct an investigation that it has initiated is a sponsor, not a sponsor-investigator, and the employees are investigators.\n\nFootnote 9: The term “approval” in this document and in FDA’s communications means approval without conditions.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff""

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA is committed to improving U.S. patient access to new devices by strengthening and streamlining the clinical trial enterprise so that medical device clinical trials are conducted in the U.S. in an efficient and cost-effective manner, while maintaining appropriate patient and research participant protections.\n\nThe purpose of this guidance is to provide greater clarity for FDA staff and investigational device exemption (IDE) sponsors and sponsor-investigators1 regarding the principal factors that FDA considers when assessing the benefits and risks of IDE applications for human clinical studies.\n\nConsistent with applicable laws and regulations, FDA may disapprove an IDE application if, among other reasons, ""[t]here is reason to believe that the risks to the subjects are not outweighed by the anticipated benefits to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained.""2 In many cases, the Agency believes that effective risk management, including the application of risk controls, which includes risk mitigation measures, can result in a favorable IDE benefit-risk determination.\n\nFDA recognizes that in assessing risks and anticipated benefits, the medical device total product lifecycle should be considered, and that earlier stages of device development and investigational clinical study are typically associated with greater uncertainty (i.e., a lower level of evidence). A primary goal of this guidance is to clarify the factors that FDA considers when assessing risks and anticipated benefits as significant contributors to the decision to approve IDE studies, and how uncertainty may be offset by a variety of risk mitigation measures which can ensure appropriate patient and research participant protections in investigational research settings. For proposed IDE studies, at earlier stages of device development, FDA considers appropriate mitigation measures for anticipated possible risks and unanticipated risks, whereas in later stages, FDA considers whether risk mitigation measures focus on the most probable risks.\n\nFootnote 2: 21 CFR 812.30(b)(4).\n\nAnother important goal of this guidance is to characterize benefits in the context of investigational research, which includes direct benefits to the subject and benefits to others (to the extent there are indirect benefits to subjects such as knowledge to be gained from the study or information that may contribute to developing a treatment).\n\nAs with the benefit-risk framework for evaluating marketing applications, FDA assessment of benefits and risks for an IDE application takes into account the contextual setting in which the study is being proposed, including but not limited to characterization of the disease or condition being treated or diagnosed, the availability of and risks associated with alternative treatments or diagnostics. When available, information characterizing subject tolerance for risk and their perspective on benefit may provide useful context during this assessment. See for more information FDA Guidance, Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications (http://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm517504.pdf).\n\nFDA believes use of this benefit-risk framework will facilitate the incorporation of evidence and knowledge from different domains--clinical, nonclinical, and patient--to support a comprehensive, balanced decision-making approach. FDA envisions this will facilitate a common understanding between FDA and sponsors/sponsor-investigators by highlighting which factors are critical in the benefit-risk assessment for a specific application, and clearly explaining how these factors influence FDA\'s decisions. This guidance document will also help improve the predictability, consistency, and transparency of the review process for IDE applications.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this one, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Scope\n\nThis guidance document explains the principal factors that FDA considers when assessing benefits and risks of original IDE applications, IDE amendments and IDE supplements for human clinical investigations of certain medical devices to determine safety and effectiveness. The approach discussed in this guidance is applicable to studies subject to the IDE requirements in 21 CFR part 812, including postmarket studies. In general, IDE applications are required for clinical investigations of significant risk devices to determine safety and effectiveness.3 This guidance applies to both diagnostic and therapeutic devices. This guidance is not intended to provide recommendations regarding device-specific data or study requirements.\n\nFootnote 3: 21 CFR 812.2 and 20.\n\n3 Informed Consent and IDE Decisions\n\nThe purpose of the IDE regulations, as set forth in Title 21 CFR part 812, is to encourage, to the extent consistent with the protection of public health and safety and with ethical standards, the discovery and development of useful devices intended for human use, and to maintain optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of this purpose.4 Title 21 CFR part 812 applies to all clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness with some exceptions, as described in 21 CFR 812.2(c).\n\nFootnote 4: 21 CFR 812.1.\n\nFDA approval of an IDE application prior to study initiation is typically required for a clinical investigation conducted in the U.S. of a significant risk device that is not approved or cleared for the indication being studied.5 As defined in 21 CFR 812.3(m), a significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nFootnote 5: See section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 812.2(b) for conditions under which an IDE application is required prior to study initiation.\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations for Medical Device Investigational Device Exemptions Guidance for Investigational Device Exemption Sponsors, Sponsor-Investigators and Food and Drug Administration Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 3: 21 CFR 812.2 and 20.\n\n3 Informed Consent and IDE Decisions\n\nThe purpose of the IDE regulations, as set forth in Title 21 CFR part 812, is to encourage, to the extent consistent with the protection of public health and safety and with ethical standards, the discovery and development of useful devices intended for human use, and to maintain optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of this purpose.4 Title 21 CFR part 812 applies to all clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness with some exceptions, as described in 21 CFR 812.2(c).\n\nFootnote 4: 21 CFR 812.1.\n\nFDA approval of an IDE application prior to study initiation is typically required for a clinical investigation conducted in the U.S. of a significant risk device that is not approved or cleared for the indication being studied.5 As defined in 21 CFR 812.3(m), a significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nFootnote 5: See section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 812.2(b) for conditions under which an IDE application is required prior to study initiation.\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAn approved IDE application exempts the study spons from certain provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (such as certain requirements for a marketing submission and good manufacturing practice). However, IDE studies must comply with the applicable requirements set forth in 21 CFR part 812, including requirements for informed consent under 21 CFR part 50, labeling of devices for investigational use only, study monitoring, records and reporting, and approval by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with 21 CFR part 56.6\n\nFootnote 6: Section 520(g)(3) of the FD&C Act.\n\nii.1.4 Informed Consent\n\nA key tenet of FDA\'s IDE benefit-risk framework is appropriate protection of human subjects and a key principle of human subject protection in clinical investigations is the informed consent process.7 This process goes beyond obtaining a signature on an informed consent form. The informed consent process provides the prospective subject or his or her legally authorized representative with adequate information about the study, including pertinent information about the investigational device, its risks and benefits, alternatives, and what is expected of the subject in order to participate in the study (e.g., study visits, procedures, maintaining subject diaries).8\n\nFootnote 7: See generally, 21 CFR part 50.\n\nThe subject or his or her legally authorized representative must be given sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate in the clinical study under circumstances that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.9\n\nFootnote 8: See 21 CFR 50.25.\n\nAn informed consent process should allow an individual to decide to accept potential risks associated with a study in exchange for the potential for anticipated benefits to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained. The informed consent process allows individuals to exercise their personal tolerance of risks as weighed against other factors, including the reasonably expected benefits and the alternatives to the study.\n\nThe informed consent process ensures that each individual makes a determination about study participation after being informed of the study, including the risks and benefits of study participation, and, if applicable, the possibility of receiving no direct benefit. The informed consent regulations in 21 CFR part 50 describe the informed consent aspects of human subject protection in clinical investigations subject to FDA regulations. For example 21 CFR 50.20, states the following:\n\n_""Except as provided in 50.23 and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative.""_In addition, 21 CFR 50.25(a)(2) states that the informed consent must include ""a description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject.""\n\nRegulatory Standard for IDE Decisions\n\nUnder section 520(g)(4)(B) of the FD&C Act, an IDE application may only be disapproved if FDA finds that the investigation does not conform to the procedures and conditions prescribed under regulations. The purpose of the IDE process is ""to encourage, to the extent consistent with the protection of the public health and safety and with ethical standards, the discovery and development of useful devices intended for human use and to that end to maintain optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of that purpose.""10\n\nFDA\'s decision-making process for IDE applications was modified with the passage of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) of 2012 (Pub. L. No. 112-144). Section 601 of FDASIA amended Section 520(g) of the FD&C Act to specify certain situations in which FDA cannot disapprove an IDE application. Section 520(g)(4)(C) of the FD&C Act states that, consistent with section 520(g)(1), FDA shall not disapprove an IDE application because:\n\nFootnote 10: Section 520(g)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nthe investigation may not support a substantial equivalence or de novo classification determination or approval of the device;\n\nthe investigation may not meet a requirement, including a data requirement, relating to the approval or clearance of a device; or\n\nan additional or different investigation may be necessary to support clearance or approval of the device.\n\nConsidering the above criteria, when the objective of a proposed study is to support a marketing submission, the sponsor may benefit from learning whether there are protocol modifications that FDA believes are needed for the study to adequately support product approval or clearance. FDA intends to convey such considerations to the sponsor to provide greater clarity and predictability. For more information, see the FDA Guidance, FDA Decisions for Investigational Device\n\nExemption (IDE) Clinical Investigations,\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocumen\n\nts/ucm279107.pdf), issued August 19, 2014 (hereinafter, FDA Decisions for IDE Guidance).\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 812.30(b), FDA may disapprove or withdraw approval of an IDE application for any of the following reasons:\n\n(1) There has been a failure to comply with any requirement of this part or the act, any other applicable regulation or statute, or any condition of approval imposed by an IRB or FDA.\n\n(2) The application or a report contains an untrue statement of a material fact, or omits material information required by this part.__(3) The sponsor fails to respond to a request for additional information within the time prescribed by FDA.\n\n(4) There is reason to believe that the risks to the subjects are not outweighed by the anticipated benefits to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained [emphasis added], or informed consent is inadequate, or the investigation is scientifically unsound, or there is reason to believe that the device as used is ineffective.\n\n(5) It is otherwise unreasonable to begin or to continue the investigation owing to the way in which the device is used or the inadequacy of:\n\n(i) The report of prior investigations or the investigational plan;\n\n(ii) The methods, facilities, and controls used for the manufacturing, processing, packaging, storage, and, where appropriate, installation of the device; or\n\n(iii) Monitoring and review of the investigation.\n\nConsistent with this regulation, FDA will generally disapprove an IDE application if potential risks of the proposed study are not justified, or if data provided are insufficient to adequately characterize the safety profile of the device such that, based on the data contained in the IDE application, human clinical investigation is not considered reasonable.\n\nThis guidance document provides greater clarity regarding regulatory assessment of:\n\nrisks and benefits associated with clinical investigational device use proposed in IDE applications;11 and\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR 812.30(b)(4).\n\ninadequacy or uncertainty regarding the clinical or nonclinical data from prior investigations, the proposed study, the manufacturing, transport and storage of a device, or monitoring oversight of the proposed study.12\n\nFootnote 12: 21 CFR 812.30(b)(5).\n\nTypes of IDE Decisions\n\nFDA regulations13 provide for three major categories of decision on an IDE application - approval, approval with conditions, and disapproval.\n\nFootnote 13: 21 CFR 812.30(a).\n\nIf FDA approves an IDE application the sponsor may begin subject enrollment upon receipt of IRB approval and in accordance with the limits described in FDA\'s decision letter, including the maximum numbers of U.S. subjects and investigational sites.

See FDA Decisions for IDE Guidance, page 6.\n\nIf FDA approves an IDE application with conditions, the sponsor may begin subject enrollment upon receipt of IRB approval and in accordance with the limits described in FDA\'s decision letter, including the maximum numbers of U.S. subjects and investigational sites, and FDAexpects that the sponsor will submit information addressing the issues identified as conditions of approval in FDA\'s letter within 45 days. See FDA Decisions for IDE Guidance, page 7.\n\nIf an IDE application is disapproved, the sponsor may not initiate enrollment in the clinical investigation until the sponsor submits an amendment to the IDE to respond to the deficiencies identified in FDA\'s letter and subsequently receives a new letter from FDA granting approval or approval with conditions. See FDA Decisions for IDE Guidance, page 10.\n\nWhere appropriate, FDA may allow additional flexibility in how outstanding issues can be addressed (i.e., future considerations, study design considerations, contingent approval, staged approval), to allow clinical investigations to commence without unnecessary delay, while ensuring that human subjects are adequately protected.14 For discussion of contingent approval, see FDA Guidance, Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) for Early Feasibility Medical Device Clinical Studies, Including Certain First in Human (FIH) Studies (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocumen ts/ucm279103.pdf), issued October 1, 2013 (hereinafter, FDA Early Feasibility Guidance).\n\nIn some cases, FDA may grant staged approval or staged approval with conditions for a portion of the planned study cohort or grant a limited number of subjects enrolled while outstanding questions that may affect the benefit-risk profile for the proposed IDE study are addressed. See FDA Decisions for IDE Guidance for more information on staged approvals, page 8.15 Staged approval permits the clinical investigation to begin in a timely manner while maintaining appropriate subject protections. Without this mitigation measure, the benefit-risk profile of the proposed investigation may not support study initiation.\n\nFootnote 14: See FDA Decisions for IDE Guidance\n\nFDA may grant approval with conditions when there are outstanding issues that do not raise concerns that preclude initiation of the proposed clinical investigation, provided that the sponsor addresses the recommended modifications to the study. Resolution of these issues is not required prior to initiation of study subject enrollment, with exception of issues related to the informed consent document, which must be addressed before enrollment begins, in accordance with 21 CFR part 50 - Protection of Human Subjects.\n\nInitial IDE application approval decisions reflect the benefit-risk profile of the proposed investigation at the time of FDA\'s assessment. Changes in approval status (e.g., from disapproval to approval) may be appropriate as new information becomes available which:\n\nchanges the understanding of risks and benefits or their associated level of uncertainty;\n\nchanges confidence in risk control or mitigation measures (refer to Appendix D); or\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nchanges the disease or clinical diagnostic/treatment landscape in a manner which alters the benefit-risk profile of the IDE device relative to alternatives.\n\nIf necessary, FDA may take appropriate regulatory actions to protect study subjects, including placing a clinical hold on the study. FDA can place a study on ""clinical hold"" when, taking into consideration the factors in section 520(g)(8) of the FD&C Act, the device involved represents an unreasonable risk to the safety of the persons who are the subjects of the clinical investigation. If the study is placed on hold, no additional subjects may be enrolled.\n\nStudy Design Considerations\n\nAlthough FDA will not disapprove an IDE because the investigational plan for a pivotal study may not support approval or clearance of a marketing submission in accordance with section 520(g)(4)(C) of the FD&C Act, study design has a direct bearing on the knowledge that can be gained from that study. A poorly designed study may produce evidence which leads to false conclusions that have significant negative public health implications. A poorly designed study could produce data, which are inconclusive or difficult to interpret and thereby limit the degree to which useful knowledge is generated from the study.\n\nIn contrast, well-designed studies are more likely to produce important knowledge about a device or disease. FDA believes it is most efficient, and consistent with least-burdensome principles, to encourage the conduct of studies which are designed to meet stated objectives. FDA may inform the sponsor of recommended modifications to the study design - Study Design Considerations (SDCs)16- that FDA believes will improve the quality of the information and knowledge generated by the study which the sponsor is encouraged but not required to address.\n\nFootnote 16: See FDA Decisions for IDE Guidance\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviccregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm279107.pdf) for more information on the topic of SDCs.\n\nIV. IDE APPLICATION ASSESSMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF A DEVICE DEVELOPMENT Pathway\n\nStages of Device Development\n\nWhen making IDE benefit-risk assessments, FDA considers: 1) the stage of development of the device, 2) the maturity of the proposed technology, and 3) the availability of non-clinical testing to complement or replace the need for clinical testing.\n\nFDA\'s Early Feasibility Guidance (page 6) defines the following device study types:\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFirst in Human (FIH): A first in human study is a type of study in which a device for a specific indication is evaluated for the first time in human subjects.\n\nEarly Feasibility: An early feasibility study is a limited clinical investigation of a device early in development, typically before the device design has been finalized, for a specific indication (e.g. innovative device for a new or established intended use, marketed device for a novel clinical application).\n\nTraditional Feasibility: A traditional feasibility study is a clinical investigation that is commonly used to capture preliminary safety and effectiveness information on a near-final or final device design to adequately plan an appropriate pivotal study.\n\nPivotal Study: A pivotal study is a clinical investigation designed to collect definitive evidence of the safety and effectiveness of a device for a specified intended use, typically in a statistically justified number of subjects.\n\nIn some cases, IDE studies may also be designed for investigation of marketed products. For example, an IDE study may be conducted to expand the indications for use or update the device labeling.\n--------------------\nContext title: Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations for Medical Device Investigational Device Exemptions Guidance for Investigational Device Exemption Sponsors, Sponsor-Investigators and Food and Drug Administration Staff'

Although the Agency has articulated policies related to design of studies intended to support specific device types, and a general policy of tailoring the evidentiary burden to the regulatory requirement, the Agency has not attempted to describe the different clinical study designs that may be appropriate to support a device pre-market submission, or to define how a sponsor should decide which pivotal clinical study design should be used to support a submission for a particular device. This guidance document describes different study design principles relevant to the development of medical device clinical studies that can be used to fulfill pre-market clinical data requirements. This guidance is not intended to provide a comprehensive tutorial on the best clinical and statistical practices for investigational medical device studies.\n\nMedical devices can undergo three general stages of clinical development. These stages may be extremely dependent on each other and doing a thorough evaluation in one stage can make the next stage much more straightforward. To begin, medical devices may undergo an exploratory clinical stage. In this stage, the limitations and advantages of the medical device are evaluated. This stage includes first-in-human studies and feasibility studies. The next stage, the pivotal stage, is used to develop the information necessary to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the device for the identified intended use. It usually consists of one or more pivotal studies. Finally, devices undergo a post-market stage which can include an additional study or studies for better understanding of device safety, such as rare adverse events and long-term effectiveness. This guidance provides information on design issues related to pivotal clinical investigations and does not address the other stages in any detail.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA medical device pivotal study is a definitive study in which evidence is gathered to support the safety and effectiveness evaluation of the medical device for its intended use. Evidence from one or more pivotal clinical studies generally serves as the primary basis for the determination of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the medical device of a pre-market approval application (PMA) and FDA's overall benefit-risk determination. In some cases, a PMA may include multiple studies designed to answer different scientific questions.\n\nThe focus of this guidance is providing recommendations to sponsors on how to design clinical investigations to support a PMA. However, sponsors who conduct clinical studies to support pre-market notification (510(k)) and de novo submissions may also rely on the principles in this guidance document.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Scope\n\nThis guidance describes principles for the design of pre-market clinical studies1 that are pivotal in establishing the safety and effectiveness of a medical device. Practical issues and pitfalls in pivotal clinical study design are discussed, along with their effects on the conclusions that can be drawn from the studies concerning safety and effectiveness. The principles discussed in this guidance are intended to assist sponsors of marketing applications and investigators in designing studies adequate to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness concerning a device.\n\nFootnote 1: For purposes of this guidance the term “studies” is equivalent to the term “investigations.”\n\nTypes of Studies Addressed in this Guidance\n\nDue to the range of intended uses and risks associated with medical devices and constraints in executing clinical studies, this guidance treats pivotal clinical studies in a general manner. It frames FDA's recommendations in terms of two broad categories of medical devices:\n\nTherapeutic and aesthetic devices\n\nDiagnostic devices\n\nFrom this guidance, device developers can gain insight about important pivotal study design issues for devices in each of these categories. At the same time, communication with FDA review staff (e.g., through a pre-submission interaction) is often valuable in arriving at pivotal clinical study designs that are both practical and adequate.\n\n2.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThis guidance also includes principles that are applicable to the device-specific issues for combination products defined under 21 CFR Part 3 (e.g., device-drug products; device-biologic products). However, drug-specific or biologic-specific issues that may also be relevant for a combination product are not described in this guidance.\n\nThis guidance is intended to complement other existing guidance, and is not intended to replace the policies described in other guidance documents. In cases where questions arise, consult the appropriate FDA review division directly or the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance and Consumer Assistance or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Office of Communication, Outreach and Development (OCOD) depending on which Center is responsible for review of the device.\n\nTypes of Studies Not Addressed in this Guidance\n\nAlthough this guidance does not address the following kinds of studies, some principles discussed herein are applicable to many of them:\n\nNon-clinical studies (e.g., bench, animal or measurement studies and, for in vitro diagnostic devices, analytical validation studies);\n\nHumanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Regulation: Questions and Answers, at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucml110194.htm, for detailed information.\n\nPre-market feasibility clinical studies, or other pre-market clinical studies that are not part of the pivotal stage;\n\nStudies to establish the clinical validity of companion diagnostic devices (i.e., in vitro diagnostic tests that provide essential information for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product). Clinical development programs for companion diagnostic devices are typically part of the clinical development programs of the corresponding therapeutic products;\n\nPost-market clinical studies. Though the need for post-market clinical studies might arise from interpretation of pre-market clinical results, post-market studies do not drive the initial determination of safety and effectiveness, and their design is not addressed in this guidance. However, the principles discussed in this guidance may be useful in designing such studies;\n\nStudies of products regulated by CBER that require an Investigational New Drug application and Biologics License Application, such as donor screening tests, are not included in the scope of the guidance.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Design Considerations for Pivotal Clinical Investigations for Medical Devices Guidance for Industry, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards and FDA Staff""

You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate telephone number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to inform new drug application (NDA) and abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) holders of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) plan to use enforcement discretion with regard to section 314.70(c)(2)(iii) of the final rule entitled\n\nSupplements and Other Changes to an Approved Application (21 CFR 314.70(c)(2)(iii)).2 This subsection describes the filing requirement that a relaxation of acceptance criteria or deletion of a test to comply with an official compendium must be reported in a changes-being-effected-in-30-days supplement (CBE-30). In the exercise of its enforcement discretion, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action if manufacturers continue to submit such changes in their annual reports. The use of enforcement discretion will give the Agency time to clarify that some of these types of postapproval changes can be submitted in an annual report, rather than in a CBE-30. The Agency intends to clarify this issue in an upcoming revision to the guidance for industry\n\nChanges to an Approved NDA or ANDA; Questions and Answers.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nBackground\n\nOn April 8, 2004, FDA published in the Federal Register (69 FR 18728) the final rule entitled Supplements and Other Changes to an Approved Application. In the same issue of the Federal Register (69 FR 18768), FDA announced the availability of the guidance for industry entitled Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA (the Changes guidance). The final rule sets forth requirements for postapproval changes.\n\nUnder section 314.70(c)(2)(iii) of the final rule, the relaxation of acceptance criteria or deletion of a test to comply with an official compendium that is consistent with FDA statutory and regulatory requirements must be submitted as a supplement - changes-being-effected-in-30 days (CBE-30) (see section VIII.C.1.e of the Changes guidance). Under 314.70(d)(2)(i) of the final rule, any change in a specification made to comply with an official compendium, except the relaxation of acceptance criteria or deletion of a test that is consistent with FDA statutory and regulatory requirements, is to be submitted as an Annual Report (see section VIII.D.1 of the Changes guidance).\n\nSince publication of the final rule, the Agency has received communications from NDA and ANDA holders requesting clarification of the regulation as it applies to changes such as excipient monographs and general chapters. As written now, the regulations could be interpreted to require a CBE for any compendial change to relax or delete a test, resulting in an increase in the number of supplements, something that was not intended. The Agency plans to revise the Guidance for Industry: Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA; Questions and Answers to provide more specific recommendations as to what types of changes can be submitted in an annual report instead of a CBE-30 supplement.\n\nIn addition, the Agency is aware that stakeholders have expressed concern that the final rule (i.e., 21 CFR 314.70), which published on April 8, 2004, and the accompanying Changes guidance do not take into consideration the recent FDA Pharmaceutical CGMP Initiative for the 21({}^{\\rm st}) Century. Accordingly, the Agency plans to align this guidance with the initiative in order to facilitate manufacturing changes to enhance product quality.\n\nIII Exercise of enforcement discretion\n\nFDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion and does not intend to take action to enforce compliance with the compendial changes requirement as stated in 21 CFR 314.70(c)(2)(iii) if manufacturers submit such changes in their annual reports. FDA intends to develop further guidance to clarify the requirere nts of 21 CFR 314.70(c)(2)(iii).\n--------------------\nContext title: Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA; Specifications – Use of Enforcement Discretion for Compendial Changes Guidance for Industry""

If you have any questions about the effect of any portion of this guidance, contact the Office of Pharmaceutical Science, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD-003), Food and Drug Association, 5600 Fisher's Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.\n\n1 Introduction and Background\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to holders of new drug applications (NDAs) and abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) who intend to make postapproval changes in accordance with section 506A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and $ 314.70 (21 CFR 314.70). The guidance covers recommended reporting categories for postapproval changes for drugs other than specified biotechnology and specified synthetic biological products. It supersedes the guidance of the same title published November 1999. Recommendations are provided for postapproval changes in (1) components and composition, (2) manufacturing sites, (3) manufacturing process, (4) specifications, (5) container closure system, and (6) labeling, as well as (7) miscellaneous changes and (8) multiple related changes.\n\nRecommendations on reporting categories for changes relating to specified biotechnology and specified synthetic biological products regulated by CDER are found in the guidance for industryentitled Changes to an Approved Application for Specified Biotechnology and Specified Synthetic Biological Products (July 1997).2\n\nFootnote 2: FDA is currently revising the 1997 guidance and intends to issue it in draft for public comment.\n\nOn November 21, 1997, the President signed the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (the Modernization Act).3 Section 116 of the Modernization Act amended the the Act by adding section 506A, which provides requirements for making and reporting manufacturing changes to an approved application and for distributing a drug product made with such changes. The FDA has revised its regulations on supplements and other changes to an approved application (21 CFR 314.70) to conform to section 506A of the Act.\n\nFootnote 3: Public Law 105-115.\n\nThis guidance does not provide recommendations on the specific information that should be developed by an applicant to assess the effect of the change on the identity, strength (e.g., assay, content uniformity), quality (e.g., physical, chemical, and biological properties), purity (e.g., impurities and degradation products), or potency (e.g., biological activity, bioavailability, bioequivalence) of a drug product as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. An applicant should consider all relevant CDER guidance documents for recommendations on the information that should be submitted to support a given change.4\n\nFootnote 4: A list of CDER guidances is available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm.\n\nCDER has published guidances, including the SUPAC (scale-up and postapproval changes) guidances, that provide recommendations on reporting categories. To the extent that the recommendations on reporting categories in this guidance are found to be inconsistent with guidances published before this guidance was finalized, the recommended reporting categories in such previously published guidances are superseded by this guidance. This guidance does not provide extensive recommendations on reporting categories for components and composition changes (see section V). Therefore, recommended reporting categories for components and composition changes provided in previously published guidances, such as the SUPAC guidances, still apply. Section 506A of the Act and SS 314.70(c) provide for two types of changes-being-effected supplements (see section II), while previously there was only one type. It is important for applicants to use this guidance to determine which type of changes-being-effected supplement is recommended. CDER intends to update the previously published guidances to make them consistent with this guidance.\n\nIf guidance for either recommended reporting categories or information that should be submitted to support a particular change is not available, the appropriate CDER chemistry or microbiology review staff can be consulted for advice.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, in general, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required. Insofar as this guidance adjusts reporting categories pursuant to section 506A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and 21 CFR 314.70, it does have binding effect. If you have any questions about the effect of any portion of this guidance, contact the Office of Pharmaceutical Science, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD-003), Food and Drug Association, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.\n\nII Reporting Categories\n\nSection 506A of the Act and $ 314.70 provide for four reporting categories that are distinguished in the following paragraphs.\n\nA major change is a change that has a substantial potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a drug product as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. A major change requires the submission of a supplement and approval by FDA prior to distribution of the drug product made using the change. This type of supplement is called, and should be clearly labeled, a Prior Approval Supplement ($ 314.70(b)). An applicant may ask FDA to expedite its review of a prior approval supplement for public health reasons (e.g., drug shortage) or if a delay in making the change described in it would impose an extraordinary hardship on the applicant. This type of supplement is called, and should be clearly labeled, a Prior Approval Supplement - Expedited Review Requested ($ 314.70(b)(4)).5 FDA is most likely to grant requests for expedited review based on extraordinary hardship for manufacturing changes made necessary by catastrophic events (e.g., fire) or by events that could not be reasonably foreseen and for which the applicant could not plan.\n\nFootnote 5: Internal Agency policies and procedures relating to processing requests for expedited review of supplements to approved ANDAs and NDAs are documented in CDER’s Manual of Policies and Procedures (MAPP) at 5240.1 and 5310.3, respectively. MAPPs can be located on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cder/mapp.htm.\n\nA moderate change is a change that has a moderate potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug product as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. There are two types of moderate change. One type of moderate change requires the submission of a supplement to FDA at least 30 days before the distribution of the drug product made using the change. This type of supplement is called, and should be clearly labeled, a Supplement - Changes Being Effected in 30 Days ($ 314.70(c)(3)). The drug product made using a moderate change cannot be distributed if FDA informs the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the supplement that a prior approval supplement is required ($ 314.70(c)(5)(i)). For each change, the supplement must contain information determined by FDA to be appropriate and must include the information developed by the applicant in assessing the effects of the change ($ 314.70(a)(2) and (c)(4)). If FDA informs the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the supplement that information is missing, distribution must be delayed until the supplement has been amended to provide the missing information ($ 314.70(c)(5)(ii)).\n--------------------\nContext title: Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry""

This guidance document represents the Agency’s current thinking on changes in labeling of approved abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) following revisions in the RLD’s labeling. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes, regulations, or both.\n\nRevising ANDA Labeling Following\n\nRevision of the RLD Labeling\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist sponsors of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) in deciding when and how to submit labeling supplements following labeling revisions to their reference listed drugs (RLDs).\n\nII Background\n\nDuring the marketing life of a drug product approved under a new drug application (NDA), the package insert labeling is frequently revised. When an NDA serves as an RLD for an ANDA, approved changes in the RLD labeling generally necessitate changes in the labeling of one or more ANDAs using the RLD. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and Agency regulations, an ANDA product must have the same labeling as the RLD. Section 505(j)(2)(A)(v) of the Act states that an abbreviated application for a new drug must contain\n\ninformation to show that the labeling proposed for the new drug is the same as the labeling approved for the listed drug...except for changes required because of differences approved under a petition...or because the new drug and the listed drug are produced or distributed by different manufacturers.\n\nSimilar statements are also found in the regulations at 21 CFR 314.94(a)(8)(iv).\n\nPreviously, OGD notified the appropriate ANDA sponsors when the approved labeling of their RLD changed. This was usually done using a formal supplement request letter. In cases where an NDA served as the RLD for multiple generic products, the preparation ofa large number of request letters took a significant amount of review staff time. With the increase in the numbers of approved NDAs and ANDAs, this approach was using an increasingly disproportionate share of OGD's resources. Because of the time it took, the approach sometimes even delayed the notification of ANDA sponsors. With the exception of a few special situations (noted below), OGD is no longer providing this type of notification. The sponsor of an ANDA is now responsible for ensuring that the labeling contained in its application is the same as the currently approved labeling of the RLD. OGD has determined that this change in responsibility is necessary to minimize the implementation time for the introduction of revised labeling into the market place. OGD believes that prompt revision, submission to the Agency, and implementation of revised labeling are important to ensure the continued safe and effective use of generic drug products. Because the regulations state that the labeling of the generic must be the same as the innovator, the revision should be made at the very earliest time possible. If there is any potential delay in the revision of a generic drug labeling, the sponsor should contact OGD.\n\n3 How to obtain information on a change in RLD labeling\n\nThe sponsor of an ANDA should routinely monitor the Labeling Review Branch Homepage (see below) for information on changes in labeling. OGD's Labeling Review Branch will:\n\nPlace monthly updates of approved labeling changes for RLDs with approved ANDAs on the Labeling Review Branch Homepage at: http://www.fda.gov/cder/ogd/rld/labeling_review_branch.html\n\nContinue to notify ANDA applicants by facsimile, telephone, and/or letter for any labeling revision approved for the RLD that warrants immediate widespread professional notification, such as those changes connected to issuing a Dear Doctor Letter or similar significant changes.\n\nAll approved labeling for RLDs is still available from Freedom of Information Staff. Sponsors who wish to obtain labeling using this mechanism should send a written or facsimile request to:\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nFreedom of Information Staff (HFI-35)\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nPhone: 301-827-6500; FAX: 301-443-1726\n\nWhen a labeling revision is needed, the ANDA sponsor should take appropriate action to revise the ANDA labeling and submit the revised labeling to the FDA.\n\nHow to submit revised labeling\n\nAll ANDA labeling changes needed because of approved changes to the labeling of the RLD may be submitted as a Special Supplement - Changes Being Effected. Such supplements should include:\n\n12 copies of final printed labeling\n\nthe date the revised labeling will be used (go into effect)\n\na side-by-side comparison of the ANDA labeling with the approved labeling of the RLD with all differences annotated and explained, as described in 21 CFR 314.94 (a)(8)(iv)\n\nSponsors should contact the OGD Labeling Review Branch at 301-827-5846 if there are any questions about the information in this guidance.\n--------------------\nContext title: Revising ANDA Labeling Following Revision of the RLD Labeling""

This guidance discusses general issues common to all types of electronic regulatory submissions. In some cases, the guidance for one center differs from that for the other center because of differences in procedures and in the computer infrastructures in the centers. We will work to minimize these differences wherever possible.\n\nAgency guidance documents on electronic regulatory submissions will be updated regularly to reflect the evolving nature of the technology involved and the experience of those using this technology.\n\n2 Background\n\nIn the Federal Register of March 20, 1997 (62 FR 13430), the FDA published the Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures regulations (21 CFR Part 11). This regulation provided for the voluntary submission of parts or all of regulatory records in electronic format without an accompanying paper copy. Publication of this regulation resulted in a series of related actions:March 1997:\n\nThe Agency established public docket number 92S-0251 to provide a permanent location for a list of the Agency units that are prepared to receive electronic submissions and the specific types of regulatory records that can be accepted in electronic format (62 FR 13467, March 20, 1997). This docket can be accessed on the Internet at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/92s0251/92s0251.htm.\n\nSeptember 1997:\n\nCDER published a guidance for industry entitled Archiving Submissions in Electronic Format -- NDAs (62 FR 49695, September 23, 1997) to assist applicants wanting to make electronic submissions of case report forms (CRFs) and case report tabulations (CRTs) as part of the NDA archival submission.\n\nApril 1998:\n\nCDER issued a draft guidance for industry, Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format -- NDAs, which expanded on the September 1997 guidance by providing information on submitting a complete archival copy of the NDA in electronic format (63 FR 17185; April 8, 1998).\n\nJune 1998:\n\nCBER published the following draft guidances to assist applicants in their efforts to submit electronic documents to the Center for review and archive as part of their BLA or PLA/ELA submissions:\n\nElectronic Submissions of a Biologics License Application (BLA), Product License Application (PLA) /Establishment License Application (ELA) to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (63 FR 29741, 6/1/98).\n\nElectronic Submissions of Case Report Forms (CRFs), Case Report Tabulations(CRTs) and Data to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (63 FR 29739; 6/1/98).\n\nPilot Program for Electronic Investigational New Drug (eIND) Applications for Biological Products (63 FR 29740; 6/1/98).\n\nInstructions for Submitting Electronic Lot Release Protocols to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (63 FR 29742; 6/98).\n\nJanuary 1999:\n\nCDER and CBER finalized this joint guidance on general considerations for electronic submissions. Subsequent guidances will focus on specific submission types.\n\nThe Agency envisions the series of guidance documents on electronic regulatory submissions to provide guidance on the following:\n\nGeneral considerations for all electronic submissions (e.g., file formats)\n\nNDAs to CDER (including supplements and amendments)\n\nMarketing Applications to CBER (e.g., BLAs, PLAs, ELAs, NDAs)\n\nAbbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs)\n\nPostmarketing Safety Reports\n\nInvestigational New Drug Applications (INDs)\n\nAnnual Reports\n\nDrug Master Files (DMFs)\n\nLaunch Material\n\nAdvertising\n\nOther\n\nAs individual documents are completed, they will be issued first in draft for comment, then finalized and added to the series. The guidances will be updated regularly to reflect the continuously evolving nature of the technology and experience of those using this technology.\n\n3 What File formats should I use for electronic documents?\n\nRegulations in 21 CFR Part 11 require that the Agency be able to generate from any document provided in electronic format an accurate and complete paper copy that is both legible (""human readable"") and suitable for inspection, review, and copying. Therefore, documents submitted in electronic format should:\n\nEnable the user to easily view a clear and legible copy of the information\n\nEnable the user to print each document page by page, as it would have been provided in paper, maintaining fonts, special orientations, table formats, and page numbers\n\nInclude a well-structured table of contents and allow the user to navigate easily through the submission * Allow the user to copy text and images electronically into common word processing documents\n\nTo achieve the above goals, you should submit all electronic documents in Portable Document Format (PDF). CDER and CBER are prepared to archive documents provided as PDF files. PDF is an open, published format created by Adobe Systems Incorporated (http://www.adobe.com). You do not need to use a product from Adobe or from any specific company to produce your PDF documents. PDF has been accepted as a standard for providing documents in electronic format by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH).\n\nThe following recommendations will help you create PDF files that we can review and archive.\n\nVersion\n\nWe should be able to read all PDF files with version 3.0 of the Acrobat Reader with the search plug in. We should not need any additional software to read and navigate the PDF files.\n\nFonts\n\nPDF viewing software automatically substitutes a font to display text if the font used to create the text is unavailable on the reviewer\'s computer. Font substitution can affect a document\'s appearance and structure, and in some cases it can affect the information conveyed by a document. We cannot guarantee the availability of any one font. Therefore, you should embed all fonts you are using in the PDF files to ensure that those fonts will always be available to the reviewer. When embedding fonts, all characters for the font should be embedded, not just a subset of the fonts being used in the document.\n\nOne problem associated with embedding fonts is that embedding requires additional computer storage space. Three techniques to help limit the storage space taken by embedding fonts include:\n\nLimiting the number of fonts used in each document\n\nUsing only True Type or Adobe Type 1 fonts\n\nAvoiding customized fonts\n\nResizing a document because the contents are too small to read is inefficient. We believe that Times New Roman, 12-point font, the font used for this document, is adequate in size for reading narrative text. Although sometimes tempting for use in tables and charts, fonts smaller than 12 points should be avoided whenever possible.\n\nWe recommend the use of a black font color. Blue font may be used for hypertext links (preferred for submissions to CBER). If a font color other than black is used, avoid light colors that do not print well on grayscale printers. You can test the color reproduction prior to submission by printing sample pages from the document using a grayscale printer.\n\nPage Orientation\n\nPages should be properly oriented. For example, you should set the page orientation of landscape pages to landscape prior to saving the PDF document in final form to ensure correct page presentation.\n\nPage Size and Margins\n\nThe print area for pages should fit on a sheet of paper that is 8.5 inches by 11 inches. You should allow a margin of at least 1 inch on all sides to avoid obscuring information if the pages are subsequently printed and bound.\n\nSource of Electronic Document\n\nPDF documents produced by scanning paper documents are usually inferior to those produced from an electronic source document. Scanned documents are more difficult to read and do not allow us to search or copy and paste text for editing. They should be avoided if at all possible. If you use optical character recognition software, you should verify that all imaged text converted by the software is accurate.\n\nMethods for Creating PDF Documents and Images\n\nChoose a method for creating PDF documents that produces the best replication of a paper document. You can ensure that the paper and PDF version of the document are the same by printing the document from the PDF version.\n\nDocuments that are available only in paper should be scanned at resolutions that will ensure the pages are legible both on the computer screen and when printed. At the same time, you should also limit the file size. We recommend scanning at a resolution of 300 dots per inch (dpi) to balance legibility and file size. We discourage the use of grayscale or color because of file size. After scanning, avoid resampling to a lower resolution.\n\nWhen creating PDF files containing images, you should not resample images. Resampling does not preserve all of the pixels in the original. For PDF images, you can use one of the following lossless compression techniques (with the exception that, when submitting to CBER, standard radiographic images, PET, and SPECT images should not be compressed).\n\nFor lossless compression of color and grayscale images, use Zip/Flate (one technique with two names). This is specified in Internet RFC 1950 and RFC 1951 (http://info.internet.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc1950.txt).\n\nFacsimile coding schemes and coding control functions for Group 4 facsimile apparatus.\n--------------------\nContext title: Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format; General Considerations'

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis document provides guidance intended to assist those parties responsible for complying with the Reportable Food Registry requirements prescribed by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L110-085). As required by section 1005(f) of this law, in September 2009, FDA issued guidance to industry about submitting reports of instances of reportable food through the electronic portal and providing notifications to other persons in the supply chain of such articles of food. This guidance document provides further guidance to industry on submitting a single reportable food report to FDA covering reportable food located at more than one of a company\'s facilities.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nOn September 27, 2007, the President signed into law the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA). This law amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) by creating a new section 417, Reportable Food Registry. Section 417 requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to establish within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a Reportable Food Registry. The congressionally-identified purpose of the Reportable Food Registry is to provide a ""reliable mechanism to track patterns of adulteration in food [which] would support efforts by the Food and Drug Administration to target limited inspection resources to protect the public health"" (Pub. L110-085, section 1005(a)(4)). The Secretary has delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs the responsibility for administering the FD&C Act, including section 417. To further the development of the Reportable Food Registry, section 417 of the FD&C Act requires FDA to establish an electronic portal by which instances of reportable food must be submitted to FDA by responsible parties and may be submitted by public health officials. After receipt of reports through the electronic portal, FDA is requiredto review and assess the information submitted for purposes of identifying reportable food, submitting entries to the Reportable Food Registry, issuing an alert or notification as FDA deems necessary, and exercising other existing food safety authorities under this Act to protect the public health.\n\nThis guidance document contains a question and answer addressing the circumstance where reportable food is located at more than one of a company\'s facilities. In September 2009, FDA issued a related guidance document entitled ""Questions and Answers Regarding the Reportable Food Registry as Established by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007.(/food/guidance-documents-regulatory-information-topic/guidance-industry-questions-and-answers-regarding- reportable-food-registry-established-food-and-drug).""\n\n3 Questions and Answers\n\nQ. My company determined that it has a reportable food and the food is located at more than one of our facilities. Can my company submit one combined report that includes all of the information that would be submitted in separate reports from each facility?\n\nA. Yes, you may submit a combined report for a specific reportable food situation that involves more than one of your facilities, such as manufacturing and processing facilities, storage facilities, and/or distribution facilities. The owner, operator, or agent in charge of each facility may authorize an individual to submit a combined report on their behalf through the Reportable Food electronic portal, in lieu of each responsible party for each facility submitting a separate reportable food report for the specific reportable food. The combined report must include all of the required data elements.\n\nTo complete the screens in the Reportable Food electronic portal, the authorized individual may provide the required information for only one of the facilities. The required information relating to all of the facilities, which may also include the facility for which the screens were completed, may be provided in a separate attachment in tabular or spreadsheet format, but should be provided in a manner that clearly associates each facility with the required information that is specific for that facility.\n\nThe following file types are supported as attachments:\n\nPortable document format.\n\nImage file format.\n\nTagged image file format.\n\nRich text format.\n\nText format.\n\nSpreadsheet file format.\n\nWord processing document formats.\n\nWord processing document format.\n\nIf using a tabular or spreadsheet format, FDA recommends that responsible parties use the following column headings, in the order listed, for the required (*) and optional information for each facility:\n\nName of facility*\n\nFood facility registration number*\n\nContact name\n\nContact phone number\n\nStreet address*\n\nCity*\n\nState*\n\nZip code*Related Information\n* Reportable Food Registry_Guidance Documents & Regulatory_Information (/food/guidance-documents-regulatory-information-topic-food-and-dietary-supplements/reportable-food-registry-guidance-documents-regulatory-information)\n\n1.1.

CGMP requirements extend beyond packaging and repackaging operations that involve direct product contact. For example, a site must register with FDA (21 CFR Part 207) and is subject to CGMP inspection (21 CFR Part 211) when the site is used to attach inserts, or in the case of a cartoning site, when cartons contain product labels. If registration and/or inspection are required for the site of this secondary packaging operation, CDER should be notified of the different site (via the application). The site should have a satisfactory inspection relating to packaging operations for notification to occur in the annual report. For the purposes of this guidance, in general, there is no two-year limit on the CGMP inspection (see Manufacturing Sites Q10).

Taking the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology results into account, the implications of the nonclinical findings for the safe human use of the pharmaceutical should be discussed (i.e., as applicable to labeling).\n\nMODELLE 2: NONCLINICAL WRITTEN AND TABULATED SUMMARIES\n\nGuidance on Nonclinical Written Summaries\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist authors in the preparation of nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology written summaries in an appropriate format. This guidance is not intended to indicate what studies are required. It merely indicates an appropriate format for the nonclinical data that have been acquired.\n\nThe sequence and content of the Nonclinical Written Summary sections are described below. It should be emphasized that no guidance can cover all eventualities, and common sense and a clear focus on the needs of the regulatory authority assessor are the best guides to constructing a document. Therefore, applicants can modify the format, if needed, to provide the best possible presentation of the information and to facilitate the understanding and evaluation of the results.\n\nWhenever appropriate, age- and gender-related effects should be discussed. Relevant findings with stereoisomers and/or metabolites should be included, as appropriate. Consistent use of units throughout the Nonclinical Written Summaries will facilitate their review. A table for converting units might also be useful.\n\nIn the Discussion and Conclusion sections, information should be integrated across studies and across species, and exposure in the test animals should be related to exposure in humans given the maximum intended doses.\n\nGeneral Presentation Issues\n\nOrder of Presentation of Information Within Sections\n\nWhen available, in vitro studies should precede in vivo studies. Where multiple studies of the same type are summarized within the Pharmacokinetics and Toxicology sections, studies should be ordered by species, by route, and then by duration (shortest duration first).\n\nSpecies should be ordered as follows:\n\n(\\bullet) Mouse\n\n(\\bullet) Rat\n\n(\\bullet) Hamster\n\n(\\bullet) Other rodent\n\n(\\bullet) Rabbit\n\n(\\bullet) Dog\n\n(\\bullet) Nonhuman primate\n\n(\\bullet) Other nonrodent mammal\n\n(\\bullet) NonmammalsRoutes of administration should be ordered as follows:\n\n(\\bullet) The intended route for human use\n\n(\\bullet) Oral\n\n(\\bullet) Intravenousus\n\n(\\bullet) Intramuscular\n\n(\\bullet) Intraperitoneal\n\n(\\bullet) Subcutaneous\n\n(\\bullet) Inhalation\n\n(\\bullet) Topical\n\n(\\bullet) Other\n\nUse of Tables and Figures\n\nAlthough the Nonclinical Written Summaries are envisaged to be composed mainly of text, some information contained within them might be more effectively and/or concisely communicated through the use of appropriate tables or figures. Examples of formats that might be included in the Written Summaries are shown in Appendix A.\n\nTo allow authors flexibility in defining the optimal structure for the written summaries, tables and figures should preferably be included within the text. Alternatively, they could be grouped together at the end of each of the Nonclinical Written Summaries.\n\nThroughout the text, reference citations to the Tabulated Summaries should be included in the following format: (Table X.X, Study/Report Number).\n\nLength of Nonclinical Written Summaries\n\nAlthough there is no formal limit to the length of the Nonclinical Written Summaries, it is recommended that the total length of the three Nonclinical Written Summaries in general not exceed 100-150 pages.\n\nSequence of Written Summaries and Tabulated Summaries\n\nThe following order is recommended:\n\n(\\bullet) Introduction\n\n(\\bullet) Pharmacology written summary\n\n(\\bullet) Pharmacology tabulated summary\n\n(\\bullet) Pharmacokinetics written summary\n\n(\\bullet) Pharmacokinetics tabulated summary\n\n(\\bullet) Toxicology written summary\n\n(\\bullet) Toxicology tabulated summary\n\nGuidance on Nonclinical Tabulated Summaries\n\nIt is recommended that summary tables for the nonclinical information in the Common Technical Document be provided in the format outlined in this guidance. Applicants can modify the format, if warranted, to provide the best possible presentation of the information and to facilitate the understanding and evaluation of the results.\n\nThis guidance is not intended to indicate what studies are requested, but solely to advise how to tabulate study results if a study is performed. Applicants can add some items to or delete some items from the cited format, where appropriate. One tabular format can contain results from several studies. Alternatively, it may be appropriate to cite the data resulting from one study in several tabular formats.\n\nThe recommended formats for the tables in the Nonclinical Tabulated Summaries are provided in Appendices B and C, which follow. Appendix B contains templates for use in preparation of the tables. The templates are annotated (in italics) to provide guidance on their preparation. (The italicized information should be deleted when the tables are prepared.) Appendix C provides examples of the summary tables. The purpose of the examples is to provide additional guidance on the suggested content and format of the Tabulated Summaries. However, it is the responsibility of the applicant to decide on the best possible presentation of the data for each product. Authors should keep in mind that, in some regions, a review of the Tabulated Summaries (in conjunction with the Written Summaries) represents the primary review of the nonclinical information. Presentation of the data in the formats provided as templates and examples should ensure that a sufficient level of detail is available to the reviewer and should provide concise overviews of related information.\n\nWhen a juvenile animal study has been conducted, it should be tabulated using the template appropriate for the type of study.\n\nThe order of presentation given for the Nonclinical Written Summaries should be followed for the preparation of the tables for the Nonclinical Tabulated Summaries.\n\n2.6. CONTENT OF NONCLINICAL WRITEN AND TABULATED SUMMARIES\n\n2.6.1 INTRODUCTION\n\nThe aim of this section should be to introduce the reviewer to the pharmaceutical and to its proposed clinical use. The following key elements should be covered:\n\n(\\bullet) Brief information concerning the pharmaceutical's structure (preferably, a structure diagram should be provided) and pharmacologic properties (\\bullet) Information concerning the pharmaceutical's proposed clinical indication, dose, and duration of use\n\n2.6.2 Pharmacology Written Summary\n\nWithin the Pharmacology Written Summary, the data should be presented in the following sequence:\n\nBrief summary\n\nPrimary pharmacodynamics\n\nSecondary pharmacodynamics\n\nSafety pharmacology\n\nPharmacodynamic drug interactions\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n\nTables and figures (either here or included in text)\n\n2.6.2.1 Brief Summary\n\nThe principal findings from the pharmacology studies should be briefly summarized in approximately two to three pages. This section should begin with a brief description of the content of the pharmacologic data package, pointing out any notable aspects such as the inclusion and/or exclusion of particular data (e.g., lack of an animal model).\n\n2.6.2.2 Primary Pharmacodynamics\n\nStudies on primary pharmacodynamics1 should be summarized and evaluated. Where possible, it would be helpful to relate the pharmacology of the drug to available data (e.g., selectivity, safety, potency) on other drugs in the class.\n\nFootnote 1: A draft ICH guidance S7 Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human Pharmaceuticals discusses this term in more detail. This draft guidance published in August 2000 and is currently under revision. Once finalized, it will represent the Agency’s current thinking on this topic.\n\n2.6.2.3 Secondary Pharmacodynamics\n\nStudies on secondary pharmacodynamics2 should be summarized by organ system, where appropriate, and evaluated in this section.\n\n2.6.2.4 Safety Pharmacology\n\nSafety pharmacology studies3 should be summarized and evaluated in this section. In some cases, secondary pharmacodynamic studies can contribute to the safety evaluation when they predict or assess potential adverse effects in humans. In such cases, these secondary pharmacodynamic studies should be considered, along with safety pharmacology studies.\n\n2.6.2.5 Pharmacodynamic Drug Interactions\n\nIf they have been performed, pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies should be briefly summarized in this section.\n\n2.6.2.6 Discussion and Conclusions\n\nThis section provides an opportunity to discuss the pharmacologic evaluation and to consider the significance of any issues that arise.\n\n2.6.2.7 Tables and Figures\n--------------------\nContext title: M4S- The CTD -- Safety""

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes, regulations, or both.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to clarify when sponsors should submit final, quality-assured toxicology reports and/or update the Agency on any changes in findings since submission of non-quality-assured reports or reports based on non-quality-assured data.\n\nIn November 1995, FDA published a guidance for industry entitled Content and Format of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-Derived Products. The guidance states that\n\nIf final, fully quality-assured individual study reports are not available at the time of IND submission, an integrated summary report of toxicologic findings based on the unaudited draft toxicologic reports of completed animal studies may be submitted... [...] full toxicology department individual study reports should be available to FDA, upon request, and individual study reports should be available to FDA, upon request, as final, fully quality-assured documents within 120 days of the start of the human study... [emphasis added].\n\nIf the integrated summary is based upon unaudited draft reports, sponsors should submit an update to their integrated summary 120 days after the start of the human study(ies)...2There has been some confusion over when the 120-day clock starts, specifically, whether it means 120 days after the start of the clinical trial, or 120 days after the submission of the toxicology information.\n\nQ: How does FDA measure the start of the 120-day period within which sponsors should submit updates to their integrated summaries?\n\nA: The Agency measures the 120-day period based on the Agency's receipt (date of receipt\n\nstamped on the IND submission) of the integrated summary report including the toxicology\n\ninformation. If the sponsor does not submit the final, quality-assured report and update at this\n\ntime, the sponsor should make the final, quality-assured report available upon the request of the\n\nAgency and update the Agency on any changes in the findings. In any case, the final, quality-\n\nassured report should be submitted with the NDA.\n\nThe Agency believes that 120 days from submission of an integrated toxicology summary should\n\nprovide sponsors with adequate time to complete a final, quality-assured document. Because the\n\nAgency assumes that clinical studies will generally be initiated immediately following the initial 30-day\n\nclock (or upon submission of the protocol for an existing IND), the intention of the 120-day allowance\n\nis to encourage the initiation of clinical studies by, in effect, allowing earlier submissions of clinical\n\nprotocols based on unaudited reports.\n--------------------\nContext title: Content and Format of INDs for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-Derived Products.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist\'s diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 21: See guidances for industry ICH M3(R2) and Nonclinical Safety Evaluation of Drug or Biologic Combinations.\n\nIn general, nonclinical combination studies of an investigational DAA plus an approved DAA, IFN, or RBV are not needed. Therefore, unless data from nonclinical studies of an investigational DAA suggest a potential for serious synergistic toxicity with an approved therapeutic drug, combination toxicology studies are not anticipated.\n\nSponsors should submit carcinogenicity studies for HCV products that are expected to be used chronically. The DAVP allows the sponsor of products for serious and life-threatening indications (such as HCV) to begin carcinogenicity studies (with written agreement) before submitting an NDA and to submit the studies during the postmarketing period under section 505(o)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.22 Because of the likelihood of retreatment for patients who fail therapy (an intermittent chronic, recurrent dosing paradigm23), generally sponsors that have clinical indications for HCV DAAs with treatment durations of 24 or more weeks should conduct carcinogenicity studies.\n\nFootnote 22: See also the guidance for industry Postmarketing Studies and Clinical Trials — Implementation of Section 505(o)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPharmacokinetic Considerations a. Pharmacokine assessments Trials conducted in HCV-infected patients should include an assessment of pharmacokinetics and the relationship between drug exposure (e.g., minimum or maximum plasma concentration (C({}{\\text{min}}) or C({}{\\text{max}})), area under curve) and virologic success and toxicity in all patients.\n\nSponsors can use a combination of intensive and sparse sampling throughout development to characterize the pharmacokinetics of investigational drugs. For example, sponsors should implement an intensive sampling schedule in early phase 1 monotherapy trials. In longer term trials, however, an intensive sampling schedule might not be feasible. Alternatively, sponsors can combine sparse sampling from these trials with intensive PK data from earlier trials for analysis. Sponsors should obtain sparse PK samples at the time of key virologic assessments. These data can then be subjected to appropriate population PK analysis. Documenting dosing times and plasma sampling times is important.\n\nSponsors can use the following two broad approaches to characterize the relationship between exposure and viral kinetics or virologic success of the investigational drug, depending on the development stage and purpose of the analysis. Both approaches should account for differences in response between relevant viral subtypes and allow for exploration of relevant covariates. For these analyses, sponsors should consider virologic relapse and the development of resistance to the investigational drug when assessing differences between treatment regimens. When applicable, sponsors should use the developed exposure-response relationships to support proposed dosing and treatment duration for subsequent trials.\n\nTo aid the design of phase 2b and phase 3 trials, with respect to dose, duration, regimen choice, and population, a mechanistic approach relating drug concentrations and viral kinetics is most appropriate\n\nWhen sufficient SVR12 data are available, a simplified analysis relating the proportion of patients with virologic success and the appropriate exposure variable (e.g., C({}_{\\text{min}}), area under curve) can be used to support evidence of effectiveness and justify dose selection\n\nIn exposure-response safety analyses, sponsors should consider the toxicities that are related to the investigational drug, and infrequent but severe safety events in order to inform dose selection and dose adjustments. The appropriate exposure parameter and modeling approach depends on the investigational drug and toxicity.\n\nSpecific pharmacokinetic evaluation\n\nWe strongly encourage PK evaluation in patients with renal impairment and hepatic impairment, to inform the need for dose modifications, early in drug development, so these patients can be enrolled into phase 2 and phase 3 trials as appropriate. In general, we recommend that sponsors conduct these trials with the final regimen rather than the individual components separately.\n\nSponsors can find specific recommendations related to trial design and data analysis in the relevant FDA clinical pharmacology guidances.\n\n3. Clinical Virology Considerations a. HCV RNA assessments and data reporting\n\nFor antiviral activity and efficacy trials, sponsors should measure HCV RNA levels using a sensitive and specific quantitative assay. Clinical trial protocols should describe the HCV RNA assay or assays to be used, including a brief description of assay performance characteristics. Protocols or final reports should include the names and addresses of the laboratories conducting HCV RNA assessments (e.g., central laboratory, assay vendor).\n\nIn clinical trial protocols, final reports, and HCV RNA datasets, sponsors should use clear and consistent language to describe low-level HCV RNA results following guidelines for reporting HCV RNA levels as described in FDA-approved assay package inserts. Specifically, HCV RNA detected but less than the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) should be reported as ""(<) {LLOQ value in IU/mL} Detected,"" and HCV RNA not detected should be reported as ""Target Not Detected"" or ""HCV RNA Not Detected."" We do not recommend using terms such as undetectable or greater than the limit of detection or less than the limit of detection (LOD) (""(>) LOD"" or ""(<) LOD,"" respectively), even if the validated assay LOD and LLOQ are equal, because HCV RNA levels can still be detected at a certain rate depending on the actual HCV RNA concentration.\n\nA detected or not detected HCV RNA cutoff can be problematic for trial endpoints or treatment decision-making because it is inherently less reproducible compared to an HCV RNA cutoff that is within the validated quantitative range of the assay. Therefore, we encourage sponsors to use the assay LLOQ (or other quantitative HCV RNA threshold as appropriate) as the HCV RNA cutoff for treatment futility rules and trial endpoints including SVR, virologic relapse, and virologic breakthrough. See also Appendix: Study Population Terms and Treatment Response Definitions for recommended terms and definitions related to virologic response and treatment history.\n\nb. HCV genotype or subtype determination\n\nA validated assay with accuracy that is comparable to HCV genotyping or subtyping reference methods (Smith, Bukh, et al. 2014) should be used for HCV genotype or subtype screening and randomization of patients; we also recommend using an FDA-approved assay. Clinical trial protocols should describe the HCV genotype or subtype assay or assays to be used, and include a brief description of assay performance characteristics. Genotyping or subtyping assays (or historical data) based only on nucleotide sequence analysis of the 5\'-noncoding region of the HCV genome should be avoided because of poor performance in distinguishing between certain HCV genotypes and subtypes 1a and 1b (Chevaliez, Bouvier-Alias, et al. 2009). Clinical assays used for HCV genotype or subtype determination may not resolve HCV subtypes other than 1a and 1b. Therefore, in patients with nongenotype 1 HCV infections, sponsors should perform retrospective analyses to identify HCV subtypes based on reference methods (Smith, Bukh, et al., 2014) or phylogenetic analyses of the drug target sequence or sequences.\n\nResistance analyses\n\nFor efficacy trials, sponsors should perform treatment-emergent resistance testing for patients who do not achieve SVR. Treatment-emergent genotypic and phenotypic resistance analyses should focus on samples collected while patients are on the investigational drug; if on-treatment HCV RNA levels are not adequate for analysis, then sponsors should analyze the first available follow-up sample with adequate HCV RNA. Any changes, including mixtures, in the amino acid coding sequence of the targeted genome region present in on-treatment or follow-up samples, but not in the baseline sample, should be reported as having developed during therapy. Enrichment of substitutions from mixtures at baseline should also be reported; how these data are considered in treatment-emergent resistance analyses may depend on clinical trial design and nucleotide sequencing methods. Sponsors should conduct similar treatment-emergent resistance analyses for all patients in early-phase monotherapy trials.\n\nSponsors should analyze pretreatment samples from clinical trial patients to identify HCV genetic polymorphisms in DAA target genes, and sponsors should also evaluate the effect of HCV polymorphisms on treatment response. These analyses should consider both the investigational DAA or DAAs and any background DAA or DAAs evaluated in combination. Sponsors should determine the prevalence of HCV populations carrying detectable resistance-associated polymorphisms, both in the full trial population and in the U.S. trial patient population specifically.\n\nSponsors should follow patients who have detectable resistance-associated substitutions at treatment cessation or follow-up for an extended period (at least 1 year after treatment cessation or until the initiation of alternative HCV therapies) to assess the persistence of resistance-associated substitutions. The potential persistence of resistance-associated substitutions should be characterized for patients enrolled in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials so that preliminary long-term follow-up data are obtained by the time of completion of phase 3 trials. Genotyping methodology should be capable of assessing the quantity of resistant viruses during the outgrowth of a wild-type virus.\n--------------------\nContext title: Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection- Developing Direct-Acting Antiviral Drugs for Treatment Guidance for Industry'

This guidance is intended for sponsors and review staff in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) involved in the development and review of new formulations of previously approved drug substances and proposals for existing formulations to be used by a new route of administration.\n\nThe goals of this guidance are to:\n\nCommunicate to industry the FDA's current thinking pertaining to safety data needed to support approval of these drug products\n\nIncrease uniformity within CDER on recommendations for the nonclinical development of reformulated drug products and products being used by an alternate route\n\nThis guidance assumes that the drug substance has already been used in an approved drug product. It outlines the nonclinical information generally recommended to support the development of a new product even if there is no change in the composition of the formulation.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\ntoxicity data, if any, are recommended. When comparing the PK/ADME of a new formulation or route with a previously approved product it is important to examine the shape of the concentration/time curve in addition to the total area under the curve. For example, alterations in absorption or the dosing frequency can produce significantly different concentration/time profiles that might lead to different toxicological effects. In some cases, PK/ADME for the new formulation or route might not be available. In these cases, an assumption of 100 percent bioavailability from the proposed clinical dose might be used to judge the adequacy of available systemic toxicity information.\n\nV Route of administration considerations\n\nIn addition to evaluating the adequacy of the available toxicity information, possible toxic effects relevant to the particular route of administration should be considered. Information on toxic effects might be insufficient when there is a change in the route of administration with a new formulation. Even reformulations that do not change the route of administration might have local toxic effects not previously observed, because new combinations of active and inactive ingredients can produce additive or new effects. For example, two ingredients (active or inactive) that produce only mild irritation when used separately might produce more pronounced irritation when used together or one ingredient may alter the metabolism of another and consequently change its toxicity.\n\nConsiderations for All Routes of Administration\n\nFor all drug product reformulations and for all drug products with new routes of administration, acute and/or repeat-dose toxicity studies with complete histological evaluation should be conducted using the clinical route of administration. Acute studies may not be needed when repeat-dose studies are conducted. In general, durations of the toxicity studies should follow the recommendations outlined in ICH M3(R2) or ICH S9. For a new formulation that will be used by the same route as the previously approved product, shorter duration toxicity studies than those outlined in ICH M3(R2) may be appropriate.\n\nIf systemic exposure by a new route of administration is equivalent to or less than that of the approved route, histological evaluation may be limited to locally exposed tissues. If there are insufficient data or a safety concern about any of the excipients in the formulation, the inclusion of a saline, water, or untreated control in the safety studies should be considered.\n\nRoute-Specific Considerations\n\nIn addition to the considerations for all routes listed in sections IV. and V.A., the route-specific recommendations described in the following sections should be considered for all new formulations, whether they are proposed for a new route or the same route as a previous formulation. Note that as with systemic toxicity, new studies may not be needed if existing information is already sufficient. Similar recommendations can be considered for any route not mentioned here.\n\n.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNo studies are recommended in addition to the toxicity studies listed in section V.A.\n\n.1.2 Dermal (Including Patches)\n\nThe potential for delayed hypersensitivity of the new formulation should be evaluated.\n\nThe potential for phototoxicity should be evaluated according to the principles outlined in the ICH guidance for industry S10 Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals.\n\nIf the new formulation contains a drug substance that has not been evaluated for ocular irritation, then the potential of the topical drug product to induce irritation of the eyes if the eyes were inadvertently exposed to the product should be appropriately addressed. The topical drug product's ocular irritation potential should be evaluated through the use of appropriate in vitro or ex vivo methods. The in vivo rabbit ocular irritation test method is no longer recommended for topical drug products.\n\nIf the new formulation contains a drug substance that has not been used by the dermal route, the repeat-dose local toxicity study mentioned earlier should be conducted in a nonrodent species (preferably minipig). This study should be of the same duration as clinical use (up to 9 months for chronically used drugs) and include both local and systemic evaluation.\n\nThe skin dose from topically applied drug products can be orders of magnitude higher than the skin dose after systemic administration. Therefore, a dermal carcinogenicity study might be recommended for drugs with a chronic indication even if systemic carcinogenicity studies are available. However, a dermal carcinogenicity study might be waived if a chronic dermal study in an appropriate nonrodent species shows no preneoplastic effects and there are no other causes for concern (i.e., there are no genotoxicity signals and systemic carcinogenicity data show no concern.)\n\nDermal studies generally should be conducted with untreated control, vehicle control, and complete formulation groups.\n\n.1.3 Intravenous\n\nCompatibility with blood (e.g., in vitro hemolysis, protein flocculation, platelet activation) should be evaluated.\n\n.1.4 Ocular\n\nIf the drug substance has not been previously administered by the proposed ocular route, then toxicity studies in two species with complete ocular and systemic evaluation for the appropriate duration should be carried out with the new formulation. A study in a single most appropriate species may be adequate if the drug substance has been previously administered by the proposed ocular route. Ocular toxicity can be assessed using slit lampbiomicroscopy (with and without fluorescein staining), funduscopy, tonometry, electroretinography, and histopathology.\n\nOcular studies generally should be conducted with vehicle control and complete clinical formulation groups.\n\nThese studies should include the evaluation of systemic exposure. Ocular tissue distribution should also be assessed.\n\nii.2.5 Otic\n\nThe dermal irritation and potential for delayed contact hypersensitivity of the new formulation should be evaluated.\n\nThe ability of the drug product to penetrate an intact tympanic membrane should be determined and the exposure to the middle and inner ears in an animal model should be estimated when this barrier is or is not intact.\n\nIf the drug product is expected to reach the middle or inner ear during clinical use or is introduced directly to those regions, evaluation of the auditory brainstem response, as well as microscopy of relevant otic tissues, including a cytococchleogram, should be included in acute and/or repeat-dose studies conducted by intratympan administration.\n\nii.2.6 Inhalation\n\nIf a drug substance in the new formulation has not been tested by inhalation, then inhalation toxicity studies should be conducted. These studies should consist of short-term studies (2 to 4 weeks) in two species (at least one nonrodent) followed by up to a 6-month study in the most appropriate species with the new formulation for a chronically indicated drug. Studies for new formulations should include sham (air) control, vehicle control, and complete formulation groups.\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonclinical Safety Evaluation of Reformulated Drug Products and Products Intended for Administration by an Alternate Route""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist\'s diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n--------------------\nContext: Traditionally, histopathology has been used to identify morphologic changes associated with an in vivo diagnosis, evaluation of response to therapy, basic research, and nonclinical safety assessment. There is often a strong correlation between specific histopathologic findings and clinical signs, or some clinical chemistry parameters. Thus, histopathology is currently used in some biomarker qualification programs as a reference or truth standard to evaluate the temporal correlation of the biomarker with the evolution and reversibility of the morphologic changes. This guidance is intended to provide recommendations to investigators who conduct nonclinical biomarker qualification studies when histopathology is used as a reference or truth standard.\n\nThis guidance is not intended to address the use of histopathology in traditional drug development nonclinical safety assessment studies. Biomarker qualification studies are different from nonclinical safety assessment studies and call for a different scientific paradigm.\n\nNonclinical safety assessment studies are conducted primarily for hazard characterization of a specific drug, and histopathologic assessment assists in identifying effects of the drug. In safety assessment studies, it is common practice for the pathologist to evaluate the histopathology knowing the identity of the treatment groups, the clinical signs, hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, organ weight, and gross pathology data, and then to integrate this information in a unified, physiologically plausible format (Crissman et al. 2004).\n\nIn contrast, histopathology is used in nonclinical biomarker qualification studies to establish correlative and temporal relationships between the biomarker and morphologic changes.\n\nExamples include (1) establishing a possible quantitative relationship between biomarker level and severity of morphological change; (2) exploring the kinetics of release, clearance of the biomarker, and correlative histomorphology; (3) determining the range of normal variability of the biomarker and any associated morphologic findings; and (4) identifying potentially confounding factors for use of the biomarker. Particularly in confirmatory nonclinical biomarker qualification studies, histopathology can be used as a reference or truth standard. In these cases, the pathologist should function as an impartial interpreter, uninfluenced by other information, and unequivocally blinded to novel biomarker value and comparator value (e.g., standard clinical chemistry value) and preferably to assigned treatment group.\n\nAlthough this guidance is not intended to apply to the conduct of nonclinical safety assessment studies, biomarker data, either exploratory or confirmatory, can be gathered from safety assessment studies to support the qualification of a biomarker. For example, data collected following ""Best Practices,"" such as those outlined by Burkhardt et al. 2011, can be used as supportive data, regardless of whether the data were derived from safety assessment studies or dedicated qualification studies. We recommend that biomarker developers consult with the FDA prior to initiating dual purpose safety assessment-qualification studies.\n\nQualification of a biomarker is a regulatory conclusion, and thus, the studies used to support qualification are expected to be scientifically valid, of high quality, and unbiased.\n\nIII Establishing performance characteristics of biomarkers\n\nMethodology for Detection of the Biomarker (Biomarker Assay)\n\nBiomarker detection can be based on several different methodologies (e.g., biochemical measurements, physiologic organ function tests, or imaging of structural features ranging from molecular to anatomic levels). The method of biomarker detection provides the measurements that are the basis for comparison of the biomarker to the reference or truth standard of histopathology and, therefore, is critical to biomarker characterization. Thus, the detection system should be well characterized.6\n\nFootnote 6: See FDA’s draft guidance for industry Bioanalytical Method Validation (Revision 1). In the Federal Register of September 13, 2013 (78 FR 56718), FDA published a notice announcing the availability of the revised draft guidance. When finalized, it will represent the Agency’s current thinking on the topic.\n\nFor example, for a biochemical biomarker, the assay used to measure the biomarker should have scientifically rigorous analytical sensitivity and analytical specificity. An assay with poor sensitivity or one that is inhibited by other substances in the biological sample or matrix could lead to a false negative result by failing to detect initial changes in biomarker levels. An assay with poor specificity would not distinguish injury to a nontarget organ or the assay may cross-react with nonspecific substances in the specimen. Thus, the biomarker assay should reliably and reproducibly detect changes (increase or decrease) or absence of changes in biomarker levels. Interpretation of any detected change in biomarker levels should ultimately include an assessment of whether the change is biologically meaningful through comparison to the histopathology.\n\nConsiderations for biomarker detection based on biochemical measurements also apply to biomarker detection based on other methodologies such as imaging technologies (e.g., positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, radiology). Histopathology used as a reference or truth standard provides an independent means of evaluating the same variable that is assessed by the biomarker.\n\nBiological Performance of the Biomarker\n\nii.2.1 Performance Characteristics\n\nIt is highly unlikely that any biomarker will be 100 percent specific or 100 percent sensitive.\n\nThe proposed context of use for a biomarker determines the specific performance characteristics that can be used to support qualification. Studies intended to establish the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the biomarker should be relevant to the proposed context of use. A reference or truth standard such as histopathology provides an independent means of evaluating the same parameter that the biomarker is intended to assess.\n\nii.2.2 Biomarker Sensitivity and Temporal Correlation\n\nIn contrast to analytical sensitivity, biomarker sensitivity is related to (1) the probability of identifying a morphologic effect, (2) the threshold of morphologic change that would cause a discernible change in the biomarker level, and (3) the time interval before or after a morphologic effect until a change in the biomarker level can be detected.\n\nBiomarker sensitivity is the probability that a biomarker will indicate a specific morphologic change when the change is present. If the biomarker is 100 percent sensitive, it will never be negative in the presence of the specific morphologic change that it is designed to detect.\n\nThe temporal relationship between the initial change in biomarker level and the onset of histopathologic change defines the biomarker sensitivity. Accurate characterization of this temporal relationship is important to optimizing the biomarker sensitivity.\n\nThe timing and frequency of biomarker measurement in qualification studies should allow for a clear interpretation of the temporal relationship of the biomarker with morphologic changes. The time frame and mechanism by which an agent (e.g., mechanical, chemical, natural disease) produces morphologic changes in tissue should be understood and considered when planning the time course of sampling and/or analysis in biomarker qualification studies.\n\nHistopathologic evaluation using light microscopy with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is preferred in qualification studies, when this is the method that will be used in the context of use of the biomarker. For treatment-induced histopathologic changes in animals, the temporal relationship between changes in biomarker levels and detectable morphologic changes, as observed by light microscopy and H&E staining, usually can be described by one of the following statements, as indicated by appropriate supportive data:\n\nThe initial change in biomarker levels precedes the onset of morphologic changes.\n\nThe initial change in biomarker levels is approximately concurrent with the onset of morphologic changes.\n\nThe initial change in biomarker levels occurs only after the development of morphologic change.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSimilarly, when there is a relationship between morphologic and biomarker changes during reversal or recovery, morphologic changes may be preceded by, concurrent with, or followed by changes in the biomarker levels. Sometimes recovery from morphologic changes may be unrelated to changes in the biomarker levels.\n\nThere are several potential causes for false negative biomarker results (when a morphologic effect is not accompanied by an expected change in biomarker). These include (1) low analytical sensitivity, (2) interference of other proteins or substances with the assay, (3) inconsistent expression of the biomarker under different physiologic or pathologic conditions, (4) a prolonged latency in biomarker change relative to the morphologic effect, (5) the morphologic effect being caused by a mechanism other than the one measured by the biomarker, (6) mishandling of a specimen, or (7) inadequate sampling of a specimen.\n\nHistopathologic sensitivity depends on the histopathologic methods of examination. The use of light microscopy for the initial evaluation of biomarker sensitivity is preferable. Special methods (e.g., electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry) may be useful to investigate whether small or early changes in biomarker levels are associated with histopathologic changes too subtle to be detected by light microscopy with H&E stain.\n--------------------\nContext title: Considerations for Use of Histopathology and Its Associated Methodologies to Support Biomarker Qualification Guidance for Industry'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.3.3.2 Route of Administration\n\nIn general, the expected clinical route of administration should be used when feasible. Regardless of the route of administration, exposure to the parent substance and its major metabolites should be similar to or greater than that achieved in humans when such information is available. Assessment of effects by more than one route may be appropriate if the test substance is intended for clinical use by more than one route of administration (e.g. oral and parenteral), or where there are observed or anticipated significant qualitative and quantitative differences in systemic or local exposure.\n\nDose Levels or Concentrations of Test Substance\n\n2.4.1 In Vivo Studies\n\nSafety pharmacology studies should be designed to define the dose-response relationship of the adverse effect observed. The time course (e.g., onset and duration of response) of the adverse effect should be investigated, when feasible. Generally, the doses eliciting the adverse effect should be compared to the doses eliciting the primary pharmacodynamic effect in the test species or the proposed therapeutic effect in humans, if feasible. It is recognized that there are species differences in pharmacodynamic sensitivity. Therefore, doses should include and exceed the primary pharmacodynamic or therapeutic range. In the absence of an adverse effect on the safety pharmacology parameter(s) evaluated in the study, the highest tested dose should be a dose that produces moderate adverse effects in this or in other studies of similar route and duration. These adverse effects can include dose-limiting pharmacodynamic effects or other toxicity. In practice, some effects in the toxic range (e.g., tremors or fasciculation during ECG recording) may confound the interpretation of the results and may also limit dose levels. Testing of a single group at the limiting dose as described above may be sufficient in the absence of an adverse effect on safety pharmacology endpoints in the test species.\n\n2.4.2 In Vitro Studies\n\nIn vitro studies should be designed to establish a concentration-effect relationship. The range of concentrations used should be selected to increase the likelihood of detecting an effect on the test system. The upper limit of this range may be influenced by physicochemical properties of the test substance and other assay specific factors. In the absence of an effect, the range of concentrations selected should be justified.\n\nDuration of Studies\n\nSafety pharmacology studies are generally performed by single dose administration. When pharmacodynamic effects occur only after a certain duration of treatment, or when results from repeat dose non-clinical studies or results from use in humans give rise to concerns about safety pharmacological effects, the duration of the safety pharmacology studies to address these effects should be rationally based.\n\nStudies on Metabolites, Isomers and Finished Products\n--------------------\nContext title: S7A_Guideline""]","[""The pathology report is the responsibility of the study pathologist and reflects that individual's diagnoses and interpretations.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes FDA\'s compliance policy with regard to a requirement related to product identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. Specifically, this guidance addresses the requirement in section 582(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360eee-1(b)(2)) that manufacturers ""affix or imprint a product identifier2 to each package3 and homogenous case4 of a product5 intended to be introduced in a transaction6 into commerce"" beginning not later than November 27, 2017.7\n\nFootnote 2: Product identifier is defined in section 581(14) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee(14)) as a standardized graphic that includes, in both human-readable formand on a machine-readable datacarrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization, the standardized numerical identifier, lot number, and expiration date of the product.\n\nFootnote 3: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 4: Homogeneous case is defined in section 581(7) of the FD&C Act. The terms “homogeneous” and “homogenous” are used interchangeably throughout the DSCSA. FDA has chosen to use only the term “homogenous” throughout this guidance.\n\nFootnote 5: Product is defined in section 581(13) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 6: Transaction is defined in section 581(24) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 7: See section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe compliance policy set forth in this guidance applies only to the requirement regarding product identifiers described above. In brief, FDA does not intend to take action against manufacturers who do not affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product before November 27, 2018. This represents a one year delay in enforcement of the requirement for manufacturers to affix or imprint product identifiers.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances  means that something  is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe Drug Supply  Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public  Law 113-54)  was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier,  authorized trading partner, and verification  requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors,  repackagers, and dispensers  to facilitate  the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution  supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 is prohibited  under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nAn important  requirement of the product tracing scheme outlined  in the DSCSA is the product identifier.  Section 582 requires that each package and homogenous  case of product in the pharmaceutical distribution  supply chain bear a product identifier  in both a human-readable  form and on a machine-readable  data carrier. The product identifier includes  the product\'s standardized  numerical identifier,8 lot number, and expiration  date. Manufacturers are required  to begin affixing  or imprinting  a product identifier  to each package and homogenous  case of a product intended to be introduced  in a transaction into commerce no later than November 27, 2017. Repackagers are required to do the same no later than November 27, 2018.9\n\nFootnote 8: Standardized numerical identifier is defined in section 581(20) of the FD&C Act as a set of numbers or characters used to uniquely identify each package or homo genus case that is composed of the National Drug Code that corresponds to the specific product (including the particular package configuration) combined with a unique alphanumeric serial number of up to 20 characters.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 582(e)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSince product packaged by a manufacturer during  the one year delay in enforcement of the product identifier requirement is also subject to the policy  set forth in the final guidance Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (grandfathering policy),  trading partners should  read that final  guidance to understand how to treat such product for the purposes of the product identifier  and verification requirements.10\n\nFootnote 10: Final guidance for industry Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?\n--------------------\nContext: This guidance does not address how to link a repackager SNI to a manufacturer SNI, nor does it address standards for prescription drug SNI at levels other than the package-level including, for example, the case- and pallet-levels. Standards for track and trace, authentication, and validation are also not addressed in this guidance because this guidance only addresses the standardized numerical identifier itself and not implementation or application issues.\n\nIII Standardized Numerical Identifiers\n\nWhat should be a package-level SNI for most prescription drugs?\n\nThe SNI for most prescription drug packages should be a serialized National Drug Code (sNDC). The sNDC is composed of the National Drug Code (NDC) (as set forth in 21 CFR Part 207) that corresponds to the specific drug product (including the particular package configuration)4 combined with a unique serial number, generated by the manufacturer or repackager for each individual package. Serial numbers should be numeric (numbers) or alphanumeric (include letters and/or numbers) and should have no more than 20 characters (letters and/or numbers). An example is shown below with a 10-character NDC.\n\nFootnote 4: In the case of repackaged drugs, each package type should have an NDC that corresponds to the repacker or private label distributor for whom the drug is repacked and to the new package configuration.\n\nWhat should be the package-level SNI for certain biological products that do not use NDC numbers?\n\nSome prescription drugs approved under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, such as blood and blood components and certain minimally manipulated human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), do not currently use NDC numbers. Examples of HCT/Ps that do not use NDC numbers include allogeneic placental/umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood progenitor cells, and donor lymphocytes for infusion. Instead, such productscurrently use other recognized standards for identification and labeling, such as ISBT 128, which creates a unique identification number for each product package. See\n\nhttp://iccbba.org/about gettoknowisbt128.html, ""Guidance for Industry: Recognition and Use of a Standard for Uniform Blood and Blood Component Container Labels,""\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/BiopicicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Blood/ucm073362.htm.) The SNI for these products should be the unique identification number created for each package under these other recognized standards, such as ISBT 128.5\n\nFootnote 5: FDA currently also recognizes Codabar as a standard for blood and blood component container labels. We note that ISBT 128 is becoming the more widely-used industry standard.\n\nDoes the SNI include expiration date and/or lot or batch number?\n\nExpiration date and/or lot or batch numbers are not part of the recommended SNI. Expiration date and/or lot or batch numbers are already accessible because FDA regulations require the inclusion of this information on the label of each drug product. (See 21 CFR SSS 201.17, 201.18, 211.130, 211.137, 610.60, and 610.61.) In addition, the SNI can be linked to databases containing this and other information. Addition of this information within the SNI will unnecessarily increase the length of, and introduce complexity into, the SNI. However, if a manufacturer or repackager chooses to include expiration date and/or lot or batch number with the SNI, it should ensure that the resulting number still permits users to distinguish and make use of the SNI. For example, expiration date and lot or batch number may be incorporated in accordance with the GS1 standards for use of Global Trade Item Numbers (GTIN)6 (discussed below in Section F).\n\nWhy did FDA select the serialized NDC for package-level SNI for most prescription drugs?\n\nFDA chose the sNDC as the package-level SNI for most prescription drugs because we believe that it serves the needs of the drug supply chain as a means of identifying individual prescription drug packages,7 which in turn should facilitate authentication and tracking and tracing of those drugs. Most prescription drug product packages already have an NDC on them. By combining a serial number of up to 20 characters with the NDC, the sNDC should be sufficiently robust to support billions of units of marketed products without duplication of an SNI. This approach will allow manufacturers and repackagers to assign serial numbers to combine with the NDC for unique identification of individual product packages. The SNI can also be linked to databases containing such product attributes as lot or batch number, expiration date, distribution/transaction history information, and other identifiers related to a product. As already noted, defining the SNI is expected to be a first step to facilitate the development of other standards and systems for securing the drug supply chain. Many aspects of the implementation of package-level identification will take shape in the future, as the standards that make use of SNI are developed.\n\nFootnote 7: As described above, ISBT-128 and Codabar serve the same function for certain biologics that lack NDCs.\n\nShould the SNI be in human- and machine-readable forms?\n\nFDA believes that an SNI generally should be applied to each package in both human-readable and machine-readable forms. However, at this time, FDA is not specifying the means of incorporating the SNI onto the package. The SNIs described in this guidance are compatible with, and flexible for, encoding into a variety of machine-readable forms of data carriers, such as2-dimensional bar codes and radio-frequency identification (RFID),8 leaving options open as technologies for securing the supply chain continue to be identified, and standards making use of SNI are developed. A redundant human-readable SNI on the package would provide the ability to identify the package when electronic means are unavailable (e.g., in the event of hardware/software failure). Due to the wide-variety of packaging required to accommodate different products and product integrity needs, FDA also is not specifying a location on the package where an SNI should be placed. If the NDC is already printed on the package in human-readable form, then the serial number could be printed in human-readable form in a non-contiguous manner elsewhere on the product package. Any SNI placed on the package must not obstruct FDA-required labeling information9 and should be placed in a manner that allows it to be readily scanned/viewed without damaging the integrity of the packaging or product..\n\nFootnote 8: FDA’s enforcement policy with respect to the application of current good manufacturing practices to RFID technology is provided in Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Section 400.210. See http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074357.htm. This CPG would apply if an SNI were embedded into an RFID tag.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 502(c) of the Act.\n\nF. Is the SNI that FDA is recommending compatible with international standards? In addition to facilitating other actions to secure the drug supply chain, adoption of the sNDC as the SNI for most prescription drugs, and of other recognized standards, such as ISBT 128, for certain biological products, satisfies the requirement in 505D(b)(2) that the SNI developed by FDA be harmonized, to the extent practicable, with internationally recognized standards for such an identifier. Specifically, use of an sNDC is compatible with, and may be presented within, a GTIN, which can be serialized using an Application Identifier (AI) [(21)] to create a serialized GTIN (sGTIN) for use with RFID or for certain barcodes.10 GTIN is a global standard for item and object identification, established by GS1, a consensus-based, not-for-profit, international\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]\n--------------------\nContext title: Standards for Securing the Drug Supply Chain - Standardized Numerical Identification for Prescription Drug Packages Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 10: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(d)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 12: For this guidance, (tradangpartner) is defined as described in section 581(23)(A) of the FD&C Act. Although third-party logistics providers are also considered trading partners under section 581(23)(B) of the FD&C Act, they are not subject to the same product tracing requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nThe Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public Law 113-54) was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier, authorized trading partner, and verification requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers, and dispensersto facilitate the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act is prohibited under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nOne requirement of the verification scheme outlined in the DSCSA is the verification of saleable returned product. Under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act, wholesale distributors must have systems in place that will enable them to verify the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, on each sealed homogeneous case of saleable returned product, or, if such product is not in a sealed homogeneous case, on each package of saleable returned product. A saleable returned product may not be further distributed until the product identifier is verified.13 The product should be handled as suspect product if the product identifier is not successfully verified (i.e., it should be quarantined and investigated).14. 15 FDA published the 2019 Compliance Policy on September 24, 2019, announcing a 1-year delay in enforcement against wholesale distributors who do not verify the product identifier of saleable returned product prior to further distributing such product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 14: See Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs (October 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIn addition, section 582 of the FD&C Act requires certain trading partners (manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers) to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and a transaction statement when engaging in transactions involving certain prescription drugs.16({}^{,})17 A transaction statement must include a statement that the entity transferring ownership in a transaction had systems and processes in place to comply with verification requirements under section 582 of the FD&C Act.18 In the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA acknowledged that wholesale distributors may not have systems in place by November 27, 2019, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, the 2019 Compliance Policy indicated FDA\'s intent to take no enforcement action prior to November 27, 2020, against a wholesale distributor that provided a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor did not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(c)(4)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act details how wholesale distributors must handle suspect product.\n\nFootnote 17: Transaction, transaction history, transaction information, and transaction statement are defined under sections 581(24), (25), (26), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582 also includes requirements for dispensers to verify product identifiers when investigating suspect or illegitimate product. Specifically, section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act provides that, effective November 27, 2020, dispensers must verify ""the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, of at least 3 packages or 10 percent of such suspect product, whichever is greater, or all packages, if there are fewer than 3, corresponds with the product identifier for such product [in the dispenser\'s possession or control]"".19 Section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act requires dispensers to verify product as described in 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act when they have received a notification of illegitimate product from FDA or a trading partner.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIII Compliance Policy for Wholesale Distributor Verification of Saleable Returned Product\n\nAfter publishing the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA has received comments and feedback from wholesale distributors, as well as other trading partners and stakeholders, expressing additional concern with industry-wide readiness for implementation of the verification of saleable returned product requirement for wholesale distributors. Stakeholders have explained that the primary factors FDA considered when issuing the 2019 Compliance Policy still exist: (1) the very large volume of saleable returned products requiring verification; (2) the need to refine and test verification systems during actual production using real-time volumes of saleable returned product rather than simply in pilots; and (3) the complexities of building an interoperable, electronic system with the capabilities to timely and efficiently verify the large volume of saleable returned products amid immature technologies.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some wholesale distributors may still need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, when the delay in enforcement set forth in the 2019 Compliance Policy expires, before they can begin verifying returned products prior to resale or other further distribution as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act in an efficient, secure, and timely manner. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against wholesale distributors who do not verify a product identifier prior to resale or other further distribution of a package or sealed homogenous case of product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAdditionally, FDA recognizes that wholesale distributors may still not have systems in place by November 27, 2020, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, prior to November 27, 2023, FDA does not intend to take action against a wholesale distributor for providing a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor does not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.20\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPolicy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (September 2018), addresses such returns.28_\n\nFootnote 28: For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page.\n\nIV Compliance Policy for the Dispenser Verification Requirements\n\nIn the years since the passage of the DSCSA, FDA has received comments and feedback from dispensers expressing concern with readiness for implementation of certain requirements under section 582(d) of the FD&C Act, including the verification requirements addressed in this compliance policy. Specifically, dispensers have described challenges with implementation of these provisions in the DSCSA due to the time necessary to develop technologies and processes that would support a robust verification system.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some dispensers may need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, before they can begin to verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect and illegitimate products as described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect product as required by section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act. In addition, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify, as required by section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act, the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of product that is the subject of an illegitimate product notification by FDA or a trading partner.\n--------------------\nContext title: Wholesale Distributor Verification Requirement for Saleable Returned Drug Product and Dispenser Verification Requirements When Investigating a Suspect or Illegitimate Product—Compliance Policies'

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?\n--------------------\nContext: IV SCOPE OF GUIDANCE\n\nThis guidance is intended to help manufacturers and repackagers understand and satisfy the requirements of section 582(b)(2) and (e)(2) of the FD&C Act, respectively, to affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product that they intend to introduce in a transaction into commerce. The recommendations in this guidance are intended to assist manufacturers and repackagers in developing standardized formats for the human- and machine-readable information that is contained in the product identifier. The requirements set forth in the DSCSA do not change the linear barcode requirements under 21 CFR 201.25.\n\nV Product Identifiers under the DSCSA\n\nAs noted in Section II of this guidance, a product identifier is defined under section 581(14) of the FD&C Act as a standardized graphic that includes the product\'s standardized numerical identifier (composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number), lot number, and expiration date, in both human- and machine-readable formats. The machine-readable format must be on a data carrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization.10 The product identifier data is specifically required under section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act to be in a ""2-dimensional data matrix barcode"" for packages and in a ""linear or 2-dimensional data matrix barcode"" for homogenous cases, which can be verified using ""human-readable or machine-readable methods.""11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 581(14) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act. As described in section 582(a)(9)(A), FDA may decide in the future to allow the use of other technologies for data instead of, or in addition to, the 2-dimensional data matrix barcode or linear barcode.\n\nUnder section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act, manufacturers are required to ""affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce"" beginning no later than November 27, 2017. Under section 582(e)(2) of the FD&C Act, repackagers are required to ""affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction in commerce"" beginning no later than November 27, 2018. Therefore, each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce must include the NDC, unique serial number, lot number, and expiration date in both human- and machine-readable formats.\n\nVI Compliance Policy for Product Identifier Requirements\n\nIn the guidance titled ""Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Compliance Policy,"" FDA stated that it did not intend to take enforcement action against manufacturers who did not, prior to November 27, 2018, affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction intocommerce as required by section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.12 As the time frame described in this compliance policy has since ended, it no longer represents the Agency\'s thinking in terms of enforcement policy.\n\nFootnote 12: See guidance for industry Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy (September 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance web page at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nVII Products that are subject to the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA\n\nThe product identifier requirements of section 582(b)(2)(A) and (e)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act apply to packages and homogenous cases of product intended to be introduced into commerce via a transaction.13 A ""product"" under section 581(13) of the FD&C Act is a ""prescription drug in finished dosage form for administration to a patient without substantial further manufacturing.""\n\nFootnote 13: There are exemptions to the definition of “transaction” (see section 581(24)(B) of the FD&C Act).\n\nThe following prescription drug products are excluded from the definition of a ""product"" under the DSCSA, and thus are not subject to the product identifier requirements:14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 581(13) of the FD&C Act, defining “product.”\n\nblood or blood components intended for transfusion\n\ncertain radioactive drugs or radioactive biological products15\n\nimaging drugs\n\ncertain intravenous products16\n\nFootnote 15: Radioactive drugs and radioactive biological products excepted from the definition of “product” under the DSCSA are defined in 21 CFR 600.3(ee) and regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or by a state, pursuant to an agreement with such Commission under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2021).\n\nhave noted that the following rule is not applicable to the FD&C Act.\n\nhave noted that the following rule is not applicable to the FD&C Act.\n\ndrug compounds compounded in compliance with sections 503A or 503B of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353a or 353b).\n\nVIII Linear Barcode Requirements Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nConsidering the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA, manufacturers and repackagers have asked FDA whether some of their products are still required under 21 CFR 201.25 to include a linear barcode. The linear barcode requirements were established for different purposes than the DSCSA requirements and apply to additional FDA-regulated products and packaging in some instances, and are still in effect. In the Federal Register of February 26, 2004 (69 FR 9120), FDA published a final rule requiring certain human drug and biological product labels to have a linear barcode that contains, at a minimum, the drug\'s NDC number (SS 201.25).18 Manufacturers, repackers (also known as ""repackagers""), relabelers, and private label distributors of human prescription drug products, biological products, and over-the-counter (OTC) drug products dispensed pursuant to an order and commonly used in hospitals, are subject to the linear barcode requirement. The linear barcode must appear on the drug\'s label as defined by section 201(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(k)). FDA has interpreted that requirement to mean the linear barcode should be on the outside container or wrapper, as well as on the immediate container unless the barcode is readily visible and machine-readable through the outside container or wrapper.19\n\nFootnote 18: See 69 FR 9120 at 9140 (Feb. 26, 2004), https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2004-02-26/pdf/04-4249.pdf.\n\nAs stated in the preamble to the final rule:\n\nBar codes can help reduce or detect potential medication errors by enabling health care professionals to check whether they are giving the right drug via the right dose and right route of administration to the right patient at the right time.20\n\nFootnote 20: Id. at 9120.\n\nThe preamble contemplated that linear barcodes, the use of scanning equipment, and computerized databases would be part of a system that could help reduce the number of medication errors that occur in hospitals and other health care settings.21\n\nFootnote 21: Id. at 9120.\n\nManufacturers, repackers, relabelers, and private label distributors of drug products who are subject to the establishment registration and drug listing requirements in section 510 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360) are responsible for placing the appropriate barcode on the product.22 The following prescription drug products, however, are exempted under SS 201.25 from the linear barcode requirements:\n\nFootnote 22: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products. Private label distributors who do not also manufacture, repack, relabel, or salvage drugs are not required to register under part 207.\n\nFootnote 23: For the purposes of the linear barcode requirements, radiopharmaceuticals are considered “radioactive drugs” or “radioactive biological products”, as defined in 21 CFR 310.3(n) and 21 CFR 600.3(ce), respectively.\n\nFootnote 24: § 201.25(b)(1)(ii).\n\nprescription drug samples\n\nallergenic extracts\n\nintrauterine contraceptive devices regulated as drugs\n\nmedical gases\n\nradiopharmaceuticals23\n\nlow-density polyethylene form fill and seal containers that are not packaged with an overwrap.\n\nFootnote 23: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products. Private label distributors who do not also manufacture, repack, relabel, or salvage drugs are not required to register under part 207.\n\nIn addition, the linear bar code requirement does not apply to prescription drugs that are sold by a manufacturer, repacker, relabeler, or private label distributor directly to patients, unless versions of that same drug are also sold to or used in hospitals.24\n\nIX Questions and Answers\n\nAgency Contacts\n\nWho should be contacted for questions related to barcode requirements for drug packages and homogenous cases under the DSCSA?\n\nFor CDER-regulated products, inquiries should be emailed to:\n\nCDER BarcodeQuestions(@fda.hhs.gov.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 7: The materials of construction used in the labeling are a concern from a packaging perspective if they affect the protection and/or safety of the drug product.\n\nQuality refers to the physical, chemical, microbiological, biological, bioavailability, and stability attributes that a drug product should maintain if it is to be deemed suitable for therapeutic or diagnostic use. In this guidance, the term is also understood to convey the properties of safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity (see 21 CFR 211.94(a)).\n\nAn extraction profile refers to the analysis (usually by chromatographic means) of extracts obtained from a packaging component. A quantitative extraction profile is one in which the amount of each detected substance is determined.\n\nCGMP, CPSC and USP Requirements on Containers and Closures\n\nCurrent good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements for the control of drug product containers and closures are included in 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211. A listing of the relevant sections is provided in Attachment A. In addition, a listing of Compliance Policy Guides that deal with packaging issues is provided in Attachment B. References in this guidance to CGMP regulations are provided for completeness. For additional information, refer to the FDA Compliance Program Guidance Manual for Pre-Approval Inspections/Investigations (7346.832) which describes specific responsibilities for CDER scientists and for field investigators.\n\nThe FDA requirement for tamper-resistant closures is included in 21 CFR 211.132 and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) requirements for child-resistant closures are included in 16 CFR 1700. An outline of these and other applicable regulatory requirements is provided in Attachment A.\n\nThe United States Pharmacopeial Convention has established requirements for containers which are described in many of the drug product monographs in The United States Pharmacopeia/National Formulary (USP/NF). For capsules and tablets, these requirements generally relate to the design characteristics of the container (e.g., tight, well-closed or light-resistant). For injectable products, materials of construction are also addressed (e.g., ""Preserve in single-dose or in multiple-dose containers, preferably of Type I glass, protected from light""). These requirements are defined in the ""General Notices and Requirements"" (Preservation, Packaging, Storage, and Labeling) section of the USP. The requirements for materials of construction are defined in the ""General Chapters"" of the USP (see Attachment A).\n\nAdditional Considerations\n\n1.1.1 Submissions of INDs\n\nThe packaging information in the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls section of an IND usually includes a brief description of the components, the assembled packaging system and any precautions needed to ensure the protection and preservation of the drug substance and drug product during their use in the clinical trials.\n\nFor general guidance regarding the container closure system information to be submitted for phase 1 studies, refer to the FDA guidance for industry Content and Format of investigational New Drug Applications(INDs) for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-derived Products (November 1995).\n\nGeneral guidance regarding the container closure system information to be submitted for phase 2 or phase 3 studies will be provided in the FDA guidance for industry INDs for Phase 2 and 3 Studies of Drugs, Including Specified Therapeutic Biotechnology-Derived Products, Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Content and Format, when finalized (draft guidance published April 21, 1999).\n\n1.2 Submissions on Packaging of a Drug Product by Another Firm\n\nContract Packager\n\nA contract packager is a firm retained by the applicant to package a drug product. The applicant remains responsible for the quality of the drug product during shipping, storage, and packaging.\n\nThe information regarding the container closure system used by a contract packager that should be submitted in the CMC section of an application (NDA, ANDA, or BLA), or in a DMF which is referenced in the application, is no different from that which would be submitted if the applicant performed its own packaging operations. If the information is provided in a DMF, then a copy of the letter of authorization (LOA) for the DMF should be provided in the application (see section V.A).\n\nB. Repackager8\n\nFootnote 8: This discussion does not apply to the repackaging of drug products for dispensing under the practice of pharmacy.\n\nA repackager is a firm that buys drug product from the drug product manufacturer or distributor and repackages it for sale under a label different from that of the manufacturer. The repackager is responsible for ensuring the quality and stability of the repackaged drug prpoduct. The repackaging operation is required to e in compliance with CGMPs (21 CFR Part 211), and there are limits to the expiration period that may be used with the repackaged product unless the repackager conducts stability studies.9 Packaging qualification information is not required if the repackager uses the same container closure system approved in the original application.\n\nAll significant phases of the manufacturing and processing of a drug product (including packaging) should be described as part of the CMC section of an application (NDA, ANDA or BLA), or in a DMF referenced in the application. The only exception is the repackaging of solid oral drug products for which an approved application already exists.10 For biologics, repackaging is considered a step in the manufacturing process for which licensing is required (21 CFR 600.3(u) and 601).\n\nFootnote 9: FDA Compliance Policy Guides, “Expiration Dating of Unit Repackaged Drugs,” 480.200, February 1, 1984, rev. March 1995 (CPG 7132b.11).\n\nFootnote 10: FDA Compliance Policy Guides, “Regulatory Action Regarding Approved New Drugs and Antibiotic Drug Products Subjected to Additional Processing or Other Manipulation,” 446.100, January 18, 1991 (CPG 7132c.06).\n\n3 Qualification and Quality Control of Packaging Components\n\nIntroduction\n\nCDER and CBER approve a container closure system to be used in the packaging of a human drug or biologic as part of the application (NDA, ANDA or BLA) for the drug or biologic. A packaging system found acceptable for one drug product is not automatically assumed to be appropriate for another. Each application should contain enough information to show that each proposed container closure system and its components are suitable for its intended use.\n\nThe type and extent of information that should be provided in an application will depend on the dosage form and the route of administration. For example, the kind of information that should be provided about a packaging system for an injectable dosage form or a drug\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]\n\nIII.G); and Other Dosage Forms (section III.H).\n\nAppendix B General Considerations\n\nSuitability refers to the tests and studies used and accepted for the initial qualification of a component or a container closure system for its intended use. Quality control (QC) refers to the tests typically used and accepted to establish that, after the application is approved, the components and the container closure system continue to possess the characteristics established in the suitability studies. The subsections on associated components and secondary components describe the tests and studies for establishing suitability and quality control for these types of components. However, the ultimate proof of the suitability of the container closure system and the packaging process is established by full shelf life stability studies.\n\n(\\quad) Suitability for the Intended Use Every proposed packaging system should be shown to be suitable for its intended use: it should adequately protect the dosage form; it should be compatible with the dosage form; and it should be composed of materials that are considered safe for use with the dosage form and the route of administration. If the packaging system has a performance feature in addition to containing the product, the assembled container closure system should be shown to function properly.\n\nInformation intended to establish suitability may be generated by the applicant, by the supplier of the material of construction or the component, or by a laboratory under contract to either the applicant or the firm. An adequately detailed description of the tests, methods, acceptance criteria, reference standards, and validation information for the studies should be provided. The information may be submitted directly in the application or indirectly by reference to a DMF. If a DMF is used, a letter authorizing reference (i.e., letter of authorization (LOA)) to the DMF must be included in the application (see section V.A).\n\nGeneral issues concerning protection, compatibility, safety and performance of packaging components and/or systems are discussed below. In this guidance, component functionality and drug delivery will also be addressed in connection with specific dosage forms and routes of administration (see sections III.D, III.E, III.F, III.G, and III.H).\n\n(\\quad) Protection A container closure system should provide the dosage form with adequate protection from factors (e.g., temperature, light) that can cause a degradation in the quality of that dosage form over its shelf life. Common causes of such degradation are: exposure to light, loss of solvent, exposure to reactive gases (e.g., oxygen), absorption of water vapor, and microbial contamination. A drug product can also suffer an unacceptable loss in quality if it is contaminated by filth.\n--------------------\nContext title: Container Closure Systems for Packaging Human Drugs and Biologics Guidance for Industry']","['National Drug Code (NDC)_ is a numeric code under 21 CFR 207.33.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nContents\n\n1 Introduction\n\n2 The FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels: Guidance for Industry\n\n3 The FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels: Guidance for Industry\n\n4 The FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels: Guidance for Industry\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance addresses how conventional food and dietary supplement manufacturers should declare small amounts of nutrients and dietary ingredients on nutrition labels. It specifically explains how FDA intends to consider exercising enforcement discretion when a conflict occurs between compliance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), section 101.9(c), and compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(g) such that compliance with both sections is not possible.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nFDA\'s regulations in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 describe requirements for nutrition labeling in conventional foods and dietary supplements, respectively. The requirements for declaring the nutrient value in a serving of conventional food are in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8). Certain dietary ingredients in dietary supplements are also required to be declared in accordance with these requirements (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)). These dietary ingredients are listed in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2) and are referred to as ""(b)(2)-dietary ingredients."" Unlike nutrients in conventional food, the (b)(2)-dietary ingredients can only be declared when they are present in dietary supplements in amounts that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling according to 21 CFR 101.9(c) (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nFDA\'s regulations under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and (5) describe compliance requirements for declaring nutrients and dietary ingredients2 in nutrition labeling. A conventional food or dietary supplement declaring the amount of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in its labeling is misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)] if:\n\nFootnote 2: See 21 CFR 101.36(f)(1).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber is below 80 percent of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).3 Footnote 3: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of calories, total sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).4 Footnote 4: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).\n\nFor the remainder of this document, we refer to 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) as ""the compliance requirements.""\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nIn many cases, the amount of a nutrient or (b)(2)-dietary ingredient declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) will not conflict with the compliance requirements. However, certain small amounts of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients cannot be declared in accordance with both 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) and the compliance requirements. In these cases, the amount declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) is below or above the level provided by the compliance requirements.\n\nExample 1 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(iv), monounsaturated fat content must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams. Therefore, if the analyzed value of monounsaturated fat is 0.75 to 1.00 grams, the amount of monounsaturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 1.00 gram (or 1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value is 0.80 gram or greater. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value of monounsaturatedfat is 0.75 to 0.79 gram because values in this range are not at least equal to 80 percent of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 1 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are below 80 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are greater than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable excesses of nutrients, such as monounsaturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nExample 2 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i), saturated fat must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams, unless the amount is less than 0.5 gram. Therefore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.50 to 0.74 gram, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 0.50 gram (0.5g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 0.50 to 0.60 gram. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.61 to 0.74 gram because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 0.50 gram.\n\nFurthermore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 1.00 to 1.24 grams, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i) is 1.00 gram (1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.20 grams or less. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.21 to 1.24 grams because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 2 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are above 20 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are less than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable deficiencies of nutrients, such as saturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nFor certain nutrients, such as total fat and its components (including monounsaturated fat and saturated fat), if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the amount must be expressed as zero in nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(c)). Unlike nutrients in conventional food, (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in dietary supplements must not be declared in nutrition labeling when the amount is zero (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nIV FDA\'s Policy\n\nAs discussed, when the analyzed value of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients present in small amounts is declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8), the declared amount may conflict with the compliance requirements. In such cases, we intend to consider the use of our enforcement discretion with respect to the compliance requirements and recommend that manufacturers declare nutrients and (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: The definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n\nThe determination of the amount of added sugars contributed by a powdered fruit or vegetable juice that is added as an ingredient to a product and that is not reconstituted to single strength juice during processing (e.g., that is added to a pureed fruit or to a yogurt) would be the same as the determination of the sugars contributed by a liquid or frozen fruit or vegetable juice concentrate. In our response to question 11, we have suggested that when calculating the added sugars declaration for a product containing concentrated fruit or vegetable juice, the total moisture content of the finished product can be considered to go towards reconstitution of the fruit juice concentrate in the formulation. Thus, the total moisture content of a finished product formulated with powdered fruit or vegetable juice concentrates can be considered to contribute towards the dilution of the powdered fruit or vegetable juice. Further, the sugars contributed by the powdered fruit or vegetable juice that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type must be declared as added sugars on the label, as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule.\n8. Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates? We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12). We require that, when a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)). If you use Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 to calculate the amount of added sugars in a product containing juice concentrate, you must document this information in the records regarding the amount of added sugars added to the food during processing (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). If you use the amount of sugars present in a single strength juice and/or a juice concentrate, that is determined through chemical analysis or other available information, when calculating the amount of added sugars in a product containing fruit juice concentrate, you must document the source of the information and/or the amount of sugars determined through chemical analysis in the records that you make and keep (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). If a diluted juice concentrate slightly exceeds the amount of sugar that would be found in the same volume of the same type of 100 percent fruit juice, manufacturers should document the average and consistency with cGMPs in the records that they make and keep.\n9. Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis? The amount of added sugars declared on the label must be in grams (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The added sugars definition includes sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. For juice, the serving size is based on volume (e.g., 8 oz. or 240 ml) while the amount of added sugars per serving is based on weight. Therefore, when calculating the weight of added sugars per serving, you may need to consider the densities of both the finished juice product and the single strength juice of the same type. You may choose to arrive at the gram amount of added sugars in different ways. Please see our responses to questions 11 and 12 for examples of how to calculate the amount of added sugars in products containing concentrated fruit juices on both a volume and weight basis.\n10. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit or vegetable juice (juice made from a single type of fruit or vegetable) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength juice where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)? In the hypothetical example below, we provide three general steps to calculate the amount of added sugars (in grams) for an apple juice product (240 ml serving size) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength apple juice. The product in this hypothetical example is reconstituted to have juice soluble solids above the minimum Brixrequirement in 21 CFR 101.30 where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9). Therefore, all sugars in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice must be declared as added sugars. The apple juice example here uses the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration. This example is provided solely to demonstrate one method of calculating the added sugars content of the product. You can use alternate methods.\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: 3. Do I need to take into consideration sugars from ingredients that are used in formulating my product when determining the added sugars declaration for a serving of my product?\n\nIngredients containing free mono- and disaccharides that meet our definition of added sugars need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (e.g. sugars from cane sugar and concentrated fruit juice added to sweeten an apple sauce). Manufacturers may need to work with ingredient suppliers to determine the amount of added sugars provided by ingredients used in formulating food products.\n\n4. Do the sugars in dried fruits meet the definition of added sugars?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we responded to comments on dried fruits (see response to comment 212, 81 FR 33742 at 33837). We said that dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them should not be considered to contain added sugars because they are essentially a dehydrated whole fruit and still retain the nutrients and other components of a whole fruit (e.g. diced dried apples). However, if additional sugar is added to a dried fruit, the sugar added to the dried fruit must be declared on the label as added sugars (81 FR 33742 at 33837).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5. Are the sugars used in the production of vinegar added sugars?\n\nIn the production of vinegar, naturally occurring sugars are first fermented into alcohol and then a secondary fermentation occurs in which alcohol is converted to vinegar. For most vinegar products, no sugars remain in the final product. Vinegars that do not contain any sugars in the finished food would not need an added sugars declaration. However, we are aware of some vinegars (e.g., balsamic vinegar) that are made using ingredients that are often used as sweeteners in foods, and that are similar to concentrated fruit juices (e.g., grape must). According to the definition of added sugars, sugars found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type are added sugars. Therefore, fruit juices that are concentrated before or during processing of some vinegars contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars. To the extent that sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are present in the finished product, the added sugars must be declared on the label and in labeling, as required in our Nutrition Facts label final rule. We understand that the manufacturing of vinegar involves several steps, and manufacturers need to consider the impact of these steps (e.g. potential concentration due to water loss when aged in wooden barrels) on the final added sugars declaration.\n\n6. The definition of added sugars excludes the ""fruit component of fruit spreads."" What constitutes the ""fruit component"" of a non-standardized fruit spread?\n\nPlease see our response to question 1 above. The fruit component of a non-standardized fruit spread would include whole fruits, pieces of fruit, dried fruit, fruit or vegetable pures (single strength or concentrated), fruit pulps, single strength juices, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders that are not made from fruit or vegetable juices.\n\n7. Do sugars found in fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the form of the fruit or vegetable (e.g., concentrated fruit and vegetable pures, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders) need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833), we explained that we excluded from the definition of ""added sugars"" whole fruit, fruit pieces, dried fruit, pulps, and pures because they are nutrient rich and maintain the basic properties of a fruit when added to foods and are not considered to contain added sugars (see response to comment 208, 81 FR 33742 at33835). We also explained that sugars from 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, and sugars from certain fruit and vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under certain regulations, fruit juice concentrates used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, and preserves under our standards of identity, and 100 percent juice concentrate sold directly to consumers (e.g. frozen orange juice concentrate) are excluded from the definition of ""added sugars.""\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833 through 33834), we explained that, while foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices can be a part of a healthful diet, the sugars added to the foods by the concentrated fruit or vegetable juice provide additional calories. Over the course of the day, small amounts of calories in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages can add up and make it difficult to balance the amount of calories expended (81 FR 33742 at 33834). For these reasons, we consider foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices to be sugar-sweetened foods (id).\n\nWe also explained that in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report (Ref. 1) (81 FR 33742 at 33835).\n\nWe are applying these same guiding principles when determining when the sugars in an ingredient are added sugars. Concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes, and some fruit and vegetable powders are essentially whole fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the physical form of the fruit or vegetable and to remove moisture. They maintain the basic properties of a whole fruit or vegetable, even if the peel and seeds may be removed. Their composition and use is more consistent with that of whole fruits or vegetables, dried fruits or vegetables, pulps and pureses than that of concentrated fruit juices, which are commonly used by industry in place of sugars. Therefore, the sugars in concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes and some fruit and vegetable powders contribute to the diet the same way that sugars found in whole fruits or vegetables do, and do not have to be declared as added sugars on the label. However, we consider sugars in powders made from fruit and vegetable juices to be the same as those found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices because such powders are essentially concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that have all moisture removed. Therefore, some or all sugars contributed by a powder made from fruit or vegetable juices must be declared as added sugars on the label as required by the Nutrition Facts label final rule, depending on the degree of reconstitution in the finished food.\n\nThe definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: GUIDANCE DOCUMENT\n\nGuidance for Industry: Exemptions from the Warning Label Requirement for Juice\n\nOCTOBER 2002\n\nFinal\n\nDocket Number: FDA-2001-D-0138 (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2001-D-0138). Issued by: (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-exemptions-warning-label-requirement-juice)\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nRecommendations for Effectively Achieving a 5-Log Pathogen Reduction\n\nComments and suggestions regarding this document may be submitted at any time to the\n\nDockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers\n\nLane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. Submit electronic comments to\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/dockets/ecomments. All comments should be identified with the Docket\n\nNumber 01D-0493. For questions regarding this document contact Jennifer A. Burnham,\n\n(240-402-2030). This guidance represents the agency\'s current thinking on reducing microbial food safety hazards in juice. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. This guidance document supercedes ""Warning and Notice Statement: Labeling of Juice Products Small Entity Compliance Guide,"" September 18, 1998.\n\nBackground\n\nIn the Federal Register of July 8, 1998 (63 FR 37030), the Food and Drug Administration\n\n(FDA) published a final rule requiring a warning label on any juice that has not been\n\nprocessed to prevent, reduce, or eliminate pathogenic microorganisms that may be present\n\n(the ""juice labeling rule""). In this guidance document, juice means any juice or juice\n\ningredient in a beverage, as defined by 21 CFR 120.1(a). Under 21 CFR 101.17(g), any juice or\n\njuice ingredient that is not processed to reduce pathogens by 100,000-fold (i.e., attain a 5-log\n\nreduction in the pertinent pathogenic microorganism) must bear a warning label. Becauselabeling may have limited effectiveness (i.e., it must be read and be understood), the warning label was intended to provide a measure of public safety until final Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations for juice could be established and implemented.\n\nIn the Federal Register of January 19, 2001 (66 FR 6138), FDA published a final rule requiring the application of HACCP principles to the processing of any juice or juice ingredient in a beverage (the ""juice HACCP rule""). Juice produced in a retail establishment, i.e., a facility that produces juice that is only sold directly to consumers, is exempt from the HACCP requirements. Like the juice labeling rule, the juice HACCP rule utilizes the standard of a 5-log reduction in the pertinent pathogenic microorganism. Specifically, under $120.24(a), juice processors must establish control measures that will produce such a reduction.\n\nAfter the publication of the juice labeling rule, FDA\'s scientific understanding of how to attain effectively a 5-log pathogen reduction evolved, as discussed in the preamble and as reflected in the requirements of the juice HACCP rule.\n\nPurpose of this Guidance\n\nThe purpose of this guidance document is to provide guidance to those juice processors not yet subject to the juice HACCP rule (e.g., small and very small processors who are not subject to the juice HACCP rule until January 21, 2003 and January 20, 2004, respectively) who are performing a 5-log pathogen reduction to attain exemption from the warning label requirement. This guidance document also provides guidance to processors at retail who are not subject to the juice HACCP rule and who are performing a 5-log pathogen reduction to attain exemption from the warning label requirement. FDA encourages those processors to operate consistently with this guidance in terms of 5-log pathogen reduction treatments because this guidance is based upon FDA\'s current scientific knowledge. In part, this guidance supercedes the previous 5-log pathogen reduction guidance in the juice labeling rule and FDA\'s guidance document, ""Warning and Notice Statement: Labeling of Juice Products Small Entity Compliance Guide"" (the ""small entity compliance guide"") (Ref. 1), because these documents no longer reflect FDA\'s current thinking.\n\nFDA Recommendations\n\nFDA\'s current scientific understanding of how to attain effectively a 5-log pathogen reduction is based on information obtained from public meetings, discussions, comments to the juice HACCP proposed rule (63 FR 20450), and recommendations from the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food (NACMCF) (Refs. 2 and 3). To assist juice processors in attaining a 5-log pathogen reduction consistent with current scientific knowledge, Table 1 compares FDA\'s previous and current recommendations for achieving the 5-log pathogen reduction. The following questions and answers provide additional guidance in terms of FDA\'s current recommendations for the 5-log reduction:Question: When in the process should the 5-log pathogen reduction treatment be applied? Answer: Based upon current scientific understanding, FDA recommends that the 5-log pathogen reduction and final product packaging occur under one firm\'s control, in a single production facility that is operating under current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) and immediately before or immediately after packing. This recommendation is for both citrus and non-citrus juices. Although good agricultural practices (GAPs) and CGMPs at the farming and harvesting stages are encouraged, they should not be counted towards the 5-log pathogen reduction. The basis for this recommendation is discussed in more detail in the juice HACCP rule (66 FR 6138 at 6166). Question: What should be treated? Answer: FDA recommends that juice processors use treatments that directly contact all pathogens that may be present in or on the fruit or vegetables being processed. For most products, this means that the treatments should be performed on the juice after it is expressed. For citrus juices only, effective surface treatment of the citrus fruit may constitute direct contact with all pathogens, and thus, processors may consider counting such treatment toward the 5-log pathogen reduction. If surface treatments are used on citrus fruits to achieve the 5-log pathogen reduction, FDA recommends that the treatment be applied to undamaged, tree-picked fruit (i.e., culled fruit that is U.S. Department of Agriculture choice or higher quality), that has been cleaned. (Note: There is no current USDA standard for choice or higher quality. FDA will consider undamaged tree-picked citrus fruit to meet the definition of ""culled"" for purposes of compliance with the juice HACCP regulation). The basis for this recommendation is discussed in more detail in the juice HACCP rule (66 FR 6138 at 6171).\n\nSummary\n\nSmall and very small processors (as defined in 21 CFR 120.1(b)) who do not treat their juice to achieve the 5-log pathogen reduction should continue to comply with the juice labeling rule. All other juice processors are now required by the juice HACCP regulation (21 CFR Part 120) to apply HACCP principles to their processing operations and to have, in any resulting HACCP plan, measures to achieve a 5-log reduction in pathogens. Based upon FDA\'s current knowledge, processing juice in accordance with the recommendations in the small entity compliance guide for the juice labeling rule may not reduce pathogens to an acceptable level. Therefore, juice processors claiming exemption from the warning label requirement on the basis of the 5-log pathogen reduction provision of 21 CFR 101.17(g)(7) should consider the principles in this guidance. On August 31, 2001, FDA published a guidance document, ""The Juice HACCP Regulation: Questions and Answers"" to provide additional information on the juice HACCP rule, including assistance in achieving a 5-log pathogen reduction. As a follow-up to that document, FDA plans to publish additional information in question and answer format that processors may find useful, as well as additional guidance documents including, ""Guidancefor Industry: Juice HACCP Hazards and Control Guide"" and ""Guidance on Bulk Transport of Juice Concentrates and Certain Shelf Stable Juices.""

Each class or subclass of food is to be given a common or usual name that states, in clear terms, what it is in a way that distinguishes it from different foods. The common or usual name, which may be a coined term, must accurately describe, in as simple and direct terms as possible, the basic nature of the food or its characterizing properties or ingredients; must be uniform among all identical or similar products; and may not be ""confusingly similar to the name of any other food that is not reasonably encompassed within the same name"" (21 CFR 102.5(a)).\n\nSugar cane products exist in many different forms, ranging from raw sugars and syrups to refined sugar and molasses. These products are differentiated by their moisture, molasses, and sucrose content as well as by crystal size and any special treatments (e.g., treatment with sulfur).2 Sugar cane products with common or usual names established by regulation are sugar (21 CFR 101.4(b)(20)) and cane sirup (alternatively spelled ""syrup"") (21 CFR 168.130). Several other sugar cane products have common or usual names established by common usage (e.g., molasses, brown sugar, turbinado sugar, muscovado sugar, and demerara sugar). For purposes of ingredient labeling, ""sugar"" is defined to mean sucrose obtained from sugar cane or sugar beets in accordance with 21 CFR 184.1854, the regulation affirming that sucrose is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in food when used under specified conditions. The GRAS regulation describes sucrose as the substance ""obtained by crystallization from sugar cane or sugar beet juice that has been extracted by pressing or diffusion, then clarified and evaporated"" (21 CFR 184.1854(a)). To be GRAS for use in food, sucrose must be of a purity suitable for its intended use (21 CFR 184.1854(b)).\n\nFootnote 2: Honig, P. Principles of Sugar Technology. Elsevier Publishing Company. 1953.\n\nOn October 7, 2009, FDA published a draft guidance entitled ""Guidance for Industry:\n\nIngredients Declared as Evaporated Cane Juice"" in the Federal Register (74 FR 51610) to advise industry of FDA\'s view that the common or usual name for the solid or dried form of sugar cane syrup is ""dried cane syrup,"" and that sweeteners derived from sugar cane syrup should not be declared on food labels as ""evaporated cane juice"" because that term falsely suggests the sweeteners are juice. On March 5, 2014, we reopened the comment period (79 FR 12507) for the draft guidance seeking further comments, data, and information about how the ingredient sometimes declared as ""evaporated cane juice"" is produced, what its basic nature and characterizing properties are, and how it compares with other sweeteners made from sugar cane. We received numerous comments on the draft guidance. The majority of comments objected to the term ""dried cane syrup."" Several comments from sugar producers asserted that this term does not accurately describe the ingredient they produce, mostly because the standardized food ""cane syrup"" is not the starting material or an intermediate step for the ingredient they refer to as ""evaporated cane juice."" Based on comments stating that the ingredient sometimes declared as evaporated cane juice is not made from cane syrup as defined in 21 CFR 168.130, FDA is no longer recommending that this ingredient be labeled as ""dried cane syrup.""\n\nMany comments described the process used to manufacture the ingredient described as ""evaporated cane juice,"" and some comments also described the manufacturing process for other products derived from sugar cane. The initial processing steps are generally the same for all products produced from sugar cane. After sugar cane is harvested, it is cut or shredded and then crushed to extract the fluid. The extracted fluid is clarified and then evaporated to concentrate the solids. To make the product ""evaporated cane juice,"" the concentrated cane extract is filtered and undergoes a single crystallization process. The crystals are then separated from the molasses using centrifugation. From the comments, the method of filtering the ""evaporated cane juice""\n\nfluid varies from producer to producer, as does the method used for single crystallization.\n\nMost other common types of cane sugar (e.g., white sugar, brown sugar) are not filtered prior to the first crystallization. After the crystals are separated from the molasses using centrifugation, as part of the refining process, the sugar is melted and re-crystallized. Most cane-based sweeteners, including white sugar, undergo multiple crystallization steps.\n\nSome comments stated that ""evaporated cane juice"" has essentially the same composition as white sugar and other sweeteners derived from sugar cane. As support for this point, one comment provided a specification sheet for ""evaporated cane juice"" indicating that the ingredient contains between 99.0 and 99.8% sucrose. The comment also included a specification sheet for another product identified as ""certified organic sugar"" and pointed out that the composition of the two products was identical except that the organic ingredient was made with organic sugar cane. Other comments focused on the differences between ""evaporated cane juice"" and other cane-based sweeteners. For example, some of these comments stated that ""evaporated cane juice"" has a different composition from white sugar because it retains traces of molasses and minerals. A few comments said that ""evaporated cane juice"" is different than other less refined, ""alternative"" sugars because it contains less molasses and can be substituted for white sugar in processed foods without affecting the taste or appearance of the finished product.\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nThis guidance is intended to help consumers make informed choices among sweeteners by promoting accurate and consistent labeling. To that end, we are advising the regulated industry of our view that the term ""evaporated cane juice"" is not the common or usual name of any type of sweetener and that this ingredient should instead be declared on food labels as ""sugar,"" preceded by one or more truthful, non-misleading descriptors if the manufacturer so chooses (e.g., ""cane sugar"").\n\nIn developing this guidance, FDA reviewed the Codex Alimentarius Commission\'s (Codex\'s) Standard for Sugars, Codex Stan. 212-1999 (Ref. 4), which provides standards for certain sugars intended for human consumption without further processing, to determine whether Codex had established a standard for a product similar to that described on some U.S. food labels as ""evaporated cane juice."" The Codex Standard for Sugars contains no product identified as ""evaporated cane juice."" However, the Codex standard does define ""raw cane sugar""3 as ""[p]artially purified sucrose, which is crystallised from partially purified cane juice, without further purification, but which does not preclude centrifugation or drying, and which is characterised by sucrose crystals covered with a film of cane molasses."" This standard appears to describe the same sweetener referred to in many of the comments as ""evaporated cane juice."" We agree that the common or usual name used to describe this ingredient on food labels should include the term ""sugar"" because that term describes the basic nature and characterizing properties of the food.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Ingredients Declared as Evaporated Cane Juice'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: 33742 at 33795.\n\nIn summary, we considered whether a physiological effect-based definition was appropriate for total carbohydrates and determined that it was not because of the wide variety of effects of different types of carbohydrates.\n\nFurthermore, as discussed in the final rule, the information in the Nutrition Facts label is not targeted to individuals with acute or chronic disease (e.g., diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or cardiovascular disease). The nutrient declaration and percent Daily Values on the label are to help consumers make more informed choices to consume a healthy diet and not intended for the clinical management of an existing disease (81 FR 33742 at 33750). Inclusion of allulose in the declaration of ""Total Carbohydrate"" on Nutrition and Supplement Facts label is also consistent with how we have considered the declaration of other substances that are captured under the method that is currently used for the determination of ""Total Carbohydrate"" on the label, including those that provide few or no calories, such as sugar alcohols and dietary fibers.\n\nTherefore, because allulose is a carbohydrate, it is captured under the calculation method for ""Total Carbohydrate"" described in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6), like a number of other substances without significant caloric contribution. We have determined that our existing definition of carbohydrate is the most appropriate and allulose must be included in the amount of ""Total Carbohydrate"" declared on the label under the existing regulations.\n\n3 FDA\'s Consideration of Allulose as a Sugar\n\nTotal Sugars are defined in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(ii) as the sum of all free mono-and disaccharides (such as glucose, fructose, lactose, and sucrose). Allulose is a monosaccharide that is an epimer of D-fructose. In the final rule, we said that consumption of sugars continues to be associated with an increased risk of dental caries; thus, the ""Total Sugars"" declaration continues to be necessary to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices (81 FR 33742 at 33798).\n\nThe 2015 Tate & Lyle citizen petition (Ref. 1) suggested that allulose should not be included in the ""Total Sugars"" declaration because it is not metabolized like a sugar, does not raise blood glucose levels, and inclusion in the ""Total Sugars"" declaration would be confusing to consumers, particularly those who monitor their blood glucose levels. A summary of the evidence related to the cariogenic potential, metabolism, and caloric value of, and glycemic response to, allulose is provided in a memorandum to the file (Ref. 8).\n\nWe have traditionally determined what is captured under the ""Total Sugars"" declaration on the label by chemical structure. Due to advances in food technology, novel sugars are now available that are not metabolized and that do not contribute 4 kcal/g to the diet like other traditional sugars. Consequently, we need to consider how information about sugars like allulose should be captured on the label.\n\nOur current thinking is that, consistent with the goal of section 403(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for the nutrient declarations to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices, we should consider not only the chemical structure of sugars, but also other evidence, including their association with dental caries and how they are metabolized in the body (e.g., caloric contribution and their effect on blood glucose and insulin levels), when determining whether a sugar should be included in the declaration of ""Total Sugars"" on the label.\n\nSugars are known to be associated with an increased risk of dental caries (21 CFR 101.80). Sugars that are metabolized by oral bacteria produce polymers that adhere to the tooth surface (i.e., dental plaque) and generate acids resulting in a decrease in the pH (Ref. 9) of dental plaque. The low pH provides an environment that allows for decalcification of the teeth (e.g., solubilization of calcium from dental enamel), increasing the risk of dental caries (or tooth decay) (Ref. 10). The ""Total Sugars"" declaration provides consumers with information that they can use to evaluate the contribution of sugars in their diet to the risk of dental caries. We therefore believe that evidence related to the association between consumption of a sugar and dental caries is an important consideration when determining whether the amount of a particular sugar in a serving of a product should be excluded from the ""Total Sugars"" declaration on the label.\n\nMono and disaccharides typically provide 4 kcal/g (Ref. 2). If a consumer wishes to determine how many calories are contributed by sugars in their diet, they can multiply the grams of Total Sugars per serving by 4 kcal/g. Current dietary recommendations suggest that Americans should limit their consumption of calories from sugars, and particularly added sugars, and stay within calorie limits (Ref. 11). As a result, manufacturers are substituting sugars that provide much less than 4 kcal/g, such as allulose, for sugars that provide 4 kcal/g in an effort to reduce caloric content. Including sugars that contribute much less than 4 kcal/g to the diet in the ""Total Sugars"" declaration would not accurately reflect the caloric contribution to the diet of sugars like allulose that contain much less than 4 kcal/g. Therefore, we consider the caloric contribution of a sugar to be an important consideration when determining if the sugar should be excluded from the amount of the ""Total Sugars"" declaration.\n\nDuring digestion, disaccharides are hydrolyzed into two monosaccharide units in the upper small intestine. Primarily, the body breaks sugars down into glucose, which is used as energy by cells in the body or stored as glycogen (Ref. 12). Consuming sugar increases circulating glucose in the blood stream. The presence of glucose in the blood triggers the release of the hormone insulin from the pancreas. Insulin stimulates the uptake of glucose by muscle and adipose tissue. Therefore, when traditional sugars like glucose, fructose, lactose, and sucrose are consumed, there is a rise in blood glucose and insulin levels (Ref. 12). The ""Total Sugars"" declaration provides consumers with information that they can use to determine whether a product contains sugars that are likely to cause an increase in circulating blood glucose and insulin levels. Some consumers expect that when they eat sugars, the result will be an increase in blood glucose and insulin levels. Therefore, we consider a sugar\'s effect on blood glucose and insulin levels to be important considerations when determining whether a sugar should be excluded from the ""Total Sugars"" declaration.\n\nAllulose, like other non-cariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners listed in 21 CFR 101.80(c)(2)(ii), does not result in a decrease in dental plaque pH below 5.7, which is associated with decalcification of the dental enamel (Ref. 10). Therefore, given the low variogenic potential of allulose, we conclude that allulose does not promote dental caries. Furthermore, based on our review of the evidence, we conclude that allulose, once ingested, is rapidly absorbed (within 1 hour) and cleared from plasma in 24 hours, and 70% of orally consumed allulose is eliminatedintact in urine and feces within 48 hours (Ref. [8]).7 Allulose produces only a negligible increase in glycemic and insulinemic responses and is not readily fermented in the large intestine, providing no more than 0.4 kcal/g (Ref. [8]). Based on the totality of the available evidence from which scientific conclusions can be drawn, allulose does not promote dental caries and is virtually unmetabolized in the human body (Ref. [8]).\n\nFootnote 7: In this mass-balance study, 70.4% of the ({}^{14})C radiotracer orally administered to seven subjects was eliminated as intact allulose in urine and feces, while 1.5 % was identified as glucose and fructose, 11.7% were not identified (unknown), and the remaining radioactivity was lost during the process (Ref. [8]).\n\nAs previously discussed, allulose does not result in a decrease in the dental plaque pH below 5.7, at which decalcification of dental enamel may begin, and thus, does not promote dental caries. It provides much less than 4 kcal/g. Additionally, the consumption of allulose produces only a negligible increase in glycemic and insulinemic responses. Therefore, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the exclusion of allulose from the amount of ""Total Sugars"" declared on the label pending future rulemaking regarding amending the definition of ""Total Sugars.""\n\nFinally, we note that allulose must be declared in the ingredient statement in accordance with 21 CFR 101.4 if it is present in a product so that consumers can determine when it is an ingredient in a food.\n\n4 FDA\'s Consideration of Allulose as an Added Sugar\n\nAdded sugars are sugars that are either added during the processing of foods, or are packaged as such, and include sugars (free, mono- and disaccharides), sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type.\n\nAs previously discussed, we did not decide whether allulose should be excluded from the amount of ""Added Sugars"" declared on the label in the final rule and stated that allulose must be included in the declaration of ""Added Sugars"" pending any future rulemaking regarding excluding allulose from the declaration.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- The Declaration of Allulose and Calories from Allulose on Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels']",['Step 4: Compare this sugar concentration of juice ingredient with that of the theoretical single strength juice of the same type.'],0.0,0.0

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA\n\nor the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the\n\napplicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff\n\nresponsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes FDA\'s interpretation of the provision of the Biologic\'s Price Competition\n\nand Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) under which an application for a biological product\n\napproved under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21\n\nU.S.C. 355) as of March 23, 2020, will be deemed to be a license for the biological product\n\nunder section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262) on March 23, 2020. Specifically, this guidance describes FDA\'s interpretation of the ""deemed to be a license""\n\nprovision in section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act for biological products that are approved under\n\nsection 505 of the FD&C Act as of March 23, 2020 (the transition date). This guidance also\n\nprovides recommendations to sponsors of proposed protein products intended for submission in\n\nan application that may not receive final approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or\n\nbefore March 23, 2020, to facilitate alignment of product development plans with FDA\'s\n\ninterpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.\n\nAlthough the majority of therapeutic biological products have been licensed under section 351 of\n\nthe PHS Act, some protein products historically have been approved under section 505 of the\n\nFD&C Act (see the Appendix to this guidance for examples of such products). On March 23,\n\n2010, the BPCI Act was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n\n(Public Law 111-148). The BPCI Act clarified the statutory authority under which certain\n\nprotein products will be regulated by amending the definition of a ""biological product""2 in\n\nsection 351(i) of the PHS Act to include a ""protein (except any chemically synthesizedpolypeptide),""3 and describing procedures for submission of a marketing application for certain biological products.\n\nFootnote 3: FDA has described its interpretation of the statutory terms “protein” and “chemically synthesized polypeptide” in the amended definition of “biological product” in guidance. See draft guidance for industry New and Revised Draft Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act (Revision 2). When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic. FDA’s guidances for industry are available on the FDA Drugs guidance web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs web guidance page. In addition, in the Federal Register of December 12, 2018, FDA also has issued a proposed rule to amend its regulation that defines “biological product” to incorporate changes made by the BPCI Act, and to provide its interpretation of the statutory terms “protein” and “chemically synthesized polypeptide.” When final, this regulation will codify FDA’s interpretation of these terms.\n\nThe BPCI Act requires that a marketing application for a ""biological product"" (that previously could have been submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act) must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act; this requirement is subject to certain exceptions during a 10-year transition period ending on March 23, 2020 (see section 7002(e)(1)-(3) and (e)(5) of the BPCI Act and section II of this guidance). On March 23, 2020 (i.e., the transition date), an approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act (see section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act). This guidance sets forth FDA\'s current interpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nBPCI Act\n\nThe BPCI Act amended the PHS Act and other statutes to create an abbreviated licensure pathway in section 351(k) of the PHS Act for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product (see sections 7001 through 7003 of the BPCI Act). The objectives of the BPCI Act are conceptually similar to those of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417) (commonly referred to as the ""Hatch-Waxman Amendments""), which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of drug products under section 505(b)(2) and 505(j) of the FD&C Act. An abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products can present challenges given the scientific and technical complexities that may be associated with the generally larger and typically more complex structure of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured. Most biological products are produced in a living system such as a microorganism, or plant or animal cells, whereas small molecule drugs are typically manufactured through chemical synthesis.\n\nSection 351(k) of the PHS Act, added by the BPCI Act, sets forth, among other things, the requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product and an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product. Section 351(i) defines ""biosimilarity"" to mean that ""the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components"" and that ""there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product"" (section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act). A 351(k) application must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based upon data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies, unless FDA determines, in its discretion, that certain studies are unnecessary in a 351(k) application (see section 351(k)(2) of the PHS Act). To meet the standard for ""interchangeability,"" an applicant must provide sufficient information to demonstrate biosimilarity, and also to demonstrate that the biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, if the biological product is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch (see section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act). Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nThe BPCI Act also includes, among other provisions:\n\nA 12-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which approval of a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be made effective (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nA 4-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be submitted (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA\'s list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: Accordingly, an original 505(b)(2) application (including a resubmission) for a biological product that relies, at least in part, on FDA\'s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug that is a biological product will receive a complete response if the application is pending at the end of the day (11:59 pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) on Friday, March 20, 2020, because the NDA for the listed drug relied upon will no longer exist at midnight on Monday, March 23, 2020.\n\nFDA intends to assist applicants who may be affected by section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act, where feasible and appropriate. For example, during the review of a BLA submitted after the transition date under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act for a proposed biological product that was previously submitted, but not approved, in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act, FDA intends to consider any previously conducted scientific review by the Agency of such previous application under the FD&C Act, to the extent that such review is relevant to, and consistent with, applicable requirements of section 351 of the PHS Act.\n\nAn application generally includes all amendments and supplements to the application.13 We recognize that there may be one or more supplements submitted to an approved NDA for a biological product before March 23, 2020, that is pending on March 23, 2020. Such supplements may include a prior approval supplement (e.g., an efficacy supplement,14 a labeling supplement,\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \\hline Date/Time & Relevant Application Type & Event \\ \\hline Friday, March 20, 2020, 11:59 pm (EDT) & Pending 505(b)(2) applications that rely, at least in part, on FDA’s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug that is a biological product & Deadline for any pending 505(b)(2) application of this type to be approved under the FD\\&C Act. \\ \\hline Monday, March 23, 2020, 12:00 am (EDT) & Approved NDAs for biological products & Approved NDAs for biological products are deemed to be BLAs, and cease to exist as NDAs. \\ \\hline Monday, March 23, 2020, 12:01 am (EDT) & 351(k) BLA that relies on a deemed BLA for its reference product & A 351(k) BLA can be submitted for a proposed biosimilar or a proposed interchangeable to a biological reference product that is the subject of a deemed BLA. \\ \\hline Monday, March 23, 2020, 11:59 pm (EDT) & Approved NDAs for biological products & FDA intends to send a letter to each holder of an approved NDA for a biological product that advises that the approved NDA has been deemed to be a BLA by operation of the statute, and no longer exists as an NDA.

For example, a pending ""stand-alone"" efficacy supplement to a ""stand-alone"" NDA16 (e.g., a supplement intended to address a post-approval requirement or post-approval commitment) will be administratively converted to a pending efficacy supplement to the corresponding deemed 351(a) BLA on the transition date and reviewed under applicable standards for 351(a) BLAs. Similarly, a pending CBE supplement to an application submitted under the FD&C Act will be administratively converted to a pending CBE supplement to the deemed BLA on the transition date, irrespective of whether the change described in the CBE supplement has been implemented before or after the transition date. The Agency also intends to maintain the same goal date, where applicable, for completion of its review of such supplements.\n\nFootnote 15: See generally 21 CFR 314.70.\n\nFootnote 16: See section III.B.1 of this guidance for information on “stand-alone” NDAs. There may be additional considerations for a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a stand-alone NDA and a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a 505(b)(2) application.\n\nii.2.2 Removal of Biological Products from the Orange Book on March 23, 2020\n\nFDA intends to remove biological products that have been approved in NDAs from FDA\'s Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book)17 on March 23, 2020, based on the Agency\'s position that these products are no longer ""listed drugs"" and such NDAs may not be relied upon by a 505(b)(2) applicant (or ANDA applicant) for approval. After March 23, 2020, FDA will not approve any NDA (or ANDA), including those that are pending or tentatively approved, for a biological product.\n\nFootnote 17: Biological products approved in NDAs that are deemed to be BLAs will be listed in FDA’s Lists of Licensed Biological Products with Reference Product Exclusivity and Biosimilarity or Interchangeability Evaluations (the Purple Book) on or shortly after the March 23, 2020, transition date.\n\nMoreover, with the exception of orphan drug exclusivity and pediatric exclusivity, the exclusivity provisions of the FD&C Act serve to limit the submission or approval of applications under section 505 of the FD&C Act, but not under section 351 of the PHS Act. Section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act provides that no applications for biological products may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act after the transition date. Accordingly, on March 23, 2020, any unexpired period of exclusivity associated with an approved NDA for a biological product subject to section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act (e.g., 5-year exclusivity or 3-year exclusivity) would\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]\n\ndeemed to be licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. Reference product exclusivity recognizes the fact that the sponsor of an eligible reference product generated (and submitted for review) the data and information required to obtain a license under section 351(a) of the PHS Act and limits competition from biosimilar and interchangeable products for a limited period of time. The biological products that will be deemed to have BLAs on the transition date, however, have already obtained marketing approval under a different statutory authority. Allowing such products to obtain a separate 12-year period of reference product exclusivity would inappropriately impede biosimilar or interchangeable product competition in several product classes.\n\nRecognizing these principles, FDA interprets section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act together with section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act such that section 351(k)(7)(A)-(B) of the PHS Act applies only to products that have undergone review and licensing under section 351(a), and not to biological products that will be deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act on the transition date. At the same time, FDA interprets the limitations on eligibility for reference product exclusivity in section 351(k)(7)(C) of the PHS Act to apply to any ""reference product,"" without regard to whether such product was ""first licensed under subsection (a)"" or instead deemed to be a license under section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act. Nothing in the BPCI Act suggests that Congress intended holders of deemed BLAs to be able to circumvent the statutory limitations on eligibility for a 12-year period of reference product exclusivity through subsequent submissions simply because the previous reference product was deemed to be licensed under section 7002(e). Therefore, FDA interprets section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act together with section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act such that section 351(k)(7)(C) will operate to bar supplements to deemed BLAs and, where applicable, subsequent BLAs from being eligible for their own periods of reference product exclusivity.\n\nRecommendations for Sponsors of Proposed Protein Products Intended for Submission in an Application Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act\n\nSponsors of development programs for proposed protein products should evaluate whether a planned submission under section 505 of the FD&C Act would allow adequate time for approval of the application prior to March 23, 2020, considering, among other things, whether the submission may require a second cycle of review and, for certain types of applications, whether unexpired patents or exclusivity may delay final approval. FDA\'s recommendations for sponsors are based on whether a ""stand-alone"" or abbreviated development program is planned.\n\n1.1 ""Stand-Alone"" New Drug Applications\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry'

FDA\'s recommendations for sponsors are based on whether a ""stand-alone"" or abbreviated development program is planned.\n\n1.1 ""Stand-Alone"" New Drug Applications\n\nAn application submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act (i.e., a ""stand-alone"" NDA) contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness that were conducted by or for the applicant or for which the applicant has a right of reference or use. Sponsors of a proposed protein product intended for submission in an NDA under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act should consider submitting a BLA under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. A 351(a) BLA for a biological product can be submitted before, on, or after March 23, 2020. Sponsors can contact the relevant review division within the Office of New Drugs in FDA\'s CDER with any questions about a BLA submission.19\n\nFootnote 19: FDA has taken measures to minimize differences in the review and approval of products required to have approved BLAs under section 351 of the PHS Act and products required to have approved NDAs under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act (see section 123(f) of FDAMA). However, certain differences continue to exist. For additional information on how FDA intends to address these issues, see the Transition Q&A Draft Guidance or contact the relevant review division. When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\n2.2.2 505(b)(2) Applications\n\nA 505(b)(2) application is an NDA that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use (e.g., FDA\'s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug or published literature). A 505(b)(2) application that seeks to rely on a listed drug must contain adequate data and information to demonstrate that the proposed product is sufficiently similar to the listed drug to justify reliance, in part, on FDA\'s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for the listed drug. Any aspects of the proposed product that differ from the listed drug must be supported by adequate data and information to support the safety and effectiveness of the proposed product.\n\nCongress did not provide an approval pathway under the PHS Act that directly corresponds to section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act. Accordingly, there are additional considerations for sponsors of proposed protein products intended for submission in a 505(b)(2) application or a 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement, and sponsors may contact the relevant review division with any questions. If a sponsor anticipates that a planned 505(b)(2) application or 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement may not receive final approval before the transition date (e.g., due to the need for a second cycle of review, applicable unexpired exclusivity or listed patents, or a stay of approval due to patent infringement litigation), the sponsor should consider the following options:\n\nModifying the development program to support submission of an application or efficacy supplement under section 351(a) of the PHS Act (i.e., a ""stand-alone"" BLA) before or after March 23, 2020. This may involve, for example, obtaining a right of reference from the application holder for the listed drug on which the proposed 505(b)(2) application or 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement would have relied or conducting studies with the proposed product to provide the scientific data that otherwise would have been relied upon to support approval of the application or the change proposed in the supplement, as applicable.20 Footnote 20: FDA has issued guidance for industry on Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency Drug Products – Submitting NDAs and is considering how the concepts described in the guidance would apply to proposed pancreatic enzyme products submitted under the PHS Act.\n\nModifying the development program to support submission of a 351(k) BLA for a proposed biosimilar product or a proposed interchangeable product at such time as there is a biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act that could be a reference product.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSponsors evaluating whether a proposed product could be submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act should consider whether they would be able to provide information demonstrating that, among other things, the proposed product:\n\nIs ""highly similar"" to a single reference product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act, and that there are ""no clinically meaningful differences"" between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency;\n\nHas the same route of administration, dosage form, and strength as the reference product;\n\nUtilizes the same mechanism(s) of action as the reference product for the proposed condition(s) of use (but only to the extent that the mechanism(s) of action are known); and\n\nSeeks licensure for a condition(s) of use (e.g., indication, dosing regimen) previously approved for the reference product.21\n\nFootnote 21: See section 351(k) of the PHS Act; see also, generally, FDA’s guidance documents on biosimilar products.\n\nA sponsor of a proposed biological product that could meet the requirements for a proposed biosimilar and other applicable requirements would be able to submit a 351(k) BLA that cites the listed drug as its reference product after the NDA for the listed drug is deemed to be a BLA (or after another product that could be a reference product for the proposed product is licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act). Sponsors that intend to adapt their development programs to meet the requirements for a submission under section 351(k) of the PHS Act can request meetings with FDA, including a Biosimilar Biological Product Development (BPD) Type 3 meeting, before March 23, 2020, to support the development and review of a proposed biosimilar product or a proposed interchangeable product. Such meetings may be based on relevant comparative data with a listed drug that is the ""intended reference product"" (i.e., the listed drug that is intended to be the reference product after the NDA for such drug is deemed to be licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act).\n\nProposed products that are intended to differ in certain respects (e.g., different dosage forms, routes of administration, strengths, or conditions of use) from a previously approved product likely would need to be submitted under section 351(a) of the PHS Act and meet applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for a 351(a) BLA. Such products likely would be unable to use the 351(k) pathway to abbreviate their development program due to lack of a reference product or the inability to meet the statutory requirements for a proposed biosimilar product.\n\nA sponsor may contact the relevant review division within the Office of New Drugs in FDA\'s CDER to request advice on a product-specific basis regarding the development of a protein product intended for submission in an application under the FD&C Act (during the transitionperiod described in section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act) or under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act, as appropriate.22\n\nFootnote 22: For information on requesting a formal meeting regarding the development of a proposed biosimilar product intended for submission under section 351(k) of the PHS Act, see FDA’s draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of BsUFA Products. For information on requesting a formal meeting regarding the development of a biological product intended for submission in an NDA before March 23, 2020, or in a 351(a) BLA, see FDA’s draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA\'s list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 49: See the draft guidance for industry Comparative Analyses and Related Comparative Use Human Factors Studies for a Drug-Device Combination Product Submitted in an ANDA (January 2017). When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nAs a general matter, in assessing the therapeutic equivalence of a proposed generic drug-device combination product, FDA intends to consider whether the proposed generic product can be expected to have the same clinical effect and safety profile as the RLD when administered to patients under the conditions specified in the labeling.50 While FDA does not expect the proposed generic combination product and its RLD to be identical in all respects, any differences identified between a proposed generic combination product and its RLD should be adequately analyzed, scientifically justified, and otherwise not preclude approval under an ANDA. The extent to which differences between the proposed generic combination product and the RLD affect the approximability of the ANDA product will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nFootnote 50: See 21 CFR 314.3. See also the Orange Book, preface to the 41({}^{\\text{a}}) edition, at page vii.\n\nAppendix C Biologic-Led Combination Products\n\nBiologic-led combination products are licensed through one of the two BLA pathways under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), either under a section 351(a) BLA (i.e.,a stand-alone BLA) or under a section 351(k) BLA for a biosimilar or interchangeable biological product.51\n\nFootnote 52: Section 351(a)(2)(C) of the PHS Act.\n\n3.2.1 Biologics License Applications (BLAs) Submitted Under Section 351(a)\n\nTo be licensed, a biological product must be shown to be safe, pure, and potent, and the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed, or held must meet standards designed to ensure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure, and potent.52 A BLA submitted under section 351(a) of the PHS Act is a stand-alone application in that all of the information and data necessary to demonstrate that these requirements are met are included in the application. This pathway is generally appropriate for biologic-led combination products other than products that are proposed to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, a previously licensed biological product.53\n\nFootnote 52: See footnote 17.\n\nFor example, this pathway would be appropriate for the following products when the sponsor is not seeking to rely on FDA\'s license of another biological product in order to demonstrate biosimilarity to, or interchangeability with, such product:\n\na gene therapy combined with a specialized delivery catheter\n\na vaccine in a pre-filled syringe\n\na protein product in an autoinjector\n\n_BLAs for Biosimilar and Interchangeable Biological Products Submitted Under Section 351(k)_Section 351(k) of the PHS Act sets forth the requirements for the licensure of biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product.54 Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act defines biosimilarity to mean that the product ""is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components"" and that ""there are no clinically meaningful differences"" between the two products with respect to safety, purity, and potency. To meet the interchangeability standard, an applicant must show that its product ""is biosimilar to the reference product,"" and must further show that the product ""can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient"" and that, for a product that is administered more than once to an individual, ""the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the [two products] is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.""55 Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing healthcare provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nFDA has published guidance indicating the availability of this abbreviated pathway for combination products, as well as considerations related to demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability of such products. With respect to demonstrating biosimilarity, Q.I.4 of the guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act (Biosimilars Q&A Guidance) states that some design differences in the delivery device used with the proposed biosimilar product may be permissible, and explains that it may be possible to obtain licensure of a proposed biosimilar product in a pre-filled syringe or auto-injector, for example, even though the reference product is a biological product licensed in a vial presentation, provided that the proposed biosimilar product meets the statutory standard for biosimilarity.\n\nThe Biosimilars Q&A Guidance also explains that licensure under section 351(k) would not be possible if design difference in a delivery device results in any of the following:\n\nA clinically meaningful difference between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency;\n\nA different route of administration;\n\nA condition of use (e.g., indication, dosing regimen) for which the reference product has not been previously approved; or\n\nA proposed biosimilar product that otherwise does not meet the standard for biosimilarity.\n\nSee Biosimilars Q&A Guidance for considerations for seeking licensure of a combination product as biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, a reference product.\n\nAnnex\n\nAnalysis of Pathway Availability for Device-Led Combination Products - Illustrative Examples\n\nTo date, questions regarding pathway availability for combination products have focused most often on device-led combination products. Accordingly, we have included this annex to address common questions utilizing the analyses discussed in section IV.1. The outcomes are also consistent with the expectations discussed in section III, that the application enable evaluation substantially similar to that which would occur if the constituent parts were reviewed under separate applications for the use.\n\nThese hypothetical examples are not intended to reflect a complete analysis of the premarket review considerations that need to be addressed for the types of products discussed in the examples or other types of combination products. In addition, specific products may raise distinct issues that are not taken into account in the examples below. If manufacturers have specific questions relating to their particular products, the Agency recommends that they contact the lead center for the product or OCP, as needed, for assistance.\n\nFor the purposes of the illustrative examples below, it is assumed that the sponsor submitted a 510(k) to CDRH for the combination product.\n\nExample 1: Antimicrobial coating added for the first time to a previously classified device type\n\nPredicate Product:\n\nA previously classified hypothetical class II device (product has no drug or biological product constituent part), which is subject to 510(k) requirements (e.g., an externally-communicating device intended to be implanted in the abdominal cavity for drainage of excessive fluids).\n\nDrug Constituent Part:\n\nA hypothetical antimicrobial coating (Antimicrobial A) that contains the same active ingredient that is in an NDA drug product approved for intravenous administration that has a well-established and understood risk profile as an antimicrobial indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. The sponsor has provided FDA documentation of a right of reference to the NDA.56\n\nFootnote 56: Alternatively, the sponsor could rely on FDA’s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for the NDA approved antimicrobial product, provided all of the requirements of 503(g)(5)(A) and (C) are satisfied and it is scientifically justified. FDA may then consider such findings in its review of a device premarket submission.\n\nNew Product:\n\nThe sponsor proposes to add an antimicrobial coating (Antimicrobial A) to the predicate product described above, making a single-entity combination product (hereinafter referred to as Product A). The purpose of adding the antimicrobial to this device is to prevent infections associated with the surgical procedure and continued use of the product. The sponsor requests the product be considered substantially equivalent to the previously cleared uncoated version of the device. An antimicrobial drug product has never been combined with this devicetype. To make a substantial equivalence determination, the following questions are generally asked:\n\nIs the predicate product legally marketed? Yes.\n\nDoes the predicate product have the same intended use? While both the predicate and the new combination product are intended to drain excessive fluid from the abdominal cavity, the addition of the proposed drug constituent part and the indication of preventing infection are not applicable to the predicate product. These changes raise different questions of safety and effectiveness, precluding a meaningful comparison with the predicate product.57 Therefore, these changes in indications for use of the product and of adding the constituent part would result in a new intended use, and the product would be found not substantially equivalent (NSE). Also, the addition of Antimicrobial A is a different technological characteristic that would raise different questions of safety and effectiveness.\n\nFootnote 57: See 21 CFR 807.92(a)(5) and the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications [510(k)].\n--------------------\nContext title: Principles of Premarket Pathways for Combination Products Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA\'s list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: BLAs\n\nEach manufacturer must submit a separate BLA describing the manufacturing facilities and operations applicable to the preparation of that manufacturer\'s biological substance or product (21 CFR 601.2(a)). Each BLA must meet the requirements of 21 CFR 601.2 and fully describe:\n\nthe extent of manufacturing and testing performed by that participating manufacturer;\n\nthe specifications;\n\nthe storage and shipping conditions;\n\nthe manufacturing methods;\n\nstability data;\n\nproduct lots available for examination; and\n\nthe labeling that will accompany that manufacturer\'s product.\n\nWe recommend that all license applications/supplements that pertain to a particular product to be manufactured under a shared manufacturing arrangement be submitted concurrently (i.e., on the same date) so that we can conduct a complete review of the product, since we will depend on information contained in all related applications when determining whether to issue the biologics license.\n\nLack of one or more related applications may be a basis for a refusal to file action (Ref. 6).\n\nPlease consult the appropriate guidance document regarding submission of chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information for technical guidance on the content and format of a license application (Refs. 7-13).\n\na. Intermediate products\n\nA common shared manufacturing agreement is one in which one manufacturer is responsible for an intermediate product and another for the final product. An application/supplement for an intermediate product licensed ""for further manufacturing use"" must include, in addition to other information in a BLA, the criteria used to determine lot-by-lot acceptability of the product (21 CFR 601.2), including:* sterility (or bioburden);\n* stability;\n* product characterization;\n* potency; and\n* purity specifications.\n\nManufacturers of all intermediate products must demonstrate that their products will consistently meet established specifications (21 CFR 601.2).\n\nWe intend to accept only those BLAs/supplements for biological products intended for further manufacture in a shared manufacturing arrangement that specify the licensed manufacturer or manufacturers to which the intermediate product will be shipped. These BLAs/supplements will be approved only after demonstration of safety and efficacy of the final product.\n\nFinal product\n\nWe will accept only those BLAs/supplements for final products in a shared manufacturing arrangement that specify the source(s) of the intermediate product(s) to be used. The approval of the final product will be dependent upon established criteria for receipt and acceptance of the intermediate(s).\n\nWe expect the manufacturer that prepares (or is responsible for the preparation of) the product in final form for commercial distribution to assume primary responsibility for providing data demonstrating the safety, purity, and potency of the final product. We also expect the licensed finished product manufacturer to be primarily responsible for any postapproval obligations, such as postmarketing clinical trials, additional product stability studies, complaint handling, recalls, postmarket reporting of the dissemination of advertising and promotional labeling materials as required under 21 CFR 601.12(f)(4) and adverse experience reporting. We recommend that the final product manufacturer establish a procedure with other participating manufacturer(s) to obtain information in these areas.\n\nResponsibilities of Each Participating Manufacturer\n\nEach licensed manufacturer in a shared manufacturing arrangement must notify the appropriate FDA center regarding proposed changes in the manufacture, testing, or specifications of its product (21 CFR 601.12; see Refs. 3, 4 and 5); and should notify other participating licensed manufacturer(s) of such proposed change.\n\nWe expect license manufacturers to have the technical knowledge and expertise needed to identify manufacturing problems or deviations and take responsibility for conducting preventive and/or corrective action to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the product (21 CFR 211.25).\n\nAll manufacturers participating in a shared manufacturing arrangement must also comply with the recordkeeping requirements of 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211, and the other applicable CGMP regulations.\n\nEach manufacturer in a shared manufacturing arrangement who holds a biological product license is responsible for reporting biological product deviations that occurred when the product was in its control (21 CFR 600.14).\n\nLabeling\n\nThe labeling for products prepared in a shared manufacturing arrangement must comply with applicable provisions of 21 CFR 610.60 through 610.67, including identification of all participating licensed manufacturers.\n\nFDA interprets 21 CFR 610.63 for divided manufacturing arrangements to apply to products manufactured by more than one licensed manufacturer, including shared manufacturing arrangements. In such cases, the package label provisions of that section may be met by placing the name, address, and license number of the final product manufacturer and the manufacturer responsible for reporting adverse events on the outer label affixed to the package, and by placing the names, addresses, and license numbers of manufacturers participating in the shared manufacturing arrangement in the product package insert. The end user may then identify contributing manufacturing firms more efficiently.\n\nSince a licensed intermediate product will be approved for further manufacturing use, we recommend that the phrase, ""for further manufacturing use"" be included as part of the proper name. If included as part of the proper name, the phrase must appear on the label affixed to each package containing the product (21 CFR 610.61), as well as the container label, if capable of bearing a full label (21 CFR 610.60).\n\nB. Contract Manufacturing Arrangements\n\nFor the purposes of this document, contract manufacturing refers to a situation in which a license manufacturer establishes a contract with another entity(ies) to perform some or all of the manufacture of a product as a service to the license manufacturer. This includes,for example, required infectious disease testing of blood and blood components conducted by licensed blood establishments for another manufacturer.\n\nA contract facility that is engaged in significant manufacturing is not required to be separately licensed, as is the case in a Shared Manufacturing Arrangement.\n\nResponsibilities of License Manufacturer\n\nA license manufacturer that establishes a contract with another entity to perform some or all of the manufacture of a product is responsible for:\n\nthe safety, purity, and potency of the product (PHS Act; 21 CFR Parts 600 through 680);\n\nensuring that manufacture of the product complies with the provisions of the BLA and the applicable regulations, including, but not limited to, 21 CFR Parts 210, 211, 600 through 680, and 820; and\n\ncompliance with both product and establishment standards.\n\nProduct and establishment standards, and applicable regulations may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nproduct release and in-process specifications (21 CFR 211.110 and 610.1);\n\nadverse experience reports, biological product deviation reports, medical device reporting systems (21 CFR 600.14, 600.80, 606.171, 803.20, 803.50, and 803.53);\n\nproduction and process controls (21 CFR Part 211.100 through 211.115);\n\nreporting changes to the production process and all facilities as required by 21 CFR 601.12;\n\nmaintenance of master production records and control records for drug products and device master records and device history records for devices (21 CFR 211.186, 820 181, 820.184);\n\nlaboratory controls, including testing and release for distribution (21 CFR 211.160 through 176);\n\nsubmission of protocols and samples for lot release, where applicable (21 CFR 610.2);\n\nlabeling (21 CFR Part 201, 610.60 through 610.62, 606.120 through 122, 660.2(c), 660.28, 660.35, 660.45, 660.55, and Parts 801 and 809);\n\nsystems to ensure continued CGMP functioning of equipment and facilities (21 CFR Part 211, Subpart D);\n\nenvironmental monitoring (21 CFR 211.42(c)(10)(iv));\n\ninfectious disease testing of blood and blood components (21 CFR 610.40); and\n\ntraining of personnel (21 CFR 211.25 and 600.10).\n\nThe contract manufacturer should share with the license manufacturer all important proposed changes to production and facilities (including introduction of new products or at inspection). The license holder is responsible for reporting these changes to FDA (21 CFR 601.12; see Refs. 3, 4, and 5).\n\nResponsibilities of the Contract Manufacturer\n\nBecause the contract manufacturer is engaged in the manufacture of a drug or device, it must comply with applicable provisions of the FDC Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et. seq.) and applicable regulations.\n\nContract facilities are subject to FDA inspection under section 351(c) of the PHS Act and section 704(a) of the FDC Act. Facilities performing contract operations for biological products must register with FDA in accordance with registration and listing provisions in 21 CFR Parts 207, 607, or 807.\n\nBecause the license manufacturer must ensure that the contract site complies with applicable product and establishment standards, the license manufacturer should have access to floor plans, equipment validation, and other production information. The license manufacturer must have a procedure in place for receiving information from the contract facility on all deviations, complaints, and adverse events (21 CFR 600.14(a); 606.171(a); 803.10).\n\nWe reiterate that the contract manufacturer should fully inform the license manufacturer of the results of all tests and investigations regarding or possibly having an impact on the product.\n--------------------\nContext title: Cooperative Manufacturing Arrangements for Licensed Biologics Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA\'s list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: The BPCI Act also includes, among other provisions:\n\nA 12-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which approval of a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be made effective (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nA 4-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be submitted (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nAn exclusivity period for the first biological product determined to be interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use, during which a second or subsequent biological product may not be determined interchangeable with that reference product (see section 351(k)(6) of the PHS Act)\n\nProcedures for identifying and resolving patent disputes involving applications submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act (see section 351(l) of the PHS Act)\n\nTransition Period for Certain Biological Products\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act provides that a marketing application for a ""biological product"" (that previously would have been submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act) must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, subject to the following exception during the transition period described below:\n\nAn application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2020, if the biological product is in a product class4 for which a biological product in such product class was approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2010. Footnote 4: FDA has interpreted the statutory term “product class” for purposes of determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period (see guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act, at Q&A II.2).\n\nHowever, an application for a biological product may not be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act if there is another biological product approved under section 351(a) of the PHS Act that could be a ""reference product""5 if such application were submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 5: The term “reference product” means the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in an application submitted under section 351(k) (see section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act (a ""deemed Biologics License Application (BLA)"") on March 23, 2020.\n\nIII Interpretation of the ""deemed to be a license"" provision\n\nFDA\'s Interpretation of Section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act is directed primarily to the submission of an application for a biological product during the transition period ending on March 23, 2020.6 Though the transition scheme described in section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act culminates with the ""deemed to be a license"" provision in section 7002(e)(4), the statute is silent regarding the process foraccomplishing the transition of approved new drug applications (NDAs) to deemed BLAs, or the implications of the deeming process on pending applications.7\n\nFootnote 7: In other legislation, Congress has described the implications of transitioning applications for drug products from one statutory scheme to another, while also describing the process that would be used in effecting the transition. See, e.g., section 107(c) of the Drug Amendments of 1962 (Pub. L. 87-781) (providing that all NDAs effective on the day immediately preceding the date of enactment of the Drug Amendments of 1962 shall be deemed approved as of the enactment date, and that the provision for withdrawal of approval of an application for lack of effectiveness generally would not apply to such deemed NDAs for a period of 2 years after the enactment date); section 125 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) (Pub. L. 105-115) (repealing section 507 of the FD&C Act and providing that an application for an antibiotic drug approved under section 507 of the FD&C Act on the day before enactment of FDAMA shall, on and after the date of enactment, be considered to be an NDA submitted and filed under section 505(b) and approved under section 505(c) or an ANDA filed and approved under 505(j)).\n\n2.1.1 FDA Interprets section 7002(e)(4) to be Limited to Approved Applications\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act provides:\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under such section 351 [of the PHS Act] on the date that is 10 years after the date of enactment of [the BPCI Act].\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) is explicitly limited to an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act. Moreover, while this provision explicitly provides that an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date, the statute does not provide a means for deeming an approved NDA to be an approved BLA prior to, or after, the transition date.8 Finally, section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act does not provide a basis for the Agency to treat approved NDAs for biological products as both NDAs and BLAs after such applications are deemed to be BLAs. Therefore, FDA interprets section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act to plainly mean that, on March 23, 2020, only approved NDAs will be deemed to be BLAs. After March 23, 2020, the Agency will not approve any application submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act for a biological product subject to the transition provision that is pending or tentatively approved.9({}^{,})10 As a corollary, applications for biological products approvedunder section 505 of the FD&C Act will no longer exist as NDAs and will be replaced by approved BLAs under section 351 of the PHS Act.11\n\nFootnote 11: See FDA’s draft guidance for industry The “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the BPCI Act: Questions and Answers (Transition Q&A Draft Guidance) for additional information, including whether an approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act will be deemed a license for the biological product under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act and administrative issues associated with the transition (including BLA numbers and user fee questions). When final, that guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nAccordingly, an original 505(b)(2) application (including a resubmission) for a biological product that relies, at least in part, on FDA\'s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug that is a biological product will receive a complete response if the application is pending at the end of the day (11:59 pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) on Friday, March 20, 2020, because the NDA for the listed drug relied upon will no longer exist at midnight on Monday, March 23, 2020.\n\nFDA intends to assist applicants who may be affected by section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act, where feasible and appropriate. For example, during the review of a BLA submitted after the transition date under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act for a proposed biological product that was previously submitted, but not approved, in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act, FDA intends to consider any previously conducted scientific review by the Agency of such previous application under the FD&C Act, to the extent that such review is relevant to, and consistent with, applicable requirements of section 351 of the PHS Act.\n\nAn application generally includes all amendments and supplements to the application.13 We recognize that there may be one or more supplements submitted to an approved NDA for a biological product before March 23, 2020, that is pending on March 23, 2020. Such supplements may include a prior approval supplement (e.g., an efficacy supplement,14 a labeling supplement,\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry']","['FDA interprets the transition provision to mean that the holder of an approved application for a biological product does not need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA.

A and B.\n\n[372]\n\n[373] The Agency may, under appropriate circumstances, take regulatory action while a request for\n\n[374] formal dispute resolution is pending.\n\n[375]\n\n[376] IV. SUITABILITY OF ISSUES FOR FORM DISPUT RESOLUTION\n\n[377]\n\n[378] Any dispute involving a scientific or technical issue related to CGMP regulations that arises\n\n[379] during an FDA inspection, as discussed above, may be suitable for the dispute resolution process\n\n[380] described in this guidance.\n\n382 The following text provides examples concerning the appropriateness of several issues for the dispute resolution process detailed in this guidance.\n\n384 A. Failure to Comply With a Precise Element of CGMP Regulations\n\n386 According to 21 CFR 211.100(a), a manufacturer producing a finished pharmaceutical product\n\n388 must have written procedures for production and process controls, and these written procedures\n\n389 must be designed to ensure that the drug has the identity, strength, quality, and purity it purports\n\n390 or is represented to have.\n\n391 Failure to have written procedures for production and process controls would be a\n\n393 failure to comply with a precise element of the CGMP regulations and would not be appropriate for the formal dispute resolution process described in this document.\n\n395\n\n396 However, observations pertaining to the adequacy of the process and production\n\n397 control design activities could be subject to scientific debate and may be appropriate\n\n398 for dispute resolution as described in this guidance.\n\n399 Another example relates to the regulatory provisions governing the testing and approval or\n\n401 rejection of components, drug product containers, and closures (21 CFR 211.84), which require\n\n402 appropriate sampling, testing, or examination of each lot of components, drug product\n\n403 containers, or closures.\n\n404\n\n405 Failure to conduct testing or examination of each lot would be failure to comply with\n\n406 a precise element of the regulations and would not be appropriate for the formal\n\n407 dispute resolution process described in this guidance.\n\n408\n\n409 However, the appropriateness of a particular test or sampling scheme could involve\n\n410 the exercise of scientific judgment. A disagreement between a manufacturer and an\n\n411 investigator concerning the adequacy of a particular test or sampling scheme could be\n\n412 subject to scientific debate and may be appropriate for dispute resolution as described\n\n413 in this guidance.\n\n414 A third example relates to the CGMP regulation requirements that a manufacturer thoroughly\n\n416 investigates any unexplained discrepancy associated with its review of product production and\n\n417 control records (21 CFR 211.192).\n\n418\n\n419 Failure to investigate an unexplained discrepancy would be a failure to comply with a precise element of the CGMP regulations and would not be appropriate for the formal dispute resolution process described in this guidance.\n\n420\n\n421\n\n422\n\n423 However, the extent or adequacy of the investigation could be subject to scientific debate. Observations pertaining to the adequacy of an investigation into an\n\n425 unexplained discrepancy may also be appropriate for dispute resolution as described\n\n426 in this guidance.\n\n[427] B. Failure to Comply With a Precise Requirement Established in an Approved Application\n\n[430] If, as part of the conditions established in an approved application, a manufacturer is required to conduct a particular test on a finished product and the manufacturer fails to conduct that test, this failure represents a failure to comply with a precise requirement established in an approved application. Any disagreement about the need for such a test should be raised in the application review process. Such disagreement is not appropriate for the dispute resolution process described in this guidance, but may be raised using the processes described in the CDER/CBER and CVM guidances listed in Section I of this document.\n\n[431] C. The Regulatory Significance of Failing to Comply With a Precise Requirement\n\n[432] The CGMP regulations require that all changes to production and process control procedures be approved by the quality control unit (21 CFR 211.100(a)). If a manufacturer makes a change in production and process control procedures, but does not obtain approval of those procedures by the manufacturer's quality control unit, this would be a failure to comply with a precise requirement of the CGMP regulations. The manufacturer may contend that the failure in this particular case was not significant because it did not have an adverse effect on product quality and may convey this contention to the Agency through existing informal communication channels, including Form FDA 483-response correspondence.\n\n[433] In such a case, the significance of this observation would not be appropriate for dispute resolution as described in this guidance, as the observation concerns a failure to comply with a precise requirement of the regulations. The regulatory significance of an observation is determined by the Agency after considering all relevant information, including the manufacturer's response to the inspectional observations. The Agency encourages manufacturers to provide all information relevant to the regulatory significance of an observation as part of this response, but such disputes are not within the scope of this guidance on scientific and technical disputes concerning the interpretation and application of CGMP requirements.\n\n[434] Manufacturers must have internal written production and process control procedures (21 CFR 211.100(a)) and, as part of these procedures, manufacturers often establish procedural action limits that are tighter than release specifications. When the action limits are exceeded, the internal written procedures may call for some type of investigation to determine if the process is drifting toward a loss of control, or the procedures may call for other assessments to determine if the product will meet appropriate specifications throughout its expected shelf life. If a manufacturer's internal written procedures require certain actions when action limits are exceeded, failure to follow these written production and process control procedures is a failure to comply with 21 CFR 211.100(b). The manufacturer may contend that this failure is not significant in that the product met all regulatory specifications when released. As discussed above, this contention about significance is not appropriate for the formal dispute resolution process described in this guidance.\n\n[472] Lssues Not Raised During the Inspection\n\n[473] If, during an inspection, an investigator notes what appears to be an objectionable condition and a manufacturer disagrees with that observation, the manufacturer should voice its disagreement with the investigator. By doing so, the investigator has the opportunity to evaluate the manufacturer's position and consult, as needed, with Agency experts. The Agency may not\n\n[474] accept a request for dispute resolution concerning a disagreement that was not initially raised by the manufacturer during the inspection unless a manufacturer can provide a reasonable\n\n[475] explanation why it did not present relevant information during the inspection.\n\n[476] V. Communication of Dispute Resolution Decisions\n\n[477] FDA believes that decisions made in the dispute resolution process, along with all supporting documentation, should be publicly available consistent with FDA's disclosure regulations (21 CFR Part 20) and applicable statutes, unless the decisions involve information that would otherwise be withheld under these regulations and statutes. The Agency will redact, as appropriate, any documents requested through the Freedom of Information process.\n\n[478] When appropriate, a summary of the relevant issues and Agency views will be provided in a question and answer format and posted on the FDA Web site with all identifying information\n\n[479] excluded. Information gained from these decisions should promote consistent application and interpretation of pharmaceutical CGMP requirements.\n\n[480] VI. Paperwork Reduction ACT OF 1995\n\n[481] This guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 500 3501-3520).\n--------------------\nContext title: Formal Dispute Resolution- Scientific and Technical Issues Related to Pharmaceutical CGMP_PRA""

FDA will publish a notice in the Federal Register of advisory committee meetings. In general, ten copies of written submissions to a committee are to be sent to the executive secretary unless otherwise specified in the Federal Register notice.24 Submissions for a Public Hearing under Part 14 do not need to be sent to FDA's Dockets Management Staff.\n\nFootnote 24: 21 CFR 14.35(a).\n\n4 Public Hearing Before the FDA Commissioner (21 CFR Part 15)\n\nA hearing under Part 15 is held at the discretion of the Commissioner, when provided by law or regulation, or as an alternative to a formal evidentiary hearing (where granted in the discretion of the Commissioner), to permit persons to present information and views at a public hearing on any matter pending before the FDA. Examples of issues that can be referred to a Part 15 hearing include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nProposals to allow persons to order custom devices;\n\nProposed Quality System (formerly Good Manufacturing Practice) Regulation;\n\nProposed exemptions from federal preemption of state and local device requirements.25\n\nFootnote 25: 21 CFR 808.25(e).\n\nFDA will publish a notice of hearing in the Federal Register. The scope of a hearing is determined by the notice of hearing and any regulation under which the hearing is held.

Part 16 provides an opportunity for a regulatory hearing on various matters including but not limited to:\n\nSections 520(g)(4) and (g)(5) of the FD&C Act, relating to disapproval of an Investigational Device Exemption, or notice of a proposed withdrawal of approval;\n\n21 CFR 814.46(c), relating to withdrawal of approval of a PMA;\n\nRescission of a 510(k) clearance;\n\nAn order suspending or revoking an FDA certificate issued to a U.S. mammography facility pursuant to the MQSA.\n\nA regulatory hearing is initiated by a notice of opportunity for hearing from FDA. A person offered a hearing has the amount of time specified in the notice to request a hearing. Under 21 CFR 16.26(a), a request for a hearing may be denied if the request fails to demonstrate a genuine and substantial issue of fact that warrants a hearing; therefore, the request should specify the grounds for the hearing request. FDA and the party requesting the hearing will, if feasible, at least one day before the hearing provide to each other written notice of any published articles or written information to be presented or relied on at the hearing. A regulatory hearing is informal and the rules of evidence do not apply.27\n\nFootnote 27: 21 CFR 16.60(c).\n\nVI Judicial Review\n\nFDA is frequently asked about judicial remedies. A party seeking judicial review of a final action taken by FDA should consult its attorney or perform its own research of applicable statutes and regulations. It is not appropriate for FDA to offer advice or assistance concerning whether, and how, a party may seek judicial review of an adverse decision, and nothing in this guidance should be construed as constraining the ability of a stakeholder to exercise any remedies provided by statute or regulation.\n\nIn general, FDA believes it is in the public interest for parties to avail themselves of administrative remedies within the agency prior to engaging in litigation, so that FDA has the opportunity to reconsider and review any dispute concerning an FDA action before it is referred to judicial review.28 In the event that a petitioner brings judicial action relating to a matter that is subject to a pending review under 21 CFR 10.75 or 10.33, or any other administrative process, the Commissioner may request that the court refer the matter back to the Agency or hold its review in abeyance pending completion of administrative reconsideration.29 Moreover, the Commissioner will generally consider a petition for reconsideration only before the petitioner brings legal action in the courts.\n\nFootnote 28: 21 CFR 10.45.\n\nFootnote 29: 21 CFR 10.33(h).\n\nVII Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n\nThis guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).\n\nThe time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average 8 hours per response, including the time to review instructions, search existing data sources, gather the data needed, and complete and review the information collection.

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n--------------------\nContext: It is important that the CGMP regulations are harmonized to the extent possible with other widely used quality management systems, including ISO 9000, non-U.S. pharmaceutical quality management requirements, and FDA's own medical device quality system regulations. This guidance serves as a first step to highlight common elements between the CGMP regulations and Quality Management Systems. With the globalization of pharmaceutical manufacturing and the increasing prevalence of drug- and biologic-device combination products, the convergence of quality management principles across different regions and among various product types is very desirable.\n\nThe FDA has concluded that modern quality systems, when coupled with manufacturing process and product knowledge and the use of effective risk management practices, can handle many types of changes to facilities, equipment, and processes without the need for prior approval regulatory submissions. Manufacturers with a robust quality system and appropriate process knowledge can implement many types of improvements. In addition, an effective quality system, by lowering the risk of manufacturing problems, may result in shorter and fewer FDA inspections.\n\nA quality system can provide the necessary framework for implementing quality by design4 (building in quality from the development phase and throughout a product's life cycle), continual improvement, and risk management in the drug manufacturing process. A quality system adopted by a manufacturer can be tailored to fit the specific environment, taking into account factors such as scope of operations, complexity of processes, and appropriate use of finite resources. Footnote 4: See ICH Q8 Pharmaceutical Development.\n\nScope of the Guidance\n\nThis guidance applies to manufacturers of drug products (finished pharmaceuticals), including products regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). It may also be useful to manufacturers of components (including active pharmaceutical ingredients) used in the manufacture of these products.\n\nThis document is not intended to create new requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturing that go beyond those established in the current regulations, nor is the guidance intended to be a guide for the conduct of FDA inspections. Rather, the document explains how implementing comprehensive quality systems can help manufacturers achieve compliance with 21 CFR parts210 and 211. Although the QS working group found that many of the quality system elements correlate with specific CGMP requirements, some do not. The Agency expects compliance with CGMP regulations, and FDA's inspection program will remain focused on compliance with those regulations.\n\nOrganization of this Guidance\n\nTo provide a reference familiar to industry, the quality systems model described in section IV of this guidance is organized -- in its major sections -- according to the structure of international quality standards. Major sections of the model include the following:\n\nManagement Responsibilities\n\nResources\n\nManufacturing Operations\n\nEvaluation Activities\n\nUnder each of these sections the key elements found in modern quality systems are discussed. When an element correlates with a CGMP regulatory requirement, that correlation is noted. In some cases, a specific CGMP regulation is discussed in more detail as it relates to a quality system element. At the end of each section, a table is included listing the quality system elements of that section and the specific CGMP regulations with which they correlate. A glossary is included at the end of the document.\n\nIII CGMPS and the Concepts of Modern Quality Systems\n\nSeveral key concepts are critical for any discussion of modern quality systems. The following concepts are used throughout this guidance as they relate to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.\n\nQuality\n\nEvery pharmaceutical product has established identity, strength, purity, and other quality characteristics designed to ensure the required levels of safety and effectiveness. For the purposes of this guidance document, the phrase achieving quality means achieving these characteristics for a product.\n\nQuality by Design and Product Development\n\nQuality by design means designing and developing a product and associated manufacturing processes that will be used during product development to ensure that the product consistently attains a predefined quality at the end of the manufacturing process.5 Quality by design, in conjunction with a quality system, provides a sound framework for the transfer of product knowledge and process understanding from drug development to the commercial manufacturing processes and for post-development changes and optimization. The CGMP regulations, when viewed in their entirety, incorporate the concept of quality by design. This guidance describes how these elements fit together.\n\nAppendix C Quality Risk Management\n\nQuality risk management is a valuable component of an effective quality systems framework.6 Quality risk management can, for example, help guide the setting of specifications and process parameters for drug manufacturing, assess and mitigate the risk of changing a process or specification, and determine the extent of discrepancy investigations and corrective actions.\n\nFootnote 6: See ICH Q9 Quality Risk Management.\n\nCAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action)\n\nCAPA is a well-known CGMP regulatory concept that focuses on investigating, understanding, and correcting discrepancies while attempting to prevent their recurrence. Quality system models discuss CAPA as three separate concepts, all of which are used in this guidance.\n\nRemedial corrections of an identified problem\n\nRoot cause analysis with corrective action to help understand the cause of the deviation and potentially prevent recurrence of a similar problem\n\nPreventive action to avert recurrence of a similar potential problem\n\nChange Control\n\nChange control is another well-known CGMP concept that focuses on managing change to prevent unintended consequences. The CGMP regulations provide for change control primarily through the assigned responsibilities of the quality control unit. Certain major manufacturing changes (e.g., changes that alter specifications, a critical product attribute or bioavailability) require regulatory filings and prior regulatory approval (21 CFR 314.70, 514.8, and 601.12).\n\nEffective change control activities (e.g., quality planning and control of revisions to specifications, process parameters, procedures) are key components of any quality system. In this guidance, change is discussed in terms of creating a regulatory environment that encourages change towards continual improvement. This means a manufacturer is empowered to make changes subject to the regulations based on the variability of materials used in manufacturing and process improvements resulting from knowledge gained during a product's lifecycle.\n\nAppendix F The Quality Unit\n\nMany of the modern quality system concepts described here correlate very closely with the CGMP regulations (refer to the charts later in the document). Current industry practice generally divides the responsibilities of the quality control unit (QCU), as defined in the CGMP regulations, between quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) functions.\n\nQC usually involves (1) assessing the suitability of incoming components, containers, closures, labeling, in-process materials, and the finished products; (2) evaluating the performance of the manufacturing process to ensure adherence to proper specifications and limits; and (3) determining the acceptability of each batch for release.\n\nQA primarily involves (1) review and approval of all procedures related to production and maintenance, (2) review of associated records, and (3) auditing and performing/evaluating trend analyses.\n\nThis guidance uses the term quality unit7 (QU) to reflect modern practice while remaining consistent with the CGMP definition in SS 210.3(b)(15). The concept of a quality unit is also consistent with modern quality systems in ensuring that the various operations associated with all systems are appropriately planned, approved, conducted, and monitored.\n\nFootnote 7: Generally, the term quality unit is used in this guidance. However, quality control unit is used when directly quoting parts 210 and 211.\n\nThe CGMP regulations specifically assign the QU the authority to create, monitor, and implement a quality system. Such activities do not substitute for, or preclude, the daily responsibility of manufacturing personnel to build quality into the product. The QU should not take on the responsibilities of other units of a manufacturer's organization, such as the responsibilities handled by manufacturing personnel, engineers, and development scientists.8 Manufacturing personnel and the QU are both critical in fulfilling the manufacturer's responsibility to produce quality products.\n\nFootnote 8: See Reference #1, comment 91.\n\nOther CGMP assigned responsibilities of the QU are consistent with modern quality system approaches (SS 211.22):\n\nEnsuring that controls are implemented and completed satisfactorily during manufacturing operations\n\nEnsuring that developed procedures and specifications are appropriate and followed, including those used by a firm under contract to the manufacturer\n\nApproving or rejecting incoming materials, in-process materials, and drug products\n\nReviewing production records and investigating any unexplained discrepancies\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations""

Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Combination Products Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n--------------------\nContext: 21 CFR 4.4(c) provides that if a facility manufactures only one type of constituent part (e.g., a drug or device constituent part) of a co-packaged or single-entity combination product, that facility is subject only to the CGMP regulations applicable to that constituent part (i.e., part 211 for a drug or part 820 for a device, as well as those under parts 600 through 680 for a biological product and part 1271 for an HCT/P). 21 CFR 4.4(d) provides that when two or more types of constituent parts to be included in a single-entity or co-packaged combination product have arrived at the same facility, or the manufacture of these constituent parts is occurring at the same facility, that facility must comply with all CGMP requirements described in part 4applicable to the manufacturing activities at that facility, and a streamlined approach under 21 CFR 4.4(b) may be used to demonstrate compliance with these requirements.\n\nSimilarly, if a facility manufactures a drug or device that is not a constituent part of a combination product and also manufactures a combination product, the CGMP requirements for the independently marketed drug or device do not change (compliance with parts 210/211 or part 820, respectively). Accordingly, if a facility manufactures an independently marketed device that is subject to part 820 and a combination product, it cannot manufacture the device under a drug CGMP-based streamlined operating system, even if it is used for the combination product, because this operating system only includes limited, specified provisions from the QS regulation. However, both the device and the combination product may be manufactured under a device QS regulation-based streamlined operating system, with the device that is not part of a combination product then being subject only to part 820.\n\nii.2.2 Documentation of CGMP Approach\n\nCombination product manufacturers should be able to identify all documentation needed to demonstrate compliance with part 4, and make it readily accessible for an FDA inspection. The facility\'s quality system documentation should identify the CGMP operating system for the combination product(s) manufactured at that facility, and the manufacturer should share this information with investigators at the initiation of an inspection. For combination product manufacturers implementing a streamlined approach (See Section II.B.1 above), inspection of the base CGMP operating system (i.e., 21 CFR part 210/211 or 21 CFR part 820) will typically be consistent with existing compliance programs and policies associated with it. For specified provisions from the non-base system, FDA intends to utilize the compliance program and policy elements specific to these provisions.12\n\nFootnote 12: For a listing of existing Compliance Program Guidance Manuals (CPGMs) for drugs, devices, and biologics, see http://www.fda.gov/ICEC1/ComplianceManuals/ComplianceProgramManual/ucm2005382.htm.\n\nPrior to the promulgation of part 4, manufacturers of combination products already had to demonstrate compliance with the applicable CGMP requirements for each constituent part of their combination product. Manufacters should ensure that their CGMP procedures and processes are compliant with the regulatory framework provided in part 4. If the operating system requires changes to come into compliance, manufacturers should document the steps they take to ensure ongoing product safety and effectiveness. Manufacters should be prepared to discuss their approach during inspections.\n\nCombination product manufacturers who are required to address CGMP issues as part of premarket review should identify in premarket submissions whether they are operating under a streamlined approach, and if so, whether it is a drug CGMP-based or device QS regulation-based streamlined approach.13 In premarket submissions, the CGMP approach should be identified for each relevant facility. For NDAs, BLAs and ANDAs, the CGMP approach should be describedin the Common Technical Document. For additional details on placement within the CTD, see eCTD Technical Conformance Guide, Section 3.3.2.14 For PMAs, the CGMP approach should be documented in the manufacturing section of the PMA (the manufacturing module for a modular PMA).\n\nFootnote 14: Available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM465411.pdf.\n\nD. The role of the lead center and other Agency components\n\nA combination product is assigned to an Agency center that will have primary jurisdiction (i.e., the lead) for that combination product\'s premarket review and regulation. Under section 503(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 351(g)), assignment of a combination product to a lead center is based on a determination of which constituent part provides the PMOA of the combination product.15\n\nFootnote 15: The “primary mode of action” of a combination product is the single mode of action (drug, device, or biological product) that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. The most important therapeutic action is the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product. See 21 CFR 3.2(k) (which defines “mode of action” and “therapeutic”) and (m) (which defines primary mode of action). For more information on product classification, assignment, and PMOA, see the guidance for industry How to Write a Request for Designation (RFD)(April 2011).\n\nIf the PMOA of a device-biological product combination product is attributable to the biological product, for example, the center responsible for premarket review of such a biological product would have primary jurisdiction for the regulation of the combination product. The lead center for premarket review of the combination product also has the lead for ensuring compliance with CGMP regulatory requirements. Regardless of the PMOA, Agency components will coordinate as appropriate to enable efficient, effective CGMP regulatory oversight, including appropriate CGMP inspections.\n\nThe lead center is a manufacturer\'s primary point of contact. Manufacturers may also contact the Office of Combination Products (OCP) for assistance, as needed, in identifying appropriate contact points (including those in the lead center), resolving substantive issues, or otherwise facilitating interactions with the Agency and collaboration among Agency components, including centers and the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA).\n\n3 General Considerations for CGMP Compliance\n\nThis section addresses some general considerations for CGMP compliance for combination products. Note that this guidance addresses only CGMP requirements. Additional requirements may apply including the need for premarket submissions as a result of changes to product design, intended use, or manufacture.\n\nA. Demonstrating compliance\n\nThe final rule identifies two ways for co-packaged and single-entity combination product manufacturers to demonstrate compliance with applicable CGMP requirements. The Agency intends for the term ""demonstrate"" to apply for part 4 as it would be for purposes of fulfilling the underlying CGMP regulations listed in 21 CFR 4.3. Manufacturers must demonstrate compliance with each applicable CGMP requirement for constituent parts and combination products.16\n\nFootnote 16: 21 CFR part 4.\n\nIf a streamlined approach is used, the manufacturer must demonstrate compliance with all of the relevant provisions of either the drug CGMPs or device QS regulation, and the provisions specified in 21 CFR 4.4(b) for the other set(s) of CGMP requirements applicable to the product. Further guidance on how to demonstrate compliance with the regulations specified in 21 CFR 4.4(b) is provided in section IV of this guidance. A manufacturer who implements a streamlined approach is not expected to demonstrate compliance with the specific provisions of the non-base set of requirements other than those specified in 21 CFR 4.4(b) (e.g., for a drug CGMP-based streamlined approach, the manufacturer must demonstrate compliance with applicable drug CGMPs plus the six specified provisions from part 820, as applicable, but the manufacturer does not need to demonstrate compliance with the other specific provisions in part 820).\n\nAs provided in 21 CFR 4.4(e), in the event of a conflict between regulations applicable under part 4, the regulations most specifically applicable to the constituent part in question supersede the more general. The intent of this provision is to address any potential conflicts between regulations. This provision does not provide a basis for the Agency to require manufacturers to demonstrate compliance with provisions not otherwise identified in part 4 as applicable to them.\n\nSome of the provisions specified in part 4 from the drug CGMPs and device QS regulation cross-reference other provisions of parts 211 and 820, respectively. This raises the question of whether manufacturers must specifically demonstrate compliance with these cross-referenced provisions. FDA believes that manufacturers can adequately address the expectations of these cross-referenced provisions through implementation of either a drug CGMP-based or device QS regulation-based CGMP streamlined approach.\n--------------------\nContext title: Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Combination Products Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n--------------------\nContext: Under 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(v), an applicant may submit one or more protocols (i.e., comparability protocols) describing tests, studies, and acceptance criteria to be achieved to demonstrate the absence of an adverse effect from specified types of changes. A comparability protocol can be used to reduce the reporting category for specified changes. A proposed comparability protocol must be submitted as a prior approval supplement, if not approved as part of the original application (21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(v)). On February 25, 2003, FDA issued a draft guidance on comparability protocols entitled Comparability protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\n4 General Requirements\n\nOther than for editorial changes in previously submitted information (e.g., correction of spelling or typographical errors, reformatting of batch records), an applicant must notify FDA about each change in each condition established in an approved application beyond the variations already provided for in the application (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(i)).\n\nA supplement or annual report must include a list of all changes contained in the supplement or annual report (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(v)). On the list, FDA recommends that the applicant describe each change in enough detail to allow FDA to quickly determine whether the appropriate reporting category has been used. For supplements, this list must be provided in the cover letter (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(v)). In annual reports, the list should be included in the summary section. The supplement or annual report also is required to describe the change fully (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(i)).\n\nAn applicant making a change to an approved application under section 506A of the Act also must conform to other applicable laws and regulations, including current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements of the Act (21 U.S.C. SS 351(a)(2)(B)) and applicable regulations in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (e.g., 21 CFR parts 210, 211, 225, 226, and 514). For example, manufacturers must comply with relevant CGMP validation and recordkeeping requirements (21 CFR parts 210, 211, 225, 226) and ensure that relevant records are readily available for examination by authorized FDA personnel during an inspection.\n\nAn applicant must include a statement in each supplement and amendment to a supplement certifying that a field copy has been provided to the appropriate FDA district office (21 CFR514.8(b)(1)(iv)).3\n\nFootnote 3: For a change to a product manufactured in a foreign facility, a field copy of the supplement or its amendment is not required to be submitted to an FDA district office. However, FDA recommends that the applicant state that the drug made with the change is manufactured only at a foreign site.\n\n4 Assessing the effect of manufacturing changes\n\nAssessment of the Effects of the Change\n\nThe holder of an approved application under section 512 of the Act must assess the effects of the change before distributing a drug made with a manufacturing change (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(ii)).4 For each change, the supplement or annual report must contain information determined by FDA to be appropriate and include the information developed by the applicant in assessing the effects of the change (section 506A(b), (c)(1), (d)(2)(A), and (d)(3)(A) of the Act). The type of information that must be included in a supplemental application or annual report is specified in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(iii), (b)(3)(iv), (b)(3)(vi), and (b)(4)(iii).\n\nFootnote 4: Assess the effects of the change means to evaluate the effects of a manufacturing change on the identity, strength, quality, purity and potency of a drug as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug. (21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(i)). The term assess or assessment as used in this guidance are not the same as validation. Certain validation information, such as sterilization processes, is considered information that is needed to assess the effect of the change as specified in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(ii) and should be submitted in an NADA or ANADA. Unless otherwise specified by FDA, other validation (e.g., process, equipment) data need not be submitted in the application, but must be retained at the facility and be available for review by FDA (see, e.g., 21 CFR 211.180).\n\nConformance to Specifications\n\nAn assessment of the effects of a change on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the drug should include a determination that the drug substance intermediates, drug substance, in-process materials, and/or drug product affected by the change conform to the approved specifications.5 A specification is a quality standard (i.e., tests, analytical procedures, and acceptance criteria) provided in an approved application to confirm the quality of drugs including, for example, drug substances, Type A medicated articles, drug products, intermediates, raw materials, reagents, components, in-process materials, container closure systems, and other materials used in the production of a drug. (21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iv)). Acceptance criteria are numerical limits, ranges, or other criteria for the tests described (21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iv)). Conformance to a specification means that the material, when tested according to the analytical procedures listed in the specification, will meet the listed acceptance criteria.\n\nFootnote 5: If a specification needs to be revised as a result of the change, this would be considered a multiple change (see sections VIII and XI).\n\n3 Contains Non-Binding Recommendations\n\nIn addition to confirming that the material affected by manufacturing changes continues to meet its specification, the applicant should perform additional testing, when appropriate, to assess whether the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a drug as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug have been or will be affected. The assessment should include, as appropriate, evaluation of any changes in the chemical, physical, microbiological, biological, bioavailability, and/or stability profiles. This additional assessment could involve testing of the post-change drug itself or, if appropriate, the material directly affected by the change. The type of additional testing that an applicant should perform would depend on the type of manufacturing change, the type of drug, and the effect of the change on the quality of the drug. For example:\n\nEvaluation of changes in the impurity or degradant profile could first involve profiling using appropriate chromatographic techniques and then, depending on the observed changes in the impurity profile, toxicology tests to qualify a new impurity or degradant or to qualify an impurity that is above a previously qualified level.6 Footnote 6: Recommendations on identifying, qualifying, and reporting impurities can be found in relevant guidances (e.g., VICH GL10(R), Impurities in New Veterinary Drug Substances (Revision), Draft Revised Guidance, (GFI 92) (January 6, 2006)).\n\nEvaluation of the hardness or friability of a tablet after certain changes.\n\nAssessment of the effect of a change on bioequivalence could include, for example, multipoint and/or multimedia dissolution profiling and/or an in vivo bioequivalence study.\n\nEvaluation of extractables from new packaging components or moisture permeability of a new container closure system.\n\nAn applicant should refer to all relevant FDA guidance documents for recommendations on the information that should be submitted to support a given change. If guidance for information that should be submitted to support a particular change is not available, CVM's Division of Manufacturing Technologies, HFV-140, should be consulted.\n\nEquivalence\n\nWhen testing is performed, the applicant should assess the extent to which the manufacturing change has affected the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the drug product. Typically, this is accomplished by comparing test results from pre- andpost-change material and determining if the test results are equivalent. Simply stated: Is the drug made after the change equivalent to the drug made before the change? Equivalence comparisons frequently have a criterion for comparison with calculation of confidence intervals relative to a predetermined equivalence interval. For this, as well as for other reasons, equivalent does not necessarily mean identical. Equivalence also may relate to maintenance of a quality characteristic (e.g., stability) rather than a single performance of a test.\n\nAdverse Effect\n\nSome manufacturing changes have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug. In many cases, the applicant chooses not to implement these manufacturing changes, but sometimes the applicant wishes to do so. If an assessment indicates that a change has adversely affected the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug, FDA recommends that the change be submitted in a prior approval supplement, regardless of the recommended reporting category for the change. For example, a process change recommended for a changes-being-effected-in-30-days supplement could cause the formation of a new degradant that requires qualification and/or identification. The applicant's degradation qualification procedures may indicate that there are no safety concerns relating to the new degradant. Even so, the applicant should submit this change in a prior approval supplement with appropriate information to support the continued safety and effectiveness of the drug. During the review of the prior approval supplement, FDA will assess the impact of any adverse effect on the drug as this change may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #83 Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Changes to Approved NADA:ANADA""]",['The FD-483 is the written notice of objectionable\n\npractices or deviations from the regulations that is prepared by the FDA investigator at the end of the inspection.

It is also intended to help ensure that APIs meet the requirements for quality and purity that they purport or are represented to possess.\n\nIn this Guide ""manufacturing"" is defined to include all operations of receipt of materials, production, packaging, repackaging, labelling, relabelling, quality control, release, storage and distribution of APIs and the related controls. In this Guide the term ""should"" indicates recommendations that are expected to apply unless shown to be inapplicable or replaced by an alternative demonstrated to provide at least an equivalent level of quality assurance. For the purposes of this Guide, the terms ""current good manufacturing practices"" and ""good manufacturing practices"" are equivalent.\n\nThe Guide as a whole does not cover safety aspects for the personnel engaged in the manufacture, nor aspects of protection of the environment. These controls are inherent responsibilities of the manufacturer and are governed by national laws.\n\nThis Guide is not intended to define registration/filing requirements or modify pharmacopoeial requirements. This Guide does not affect the ability of the responsible regulatory agency to establish specific registration/filing requirements regarding APIs within the context of marketing/manufacturing authorizations or drug applications. All commitments in registration/filing documents must be met.\n\nRegulatory Applicability\n\nWithin the world community, materials may vary as to the legal classification as an API. When a material is classified as an API in the region or country in which it is manufactured or used in a drug product, it should be manufactured according to this Guide.\n\nScope\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: The ICH guidance for industry Q7A Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients provides guidance for manufacturing under an appropriate system for managing quality.\n\nThe ICH guidance for industry S6(R1) Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals provides an overall description of what nonclinical studies of biological products should be considered to support clinical trials.\n\nThe draft guidance for industry Microbiological Data for Systemic Antibacterial Drug Products -- Development, Analysis, and Presentation provides an overview of the nonclinical microbiology studies that help to support clinical development.23 Footnote 23: When final, this guidance will represent the FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nThe guidance for industry Content and Format of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-derived Products describes in general the types of information that should accompany an IND submission. See also the Questions and Answers companion document.\n\nThe guidance for industry INDs for Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies -- Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information describes the CMC information that should be submitted for phase 2 and phase 3 trials conducted under INDs.\n\nAppendix 2 Guidances for clinical development24\n\nFootnote 24: These guidances can be found on the FDA Drugs guidance Web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nThe following guidances can be useful in the area of clinical development of drugs for NTDs:\n\nThe ICH guidance for industry E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials summarizes statistical areas for clinical trials.\n\nThe ICH guidance for industry E10 Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials highlights some of the important aspects of using an appropriate control group. The guidance discusses some of the considerations for the noninferiority trial to ensure the appropriate demonstration of efficacy when compared to an active-controlled drug.\n\nEffective treatment of some NTDs includes the use of combinations of antimicrobial drugs to enhance efficacy or prevent the development of resistant pathogens. Some development programs may include two or more new investigational drugs. The guidance for industry Codevelopment of Two or More New Investigational Drugs for Use in Combination covers this area.\n\nSome NTDs have known effective treatment, and clinical trials designed to demonstrate noninferiority of an investigational drug to the control drug can be used in this situation. The noninferiority clinical trial design poses some unique scientific and regulatory challenges, which focus on an ability to describe a reliable treatment effect of the control drug. Two guidances in this area include the draft guidance for industry Non-Inferiority Clinical Trials25 and the guidance for industry Antibacterial Drug Products: Use of Noninferiority Trials to Support Approval. Footnote 25: When final, this guidance will represent the FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nThe principles of good meeting management practices and standardized procedures for meetings are outlined in the guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants.\n\nThe guidance for industry Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products provides a general overview of the approach to demonstrating effectiveness.\n\nThe draft guidance for industry Antibacterial Therapies for Patients With Unmet Medical Need for the Treatment of Serious Bacterial Diseases explains the FDA's current thinking about possible streamlined development programs and clinical trial designs for drugs to treat serious bacterial diseases in patients who have an unmet medical need.26\n\nContents\n\n1 Introduction\n\n2 The FDA's\n2.1 The FDA's\n2.2 The FDA's\n2.3 The FDA's\n2.4 The FDA's\n2.5 The FDA's\n2.6 The FDA's\n2.7 The FDA's\n2.8 The FDA's\n2.9 The FDA's\n\n2.10 The FDA's\n\n2.11 The FDA's\n\n2.12 The FDA's\n\n2.13 The FDA's\n\n2.14 The FDA's\n\n2.15 The FDA's\n\n2.16 The FDA's\n\n2.17 The FDA's\n\n2.18 The FDA's\n\n2.19 The FDA's\n\n2.20 The FDA's\n\n2.21 The FDA's\n\n2.22 The FDA's\n\n2.23 The FDA's\n\n2.24 The FDA's\n\n2.25 The FDA's\n\n2.26 The FDA's\n\n2.27 When final, this guidance will represent the FDA's current thinking on this topic.\n--------------------\nContext title: Neglected Tropical Diseases of the Developing World- Developing Drugs for Treatment or Prevention""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: Final Concept Paper\n\nICH Q7 Q&As\n\nQ7: Good Manufacturing Practice Guide for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients\n\nDated and endorsed by the Steering Committee: 17 October 2012\n\nType of Harmonization Action Proposed\n\nImplementation Working Group (Q7 IWG) on Q7 (Q&A document).\n\nStatement of the Perceived Problem\n\nThe ICH Q7 Guideline is implemented successfully in the regulatory framework by WHO and most authorities around the world. However, experience gained with the implementation of ICH Q7 since the approval in November 2000 shows that uncertainties related to the interpretation of some sections exist. Furthermore, the importance of the application of the life-cycle approach addressed in the new ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, Q10 Guidelines to API manufacturing procedures is emphasized by the ICH Quality Implementation Working Group (Quality IWG). Technical issues with regard to GMP of APIs - also in context with new ICH Guidelines - need to be addressed in order to harmonize expectations during inspections.\n\nA document would be helpful in removing these ambiguities and uncertainties and also in harmonizing the inspections of both small molecules and biotech APIs.\n\nIssues to be resolved\n\nThe following issues have so far been identified by practical experience and will need to be addressed in a Q&A document on Q7:\n\nOutput from the review of existing Q&As (e.g., from PIC/S Expert Circle on APIs, from initial Regulatory/PDA training 2002) currently underway by PIC/S teams will be considered for endorsement.\n\nTechnical issues for clarification such as application in the supply chain control, contractor/supplier management (outsourcing), monitoring of impurity profiles, quality systems, applicability to biologicals/biotech and relationship with Q5D, and GMP expectations in the development phase (manufacturing for clinical trials).\n\nImpact of the implementation of ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, and Q10 on Q7 (see also Quality IWG Q&As and Points to Consider).\n\nBackground to the Proposal\n\nIt has become apparent, based on the approval and implementation of ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11 principles into GMP of APIs that certain individual implementation approaches are leading to non harmonized interpretation and new expectations beyond the intention of ICH Q7. The Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme (PIC/S) launched the 'International Collaboration on APIs - Training programme on ICH Q7'. This training programme includes a basic training, an advanced training and a Q&A document on interpretation of ICH Q7. This provides a feedback by the global knowledge of its network of inspectors. PIC/S will be supportive of the Q7 IWG work.\n\nType of Implementation Working Group and Resources\n\nThe Q7 IWG should comprise of the Six ICH Parties (2 experts per Party), Observers to ICH (1 expert per Observer), RHIs, DRAs and DoH (1 expert per RHI/DRA/DoH), and Interested Parties (WSNI, IGPA, Biotechnology Industry, PIC/S, API Industry and CEP programme of EDQM, 1 expert per Interested Party).\n\nTiming\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Q&As Concept Paper""

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: 12.70 Cleaning procedures should normally be validated. In general, cleaning validation should be directed to situations or process steps where contamination or carryover of materials poses the greatest risk to API quality. For example, in early production it may be unnecessary to validate equipment cleaning procedures where residues are removed by subsequent purification steps.\n12.71 Validation of cleaning procedures should reflect actual equipment usage patterns. If various APIs or intermediates are manufactured in the same equipment and the equipment is cleaned by the same process, a representative intermediate or API can be selected for cleaning validation. This selection should be based on the solubility and difficulty of cleaning and the calculation of residue limits based on potency, toxicity, and stability.\n12.72 The cleaning validation protocol should describe the equipment to be cleaned, procedures, materials, acceptable cleaning levels, parameters to be monitored and controlled, and analytical methods. The protocol should also indicate the type of samples to be obtained and how they are collected and labelled.\n12.73 Sampling should include swabbing, rinsing, or alternative methods (e.g., direct extraction), as appropriate, to detect both insoluble and soluble residues. The sampling methods used should be capable of quantitatively measuring levels of residues remaining on the equipment surfaces after cleaning. Swab sampling may be impractical when product contact surfaces are not easily accessible due to equipment design and/or process limitations (e.g., inner surfaces of hoses, transfer pipes, reactor tanks with small ports or handling toxic materials, and small intricate equipment such as micronizers and microfluidizers).\n12.74 Validated analytical methods having sensitivity to detect residues or contaminants should be used. The detection limit for each analytical method should be sufficiently sensitive to detect the established acceptable level of the residue or contaminant. The method's attainable recovery level should be established. Residue limits should be practical, achievable, verifiable and based on the most deleterious residue. Limits can be established based on the minimum known pharmacological, toxicological, or physiological activity of the API or its most deleterious component.\n12.75 Equipment cleaning/sanitization studies should address microbiological and endotoxin contamination for those processes where there is a need to reduce total microbiological count or endotoxins in the API, or other processes where such contamination could be of concern (e.g., non-sterile APIs used to manufacture sterile products).\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: This Guide is not intended to define registration/filing requirements or modify pharmacopoeial requirements. This Guide does not affect the ability of the responsible regulatory agency to establish specific registration/filing requirements regarding APIs within the context of marketing/manufacturing authorizations or drug applications. All commitments in registration/filing documents must be met.\n\nRegulatory Applicability\n\nWithin the world community, materials may vary as to the legal classification as an API. When a material is classified as an API in the region or country in which it is manufactured or used in a drug product, it should be manufactured according to this Guide.\n\nScope\n\nThis Guide applies to the manufacture of APIs for use in human drug (medicinal) products. It applies to the manufacture of sterile APIs only up to the point immediately prior to the APIs being rendered sterile. The sterilization and aseptic processing of sterile APIs are not covered by this guidance, but should be performed in accordance with GMP guidelines for drug (medicinal) products as defined by local authorities.\n\nThis Guide covers APIs that are manufactured by chemical synthesis, extraction, cell culture/fermentation, by recovery from natural sources, or by any combination of these processes. Specific guidance for APIs manufactured by cell culture/fermentation is described in Section 18.\n\nThis Guide excludes all vaccines, whole cells, whole blood and plasma, blood and plasma derivatives (plasma fractionation), and gene therapy APIs. However, it does include APIsthat are produced using blood or plasma as raw materials. Note that cell substrates (mammalian, plant, insect or microbial cells, tissue or animal sources including transgenic animals) and early process steps may be subject to GMP but are not covered by this Guide. In addition, the Guide does not apply to medical gases, bulk-packaged drug (medicinal) products, and manufacturing/control aspects specific to radiopharmaceuticals.\n\nSection 19 contains guidance that only applies to the manufacture of APIs used in the production of drug (medicinal) products specifically for clinical trials (investigational medicinal products).\n\nAn ""API Starting Material"" is a raw material, intermediate, or an API that is used in the production of an API and that is incorporated as a significant structural fragment into the structure of the API. An API Starting Material can be an article of commerce, a material purchased from one or more suppliers under contract or commercial agreement, or produced in-house. API Starting Materials normally have defined chemical properties and structure.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline']","['Yes. Regardless of whether equipment is dedicated or not, it is expected that acceptance criteria for residues be defined and that the equipment be cleaned at appropriate intervals to prevent build-up and carry-over of contaminants. Intervals can be based on number of batches, product change-over, time, etc. (ICH Q7, paragraphs 5.22, 5.23, 5.24, 5.25, 8.50).\n\nCleaning intervals and acceptance criteria should be established based on an understanding of the process/reactions/degradation, taking into account solubility, potency, toxicity, etc. Establishment of acceptance criteria does not necessarily imply sampling and testing after every cleaning. Visual inspection of equipment for cleanliness is an expectation of ICH Q7, paragraph 5.21. Where validation data has confirmed effective cleaning, cleaning procedures should be monitored at appropriate intervals (ICH Q7, paragraph 12.76).']",0.19999999998,0.3571428571428571
51,"As per the details in Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , How do I provide the ""Supplement Facts"" panel if my dietary supplements are sold from bulk containers?","['--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , How do I provide the ""Supplement Facts"" panel if my dietary supplements are sold from bulk containers?\n--------------------\nContext: The ""Supplement Facts"" nutrition information (referred to as a panel) must be enclosed in a box by using hairlines. The title, ""Supplement Facts,"" must be larger than all other print in the panel and, unless impractical, must be set full width of the panel. The title and all headings must be bolded to distinguish them from other information.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n36. How must I present the information in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n\nYou must present all information using the following:\n\na. A single easy-to-read type style;\n\nb. All black or one color type, printed on a white or neutral contrasting background, whenever practical;3. Upper- and lowercase letters, except that you may use all uppercase lettering on small packages (i.e., packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches); d. At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text); and e. Letters that do not touch.\n37. What are the type size requirements for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n\nExcept as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must set information other than the title, headings, and footnotes in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. You also must use a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label for the title ""Supplement Facts."" You may set the column headings and footnotes in type no smaller than 6 point type. See the section on ""Special Labeling Provisions"" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nMust I use hairlines in the Supplement Facts panel?\n\nExcept for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must use a hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text to separate each dietary ingredient from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it. FDA has provided an exception for certain packages with space constraints. See the section on ""Special Labeling Provisions"" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nHow closely must I follow the ""Examples of graphic enhancements used by the FDA"" in appendix B to Part 101?\n\nYou are not required to follow Appendix B to Part 101. Appendix B and its specifications are a model, which FDA has suggested in the interest of uniformity of presentation. For example, 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(i) requires the use of an ""easy-to-read"" type style, not specifically Helvetica type, as suggested in Appendix B.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)(9)\n\nHow do I provide nutrition labeling when my product contains two or more packets of supplements (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening)?\n\nYou may present the information for each packet (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening) in an individual nutrition label or you may use an aggregate nutrition label. For two packets, this would consist of five columns. List all of the dietary ingredients in the first column. List the amounts and percents of the morning packet in the second and third columns and similar information for the evening packet in the fourth and fifth columns (see the illustration of aggregate nutrition labeling in 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iii)).\n\nCompliance\n\nWhat kind of samples will FDA collect to determine compliance with 21 CFR 101.36?\n\nFDA will collect a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller. FDA will randomly select these packages.\n\nWhat if it is not technically feasible for me to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements?\n\nFDA may permit you to use an alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9). If your firm needs such special allowances, you must make your request in writing to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(f)(2)\n\nMust dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?\n\nFor dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value.\n\nExemptions\n\nWhat are the circumstances in which my dietary supplement products would be exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements? Your dietary supplement product is not required to have a ""Supplement Facts"" panel if: a. Your firm is a small business that has not more than $50,000 gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers or not more than $500,000 per year from total sales in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1); b. You sell less than 100,000 units of the product annually, your firm has fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(2) andyou file an annual notification with FDA as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(18)(iv); or c. You ship the product in bulk form, do not distribute it to consumers in such form, and you supply it for use in the manufacture of other dietary supplements in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(3). The two exemptions for small businesses and low-volume products (a. and b. above) are available to you only if your products\' labels bear no claims or other nutrition information.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(h)(1) - (3)\n\nSpecial Labeling Provisions\n\nWhat are small packages?\n\nSmall packages are those packages having less than 12 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)\n\nWhat is the telephone provision for small packages?\n\nIn lieu of a ""Supplement Facts"" panel, you may print labels for small packages with a telephone number or address that consumers can use to obtain nutrition information. You may use a telephone number or an address in place of the ""Supplement Facts"" panel only if you place no claims or other nutrition information on the product label.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size that I may use for small packages?\n\nYou may use a type size no smaller than 4-5 point for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on the labels of small packages.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(i)\n\nMay I use a tabular or linear format for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on a small package?\n\nYes. You may use a tabular format on small packages. You also may present ""Supplement Facts"" information in a linear (i.e., string) fashion if the label will not accommodate the ""Supplement Facts"" panel in a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j) (13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display.)\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n\nWhat are intermediate-sized packages?\n\nIntermediate-sized packages are those packages having from 12 to 40 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(ii)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size for intermediate-sized packages?The ""Supplement Facts"" panel on the labels of intermediate-sized packages must use type size no smaller than 6 point, except that type no smaller than 4-5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches that list more than 16 dietary ingredients. Also, 4-5 point type may be used on packages with less than 20 square inches that list more than 8 dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the type size used in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on an inner container may be as small as needed to accommodate all required information if the ""Supplement Facts"" on the outer container meets these type size requirements.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv)\n51. May I use a tabular or linear format for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on an intermediate-sized package? You may use a tabular format on an intermediate-sized package if the package shape or size cannot accommodate vertical columns. You may use a linear format if the label will not accommodate a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n52. May I abbreviate on the labels of intermediate- sized packages? You may use the abbreviations in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B) in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel for small and intermediate-sized packages, e.g, ""Serv size"" for ""Serving Size"" and ""Servings"" for ""Servings Per Container.""\n\n21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B)\n53. Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

A mineral;\n\nAn herb or other botanical;\n\nAn amino acid;\n\nA dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or\n\nA concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or a combination of any ingredient mentioned above. Further, dietary supplements are products intended for ingestion, are not represented for use as a conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or the diet, and are labeled as dietary supplements. The complete statutory definition is found in section 201(ff) of Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321).\n\nWhat label statements are required on the containers and packages of dietary supplements? Five statements are required: 1) the statement of identity (name of the dietary supplement), 2) the net quantity of contents statement (amount of the dietary supplement), 3) the nutrition labeling, 4) the ingredient list, and 5) the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor.\n\n21 CFR 101.3(a), 21 CFR 101.105(a), 21 CFR 101.36, 21 CFR 101.4(a)(1), and 21 CFR 101.5\n\nWhere do I place the required label statements? You must place all required label statements either on the front label panel (the principal display panel) or on the information panel (usually the label panel immediately to the right of the principal display panel, as seen by the consumer when facing the product), unless otherwise specified by regulation (i.e., exemptions).\n\n21 CFR 101.2(b) and (d), 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13) and (j)(17), 21 CFR 101.36(g), (i)(2) and (i) (5)\n\nWhat label statements must I place on the principal display panel? You must place the statement of identity and the net quantity of contents statement on the principal display panel. Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, you must place this information on each alternate principal display panel.\n\n21 CFR 101.1, 21 CFR 101.3(a) and 21 CFR 101.105(a)\n\nHow do I locate the principal display panel? The principal display panel of the label is the portion of the package that is most likely to be seen by the consumer at the time of display for retail purchase. Many containers are designed with two or more different surfaces that are suitable for use as the principal display panel. These are alternate principal display panels.\n\n6 What label statements must I place on the information panel?\n\nYou must place the ""Supplement Facts"" panel, the ingredient list, and the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor on the information panel if such information does not appear on the principal display panel, except that if space is insufficient, you may use the special provisions on the ""Supplement Facts"" panel in 21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(iii) and (i)(5). See questions 46 and 56 in Chapter IV for more details.\n\n7 Where is the information panel?\n\nThe information panel is located immediately to the right of the principal display panel as the product is displayed to the consumer. If this panel is not usable, due to package design and construction (e.g. folded flaps), the panel immediately contiguous and to the right of this part may be used for the information panel. The information panel may be any adjacent panel when the top of a container is the principal display panel.\n\n8 What name and address must I list on the label of my product?\n\nYou must list the street address if it is not listed in a current city directory or telephone book, the city or town, the state, and zip code. You may list the address of the principal place of business in lieu of the actual address.\n\n9 May I place intervening material on the information panel?\n\nNo. You may not place intervening material, which is defined as label information that is not required (e.g., UPC bar code), between label information that is required on the information panel.\n\nWhat type size, prominence and conspicuousness am I required to use on the principal display panel and the information panel?\n\nYou are required to use a print or type size that is prominent, conspicuous and easy to read. The letters must be at least one-sixteenth (1/16) inch in height based on the lower case letter ""o,"" and not be more than three times as high as they are wide, unless you petition for an exemption in accordance with 21 CFR 101.2(f). The lettering must contrast sufficiently (it does not need to be black and white) with the background so as to be easy to read. See Chapter IV for the type size requirements for the nutrition label.\n\nDo I need to specify the country of origin if my product, or the ingredients in my product, is not from the United States?\n\nYes. Unless excepted by law, the Tariff Act requires that every article of foreign origin (or its container) imported into the United States conspicuously indicate the English name of the country of origin of the article.\n\nSection 304, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 304)\n* 12.Who regulates the statement ""Made in the U. S. A.""? FDA does not have regulatory authority over such statements. The U.S. Customs Service regulates country of origin marking (i.e., ""Made in the U.S.A."") as authorized by the Tariff Act of 1930. Their website is www.customs.ustreas.gov.\n* 13.How do I obtain a UPC bar code? The UPC bar code may be obtained from the Uniform Code Council. Their website is www.uc-council.org. Click on the button that says ""I Need a UPC Bar Code.""\n* 14.Must expiration dating be included on the label of dietary supplements? No. However, a firm may include this information if it is supported by valid data demonstrating that it is not false or misleading.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter I.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , How do I provide the ""Supplement Facts"" panel if my dietary supplements are sold from bulk containers?\n--------------------\nContext: Small Entity Compliance Guide on Structure/Function Claims\n\nJANUARY 2002\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (P.L. 104-121). This guidance document restates in plain language the legal requirements set forth in a regulation concerning labeling claims for dietary supplements. This is a Level 2 guidance document published for immediate implementation in accordance with FDA\'s good guidance practices (21 CFR 10.115). The regulations are binding and have the force and effect of law. However, this guidance document represents the agency\'s current thinking on this subject and does not, itself, create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute and regulations.\n\nSummary\n\nOn January 6, 2000, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a final rule in the Federal Register defining the types of statements that may be used on the label and in the labeling of dietary supplements without prior review by the agency (65 FR 1000) (http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/(\\sim)lrd/fro00106.html ). Called structure/function claims, these claims are statements that describe the effect a dietary supplement may have on the structure or function of the body. The regulation also provides criteria to assist you in determining when a statement about a dietary supplement is a disease claim, that is, a claim to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease. Disease claims require prior approval by FDA and may be made only for products that are approved drug products or for foods under separate legal provisions that apply to claims called ""health claims.""\n\nThis guidance discusses only the requirements that apply to determining whether a claim is a structure/function claim or a disease claim. It should be noted that other regulations also cover labeling and packaging requirements for dietary supplements. These requirementswere published as final rules in the Federal Registers of September 23, 1997 (62 FR 49826), June 5, 1998 (63 FR 30615), and Jan 15, 1997 (62 FR 2218)\n\n(https://www.federalregister.gov/ (https://www.federalregister.gov/)) (see Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) Parts 101 and 111).(1).\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\nThe regulation added $101.93(f) and (g) to Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 101. These two sections define what types of claims are structure/function claims and what types of claims are disease claims. In addition to these definitions, the regulation includes criteria that are intended to assist you in determining whether a particular statement is or is not a disease claim. Finally, the preamble to this rule clarifies several legal issues that are important to understand if you use structure/function claims on the labels or in the labeling of your products. They are restated below.\n\nBasic Legal Requirements for Structure/Function Claims. What are structure/function claims? The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) added section 403(r)(6) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)2. This section of the law states that a dietary supplement may bear certain statements on its label or in its labeling if the claim meets certain requirements. Section 101.93(f) simply restates part of the definition of the types of claims that may be made under section 403(r)(6) of the FD&C Act. Section 101.93(f) reads: (f) Permitted structure/function statements. Dietary supplement labels or labeling may, subject to the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, bear statements that describe the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans or that characterize the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, provided that such statements are not disease claims under paragraph (g) of this section. If the label or labeling of a product marketed as a dietary supplement bears a disease claim as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, the product will be subject to regulation as a drug unless the claim is an authorized health claim for which the product qualifies. Are there other claims that can be made for dietary supplements under this section of the law? Yes. Section 403(r)(6) also states that dietary supplements can use claims about nutrient deficiency diseases (for example, vitamin C and scurvy) or that describe the effect of the dietary supplement on general well-being. What requirements must I meet to make any of these types of claims for my dietary supplement?There are three requirements you must meet. First, the law says you can make these claims if you have substantiation that the claims are truthful and not misleading. You must have this substantiation before you make the claims. Second, you must notify FDA that you are using the claim within 30 days of first marketing your product. Third, the claim must include a mandatory disclaimer statement that is provided for in the law.\nWhere can I find information on the mandatory disclaimer and the notification I need to send in?\n\nWe have published regulations that describe exactly what the disclaimer must say and what you must include in your notification to us and where you must send it in the September 23, 1997 Federal Register (62 FR 49859 and 49883, respectively). These requirements can be found in 21 CFR 101.93(b) through (e) and 21 CFR 101.93(a), respectively.\nB. When and What You Must Do To Comply With the New Regulation.**\n\nWhen does this rule become effective?\n\nThe rule became effective on February 7, 2000, for any products marketed for the first time after publication of the final rule or for any new claims made for an existing product after publication of the final rule (i.e., new claims made after January 6, 2000).\nIf I have existing inventory, do I need to re-label it now?\n\nLarge businesses had until January 7, 2001, to bring existing claims on products into compliance. FDA granted this period for firms to use up their label inventories. Small businesses had until July 7, 2001, to bring existing claims on products into compliance. Any existing inventory not used up after these dates would need to be relabeled.\nC. How Do I Determine if a Claim is a Structure/Function Claim or a Disease Claim?\n\nIt may not be possible always to draw a bright line between structure/function and disease claims. You should look at the objective evidence in your labeling to assess whether a claim explicitly or implicitly is a disease claim. For example, a statement may not mention a disease but may refer to identifiable characteristic signs or symptoms of a disease such that the intended use of the product to treat or prevent the disease may be inferred. It is important that you keep in mind two things. First, the context of the statement, decided from information on the label and in other labeling, will determine if the statement is considered to be a disease claim. Second, dietary supplements may not bear disease claims, explicit or implied, unless the claim has undergone premarket review by FDA and has been authorized or approved under the rules for health claims or drugs, as appropriate. To assist you in deciding whether a claim is or isn\'t a disease claim, the new regulation contains a definition for disease, and then includes 10 criteria intended to help clarify the types of claims that may be made for dietary supplements without prior authorization or approval by FDA. We are providing that disease definition and an explanation of the 10 criteria below.\n\nWhat is the definition of a disease?Section 101.93(g) defines disease as:\n\n...damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition.\n\nWhat are the criteria for determining if a statement is a disease claim?\n\nThere are 10 criteria in the rule that are useful in determining if a statement is a disease claim.\n\nCriterion 1: Claims an effect on a disease or class of diseases (see section E, starting on page 1012 of the preamble to the rule).\n\nA statement is a disease claim if it mentions a specific disease or class of diseases. For example, a claim that a product is ""protective against the development of cancer"" or ""reduces the pain and stiffness associated with arthritis"" would be a disease claim.\n\nA statement also is a disease claim if it implies that it has an effect on a specific disease or class of diseases by using descriptions of the disease state. Examples of implied disease claims are ""relieves crushing chest pain (angina),"" ""improves joint mobility and reduces inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis),"" or ""relief of bronchospasm (asthma).""\n\nCriterion 2: Claims an effect on characteristic signs or symptoms of disease using scientific or lay terminology (see section F, starting on page 1015 of the preamble to the rule).\n\nHow can I tell if a particular claimed effect is a sign or symptom of a specific disease?\n\nThe test of whether claimed effects are characteristic signs or symptoms depends on 2 questions: (1) Is the condition, to which the signs and symptoms refer, related to a disease; and (2) are the signs and symptoms referred to in the labeling characteristic of the disease and permit the inference that the product is intended to affect that disease.\n\nDoes it matter if I don\'t use every sign or symptom of a condition or if I use layman\'s terms instead of technical language?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide on Structure:Function Claims'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.

It specifically explains how FDA intends to consider exercising enforcement discretion when a conflict occurs between compliance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), section 101.9(c), and compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(g) such that compliance with both sections is not possible.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nFDA\'s regulations in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 describe requirements for nutrition labeling in conventional foods and dietary supplements, respectively. The requirements for declaring the nutrient value in a serving of conventional food are in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8). Certain dietary ingredients in dietary supplements are also required to be declared in accordance with these requirements (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)). These dietary ingredients are listed in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2) and are referred to as ""(b)(2)-dietary ingredients."" Unlike nutrients in conventional food, the (b)(2)-dietary ingredients can only be declared when they are present in dietary supplements in amounts that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling according to 21 CFR 101.9(c) (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nFDA\'s regulations under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and (5) describe compliance requirements for declaring nutrients and dietary ingredients2 in nutrition labeling. A conventional food or dietary supplement declaring the amount of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in its labeling is misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)] if:\n\nFootnote 2: See 21 CFR 101.36(f)(1).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber is below 80 percent of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).3 Footnote 3: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of calories, total sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).4 Footnote 4: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).\n\nFor the remainder of this document, we refer to 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) as ""the compliance requirements.""\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nIn many cases, the amount of a nutrient or (b)(2)-dietary ingredient declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) will not conflict with the compliance requirements. However, certain small amounts of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients cannot be declared in accordance with both 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) and the compliance requirements. In these cases, the amount declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) is below or above the level provided by the compliance requirements.\n\nExample 1 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(iv), monounsaturated fat content must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams. Therefore, if the analyzed value of monounsaturated fat is 0.75 to 1.00 grams, the amount of monounsaturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 1.00 gram (or 1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value is 0.80 gram or greater. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value of monounsaturatedfat is 0.75 to 0.79 gram because values in this range are not at least equal to 80 percent of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 1 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are below 80 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are greater than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable excesses of nutrients, such as monounsaturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nExample 2 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i), saturated fat must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams, unless the amount is less than 0.5 gram. Therefore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.50 to 0.74 gram, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 0.50 gram (0.5g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 0.50 to 0.60 gram. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.61 to 0.74 gram because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 0.50 gram.\n\nFurthermore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 1.00 to 1.24 grams, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i) is 1.00 gram (1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.20 grams or less. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.21 to 1.24 grams because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 2 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are above 20 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are less than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable deficiencies of nutrients, such as saturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nFor certain nutrients, such as total fat and its components (including monounsaturated fat and saturated fat), if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the amount must be expressed as zero in nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(c)). Unlike nutrients in conventional food, (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in dietary supplements must not be declared in nutrition labeling when the amount is zero (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nIV FDA\'s Policy\n\nAs discussed, when the analyzed value of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients present in small amounts is declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8), the declared amount may conflict with the compliance requirements. In such cases, we intend to consider the use of our enforcement discretion with respect to the compliance requirements and recommend that manufacturers declare nutrients and (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels']","['The retailer must display a ""Supplement Facts"" panel clearly at the point of purchase (e.g. on a counter card, sign, tag affixed to the product, or some other appropriate device).

However, experience gained with the implementation of ICH Q7 since the approval in November 2000 shows that uncertainties related to the interpretation of some sections exist. Furthermore, the importance of the application of the life-cycle approach addressed in the new ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, Q10 Guidelines to API manufacturing procedures is emphasized by the ICH Quality Implementation Working Group (Quality IWG). Technical issues with regard to GMP of APIs - also in context with new ICH Guidelines - need to be addressed in order to harmonize expectations during inspections.\n\nA document would be helpful in removing these ambiguities and uncertainties and also in harmonizing the inspections of both small molecules and biotech APIs.\n\nIssues to be resolved\n\nThe following issues have so far been identified by practical experience and will need to be addressed in a Q&A document on Q7:\n\nOutput from the review of existing Q&As (e.g., from PIC/S Expert Circle on APIs, from initial Regulatory/PDA training 2002) currently underway by PIC/S teams will be considered for endorsement.\n\nTechnical issues for clarification such as application in the supply chain control, contractor/supplier management (outsourcing), monitoring of impurity profiles, quality systems, applicability to biologicals/biotech and relationship with Q5D, and GMP expectations in the development phase (manufacturing for clinical trials).\n\nImpact of the implementation of ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, and Q10 on Q7 (see also Quality IWG Q&As and Points to Consider).\n\nBackground to the Proposal\n\nIt has become apparent, based on the approval and implementation of ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11 principles into GMP of APIs that certain individual implementation approaches are leading to non harmonized interpretation and new expectations beyond the intention of ICH Q7. The Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme (PIC/S) launched the 'International Collaboration on APIs - Training programme on ICH Q7'. This training programme includes a basic training, an advanced training and a Q&A document on interpretation of ICH Q7. This provides a feedback by the global knowledge of its network of inspectors. PIC/S will be supportive of the Q7 IWG work.\n\nType of Implementation Working Group and Resources\n\nThe Q7 IWG should comprise of the Six ICH Parties (2 experts per Party), Observers to ICH (1 expert per Observer), RHIs, DRAs and DoH (1 expert per RHI/DRA/DoH), and Interested Parties (WSNI, IGPA, Biotechnology Industry, PIC/S, API Industry and CEP programme of EDQM, 1 expert per Interested Party).\n\nTiming\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Q&As Concept Paper""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: An exception can be made for retrospective validation for well established processes that have been used without significant changes to API quality due to changes in raw materials, equipment, systems, facilities, or the production process. This validation approach may be used where:\n\nCritical quality attributes and critical process parameters have been identified;\n\nAppropriate in-process acceptance criteria and controls have been established;\n\nThere have not been significant process/product failures attributable to causes other than operator error or equipment failures unrelated to equipment suitability; and\n\nImpurity profiles have been established for the existing API.\n\nBatches selected for retrospective validation should be representative of all batches made during the review period, including any batches that failed to meet specifications, and should be sufficient in number to demonstrate process consistency.

For prospective and concurrent validation, three consecutive successful production batches should be used as a guide, but there may be situations where additional process runs are warranted to prove consistency of the process (e.g., complex API processes or API processes with prolonged completion times). For retrospective validation, generally data from ten to thirty consecutive batches should be examined to assess process consistency, but fewer batches can be examined if justified.\n\nCritical process parameters should be controlled and monitored during process validation studies. Process parameters unrelated to quality, such as variables controlled to minimize energy consumption or equipment use, need not be included in the process validation.\n\nProcess validation should confirm that the impurity profile for each API is within the limits specified.

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: Prospective validation should normally be performed for all API processes as defined in 12.1. Prospective validation of an API process should be completed before the commercial distribution of the final drug product manufactured from that API. (12.42)\n\nConcurrent validation can be conducted when data from replicate production runs are unavailable because only a limited number of API batches have been produced, API batches are produced infrequently, or API batches are produced by a validated process that has been modified. Prior to the completion of concurrent validation, batches can be released and used in final drug product for commercial distribution based on thorough monitoring and testing of the API batches. (12.43)\n\nAn exception can be made for retrospective validation of well-established processes that have been used without significant changes to API quality due to changes in raw materials, equipment, systems, facilities, or the production process. This validation approach may be used where the following apply: (12.44)\n\nCritical quality attributes and critical process parameters have been identified\n\nAppropriate in-process acceptance criteria and controls have been established\n\nThere have not been significant process/product failures attributable to causes other than operator error or equipment failures unrelated to equipment suitability\n\nImpurity profiles have been established for the existing API\n\nBatches selected for retrospective validation should be representative of all batches produced during the review period, including any batches that failed to meet specifications, and should be sufficient in number to demonstrate process consistency. Retained samples can be tested to obtain data to retrospectively validate the process. (12.45)\n\nProcess Validation Program (12.5)\n\nThe number of process runs for validation should depend on the complexity of the process or the magnitude of the process change being considered. For prospective and concurrent validation, three consecutive successful production batches should be used as a guide, but there may be situations where additional process runs are warranted to prove consistency of the process (e.g., complex API processes or API processes with prolonged completion times). For retrospective validation, generally data from 10 to 30 consecutive batches should be examined to assess process consistency, but fewer batches can be examined if justified. (12.50)Critical process parameters should be controlled and monitored during process validation studies. Process parameters unrelated to quality, such as variables controlled to minimize energy consumption or equipment use, need not be included in the process validation. (12.51)\n\nProcess validation should confirm that the impurity profile for each API is within the limits specified. The impurity profile should be comparable to, or better than, historical data and, where applicable, the profile determined during process development or for batches used for pivotal clinical and toxicological studies. (12.52)\n\nPeriodic Review of Validated Systems (12.6)\n\nSystems and processes should be periodically evaluated to verify that they are still operating in a valid manner. Where no significant changes have been made to the system or process, and a quality review confirms that the system or process is consistently producing material meeting its specifications, there is normally no need for revalidation. (12.60)\n\nCleaning Validation (12.7)\n\nCleaning procedures should normally be validated. In general, cleaning validation should be directed to situations or process steps where contamination or carryover of materials poses the greatest risk to API quality. For example, in early production it may be unnecessary to validate equipment cleaning procedures where residues are removed by subsequent purification steps. (12.70)\n\nValidation of cleaning procedures should reflect actual equipment usage patterns. If various APIs or intermediates are manufactured in the same equipment and the equipment is cleaned by the same process, a representative intermediate or API can be selected for cleaning validation. This selection should be based on the solubility and difficulty of cleaning and the calculation of residue limits based on potency, toxicity, and stability. (12.71)\n\nThe cleaning validation protocol should describe the equipment to be cleaned, procedures, materials, acceptable cleaning levels, parameters to be monitored and controlled, and analytical methods. The protocol should also indicate the type of samples to be obtained and how they are collected and labeled. (12.72)\n\nSampling should include swabing, rinsing, or alternative methods (e.g., direct extraction), as appropriate, to detect both insoluble and soluble residues. The sampling methods used should be capable of quantitatively measuring levels of residues remaining on the equipment surfaces after cleaning. Swab sampling may be impractical when product contact surfaces are not easily accessible due to equipment design and/or process limitations (e.g., inner surfaces of hoses, transfer pipes, reactor tanks with small ports or handling toxic materials, and small intricate equipment such as micronizers and microfluidizers). (12.73)\n\nValidated analytical methods having sensitivity to detect residues or contaminants should be used. The detection limit for each analytical method should be sufficiently sensitive to detect the established acceptable level of the residue or contaminant. The method's attainable recovery level should be established. Residue limits should be practical, achievable, verifiable, and based on the most deleterious residue. Limits can be established based on the minimum known pharmacological, toxicological, or physiological activity of the API or its most deleterious component. (12.74)\n\nEquipment cleaning/sanitation studies should address microbiological and endotoxin contamination for those processes where there is a need to reduce total microbiological count or endotoxins in the API, or other processes where such contamination could be of concern (e.g., non-sterile APIs used to manufacture sterile products). (12.75)\n\nCleaning procedures should be monitored at appropriate intervals after validation to ensure that these procedures are effective when used during routine production. Equipment cleanliness can be monitored by analytical testing and visual examination, where feasible. Visual inspection can allow detection of gross contamination concentrated in small areas that could otherwise go undetected by sampling and/or analysis. (12.76)\n\nValidation of Analytical Methods (12.8)\n\nAnalytical methods should be validated unless the method employed is included in the relevant pharmacopoeia or other recognized standard reference. The suitability of all testing methods used should nonetheless be verified under actual conditions of use and documented. (12.80)\n\nMethods should be validated to include consideration of characteristics included within the ICH guidances on validation of analytical methods. The degree of analytical validation performed should reflect the purpose of the analysis and the stage of the API production process. (12.81)\n\nAppropriate qualification of analytical equipment should be considered before initiating validation of analytical methods. (12.82)\n\nComplete records should be maintained of any modification of a validated analytical method. Such records should include the reason for the modification and appropriate data to verify that the modification produces results that are as accurate and reliable as the established method. (12.83)\n\nChange Control (13)\n\nA formal change control system should be established to evaluate all changes that could affect the production and control of the intermediate or API. (13.10)\n\nWritten procedures should provide for the identification, documentation, appropriate review, and approval of changes in raw materials, specifications, analytical methods, facilities, support systems, equipment (including computer hardware), processing steps, labeling and packaging materials, and computer software. (13.11)\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAny proposals for GMP relevant changes should be drafted, reviewed, and approved by the appropriate organizational units and reviewed and approved by the quality unit(s). (13.12)\n\nThe potential impact of the proposed change on the quality of the intermediate or API should be evaluated. A classification procedure may help in determining the level of testing, validation, and documentation needed to justify changes to a validated process. Changes can be classified (e.g., as minor or major) depending on the nature and extent of the changes, and the effects these changes may impart on the process. Scientific judgment should determine what additional testing and validation studies are appropriate to justify a change in a validated process. (13.13)\n\nWhen implementing approved changes, measures should be taken to ensure that all documents affected by the changes are revised. (13.14)\n\nAfter the change has been implemented, there should be an evaluation of the first batches produced or tested under the change. (13.15)\n\nThe potential for critical changes to affect established retest or expiry dates should be evaluated. If necessary, samples of the intermediate or API produced by the modified process can be placed on an accelerated stability program and/or can be added to the stability monitoring program. (13.16)\n\nCurrent dosage form manufacturers should be notified of changes from established production and process control procedures that can affect the quality of the API. (13.17)\n\nXiv Rejection and Re-Use of Materials (14)\n\nRejection (14.1)\n\nIntermediates and APIs failing to meet established specifications should be identified as such and quarantined. These intermediates or APIs can be reprocessed or reworked as described below.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: In summary, the CGMP regulations require that manufacturing processes be designed and controlled to assure that in-process materials and the finished product meet predetermined quality requirements and do so consistently and reliably.\n\nIV Recommendations\n\nIn the following sections, we describe general considerations for process validation, the recommended stages of process validation, and specific activities for each stage in the product lifecycle.\n\nGeneral Considerations for Process Validation\n\nIn all stages of the product lifecycle, good project management and good archiving that capture scientific knowledge will make the process validation program more effective and efficient. The following practices should ensure uniform collection and assessment of information about the process and enhance the accessibility of such information later in the product lifecycle.\n\nWe recommend an integrated team approach11 to process validation that includes expertise from a variety of disciplines (e.g., process engineering, industrial pharmacy, analytical chemistry, microbiology, statistics, manufacturing, and quality assurance). Project plans, along with the full support of senior management, are essential elements for success. Footnote 11: This concept is discussed in more detail in FDA’s guidance for industry, Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations, available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatory/Information/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nThroughout the product lifecycle, various studies can be initiated to discover, observe, correlate, or confirm information about the product and process. All studies should be planned and conducted according to sound scientific principles, appropriately documented, and approved in accordance with the established procedure appropriate for the stage of the lifecycle.\n\nThe terms attribute(s) (e.g., quality, product, component) and parameter(s) (e.g., process, operating, and equipment) are not categorized with respect to criticality in this guidance. With a lifecycle approach to process validation that employs risk based decision making throughout that lifecycle, the perception of criticality as a continuum rather than a binary state is more useful. All attributes and parameters should be evaluated in terms of their roles in the process and impact on the product or in-process material, and reevaluated as new information becomes available. The degree of control over those attributes or parameters should be commensurate with their risk to the process and process output. In other words, a higher degree of control is appropriate for attributes or parameters that pose a higher risk. The Agency recognizes that terminology usage can vary and expects that each manufacturer will communicate the meaning and intent of its terminology and categorization to the Agency.\n\nMany products are single-source or involve complicated manufacturing processes. Homogeneity within a batch and consistency between batches are goals of process validation activities. Validation offers assurance that a process is reasonably protected against sources of variability that could affect production output, cause supply problems, and negatively affect public health.\n\nStage 1 -- Process Design\n\nProcess design is the activity of defining the commercial manufacturing process that will be reflected in planned master production and control records. The goal of this stage is to design a process suitable for routine commercial manufacturing that can consistently deliver a product that meets its quality attributes.\n\nii.2.1 Building and Capturing Process Knowledge and Understanding\n\nGenerally, early process design experiments do not need to be performed under the CGMP conditions required for drugs intended for commercial distribution that are manufactured during Stage 2 (process qualification) and Stage 3 (continued process verification). They should, however, be conducted in accordance with sound scientific methods and principles, including good documentation practices. This recommendation is consistent with ICH Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality System.12 Decisions and justification of the controls should be sufficiently documented and internally reviewed to verify and preserve their value for use or adaptation later in the lifecycle of the process and product.\n\nFootnote 12: Available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nAlthough often performed at small-scale laboratories, most viral inactivation and impurity clearance studies cannot be considered early process design experiments. Viral and impurity clearance studies intended to evaluate and estimate product quality at commercial scale should have a level of quality unit oversight that will ensure that the studies follow sound scientific methods and principles and the conclusions are supported by the data.\n\nProduct development activities provide key inputs to the process design stage, such as the intended dosage form, the quality attributes, and a general manufacturing pathway. Process information available from product development activities can be leveraged in the process design stage. The functionality and limitations of commercial manufacturing equipment should be considered in the process design, as well as predicted contributions to variability posed by different component lots, production operators, environmental conditions, and measurement systems in the production setting. However, the full spectrum of input variability typical of commercial production is not generally known at this stage. Laboratory or pilot-scale models designed to be representative of the commercial process can be used to estimate variability.\n\nDesigning an efficient process with an effective process control approach is dependent on the process knowledge and understanding obtained. Design of Experiment (DOE) studies can help develop process knowledge by revealing relationships, including multivariate interactions, between the variable inputs (e.g., component characteristics 13 or process parameters) and the resulting outputs (e.g., in-process material, intermediates, or the final product). Risk analysis tools can be used to screen potential variables for DOE studies to minimize the total number of experiments conducted while maximizing knowledge gained. The results of DOE studies can provide justification for establishing ranges of incoming component quality, equipmentparameters, and in-process material quality attributes. FDA does not generally expect manufacturers to develop and test the process until it fails.\n\nOther activities, such as experiments or demonstrations at laboratory or pilot scale, also assist in evaluation of certain conditions and prediction of performance of the commercial process. These activities also provide information that can be used to model or simulate the commercial process. Computer-based or virtual simulations of certain unit operations or dynamics can provide process understanding and help avoid problems at commercial scale. It is important to understand the degree to which models represent the commercial process, including any differences that might exist, as this may have an impact on the relevance of information derived from the models.\n\nIt is essential that activities and studies resulting in process understanding be documented. Documentation should reflect the basis for decisions made about the process. For example, manufacturers should document the variables studied for a unit operation and the rationale for those variables identified as significant. This information is useful during the process qualification and continued process verification stages, including when the design is revised or the strategy for control is refined or changed.\n\nii.2.2 Establishing a Strategy for Process Control\n\nProcess knowledge and understanding is the basis for establishing an approach to process control for each unit operation and the process overall. Strategies for process control can be designed to reduce input variation, adjust for input variation during manufacturing (and so reduce its impact on the output), or combine both approaches.\n\nProcess controls address variability to assure quality of the product. Controls can consist of material analysis and equipment monitoring at significant processing points (SS 211.110(c)). Decisions regarding the type and extent of process controls can be aided by earlier risk assessments, then enhanced and improved as process experience is gained.\n\nFDA expects controls to include both examination of material quality and equipment monitoring. Special attention to control the process through operational limits and in-process monitoring is essential in two possible scenarios:\n\nWhen the product attribute is not readily measurable due to limitations of sampling or detectability (e.g., viral clearance or microbial contamination) or\n\nWhen intermediates and products cannot be highly characterized and well-defined quality attributes cannot be identified.\n\nThese controls are established in the master production and control records (see SS 211.186(a) and (b)(9)).\n\nMore advanced strategies, which may involve the use of process analytical technology (PAT), can include timely analysis and control loops to adjust the processing conditions so that the output remains constant. Manufacturing systems of this type can provide a higher degree of process control than non-PAT systems. In the case of a strategy using PAT, the approach to process qualification will differ from that used in other process designs. Further information on PAT processes can be found in FDA's guidance for industry on PAT -- A Framework for Innovative Pharmaceutical Development, Manufacturing, and Quality Assurance.14\n--------------------\nContext title: Process Validation- General Principles and Practices Guidance for Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: Manufacturers should seek regulatory approval before implementing a conversion of an approved batch process to a CM process. Manufacturers can seek advice from the regulatory authority to gain clarification on the regulatory expectations and acceptability of their strategy and data package for the proposed changes (e.g., when potential changes in formulation are necessary to enable conversion to CM and the impact of these changes on product registration).\n\nProcess Validation\n\nThe requirements for process validation as established by region are similar for CM and batch manufacturing processes. Approaches such as traditional process validation that uses a fixed number of validation batches or continuous process verification can be used.\n\nWhen continuous process verification is used, the CM system performance and output material quality is continuously monitored, such that the real-time data collected demonstrate the maintenance of a state of control and production of output material with the desired quality for the run time duration. The use of continuous process verification should be justified based on the product and process understanding, system design, and overall control strategy. This justification should be provided in the dossier (see Table 1 below).\n\nWhen a continuous process verification approach is used to support initial product launch, applicants should justify the appropriateness of the validation activities to provide confidence in the commercial manufacturing process.\n\nPharmaceutical Quality System\n\nPQS expectations are the same for batch and CM processes and should follow pertinent ICH guidelines. One important operational aspect of CM is that non-conforming materials can be diverted from the rest of the batch when material traceability, process monitoring, and material diversion strategies are well established. Procedures for material diversion, when required, should be established under the PQS (see Section 4.2). An overarching plan or decision tree that describes how disturbances are managed for various types of material diversion should be maintained under the PQS. Diverted materials resulting from planned events (e.g., system start-up and shutdown) generally do not require investigation when the events meet established process performance criteria. Examples of approaches for managing disturbances are provided in Annex V. As described therein, when unexpected and/or frequent disturbances occur, appropriate investigation, root cause analysis, and corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) should be instituted.\n\nLifecycle Management\n\nThe principles and approaches described in ICH Q12 are applicable to the lifecycle management of CM.\n\nSubmission of CM-Specific Information in the CTD\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_Q13_Step4_Guideline_2022_1116']","['Prospective validation is normally expected for processes introduced since the publication of ICH Q7.

OBJECTIVE\n\nA. Criteria for Exercise of Enforcement Discretion\n\nB. Procedures\n\nFiling Review\n\nPrioritization\n\nOpportunity for Public Comment\n\nScientific Review\n\nConsolidation of Like Petitions\n\nConsultation with Other Federal Agencies\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\nA Criteria for Exercise of Enforcement Discretion FDA plans to establish criteria for considering exercising enforcement discretion for qualified health claims based on the extent to which the totality of the publicly available evidence supports the claim (see Guidance for Industry and FDA: Interim Evidence-based Ranking System for Scientific Data). Different levels of evidence will result in different qualifying language as described in Table 1, which provides standardized language for the B, C, and D categories to be used as part of the qualifying language for qualified health claims until consumer research [3] is complete.\n\nProcedures\n\nFiling Review FDA plans to begin accepting petitions for qualified health claims on September 1, 2003. Within 45 days of receipt of a qualified health claim petition, FDA intends to determine whether the petition is complete (see Section C below). If the petition is incomplete, the agency plans to inform the petitioner of the deficiencies and what steps the petitioner should take to rectify these deficiencies. If FDA determines that the petition is complete, it intends to file the petition. The agency recognizes that it can evaluate petitions more efficiently and effectively if they are well-organized and contain all the relevant information. FDA encourages potential petitioners to meet with the agency prior to preparing a petition to discuss their plans.\n\nPrioritization\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{56.9pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \\hline\nScientific Ranking & FDA & \\\nRanking & Category & Appropriate Qualifying Language*** \\ \\hline Second Level & B &... “although there is scientific evidence supporting the claim, the evidence is not conclusive.” \\ \\hline Third Level & C & “Some scientific evidence suggests... however, FDA has determined that this evidence is limited and not conclusive.” \\ \\hline Fourth Level & D & “Very limited and preliminary scientific research suggests... FDA concludes that there is little scientific evidence supporting this claim.” \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nFrom Guidance for Industry and FDA: Interim Evidence-based Ranking System for Scientific Data.\n\n***The language reflects wording used in qualified health claims as to which the agency has previously exercised enforcement discretion for certain dietary supplements. During this interim period, the precise language as to which the agency considers exercising enforcement discretion may vary depending on the specific circumstances of each case.\n\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Standardized Qualifying Language for Qualified Health Claims.\n\nFDA has only limited resources for reviewing health claims. Thus, to maximize the public health benefit of its claims review process, FDA intends to prioritize on a case-by-case basis all complete petitions according to several factors, including whether the food or dietary supplement that is the subject of the petition is likely to have a significant impact on a serious or life-threatening illness; the strength of the evidence; whether consumer research has been provided to show the claim is not misleading; whether the substance of the claim has undergone an FDA safety review (i.e., is an authorized food additive, has been GRAS (generally recognized as safe) affirmed, listed, or has received a letter of ""no objection"" to a GRAS notification); whether the substance that is the subject of the claim has been adequately characterized so that the relevance of available studies can be evaluated; whether the disease is defined and evaluated in accordance with generally accepted criteria established by a recognized body of qualified experts; and whether there is prior review of the evidence or the claim by a recognized body of qualified experts.\n3. Opportunity for Public Comment Upon filing of a petition, FDA intends to post the petition on its website and request public comment for 60 days. FDA plans to post comments submitted by the public on FDA\'s website or to make comments available for public review at the Division of Dockets Management, HFA-305.\n4. Scientific Review After the comment period closes, FDA may pursue any one of several options for scientific review of data submitted in a petition in support of the substance/disease relationship. For example, FDA may conduct the review internally, it may convene an advisory subcommittee, or it may use appropriate third-party reviewers under contract to FDA, e.g., the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research (AHRQ). In the case of a petition forwarded to AHRQ, AHRQ plans to send the petition to an Evidence-Based Practice Center (EPC) with which it has a contract to review the scientific evidence in the petition and to rank the degree of scientific certainty of the validity of the substance/disease relationship. AHRQ also plans to ask the EPC to review those science-related public comments received by FDA that discuss or provide evidence. Within 120 days after the commencement of the third party review, FDA would expect to receive a report that includes a description of the evidence reviewed, an analysis of that evidence, a summary of and response to public comments that pertain to the evidence, and its assessment as to the degree of scientific certainty in support of the substance/disease relationship.\n5. Consolidation of Like Petitions_If FDA receives more than one petition for a qualified health claim that describes the same relationship between a substance and a disease or health-related condition during its review, the agency plans to consolidate all of the related petitions received, if appropriate.\n6. _Consultation with Other Federal Agencies To fully inform FDA\'s review, FDA intends, as appropriate, on a case-by-case-basis, to consult with other scientific Federal agencies with official responsibility for public health protection or research related to human nutrition and dietary supplements.\n7. Regulatory Decision As mentioned above, FDA plans to either conduct its own review or use an appropriate third party to conduct a scientific review. In the case of third party review, after FDA receives, for example the EPC report, FDA intends, based on the totality of the publicly available evidence, public comment, and other relevant regulatory considerations, to determine whether to consider exercising enforcement discretion with respect to the proposed claim. If FDA decides to consider exercising enforcement discretion, the agency plans to determine what qualifying statement(s) and other information should accompany the claim to ensure that it is truthful and not misleading. In reaching its determination, FDA intends to review and evaluate the third party report, the totality of the publicly available evidence, and all of the public comments submitted within the comment period, as well as consider how the proposed qualified claim will affect consumers\' dietary choices. FDA also intends to consider whether to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to other requirements in 21 CFR 101.14, and what other factors, in addition to qualifying language, are relevant to considering the exercise of enforcement discretion.\n8. Notification to Petitioner On or before day 270 after receipt of the filed petition, FDA plans to notify the petitioner in a letter of: a) the agency\'s determination; b) the basis for its determination; and c) if the agency decides to consider exercising enforcement discretion, the qualified claim for which the agency intends to consider exercising such discretion and the provisions of 21 CFR 101.14 for which the agency intends to consider exercising such discretion. FDA also plans to notify the petitioner of any other factors the agency intends to consider in deciding whether to exercise enforcement discretion when the claim appears in labeling of conventional human food or dietary supplements. FDA plans to post the letter and any third party report on the agency\'s website.\n9. _Extensions_If the agency determines that it is appropriate, upon good cause, FDA may, decide to extend by 30-60 days the time period to notify the petitioner.\n\nReconsideration\n\nIf a petitioner or other party disagrees with an FDA determination, that party may request reconsideration. FDA intends to reconsider its determination if the party presents significant new relevant evidence or provides a persuasive analysis that the agency\'s interpretation of the original evidence was incorrect. FDA intends to use the same process described above for reconsideration of the agency\'s determination. FDA may, on its own initiative, decide to reconsider a determination.\n\nContent of Petitions\n\nRequirements\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What do you mean by ""recognized antioxidant activity""?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance Document\n\nGuidance for Industry: FDA\'s Implementation of Qualified Health Claims\n\nMAY 2006\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-fda-implementation-qualified-health-claims)\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nComments and suggestions regarding this document may be submitted at any time. Submit comments to Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852.\n\nFor questions regarding this document, contact the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) at 240-402-1450.\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration\'s (FDA\'s) current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You may use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nBackground\n\nWhy is FDA providing for ""qualified"" health claims?\n\nThrough the Better Nutrition Information for Consumer Health Initiative (see Consumer Health Information for Better Nutrition Initiative (/food/labeling:\n\nnutrition/consumer-health-information-better-nutrition-initiative-task-force-final-report), issued July 10, 2003), FDA acknowledged that consumers benefit from more information on food labels concerning diet and health. As part of this initiative, the agency established interim procedures whereby ""qualified"" health claims can be made not only for dietary supplements but for conventional foods as well (see Interim\n\nProcedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food\n\nAn example of dietary guidance, which does not refer to a specific substance but rather refers to a broad class of foods without an expressed or implied connection to a specific substance that is present the class of foods is: ""Diets rich in fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of some types of cancer"". One element is present, but not both. It is not a health claim because it cannot reasonably be understood to be about a specific substance. A dietary guidance statement that refers to a specific food or food component but not a disease or health-related condition is: ""Carrots are good for your health, "" or ""Calcium is good for you."" Again, one element is present, but not both.\n8. How is dietary guidance provided for on food labels? Truthful, non-misleading dietary guidance statements may be used on food labels, and do not undergo pre-review by FDA. However, once the food is marketed with the statement, FDA can consider whether the statement meets the requirement to be truthful and not misleading (see 21 CFR 101.14). FDA, as part of its recent Better Nutrition Information for Consumer Health Initiative, recognized that scientifically sound and non-misleading dietary guidance statements may be useful to consumers when placed on food labels.\n\nProcedures for Qualified Health Claims\n\nWhat are the regulatory procedures associated with qualified health claims? All health claims, whether SSA or qualified, require that a petition be submitted to FDA. The requirements for health claim petitions are specified in 21 CFR 101.70, and the general requirements for health claims are in 21 CFR 101.14. Both types of health claims can be applicable to conventional foods and dietary supplements, must characterize the substance\'s ability to reduce the risk of disease, and cannot be about mitigating or treating disease. Qualified health claims have differences that relate to scientific support, wording of the claim, use of enforcement discretion, and timelines.\n\nHow is the science supporting a qualified health claim different from that for an SSA health claim? SSA health claims require significant scientific agreement based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence (see 21 CFR 101.14). Qualified health claims are still based on the totality of publicly available evidence but the scientific support does not have to be as strong as that for significant scientific agreement. Under its interim guidance (see Interim Evidence-based Ranking System for Scientific Data (http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/04400072/044-0072-pdn0001-05-FDA-vol5.pdf)), FDA is tentatively providing for 3 levels of science below the SignificantScientific Agreement standard: good to moderate level of scientific agreement, low level of scientific agreement, and very low level of scientific agreement. The criteria for the scientific review are described in the interim guidance.\n\nHow the language for qualified health claims is different? Qualified health claims language must be worded (""qualified"") in such a way that consumers are not misled about the nature of the supporting science. As part of its interim guidance (see Interim Evidence-based Ranking System for Scientific Data (http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/04q0072/04q-0072-pdn0001-05-FDA-vol5.pdf)), FDA has specified qualifying language for the 3 levels of scientific support below the Significant Scientific Agreement standard. FDA also notes that it may consider other qualifying language on a case-by-case basis.\n\nHow do the regulatory procedures for qualified health claims differ from SSA health claims? Petitions requesting an SSA health claim are evaluated under the Significant Scientific Agreement standard (see Significant Scientific Agreement in the Review of Health Claims for Conventional Foods and Dietary Supplements_ (http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/995424GD.pdf)). If FDA decides that standard is met, it authorizes the claim through notice-and-comment rulemaking. Petitions requesting a qualified health claim are posted on the FDA web page for a 60-day public comment period. Qualified health claims meeting the interim procedures criteria are provided for by letters of enforcement discretion (as described above). The letter of enforcement discretion will be posted on the FDA web page. Petitions for a qualified health claim that have no credible scientific evidence for the claim may be denied. These letters will be posted on FDA\'s website.\n\n*What is the procedural timeline for qualified health claims?\n\nWithin 15 days of receipt, FDA will acknowledge the petition.\n\nWithin 45 days of receipt, FDA will file the petition and a docket number will be assigned. Note: Petitions that do not meet content requirements as specified in 21 CFR 101.70 will not be filed and will be returned to the petitioner.\n\nAt the time of filing, FDA will post the petition on the FDA webpage for a 60-day public comment period. During this time, written comments may be submitted to the docket.\n\nOn or before 270 days after receipt of the petition, a final decision will be sent to the petitioner in the form of a letter as to whether FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to a qualified health claim or deny the petition. The letter will be posted on FDA\'s website.\n\nExtensions beyond 270 days can be granted upon mutual agreement between the petitioner and the agency.\n\nSubmitting a Petition\n\nHow will FDA know that I wish to have my petition reviewed under the standards for a qualified health claim rather than those for an SSA health claim (i.e., under the Significant Scientific Agreement standard)? The petitioner may indicate within the petition\'s cover letter that he/she is waiving the right to a review under the Significant Scientific Agreement standard and request that the petition be reviewed under the interim procedures for a qualified health claim. This request will result in FDA proceeding directly to the qualified health claim procedures and its 270-day timeline (see next question). In the absence of such a request, FDA contacts the petitioner to determine if they are petitioning for a SSA or qualified health claim.\n\nWhat information is required to be included in the petition?

It represents the agency\'s current thinking on 1) the process for evaluating the scientific evidence for a health claim, 2) the meaning of the significant scientific agreement (SSA) standard in section 403(7)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) (z1 U.S.C. 343(r)(3)) and 21 CFR 101.14(c), and 3) credible scientific evidence to support a qualified health claim.\n\nThis guidance document describes the evidence-based review system that FDA intends to use to evaluate the publicly available scientific evidence for SSA health claims or qualified health claims on the relationship between a substance and a disease or health-related condition. (2) This guidance document explains the agency\'s current thinking on the scientific review approach FDA should use and is intended to provide guidance to health claim petitioners. (3)\n\nThe specific topics addressed in this guidance document are: (1) identifying studies that evaluate the substance/disease relationship, (2) identifying surrogate endpoints for disease risk, (3) evaluating the human studies to determine whether scientific conclusions can be drawn from them about the substance/disease relationship, (4) assessing the methodological quality of each human study from which scientific conclusions about the substance/disease relationship can be drawn, (5) evaluating the totality of scientific evidence, (6) assessing significant scientific agreement, (7) specificity of claim language for qualified health claims, and (8) reevaluation of existing SSA or qualified health claims.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency\'s guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nBack to top:\n\nThe Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA) (Pub. L. 101-553) was designed to give consumers more scientifically valid information about foods they eat. Among other provisions, the NLEA directed FDA to issue regulations providing for the use of statements that describe the relationship between a substance and a disease (""health claims"") in the labeling of foods, including dietary supplements, after such statements have been reviewed and authorized by FDA. (4) For these health claims, that is, statements about substance/disease relationships, FDA has defined the term ""substance"" by regulation as a specific food or food component (21 CFR 101.14(a)(2)). An authorized health claim be used on both conventional foods and dietary supplements, provided that the substance in the product and the product itself meet the appropriate standards in the authorizing regulation. Health claims are directed to the general population or designated subgroups (e.g., the elderly) and are intended to assist the consumer in maintaining healthful dietary practices.\n\nIn evaluating a petition for an authorized health claim, FDA considers whether the evidence supporting the relationship that is the subject of the claim meets the SSA standard. This standard derives from 21 U.S.C. 343 (r)(J)(J)(B)(J), which provides that FDA shall authorize a health claim to be used on conventional foods if the agency ""determines based on the totality of the publicly available evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted in a manner which is consistent with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles), that there is significant scientific agreement among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate such claims, that the claim is supported by such evidence."" This scientific standard was prescribed by statute for conventional food health claims; by regulation, FDA adopted the same standard for dietary supplement health claims. See 21 CFR 101.14(c).\n\nThe genesis of qualified health claims was the court of appeals decision in Pearson v. Shadala (Pearson). In that case, the plaintiffs challenged FDA\'s decision not to authorize health claims for four specific substance-disease relationships in the labeling of dietary supplements. Although the district court ruled for FDA (14 F. Supp. 2d to (D.D.C. 1998), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the lower court\'s decision (164 F.3d 650 (D.C. Cir.1999)). The appeals court held that the First Amendment does not permit FDA to reject health claims that the agency determines to be potentially misleading unless the agency also reasonably determines that a disclaimer would not eliminate the potential deception. The appeals court also held that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) required FDA to clarify the ""significant scientific agreement"" (SSA) standard for authorizing health claims.\n\nOn December 22, 1999, FDA announced the issuance of its Guidance for Industry: Significant Scientific-Agreement in the Review of Health Claims for Conventional Foods and Dietary Supplements (64 Fed. Reg.17494). This guidance document was issued to clarify FDA\'s interpretation of the SSA standard in response to the court of appeals\' second holding in Pearson.\n\nOn December 20, 2002, the agency announced its intention to extend its approach to implementing the Pearson decision to include health claims for conventional foods (67 Fed. Reg. 78002). Recognizing the need for a scientific framework for qualified health claims, the Task Force on ""Consumer Health Information for Better Nutrition"" was formed. The Task Force recognized that there could be significant public health benefits when consumers have access to, and use, more and better information in conventional food as well as dietary supplement labeling to aid them in their purchases, information that goes beyond just price, convenience, and taste, but extends to include science-based health factors. Armed with more scientifically based information about the likely health benefits of the foods and dietary supplements they purchase, consumers can make a tangible difference in their own long-term health by lowering their risk of numerous chronic diseases.\n\nTo maximize the public health benefit of FDA\'s claims review process, the Task Force\'s Final Report(r) provides a procedure to prioritize on a case-by-case basis all complete petitions according to several factors, including whether the food or dietary supplement that is the subject of the petition is likely to have a significant impact on a serious or life-threatening illness; the strength of the evidence; whether consumer research has been provided to show the claim is not misleading, whether the substance that is the subject of the claim has undergone an FDA safety review (i.e., is an authorized food additive, has been Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) affirmed, listed, or has received a letter of ""no objection"" to a GRAS notification); whether the substance that is the subject of the claim has been adequately characterized so that the relevance of available studies can be evaluated; whether the disease is defined and evaluated in accordance with generally accepted criteria established by a recognized body of qualified experts; and whether there has been prior review of the evidence or the claim by a recognized body of qualified experts.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Evidence-Based Review System for the Scientific Evaluation of Health Claims'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe purpose of this guidance is to advise manufacturers who wish to use the implied nutrient content claim ""healthy"" to label their food products as provided by our regulations. More specifically, this guidance is intended to advise food manufacturers of our intent to exercise enforcement discretion relative to foods that use the implied nutrient content claim ""healthy"" on their labels which: (1) Are not low in total fat, but have a fat profile makeup of predominantly mono and polyunsaturated fats; or (2) contain at least ten percent of the Daily Value (DV) per reference amount customarily consumed (RACC) of potassium or vitamin D.\n\nThis guidance is immediately effective because the agency has determined that prior public participation is not feasible or appropriate (21 CFR 10.115(g)(2)).\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nUnder section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(1)(A)), a food2 is misbranded if it bears claims, either express or implied, that characterize the level of a nutrient which is of a type required to be declared in nutritionlabeling3 unless the claim is made in accordance with a regulatory definition established by FDA (see section 403(r)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 343(r)(2)). 21 CFR 101.65(d) provides such regulatory definition for use of the term ""healthy"" or related terms (such as ""health,"" ""healthful,"" ""healthfully,"" ""healthfulness,"" ""health,"" ""healthiest,"" ""healthily,"" and ""healthiness"") as an implied nutrient content claim on the label or in labeling of a food. The ""healthy"" nutrient content claim can be used if the food meets certain nutrient conditions; and, when used with an explicit or implicit claim or statement about a nutrient (e.g. ""healthy, contains 3 grams of fat""), suggests that a food, because of its nutrient content, may be useful in creating a diet that is consistent with dietary recommendations. The nutrient conditions for bearing a ""healthy"" nutrient content claim include specific criteria for nutrients to limit in the diet, such as total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, as well as requirements for nutrients to encourage in the diet, including vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, iron, protein, and fiber. The criteria are linked to elements in the Nutrition Facts label and serving size regulations (see 21 CFR SSS 101.9 and 101.12). The nutrient criteria to use the claim can vary for different food categories (e.g., fruits and vegetables, or seafood and game meat) (see 21 CFR 101.65(d)(2)).\n\nFootnote 3: Section 201(m) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(m)) defines “labeling” as all labels and other written, printed, or graphic matter upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers or accompanying such article.\n\nIn addition, it is also important to note that under section 403(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)), a food is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(n)) provides that labeling is misleading if, among other things, it fails to reveal facts that are material in light of representations made or suggested in the labeling, or material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the food to which the labeling relates under the conditions of use prescribed in the labeling, or under such conditions of use as are customary or usual.\n\n3 Discussion\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016, we issued final rules updating the Nutrition Facts label and serving size information for packaged foods to reflect new scientific information, including the link between diet and chronic diseases such as obesity and heart disease (see 81 FR 33742, ""Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels""; 81 FR 34000, ""Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments""). Updates to the Nutrition Facts label include changes in the individual nutrients that must be declared and also changes to the Daily Value (DV) of other individual nutrients, reflecting changes in recommended intake levels, based on current science. The individual nutrients included in Nutrition Facts and their DVs significantly influence the regulations on nutrient content and health claims. Because the framework for many of FDA\'s other nutrition labeling regulations is linked to elements in the Nutrition Facts label and serving size regulations, we plan to update those other regulations, such as those for health claims and nutrient content claims (including the implied nutrient content claim ""healthy""), to align with these most recent updates.\n\nWe are re-evaluating the regulatory criteria for use of the implied nutrient content claim ""healthy"" in light of the latest nutrition science and the current dietary recommendations and seek input on possible future rulemaking to update the existing regulations for this claim. Because the rulemaking process can sometimes be lengthy, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion in the interim with respect to some of the existing criteria for the nutrient content claim ""healthy"" if the alternative nutrient criteria described below are met. We intend to exercise enforcement discretion until we amend 21 CFR 101.65(d)(2).\n\nLow Fat\n\nAs stated above, since we published the final rule defining ""healthy"" (58 FR 2302, January 6, 1993), the science related to public health recommendations for intake of dietary fats has evolved. The focus of the most recent dietary fat recommendations has shifted away from limiting total fat intake to encouraging intakes of mono and polyunsaturated fats. Foods that use the term ""healthy"" on their labels that are not low in total fat should have a fat profile makeup of predominantly mono and polyunsaturated fats (i.e., sum of monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats are greater than the total saturated fat content of food). Consistent with consensus science and public health recommendations for dietary fats which no longer recommend low total fat intake, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the current requirement that any food bearing the nutrient content claim ""healthy"" meet the low fat requirement (SS101.65(d)(2)(i)), provided that: (1) The amounts of mono and polyunsaturated fats are declared on the label and (2) the amounts declared constitute the majority of the fat content. These conditions are necessary so that consumers are made aware that the total fat is mostly made up of fats that are encouraged by current dietary recommendations.\n\nBeneficial Nutrients\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Use of the Term “Healthy” in the Labeling of Human Food Products'

Background: Promotion, Education, and Independence\n\nTwo important sources of information on therapeutic products (human and animal drugs, biological products, and medical devices regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)) for health care professionals are: (1) Activities (programs and materials) performed by, or on behalf of, the companies that market the products; and (2) activities, supported by companies, that are otherwise independent from the promotional influence of the supporting company. Although both provide valuable and sometimes vital information to health care professionals, the programs and materials performed and disseminated by companies are subject to the labeling and advertising provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), whereas the truly independent and nonpromotional industry-supported activities have not been subject to FDA regulation.2\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by FDA’s Intra-Agency Working Group on Advertising and Promotion. This guidance represents the Agency’s current thinking on industry-supported scientific and educational activities. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the industry. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.\n\nFootnote 2: In this context, the terms “independent” and “nonpromotional” are not mutually exclusive. The agency views independence as an indication of whether an activity is nonpromotional.\n\nThis jurisdictional line is important because the constraints on advertising and labeling,3 when applied to scientific and educational activities, can restrict the freedom of participants to discuss their data or express their views. In particular, discussions of unapproved uses, which can be an important component of scientific and educational activities, are not permissible in programs that are or can be (because the provider is not functionally independent) subject to substantive influence by companies that market products related to the discussion. Thus, the agency, has traditionally sought to avoid regulating activities that are producedindependently from the influence of companies marketing the products. The agency recognizes that industry-supported activities can be both nonpromotional and educational.\n\nDemarcating the line between activities that are performed by or on behalf of the company, and thus, subject to regulation, and activities that are essentially independent of their influence has become more difficult due to the increasing role industry has played in supporting postgraduate and continuing education for health care professionals.\n\nThe agency traditionally has recognized the important public policy reasons not to regulate all industry-supported activities as advertising or labeling. To permit industry support for the full exchange of views in scientific and educational discussions, including discussions of unapproved uses, FDA has distinguished between those activities supported by companies that are nonpromotional and otherwise independent from the substantive influence of the supporting company and those that are not. Those activities that have been deemed by the agency to be independent from influence by the supporting company and nonpromotional have not been treated as advertising or labeling, and have not been subjected to the agency\'s regulatory scrutiny.\n\nIn determining whether an activity is independent of the substantive influence of a company, the agency examines whether and to what extent the company is in a position to influence the presentation of information related to its products or otherwise transform an ostensibly independent program into a promotional vehicle. FDA is concerned that companies may influence the content of educational programs both directly and indirectly. Directly, by being involved in the selection of speakers or in the treatment of topics. Indirectly, through the nature of the relationship between the company and the provider (e.g., if the provider has reason to believe that future financial support from the company depends upon producing programs that promote the company\'s products.)\n\nFDA is responsible for seeing that scientific and educational activities that are not intended to be promotional are designed to be truly independent from substantive influence by the marketers of regulated products. The agency recognizes, however, that the primary responsibility for overseeing the process of postgraduate and continuing professional education and scientific exchange lies with the scientific and health care communities and accrediting organizations. Accordingly, FDA will work closely with scientific and professional health care communities and accrediting organizations to help ensure that provider activities are independent.\n\nThe agency is providing this guidance to describe the agency\'s enforcement policy with regard to scientific and educational activities supported by industry. The guidance seeks to clarify the distinction drawn by the agency between scientific and educational activities that FDA considers nonpromotional and those that the agency considers promotional, and to provide guidance on how industry may support such activities without subjection to regulation under the labeling and advertising provisions of the act.\n\nThis guidance applies only to those company-supported activities that relate to the supporting company\'s products or to competing products. A company-supported educational activity or part thereof that does not relate to the company\'s products or a competing product, or suggest a use for the company\'s products, would not be considered a promotional activity under this guidance.\n\nII. Guidance: Industry-Supported Scientific and Educational Activities\n\nFDA has not regulated and does not intend to regulate, under the labeling and advertising provisions of the act, industry-supported scientific and educational activities that are independent of the influence of the supporting company. Companies and providers who wish to ensure that their activities will not be subject to regulation should design and carry out their activities free from the supporting company\'s influence and bias, based on the factors considered in evaluating activities and determining independence, as described below. These factors are provided to furnish guidance on the design and conduct of such activities, so that they will be educational and nonpromotional in nature. These factors will be considered as part of an overall evaluation of an activity; no individual factor is likely by itself to stimulate an action based on lack of independence.\n\nA. Factors Considered in Evaluating Activities and Determining Independence\n\nFDA will consider the following factors in evaluating programs and activities and determining independence:(1) Control of Content and Selection of Presenters and Moderators\n\nThe agency will consider whether the provider has maintained full control over the content of the program, planning of the program\'s content, and over the selection of speakers and moderators. In so doing, the agency will look at whether the supporting company has engaged in scripting, targeting points for emphasis, or other actions designed to influence the program\'s content. In addition, the agency will consider if the company has suggested speakers who are or were actively involved in promoting the company\'s products or who have been the subject of complaints or objections with regard to presentations that were viewed as misleading or biased in favor of the company\'s products.\n\n(2) Disclosures\n\nThe agency will consider whether there was meaningful disclosure, at the time of the program, to the audience of: (1) The company\'s funding of the program; (2) any significant relationship between the provider, presenters or moderators, and the supporting company (e.g., employee, grant recipient, owner of significant interest or stock); and (3) whether any unapproved uses of products will be discussed;\n\n(3) The Focus of the Program\n\nThe agency will consider whether the intent of the company and the provider is to produce an independent and nonprorotional activity that is focussed on educational content and free from commercial influence or bias. The agency will also consider whether the title of the activity fairly and accurately represents the scope of the presentation.\n\nThe agency also will look at the focus of the activity to determine if the central theme is based on a single product marketed by the company or a competing product, except when existing treatment options are so limited as to preclude any meaningful discussion of alternative therapies. This is not to suggest that each treatment option must be discussed with precisely equal emphasis. However, emphasis on a newer or, in the view of the presenter, more beneficial treatment modality should be provided in the context of a discussion of all reasonable and relevant options.\n\n(4) Relationship Between Provider and Supporting Company\n\nThe agency will consider whether there are legal, business, or other relationships between the company and the provider that could place the company in a position whereby it may exert influence over the content of the activity (e.g., a provider that is owned by, or is not viable without the support of, the company supporting the activity).\n\n(5) Provider Involvement in Sales or Marketing\n--------------------\nContext title: Industry Supported Scientific and Educational Activities Guidance for Industry'

Factors Considered in Evaluating Activities and Determining Independence\n\nFDA will consider the following factors in evaluating programs and activities and determining independence:(1) Control of Content and Selection of Presenters and Moderators\n\nThe agency will consider whether the provider has maintained full control over the content of the program, planning of the program\'s content, and over the selection of speakers and moderators. In so doing, the agency will look at whether the supporting company has engaged in scripting, targeting points for emphasis, or other actions designed to influence the program\'s content. In addition, the agency will consider if the company has suggested speakers who are or were actively involved in promoting the company\'s products or who have been the subject of complaints or objections with regard to presentations that were viewed as misleading or biased in favor of the company\'s products.\n\n(2) Disclosures\n\nThe agency will consider whether there was meaningful disclosure, at the time of the program, to the audience of: (1) The company\'s funding of the program; (2) any significant relationship between the provider, presenters or moderators, and the supporting company (e.g., employee, grant recipient, owner of significant interest or stock); and (3) whether any unapproved uses of products will be discussed;\n\n(3) The Focus of the Program\n\nThe agency will consider whether the intent of the company and the provider is to produce an independent and nonprorotional activity that is focussed on educational content and free from commercial influence or bias. The agency will also consider whether the title of the activity fairly and accurately represents the scope of the presentation.\n\nThe agency also will look at the focus of the activity to determine if the central theme is based on a single product marketed by the company or a competing product, except when existing treatment options are so limited as to preclude any meaningful discussion of alternative therapies. This is not to suggest that each treatment option must be discussed with precisely equal emphasis. However, emphasis on a newer or, in the view of the presenter, more beneficial treatment modality should be provided in the context of a discussion of all reasonable and relevant options.\n\n(4) Relationship Between Provider and Supporting Company\n\nThe agency will consider whether there are legal, business, or other relationships between the company and the provider that could place the company in a position whereby it may exert influence over the content of the activity (e.g., a provider that is owned by, or is not viable without the support of, the company supporting the activity).\n\n(5) Provider Involvement in Sales or Marketing\n--------------------\nContext title: Industry-Supported Scientific and Educational Activites']","['""Generally recognized"" means that the scientific community has a consensus concerning the substance\'s relative activity as an antioxidant. Determination of ""recognized antioxidant activity"" should take into account the following factors, among others:\n\n(1) The present body of scientific knowledge;\n\n(2) Regulatory status for antioxidant ingredients and substances;\n\n(3) Safety considerations;\n\n(4) Common chemical assays used for determination of antioxidant activity;\n\n(5) Expert opinions on availability and efficacy of test methods for assessing antioxidant activity; and\n\n(6) The substance\'s biological and physiological familiarity and characteristics.\n\nThe standard for determining ""generally recognized"" is not dependent solely on favorable but inconclusive research that supports an ingredient\'s activity; nor is the standard satisfied by clinical studies alone. Rather, the substance must be shown to have this quality based on a wide range of scientific data and information.\n\nHere\'s an example of how ""recognized antioxidant activity"" might be determined: If the pertinent scientific data and information support a conclusion that an antioxidant nutrient, such as vitamin E, tends to prevent the oxidation of LDL cholesterol in humans, and a well-recognized assay measures that protective effect, then it may be concluded that vitamin E has recognized antioxidant activity. In addition, the wider body of scientific knowledge may need to be determined when more than one assay can be used, or when different substances are combined in a dietary supplement.\n\n21 CFR 101.54(g)(4)']",0.0,0.0
54,"Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of ""product class"" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?","['--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of ""product class"" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: B.: Applications for Biological Products Submitted Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act on or Before the Transition Date\n\nQ5.: When will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the application number that will be used for its deemed BLA?\n\nFDA intends to assign the same application number used for the approved NDA to the deemed BLA on the March 23, 2020, transition date. As a hypothetical example, NDA 012345 would be deemed to be BLA 012345 on the transition date. This approach is intended to minimize burden on holders of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act who are preparing submissions to their applications around the transition date and to facilitate the administrative conversion of any pending supplements to such applications (see the Transition Policy Final Guidance for additional information regarding such supplements). The use of a predictable application numbering system for deemed BLAs is also expected to facilitate preparation and submission of a 351(k) BLA for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeableproduct that references a product licensed in a deemed 351(a) BLA as a reference product. The FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date will include the product\'s BLA number.\n\nWhen will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the license number that will apply to its deemed BLA(s)?\n\nThe FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be an approved BLA will include the U.S. license number assigned to the application holder. Each establishment that is listed in the approved NDA as currently involved in the manufacture of the biological product on the transition date will be considered a licensed establishment on that date (see section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act; see also section 7002(e)(4)(B)(iii) of the BPCI Act). FDA does not intend to conduct pre-license inspections of manufacturers of the transitioning biological products because FDA interprets section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act to mean that an approved application under the FD&C Act for the biological product will be ""deemed to be a license"" on the transition date by operation of the statute.12 Moreover, the establishments will have been inspected in connection with the previously approved NDAs under the FD&C Act (see Q16 below for information on establishment inspections related to certain supplements to a deemed 351(a) BLA).\n\nFootnote 12: See also footnote 10 in the response to Q2.\n\nFDA issues only one U.S. license number per BLA holder, regardless of the number of licensed biological products manufactured by that BLA holder under separate BLAs. Accordingly, if an NDA holder is also a BLA holder and has been assigned a U.S. license number for another biological product, the NDA holder will not be issued a different U.S. license number when its approved NDA for a biological product is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date.\n\nSection 351(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the PHS Act requires that each package of a biological product is plainly marked with, among other things, the applicable license number of the manufacturer of the biological product in order for the biological product to be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce. To minimize possible disruption in the distribution of biological products in the United States and to minimize burden on holders of deemed BLAs, FDA intends to adopt a compliance policy for the labeling of biological products that are the subject of deemed BLAs (see Q14 and section IV below for additional information on the compliance policy for labeling of biological products in deemed BLAs).\n\nWill an approved NDA for a biological product be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA or a 351(k) BLA?\n\nFDA interprets the transition provision, along with the applicable provisions of the FD&C Act and the PHS Act, to mean that an approved NDA, including an application submitted through the pathway described by section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act (505(b)(2) application), will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA on the transition date.\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act is directed primarily to the submission of an application for a biological product during the transition period ending on March 23, 2020, and does not explicitly state whether an approved NDA will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA or a 351(k) BLA. The Agency\'s interpretation that an approved NDA submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA is based on the shared requirement that both types of applications contain full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (or, for a 351(a) BLA, safety, purity, and potency). We expect that the measures FDA has taken to minimize differences in the review and approval of products in marketing applications submitted under section 351(a) of the PHS Act and section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act will facilitate implementation of the statutory provision under which an approved NDA will be deemed to be a BLA.\n\nThe Agency\'s interpretation that an approved 505(b)(2) application will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA reflects the shared requirement that both types of applications contain full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (or, for a 351(a) BLA, safety, purity, and potency).13 This approach also reflects the Agency\'s view that it is more appropriate to regulate a biological product approved through the 505(b)(2) pathway that may be intended to differ in certain respects (e.g., different strength, dosage form, or route of administration or approved conditions of use) from a previously approved product under the statutory and regulatory framework for 351(a) BLAs, as such differences are not permitted under the statutory framework for 351(k) BLAs. Moreover, FDA\'s approval of a 505(b)(2) application reflects the Agency\'s evaluation of the data against a different statutory standard than a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: A 505(b)(2) application is an NDA that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use (e.g., FDA’s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug or published literature).\n\nWill an approved NDA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing be deemed to be a BLA?*\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) states that an ""approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the [FD&C Act]"" will be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date. Accordingly, FDA interprets the statute to mean that an approved NDA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing, but for which FDA has not withdrawn approval of the application, will be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date. The holder of an NDA for a discontinued product must comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for its application before the transition date, and after its application is deemed to be a BLA. These requirements include, for example, postmarketing reporting of adverse drug experiences and, if appropriate, the submission of proposed revisions to product labeling. If the holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing seeks to reintroduce the product to the market, the BLA holder should consult with the relevant FDA review division before submitting a supplement to the deemed BLA, to discuss any data and information that may be needed.\n\nHow will the transition on March 23, 2020, affect the annual program fee for an approved NDA for a biological product?\n\nUnder section 736(a)(2) of the FD&C Act, a person named as the applicant in a human drug application (which refers to an NDA or a 351(a) BLA, subject to applicable statutory exceptions) is assessed an annual prescription drug program fee. A prescription drug program fee is assessed each fiscal year for each prescription drug product identified in a human drug application approved as of October 1 of the fiscal year, with certain exceptions described by statute. For more information about the prescription drug program fee, consult the FDA guidance for industry Assessing User Fees Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017 (May 2018).\n\nIn general, sponsors of biological products for which annual prescription drug program fees are assessed prior to the transition, and that are deemed to be licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act on the transition date, will continue to be assessed prescription drug program fees for such products after the transition, subject to applicable statutory requirements and exceptions.\n\nIf an applicant withdraws an NDA that is tentatively approved on or before the transition date, or otherwise pending with FDA, and submits an application for the same product under section 351(a) of the PHS Act, will an additional PDUFA application fee be assessed?\n\nAn applicant (or the applicant\'s licensee, assignee, or successor) will not be charged a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) application fee for the submission of an application under section 351(a) of the PHS Act if all of the following circumstances are satisfied (see section 736(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act):\n\nThe applicant previously submitted an NDA for the same product and paid the associated PDUFA application fee for the NDA.\n\nThe NDA was accepted for filing. (Note that an NDA for a biological product will not be accepted for filing after the transition date.)\n\nThe NDA was not approved14 or was withdrawn (without a waiver). Footnote 14: An NDA that is tentatively approved is notan approved NDA (see 21 CFR 314.105(a)).\n\nFor questions regarding user fees, please contact the User Fee Staff at\n--------------------\nContext title: The “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of ""product class"" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 9: In the Federal Register of February 21, 2020, FDA issued a final rule that amends its regulation that defines “biological product” to incorporate changes made by the BPCI Act and the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, and to provide its interpretation of the statutory term “protein” (85 FR 10057). This rule is effective on March 23, 2020.\n\nThe prescription or over-the-counter status of a biological product with an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act will not change when the approved application is deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act on March 23, 2020.\n\nExamples of biological products approved under the FD&C Act are listed in the Appendix to the Transition Policy Final Guidance. To enhance transparency and facilitate planning for the transition date, FDA is posting on the FDA website (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/deemed-be-license-provision-bpci-act) a preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act (as of December 31, 2019) that will be affected by the transition provision, and FDA intends to periodically update the list before the transition date (see Q3 below). Shortly after the transition date, FDA intends to post a final list of approved applications under the FD&C Act that have been deemed to be licenses under the PHS Act.\n\nDoes the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA\'s list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n\nFDA interprets the transition provision to mean that the holder of an approved application for a biological product does not need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA. Specifically, FDA interprets section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act to mean that an approved application under the FD&C Act for a biological product will be ""deemed to be a license"" for the biological product on the transition date by operation of the statute.10\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe statute is silent regarding the process for accomplishing the transition of approved NDAs to deemed BLAs. FDA intends to send a letter to such application holders on March 23, 2020, advising that the approved NDA was deemed to be a BLA at 1200 am Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on March 23, 2020, and no longer exists as an NDA. (If the NDA is approved on March 23, 2020, the approved NDA will be deemed to be a BLA immediately after approval.) In the letter, FDA also will notify the application holder that it has been issued a license that authorizes the application holder to manufacture the biological product within the meaning of section 351 of the PHS Act and to introduce the biological product or deliver the biological product for introduction into interstate commerce (see Q6 below). The letter also will remind application holders that they will need to ensure that the listing information for the biological product is updated in FDA\'s electronic Drug Registration and Listing System (eDRLS) between March 23, 2020, and June 30, 2020, to reflect a change in the prefix of the application number (from ""NDA"" to ""BLA"") (see 21 CFR 207.57(b)). FDA notes that the deeming of an approved NDA to be a BLA and the corresponding update of the eDRLS listing information for the biological product to change the prefix for the application number will not result in the need for a new National Drug Code (NDC) number with a new product code. Accordingly, in the absence of other changes made by the application holder that would require a new NDC number, biological products approved under the FD&C Act will retain their current NDC number after the NDA is deemed to be a BLA. This will provide consistency for manufacturers and for the databases and pharmacy systems that track drug and biological products.\n\nTo enhance transparency and facilitate planning for the transition date, FDA is posting on the FDA website a preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act (as of December 31, 2019) that will be affected by the transition provision, and FDA intends to periodically update the list before the transition date (see Q1 above). Biological products approved in NDAs that are deemed to be BLAs will be removed from FDA\'s Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book) on March 23, 2020, and will be listed in FDA\'s Lists of Licensed Biological Products with Reference Product Exclusivity and Biosimilarity or Interchangeability Evaluations (the Purple Book) and the CDER Therapeutic Biologics Products list on or shortly after the March 23, 2020, transition date.\n\n2.2 Who should an application holder contact if it believes that its approved NDA should or should not be included on FDA\'s preliminary list of approved applications for biological products that will be affected by the transition provision?\n\nIf an application holder or other person reviews, on FDA\'s website, the preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act that will be affected by the transition provision and believes that an approved NDA should be added to the list or should not be included on the list, the application holder or other person should submit a comment to the public docket established for this guidance and the preliminary list. For information on submission of comments to the public docket, please refer to the Federal Register (FR) Notice of Availability of this guidance.\n\nQ4.: How will FDA notify the sponsor of a proposed biological product who seeks to obtain approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act that the planned application would need to be approved under the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2020?\n\nFDA provided notice to sponsors of proposed biological products intended for submission in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act that they will be affected by the transition provision through the Biosimilars Q&A Guidance, as well as through FDA\'s draft guidance for industry Implementation of the ""Deemed to be a License"" Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (March 2016) (Transition Policy Draft Guidance) and the Biosimilars Q&A Draft Guidance. In the Biosimilars Q&A Guidance, FDA initially stated its interpretation of the statutory term ""protein"" in the amended definition of ""biological product"" (see Q1 above and Biological Product Definition Final Rule). In the Transition Policy Final Guidance, FDA provides recommendations to sponsors of proposed protein products intended for submission in an application that may not receive final approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2020, to facilitate alignment of product development plans with FDA\'s interpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.11 FDA recommends that sponsors of development programs for proposed protein products evaluate whether a planned submission under section 505 of the FD&C Act would allow adequate time for approval of the application prior to March 23, 2020, considering, among other things, whether the submission may require a second cycle of review and, for certain types of applications, whether unexpired patents or exclusivity may delay final approval. If a sponsor is unsure whether its proposed product may receive approval under the FD&C Act by March 23, 2020, the sponsor should consider submitting a BLA under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act instead. For additional information, please see the Transition Policy Final Guidance.\n\nFootnote 11: After FDA issued the Transition Policy Final Guidance, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 was enacted. Section 607 of this Act amended section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act to provide that FDA will continue to review an application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act after March 23, 2020, so long as that application was submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act, is filed not later than March 23, 2019, and is not approved as of March 23, 2020. If such an application is approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act before October 1, 2022, it will be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act upon approval (see section 7002(e)(4)(B)(iii) and (vi) of the BPCI Act).\n\nB.: Applications for Biological Products Submitted Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act on or Before the Transition Date\n\nQ5.: When will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the application number that will be used for its deemed BLA?\n\nFDA intends to assign the same application number used for the approved NDA to the deemed BLA on the March 23, 2020, transition date.

This approach is intended to minimize burden on holders of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act who are preparing submissions to their applications around the transition date and to facilitate the administrative conversion of any pending supplements to such applications (see the Transition Policy Final Guidance for additional information regarding such supplements). The use of a predictable application numbering system for deemed BLAs is also expected to facilitate preparation and submission of a 351(k) BLA for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeableproduct that references a product licensed in a deemed 351(a) BLA as a reference product.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to help applicants develop draft labeling for proposed biosimilar products for submission in an application under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262(k)). The recommendations for prescription drug labeling in this guidance pertain only to the prescribing information (commonly referred to as the package insert), except for certain recommendations in section V pertaining to FDA-approved patient labeling (e.g., Patient Information, Medication Guide, and Instructions for Use).2 This guidance does not provide specific labeling recommendations for interchangeable products (see section VIII of this guidance).\n\nFootnote 2: Unless otherwise specified, the terms biosimilar product labeling and labeling as used in this guidance address only the prescribing information as described in 21 CFR 201.56 and 201.57.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) (Public Law 111-148) on March 23, 2010. The BPCI Act amends the PHS Act and other statutes to create an abbreviated license pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference product3 (see sections 7001 through 7003 of the Affordable Care Act). Section 351(k) of the PHS Act, added by the BPCI Act, sets forth the requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product and an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product.\n\nFootnote 3: Reference product means the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in a 351(k) application (section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nSection 351(i) of the PHS Act defines biosimilarity to mean ""that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components"" and that ""there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product.""\n\nTo meet the standard for interchangeability, an applicant must provide sufficient information to demonstrate biosimilarity and also to demonstrate that the biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, if the biological product is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch (see section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act). Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nAn application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based upon data derived from:\n\nAnalytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;\n\nAnimal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and\n\nA clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.\n\nUnder the PHS Act, FDA has the discretion to determine that an element described above is unnecessary in a 351(k) application.\n\nUnder FDA regulations, prescription drug labeling must provide adequate information to enable health care providers to ""use the drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended""; and to this end, the approved prescribing information summarizes the essential scientific information needed by health care providers for the safe and effective use of a drug.4 Prescription drug labeling reflects FDA\'s finding of safety and effectiveness5({}^{,})6 for the drug under the labeled conditions of use and facilitates prescribing decisions, thereby enabling the safe and effective use of drugs, including biological products, and reducing the likelihood of medication errors.\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 CFR 201.100 and 201.56(a)(1).\n\nFootnote 5: The standard for licensure of a biological product as potent under section 351(a) of the PHS Act has long been interpreted to include effectiveness (see 21 CFR 600.3(s) and the guidance for industry Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nFootnote 6: In this guidance, we use the terms safety and effectiveness and safety, purity, and potency interchangeably in the discussions pertaining to biosimilar products.\n\nIII General principles for draft labeling of proposed biosimilar products (biosimilar product labeling)\n\nThe goal of a biosimilar product development program is to demonstrate biosimilarity between the proposed product and the reference product -- not to independently establish safety and effectiveness of the proposed product. A demonstration of biosimilarity means, among other things, that FDA has determined that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.7 Thus, FDA\'s finding of safety and effectiveness for the reference product, as reflected in its FDA-approved prescribing information, may be relied upon to provide health care providers with the essential scientific information needed to facilitate prescribing decisions for the proposed biosimilar product\'s labeled conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)). Accordingly, FDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, such as those described in sections V and VI of this guidance.8\n\nFootnote 7: Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act.\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of ""product class"" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 4: Section 607 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, redesignated section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act as section 7002(e)(4)(A) and added the title “In General” to the new subparagraph. Confoming revisions have been made throughout this guidance to refer to the new subparagraph.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nBPCI Act\n\nThe BPCI Act amended the PHS Act and other statutes to create an abbreviated licensure pathway in section 351(k) of the PHS Act for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product (see sections 7001 through 7003 of the BPCI Act). The objectives of the BPCI Act are conceptually similar to those of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417) (commonly referred to as the ""Hatch-Waxman Amendments""), which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of drug products under section 505(b)(2) and 505(j) of the FD&C Act. An abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products can present challenges given the scientific and technical complexities that may be associated with the generally larger, and typically more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured. Most biological products are produced in a living system, such as a microorganism or plant or animal cells, whereas small molecule drugs are typically manufactured through chemical synthesis.\n\nSection 351(k) of the PHS Act, added by the BPCI Act, sets forth, among other things, the requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product and an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product. Section 351(i) defines ""biosimilarity"" to mean ""that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components"" and that ""there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product"" (section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act). A 351(k) application must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based upon data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies, unless FDA determines, in its discretion, that certain studies are unnecessary in a 351(k) application (see section 351(k)(2) of the PHS Act). To meet the standard for ""interchangeability,"" an applicant must provide sufficient information to demonstrate biosimilarity, and also to demonstrate that the biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, if the biological product is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch (see section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act). Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\n2 Transition Period for Certain Biological Products\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act provides that a marketing application for a biological product (that previously could have been submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act) must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, subject to the following exception during the transition period described below.\n\nAn application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2020, if the biological product is in a product class5 for which a biological product in such product class was approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2010.\n\nFootnote 5: FDA has interpreted the statutory term_product class_ for purposes of determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period(see FDA’s guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCIAct (December 2018) (Biosimilars Q&A Guidance), at Q. II.2). We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory:information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nHowever, an application for a biological product may not be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act if there is another biological product approved under section 351(a) of the PHS Act that could be a ""reference product""6 if such application were submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a license for a biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act (a ""deemed BLA"") on March 23, 2020 (see section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act; see also section 7002(e)(4)(B) of the BPCI Act). For additional information about FDA\'s interpretation of this ""transition"" provision, please refer to FDA\'s guidance for industry Interpretation of the ""Deemed to be a License"" Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (December 2018) (Transition Policy Final Guidance).\n\n3 Questions and Answers\n\nIdentification of Products Subject to the Transition Provision\n\n1 What products are affected by the transition provision? How will the holder of an approved new drug application (NDA) for a biological product know if it will be affected by the transition provision?\n\nThe ""deemed to be a license"" provision in section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act (also known as the transition provision) will apply on March 23, 2020, to each approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act.7 The BPCI Act and Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, amended the definition of a ""biological product"" in section 351(i) of the PHS Act to include a ""protein.""\n\nFootnote 7: General references in this guidance to “applications” submitted or approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act also may include ANDAs, to the extent applicable. An ANDA generally must contain information to demonstrate, among other things, that the proposed generic drug has the same active ingredient(s), conditions of use, dosage form, route of administration, strength, and (with certain permissible differences) labeling as the reference listed drug (section 505(i)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act). Given the complexity of protein molecules and limitations of current analytical methods, it may be difficult for manufacturers of proposed protein products to demonstrate that the active ingredient in their proposed product is the same as the active ingredient in an already approved product, and thus ANDAs are not a focus of this guidance. There are no currently marketed bio logical products that were approved through the ANDA pathway.\n\nFDA has previously stated its interpretation of the statutory term ""protein"" in the amended statutory definition of ""biological product.""8 As explained in FDA\'s final rule entitled ""Definition of the Term ""Biological Product"" (Biological Product Definition Final Rule), FDA interprets the term ""protein"" to mean any alpha amino acid polymer with a specific defined sequence that is greater than 40 amino acids in size. When two or more amino acid chains in an amino acid polymer are associated with each other in a manner that occurs in nature, the size of the amino acid polymer for purposes of this interpretation will be based on the total number of amino acids in those chains, and will not be limited to the number of amino acids in a contiguous sequence.9 FDA interprets the statutory definition of ""biological product"" such that any amino acid polymer composed of 40 or fewer amino acids (i.e., a ""peptide"") is outside the scope of the term ""protein."" A ""peptide"" is not a ""biological product"" and will continue to be regulated as a drug under the FD&C Act unless the peptide otherwise meets the statutory definition of a ""biological product"" (e.g., a peptide vaccine) (see Q. II.1 in FDA\'s draft guidance for industry New and Revised Draft Q&As on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act (Revision 2) (December 2018) (Biosimilars Q&A Draft Guidance)). Moreover, a drug product that contains a protein only as an inactive ingredient (e.g., a drug product formulated with human serum albumin as an inactive ingredient) is not considered to be a ""protein"" for purposes of the statutory definition of ""biological product"" and the transition provision of the BPCI Act.\n\nFootnote 9: In the Federal Register of February 21, 2020, FDA issued a final rule that amends its regulation that defines “biological product” to incorporate changes made by the BPCI Act and the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, and to provide its interpretation of the statutory term “protein” (85 FR 10057). This rule is effective on March 23, 2020.\n\nThe prescription or over-the-counter status of a biological product with an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act will not change when the approved application is deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act on March 23, 2020.\n--------------------\nContext title: The “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of ""product class"" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: SS 343(a)(1). Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(n)) provides that labeling is misleading if, among other things, it fails to reveal facts that are material in light of representations made or suggested in the labeling, or material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the food to which the labeling relates under the conditions of use prescribed in the labeling, or under such conditions of use as are customary or usual. 21 U.S.C. SS 321(n). In a 1992 ""Statement of Policy: Foods Derived from New Plant Varieties"" (1992 Policy) (Ref. 5) FDA explained its interpretation of the FD&C Act with respect to foods derived from new plant varieties, including varieties developed using bioengineering. In the 1992 Policy, FDA stated that it was not aware of any information showing that bioengineered foods differ from other foods in any meaningful or uniform way, or that, as a class, foods developed by the new techniques present any different or greater safety concern than foods developed by traditional plant breeding (Ref. 5). Further, FDA concluded that the method of development of a new plant variety (including the use of new techniques such as rDNA technology) is generally not material information within the meaning of section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, and would not usually be required to be disclosed in the labeling for the food. This determination was reviewed and upheld by the court in Alliance for Bio-Integrity v. Shalala, 116 F. Supp. 2d 166, 178-79 (D.D.C. 2000) (finding that FDA\'s determination that genetic engineering, alone, is not a material fact that warrants food labeling was entitled to deference) (Ref. 10). Labeling provided by manufacturers on a wholly voluntary basis regarding whether a food was or was not bioengineered as described in this guidance is acceptable to FDA, provided that such labeling is truthful and not misleading. Some consumers are interested in the information provided in such labeling.\n\nThe FD&C Act does not define the term ""material"" within the context of section 201(n) of the FD&C Act. Historically, the agency has interpreted the term, within the context of food, to mean information about the attributes of the food itself. For example, FDA has required special labeling in cases where the absence of such ""material"" information may: (1) pose special health risks (e.g., a warning statement on protein products used in very low calorie diets (21 CFR 101.17(d)) (Ref. 6), or a caution statement not to feed animal food products that contain animal-derived protein to cattle or other ruminants (21 CFR 589.2000(c)(1)(i)) (Ref. 7)); (2) mislead the consumer in light of other statements made on the labeling (e.g., a requirement for quantitative nutrient information when certain nutrient content claims are made about a product (21 CFR 101.13(j)) (Ref. 8)); or (3) in cases where a consumer may assume that a food, because of its similarity to another food, has nutritional, organoleptic (e.g., taste, smell, or texture), or functional characteristics of the food it resembles when in fact it does not (e.g., a statement that reduced fat margarine is not suitable for frying (21 CFR 101.13(d)(1)) (Ref. 9). Further, section 403(i) of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations require that each food bear a common or usual name or, in the absence of such a name, an appropriately descriptive term (21 U.S.C. SS 343(i); 21 CFR 101.3, 501.3). For example, if oil from a genetically engineered canola plant has a significantly different amount of lauric acid such that the fatty acid composition of the oil is significantly changed compared to traditional canola oil, the term ""canola oil"" no longer adequately identifies or describes the nature of the oil or its characterizing properties, particularly Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nsince oils are distinguished by their fatty acid profiles.\n\nSince the commercial introduction of bioengineered crops in the United States in 1996, the use of bioengineered crops has accelerated and such crops are now widely used (Ref. 11). In 2013, in the United States, bioengineered soybeans made up 93 percent of the acreage of planted soybeans, bioengineered cotton made up 90 percent of the acreage of planted cotton, and bioengineered corn varieties made up 90 percent of the acreage planted corn (Ref. 11). In addition, bioengineered sugar beets accounted for 95 percent of the acreage of planted sugar beets in the 2009-2010 crop year (Ref. 11).\n\nIII Guidance\n\nGeneral principles\n\nIn determining whether a food is misbranded, FDA generally reviews labeling statements under sections 403 and 201(n) of the FD&C Act, and if applicable, other sections of the FD&C Act. Under section 403(a)(1) of the FD&C Act, a food is misbranded if its label or labeling is false or misleading in any particular. For example, the label on a chocolate bar may not declare that the chocolate contains ingredients, such as walnuts and coconut oil, if those ingredients are not actually present in the chocolate.\n\nUnder section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, both the presence and the absence of information are relevant to whether labeling is misleading. Put another way, food labeling may be misleading if it makes or suggests certain representations, or if it fails to disclose facts that are material in light of representations made or suggested about a food or facts that are material with respect to the consequences that may result from use of the food. In determining whether a labeling statement about a food is misleading under sections 201(n) and 403(a)(1) of the FD&C Act, FDA takes into account all labeling for that food, including the label on the food itself (e.g., all words used on the label including the brand name of the product, vignettes, logos or any of its containers or wrappers and other information accompanying the food, such as labeling for the food that is on the internet. Labeling means all labels and other written, printed, or graphic matter (1) upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers, or (2) accompanying such article. 21 U.S.C. 321(m) (section 201(m) of the FD&C Act). Firms should be aware that ""labeling"" may extend to information beyond that included on containers or wrappers. For example, in certain circumstances, information that is disseminated over the internet by, or on behalf of, a regulated company meets the definition of labeling in section 201(m) of the FD&C Act and is subject to applicable requirements. See, e.g., Guidance for Industry and FDA: Dear Manufacturer letter Regarding Food Labeling, January 2007, available at:\n\nhttp://wwwfdagov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/Labe\n\nlingNutrition/ucm053425.htm. These general principles apply in evaluating a food labeling claim, including a statement about whether a food is or is not developed using modern plant biotechnology.\n\nB Statements about foods that are not derived from genetically engineered plants\n\nFood manufacturers may voluntarily label their foods with information about whether the foods were not produced using bioengineering, as long as such information is truthful and not misleading. In general, an accurate statement about whether a food was not produced using bioengineering is one that provides information in a context that clearly refers to bioengineering technology. Examples of such statements include:\n\n""Not bioengineered.""\n\n""Not genetically engineered.""\n\n""Not genetically modified through the use of modern biotechnology.""\n\n""We do not use ingredients that were produced using modern biotechnology.""\n\n""This oil is made from soybeans that were not genetically engineered.""\n\n""Our corn growers do not plant bioengineered seeds.""\n\nOther terms are sometimes used by manufacturers in food labeling regarding whether a food was not derived from genetically engineered plants, including ""not genetically modified"" and claims using the acronym ""GMO"" (genetically modified organism). For the reasons discussed in the remaining paragraphs of this section, FDA recommends terms such as ""not bioengineered,"" ""not genetically engineered,"" and ""not genetically modified through the use of modern biotechnology."" However, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action against a label using the acronym ""GMO"" in a statement indicating that the product (or an ingredient) was not produced through the use of modern biotechnology, as long as the food is, in fact, not derived from a genetically engineered plant and the food\'s labeling is not otherwise false or misleading, as further discussed in this guidance. Similarly, we do not intend to take enforcement action against a label using the acronym ""GMO"" in a statement indicating that the product (or an ingredient) was produced through the use of modern biotechnology, as long as the statement was true and the food\'s labeling is not otherwise false or misleading.\n\nAs stated, FDA encourages manufacturers to use labeling claims that state that a food product (or its ingredients, as appropriate) was not developed using bioengineering, genetic engineering, or modern biotechnology such as the claims included above.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Voluntary Labeling Indicating Whether Foods Have or Have Not Been Derived from Genetically Engineered Plants']","['For purposes of section 7002(e)(2) of the ACA, a proposed biological product will be considered to be in the same _product class_ as a protein product previously approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2010, if both products are homologous to the same gene-coded sequence (e.g., the INS gene for insulin and insulin glargine) with allowance for additional novel flanking sequences (including sequences from other genes).

A definition of ""custom synthesised chemical"" was not provided in ICH Q11, but a custom synthesised chemical is generally understood to be one that is made specifically to a drug substance manufacturer\'s requirement, either in-house or externally, or available for purchase but where the only use is for pharmaceutical manufacture. The reference to ""non-pharmaceutical market"" in the ICH Q11 description of commercially available chemicals is intended to preclude purchased intermediates from being claimed as commercially available chemicals.\n\n[1]ICH Q11 makes an important distinction between commercially available chemicals and custom synthesised chemicals. An applicant generally need not justify the use of a commercially available chemical as a starting material, whereas a custom synthesised chemical proposed as a starting material should be justified in accordance with the ICH Q11 general principles. The availability of a chemical from multiple suppliers should not be the sole basis for the designation of a chemical as a commercially available starting material. This includes situations where a custom synthesized chemical has become available over time from multiple suppliers. Such chemicals should still be justified according to the ICH Q11 general principles for selection of starting materials. It can be acceptable for a starting material that is demonstrated to be a commercially available chemical to enter late in the synthesis, e.g., in the last chemical transformation prior to the drug substance. A chemical manufactured on a small scale can be suitable as a commercially available starting material, provided that the scale is sufficient for the manufacture of the drug substance and that the chemical is also used in a pre-existing, non-pharmaceutical market. In some cases, a chemical that does not meet the definition of a commercially available chemical (e.g., it does not have a non-pharmaceutical use) but is simple enough in structure may be accepted as a starting material (e.g., protected natural amino acids). However, in such cases, a rationale should be provided explaining why the starting material is considered appropriate (see Q&A 5.1) and why the proposed control strategy is appropriate to control impurities in the drug substance.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11_Q&As_Q&As'

This can include information on:\n\nThe ability of analytical procedures to detect impurities in the starting material;\n\nThe fate and purge of those impurities and their derivatives in subsequent processing steps;\n\nHow the proposed specification for each starting material will contribute to the control strategy.\n\nThe applicant should provide, as part of the justification, a flow diagram outlining the current synthetic route(s) for the manufacture of the drug substance, with the proposed starting materials clearly indicated. Changes to the starting material specification and to the synthetic route from the starting material to final drug substance are subject to regional, post-approval change requirements. In addition, regional requirements concerning starting material suppliers may also be applicable.\n\nAn applicant generally need not justify the use of a commercially available chemical as a starting material. A commercially available chemical is usually one that is sold as a commodity in a pre-existing, non-pharmaceutical market in addition to its proposed use as starting material. Chemicals produced by custom syntheses are not considered to be commercially available. If a chemical from a custom synthesis is proposed as a starting material, it should be justified in accordance with the general principles for the selection of starting materials outlined above in Section 5.1.1.\n\nIn some instances, additional purification steps by the drug substance manufacturer might be called for to ensure the consistent quality of a commercially available starting material. In these instances, the additional purification steps should be included as part of the description of the drug substance manufacturing process.

The ICH Q11 general principles apply to processes where multiple chemical transformations are performed without isolation of intermediates. In the absence of such isolations (e.g., crystallization, or starting materials and precipitation), design of the manufacturing process (e.g., kinetics) and/or unit operations (e.g., extraction, distillation, the use of scavenging agents) should be in place to adequately control and/or purge impurities and be described in the application.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11_Q&As_Q&As'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances , What information should be included in the application about a starting material that is a commercially available chemical? (5.14)\n--------------------\nContext: The full bibliographic reference should be cited close to where the reference appears in the text of the application (e.g., in a footnote or section endnote). The full text of the literature cited (e.g., journal article) should be included in the Literature References section, except when otherwise indicated. For example, as previously stated in this guidance, monographs from an official compendium need not be included in the application.\n\nAttachment 1:\n\nStarting materials for synthetic drug substances\n\nA starting material for a synthetic drug substance is a chemical compound of defined molecular structure that contributes to the structure of the drug substance. A reagent that contributes a minor structural element to the drug substance (e.g., hydride ion) is not considered to fall within the meaning of starting material. A synthesis can be linear or convergent. Therefore, an applicant should propose one or more starting materials to mark the beginning of each synthesis branch.\n\nThe description of the manufacturing process in an application begins with the starting material or materials. Appropriate GMPs, as defined in ICH Q7A, can apply to the manufacturing steps after introduction of the starting material. Because there is limited FDA oversight of the manufacturing of the starting material, the starting material should be selected and controlled so that the risk from future changes in the quality of the starting material affecting the identity, quality, purity, or potency of the drug substance is minimized. A proposed starting material should be chosen so that sufficient information will be available to the FDA on the manufacturing process to evaluate the safety and quality of the drug substance. A drug substance that is used to synthesize another drug substance is not an appropriate candidate for designation as a starting material. An applicant can discuss the selection of proposed starting materials prior to submitting its application.\n\nThe extent of information that should be submitted in the application to justify the proposed starting materials depends on whether or not the chemical has a significant nonpharmaceutical market. FDA will consider the justification provided to support a proposed starting material as well as other relevant information such as the proposed starting material specification and controls on manufacturing steps downstream from the proposed starting material when evaluating the appropriateness of a proposal to designate a chemical as a starting material.\n\nStarting Materials with a Significant Nonpharmaceutical Market\n\nA significant nonpharmaceutical market is considered to exist if the quantity of the chemical needed for the production of the drug substance represents only a small fraction of the chemical's total market. This is true whether the chemical is made by the drug substance manufacturer for its own use or is obtained from another firm. If the quality of the chemical made for the nonpharmaceutical market is insufficient to ensure consistent quality of the drug substance and the chemical is further processed to produce material of higher quality, the purification operations should be described as part of the manufacturing process of the drug substance (S.2.2). See section II of this attachment for recommendations on the documentation that should be provided for these starting materials.\n\nStarting Materials without a Significant Nonpharmaceutical Market\n\nA chemical should not be considered to have a significant nonpharmaceutical market if (1) the only market for the chemical is to manufacture drug substance; (2) the drug substancemanufacturer had to synthesize the chemical, or arrange for another firm to synthesize it, to produce drug substance for clinical trials; (3) an existing manufacturer of the chemical had to scale up its process to produce sufficient quantities of drug substance for clinical trials; or (4) the method of manufacture was provided by the drug substance manufacturer to the other firms that manufacture the chemical. See sections I and II of this attachment, respectively, for selection principles and recommendations on the documentation that should be provided for these starting materials.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #169 Drug Substance Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances , What information should be included in the application about a starting material that is a commercially available chemical? (5.14)\n--------------------\nContext: It is valuable for drug substance manufacturers to maintain close communication with manufacturers of starting materials. The quality of a starting material can be affected by changes in manufacturing process (e.g., changes in solvents, purification, catalysts, route of synthesis), and knowledge that a change has taken place can assist a drug substance manufacturer in maintaining a valid starting material specification.\n\nAttachment 2:\n\nStarting materials of plant or animal origin\n\nThe FDA considers (1) cells; (2) plants, plant parts, macroscopic fungi, or algae; or (3) animal tissues, organs, or body fluid from which the drug substance is derived to be starting material for a drug substance derived from a biological source. Identification of the biological source is warranted to ensure the identity, quality, and purity of the drug substance and to address critical safety issues (e.g., viruses, residual pesticides). The term drug substance derived from a biological source includes drug substances that are the chemical obtained directly from the biological source and semisynthetic drug substances that are produced by modification of a chemical (i.e., intermediate) obtained from the biological source. A semisynthetic drug substance can have more than one starting material, depending on the number of branches in the synthetic portion of the manufacturing process. A drug substance is considered semisynthetic when at least one of the starting materials is of biological origin.\n\nThe recommendations in Attachment 2 do not pertain to:\n\nStarting materials that are highly purified chemicals obtained from biological sources that had significant nonpharmaceutical markets before they were used in the drug substance synthesis (e.g., Sucrose, tartaric acid).\n\nStarting materials of synthetic origin for semisynthetic drug substances\n\nCells used in fermentation processes\n\nCells or tissue used in cell culture processes\n\nTransgenic plants or animals\n\nThe recommendations in Attachment 1 apply to starting materials of biological origin that have significant nonpharmaceutical markets and starting materials of synthetic origin for semisynthetic drug substances. Starting materials for antibiotics and other cellular metabolites produced by microorganisms using conventional fermentation processes will be covered by a forthcoming guidance.\n\nI. DOCUMENTATION\n\nApplicants should provide the following information in S.2.3 for plant or animal starting materials. For semisynthetic drug substances the information recommended in Attachment 1 should be provided for the starting materials of synthetic origin, if there are any, in addition to the information provided for the plant or animal starting materials.\n\nA. Information on Plant or Animal Starting Materials\n\nThe following should be provided for plant starting materials:\n\nBiological identification (i.e., Family, genus, species, variety) and the process for confirming taxonomic authenticit* Part of the plant used (e.g., Seed, flower, roots, all)\n\nGeographic areas of harvesting (e.g., Countries, provinces, states)\n\nGrowing season and harvest time\n\nList of pesticides and herbicides that may be used in the geographic areas of harvesting\n\nSupplier (i.e., Company with overall responsibility for collecting biomass, not individual harvesters, plantation owners, or subcontractors)\n\nThe following should be provided for animal starting materials:\n\nBiological identification (i.e., Species)\n\nSpecific part of animal used (e.g., Pancreas, bone, urine)\n\nCountry of origin23 Footnote 23: Bovine-derived materials should not be from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) countries as defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (9 CFR 94.11) unless otherwise exempted by the Agency.\n\nA list of known diseases or pathogens associated with the type of animal\n\nCriteria for ensuring animal health\n\nFor animals that are consumed for food, a statement of compliance with USDA or equivalent requirements\n\nSupplier (i.e., Company with overall responsibility for collecting biomass, not individual farmers or subcontractors)\n\nFlow Diagram of the Manufacturing Process\n\nWhen the drug substance is the chemical obtained directly from the biological source this flow diagram should be the same as the flow diagram in S.2.2. The flow diagram in S.2.2 can be cross-referenced.\n\nFor semisynthetic drug substances, the flow diagram should depict the manufacturing process that results in the chemical (i.e., intermediate) from the biological source and the synthetic part of the manufacturing process. See Attachment 1, Section II. B for recommendations on the flow diagram for the synthetic part of the manufacturing process.\n\nSpecifications for Plant or Animal Starting Materials\n\nThe specification for the starting material should be based on the quality of the material used to prepare the batches of drug substance used to establish the specification for the drug substance (see sections V.A, V.D, and V.E of this guidance). The specification for plant starting materials should include identity tests for determining taxonomic authenticity and, when appropriate, screening for pesticides and herbicides. The specification for the animal starting material should include screening for adventitious agents, when appropriate.\n\nA chemical substance (e.g., plant extract) used to produce a semisynthetic drug substance or a crude drug substance derived from a plant or animal starting material is considered an intermediate. Information on the intermediate, including the specification, should be provided in S.2.4.\n\nII Environmental Assessment\n\nAll NADAs and ANADAs must include either an environmental assessment (EA) or claim of categorical exclusion from the requirement to provide an environmental assessment (21 CFR 25.15(a)). Environmental information should be included in the Environmental Impact section of an NADA or ANADA. Applicants should refer to the VICH guidance GL6 Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for Veterinary Medicinal Products (VMPs) and 21 CFR part 25 for additional information on environmental assessments.\n\nIII Postapproval Issues\n\nChanges in the information on plant or animal starting materials (see section I.A of this attachment) should be reported to the Agency in a prior approval supplement. The supplement should include a new or revised environmental assessment or claim of categorical exclusion from the requirement to provide an environmental assessment, as appropriate. Information should also be provided concerning the potential for the change to result in new impurities or higher levels of known impurities. A change that is merely editorial or administrative (e.g., a change in ownership of the supplier with no change in the process for overseeing collection of biomass) can be submitted in an annual report.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n11 Glossary\n\nAdvertitious Agents: For the purpose of this guidance, pathogenic viruses and non-viral agents (e.g., transmissible spongiform encephalopathy agents, pathogenic bacteria, mycoplasma) in plants, animals, or cells or any materials derived therefrom, used in the manufacture of human drug substances or products\n\nAlternative Processes: Two or more manufacturing processes described in an application that can be used to prepare the same intermediate or drug substance\n\nAuxiliary Materials: Substances (e.g., charcoal, filter aid) used during the manufacturing process of a drug substance that are not normally considered to be starting materials, intermediates, reagents, solvents, catalysts, or diluents\n\nCritical: Describes a process step or process control (e.g., process condition, test requirement, or other relevant parameter or item) that must be controlled within predetermined criteria to ensure that the drug substance meets its specification\n\nCrystal Shape (Habit): Crystals with the same internal structure but different external shape because different crystal faces have developed during growth\n\nDegradation Product: A molecule resulting from a chemical change in the drug molecule brought about over time and/or by the action of, for example, light, temperature, pH, water, and/or by reaction with an excipient (or diluent), another drug substance, and/or the immediate container closure system.

Although an effort has been made to use standard definitions as far as possible, they may have different meanings in other contexts and documents. The following definitions are provided to facilitate interpretation of the guidelines. The definitions are consistent with those published in other WHO quality assurance guidelines. The Quality Assurance of Medicines Terminology Database was established in August 2005 and includes the definitions of terms related to quality assurance of medicines. This database is intended to help harmonize terminology and to avoid misunderstandings that may result from the different terms and their interpretations used in various WHO publications.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: method-dependent. For the purpose of stability testing, tests for purity should focus on methods for determination of degradation products.\n\nThe degree of purity, as well as the individual and total amounts of degradation products of the biotechnological/biological product entered into the stability studies, should be reported and documented whenever possible. Limits of acceptable degradation should be derived from the analytical profiles of batches of the drug substance and drug product used in the preclinical and clinical studies.\n\nThe use of relevant physicochemical, biochemical, and immunochemical analytical methodologies should permit a comprehensive characterization of the drug substance and/or drug product (e.g., molecular size, charge, hydrophobicity) and the accurate detection of degradation changes that may result from deamidation, oxidation, sulfoxidation, aggregation, or fragmentation during storage. As examples, methods that may contribute to this include electrophoresis (SDS09Page, immunoelectrophoresis, Western blot, isoelectrofocusing), high-resolution chromatography (e.g., reversed-phase chromatography, gel filtration, ion exchange, affinity chromatography), and peptide mapping.\n\nWherever significant qualitative or quantitative changes indicative of degradation product formation are detected during long-term, accelerated, and/or stress stability studies, consideration should be given to potential hazards and to the need for characterization and quantification of degradation products within the long-term stability program. Acceptable limits should be proposed and justified, taking into account the levels observed in material used in preclinical and clinical studies.\n\nFor substances that cannot be properly characterized or products for which an exact analysis of the purity cannot be determined through routine analytical methods, the applicant should propose and justify alternative testing procedures.\n\nOther Product Characteristics (5.4)\n\nThe following product characteristics, though not specifically relating to biotechnological/biological products, should be monitored and reported for the drug product in its final container:\n\nVisual appearance of the product (color and opacity for solutions/suspensions; color, texture, and dissolution time for powders), visible particulates in solutions or after the reconstitution of powders or lyophilized cakes, pH, and moisture level of powders and lyophilized products.\n\nSterility testing or alternatives (e.g., container/closure integrity testing) should be performed at a minimum initially and at the end of the proposed shelf life.\n\nAdditives (e.g., stabilizers, preservatives) or excipients may degrade during the dating period of the drug product. If there is any indication during preliminary stability studies that reaction or degradation of such materials adversely affect the quality of the drug product, these items may need to be monitored during the stability program.\n\nThe container/closure has the potential to affect the product adversely and should be carefully evaluated (see below).\n\nVI.: Storage CONDITIONS (6)\n\nA. Temperature (6.1)\n\nBecause most finished biotechnological/biological products need precisely defined storage temperatures, the storage conditions for the real-time/real-temperature stability studies may be confined to the proposed storage temperature.\n\nB. Humidity (6.2)\n\nBiotechnological/biological products are generally distributed in containers protecting them against humidity. Therefore, where it can be demonstrated that the proposed containers (and conditions of storage) afford sufficient protection against high and low humidity, stability tests at different relative humidities can usually be omitted. Where humidity-protecting containers are not used, appropriate stability data should be provided.\n\nC. Accelerated and Stress Conditions (6.3)\n\nAs previously noted, the expiration dating should be based on real-time/real-temperature data. However, it is strongly suggested that studies be conducted on the drug substance and drug product under accelerated and stress conditions. Studies under accelerated conditions may provide useful support data for establishing the expiration date, provide product stability information or future product development (e.g., preliminary assessment of proposed manufacturing changes such as change in formulation, scale-up), assist in validation of analytical methods for the stability program, or generate information that may help elucidate the degradation profile of the drug substance or drug product. Studies under stress conditions may be useful in determining whether accidental exposures to conditions other than those proposed (e.g., during transportation) are deleterious to the product and also for evaluating which specific test parameters may be the best indicators of product stability. Studies of the exposure of the drug substance or drug product to extreme conditions may help to reveal patterns of degradation; if so, such changes should be monitored under proposed storage conditions. Although the tripartite guideline on stability describes the conditions of the accelerated and stress study, the applicant should note that those conditions may not be appropriate for biotechnological/biological products. Conditions should be carefully selected on a case-by-case basis.\n\nD. Light (6.4)\n\nApplicants should consult the appropriate regulatory authorities on a case-by-case basis to determine guidance for testing.\n\nE. Container/Closure (6.5)\n\nChanges in the quality of the product may occur due to the interactions between the formulated biotechnological/biological product and container/closure. Where the lack of interactions cannot be excluded in liquid products (other than sealed ampules), stability studies should include samples maintained in the inverted or horizontal position (i.e., in contact with the closure), as well as in the upright position, to determine the effects of the closure on product quality. Data should be supplied for all different container/closure combinations that will be marketed.\n\nIn addition to the standard data necessary for a conventional single-use vial, the applicant should demonstrate that the closure used with a multiple-dose vial is capable of withstanding the conditions of repeated insertions and withdrawals so that the product retains its full potency, purity, and quality for the maximum period specified in the instructions-for-use on containers, packages, and/or package inserts. Such labeling should be in accordance with relevant national/regional requirements.\n\nF. Stability after Reconstitution of Freeze-Dried Product (6.6)\n\nThe stability of freeze-dried products after their reconstitution should be demonstrated for the conditions and the maximum storage period specified on containers, packages, and/or package inserts. Such labeling should be in accordance with relevant national/regional requirements.\n\nVII Testing Frequency (7)\n\nThe shelf lives of biotechnological/biological products may vary from days to several years. Thus, it is difficult to draft uniform guidelines regarding the stability study duration and testing frequency that would be applicable to all types of biotechnological/biological products. With only a few exceptions, however, the shelf lives for existing products and potential future products will be within the range of 0.5 to 5 years. Therefore, the guidance is based upon expected shelf lives in that range. This takes into account the fact that degradation of biotechnological/biological products may not be governed by the same factors during different intervals of a long storage period.\n\nWhen shelf lives of 1 year or less are proposed, the real-time stability studies should be conducted monthly for the first 3 months and at 3 month intervals thereafter. For products with proposed shelf lives of greater than 1 year, the studies should be conducted every 3 months during the first year of storage, every 6 months during the second year, and annually thereafter.\n\nWhile the testing intervals listed above may be appropriate in the preapproval or prelicense stage, reduced testing may be appropriate after approval or licensure where data are available that demonstrate adequate stability. Where data exist that indicate the stability of a product is not compromised, the applicant is encouraged to submit a protocol that supports elimination of specific test intervals (e.g., 9-month testing) for postapproval/postlicensure, long-term studies.\n\nVIII Specifications (8)\n\nAlthough biotechnological/biological products may be subject to significant losses of activity, physicochemical changes, or degradation during storage, international and national regulations have provided little guidance with respect to distinct release and end of shelf life specifications. Recommendations for maximum acceptable losses of activity, limits for physicochemical changes, or degradation during the proposed shelf life have not been developed for individual types or groups of biotechnological/biological products but are considered on a case-by-case basis. Each product should retain its specifications within established limits for safety, purity, and potency throughout its proposed shelf life. These specifications and limits should be derived from all available information using the appropriate statistical methods. The use of different specifications for release and expiration should be supported by sufficient data to demonstrate that the clinical performance is not affected, as discussed in the tripartite guideline on stability.\n\nLabeling (9)\n--------------------\nContext title: Q5C Quality of Biotechnological Products- Stability Testing of Biotechnological:Biological Products'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: Stability testing for certain drug products and components\n\nPeriodic examinations of data and of reserve samples\n\nIf the demand for MNPs cannot be met by the measures described above, manufacturers can consider reducing activities that are more directly connected with batch manufacturing or a product accept/reject decision provided that they have a documented rationale or risk assessment to show that the proposed changes will not unacceptably reduce assurance of product quality. Examples include:\n\nNot requiring second-person verification of activities for less critical steps (though we recommend a self-check of work)\n\nReducing the number of samples for labor-intensive laboratory testing\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nForgoing an in-process test to assure adequacy of mix, particularly when making successive batches, where the risk is judged to be low in terms of drug safety and efficacy\n\nDelaying completion of deviation investigations of minor events\n\nCDER recommends that in taking such measures, firms plan to carefully monitor indicators of product quality to note any unfavorable trends or shifts as a result of the implementation of the Plan. CDER also recommends that firms retain samples for testing at a later date in cases where testing is reduced or omitted because of lack of resources.\n\nReturning to Normal Operations\n\nA critical component of any emergency Plan is a procedure detailing when and how the transition back to pre-emergency, or normal, operations should occur. Once the Plan has been activated, it should remain active continuously until there is a reasonable expectation that normal operations will be maintainable for an extended period of time. The Plan should consider:\n\nWhat factors will indicate that it is time to return to normal operations or deactivate the Plan\n\nWhat resources will be necessary to complete postponed activities\n\nWhat activities will enable a successful transition back to normal operations\n\nThe following questions can stimulate some useful ideas for consideration and inclusion in the Plan:\n\nWhat information should be used to signal a return to normal operations (e.g., percentage of absenteeism in critical manufacturing and/or laboratory positions has remained below X percent for Y number of consecutive days)?\n\nHow should efforts to resume processes suspended during the emergency be prioritized?\n\nWhat is the most efficient method to address delayed activities such as sample analysis and equipment calibrations?\n\nHow should issues resulting from the execution of the Plan (e.g., out of specification test results, deviations, unusual complaints) be reported to CDER?\n\nWhat mechanism is most appropriate to review and summarize activities taken during Plan activation?\n\nCDER encourages companies to maintain awareness of the emergency on the local, national, and global scale as much as possible. This awareness will help the company anticipate potential future concerns or imminent hazards that could affect their decision to resume normal operations or continue operating under their Plan. CDER also recommends that firms conduct a formal post-execution assessment of the execution outcomes and update their Plan as appropriate.\n\nNotifying CDER\n\nIt is probable that despite every effort to avoid shortages, the very nature of an emergency makes shortages of products possible or even likely. To foster communication between companies and CDER and protect the national public health, we encourage manufacturers to include a procedure in their Plan for notifying CDER when the Plan is activated and when returning to normaloperations. These communications are intended to help CDER maintain awareness of any potential shortage situations and act accordingly to avoid or mitigate them. During periods when manufacturers are experiencing high rates of absenteeism, it is possible that CDER will also experience staff shortages. In such circumstances, CDER\'s ability to confirm receipt or subsequent activities could be delayed. We suggest that notifications of this nature include the following information, and be sent to CDERStaffingNotice@FDA.HHS.GOV:\n\nWithin 1 day of Plan activation:\n\nManufacturing facilities affected\n\nDate the Plan is implemented at each affected facility\n\nContact information for site-responsible person\n\nCompany-identified criteria that have triggered activation of the Plan\n\nProducts to be manufactured under the altered procedures of the Plan (include NDA, ANDA, and BLA numbers)\n\nProducts to have manufacturing temporarily delayed (include NDA, ANDA, BLA numbers)\n\nAny anticipated or potential shortages\n\nQuantity of finished product on hand for any product with an anticipated or potential shortage\n\nWithin 1 day of the Plan deactivation:\n\nManufacturing facilities affected\n\nDate the Plan was implemented at each affected facility\n\nDate each affected facility returned to normal operations\n\nContact information for site-responsible person\n\nIf, after releasing a MNP under the Plan, a firm obtains information leading to suspicion that the product might be defective, the firm should contact CDER immediately in adherence to existing recall reporting regulations (21 CFR 7.40) or defect reporting requirements for drug application products (21 CFR 314.81(b)) and therapeutic biological products regulated by CDER (21 CFR 600.14).\n\nDocumenting Emergency Activities\n\nCDER recommends that manufacturers evaluate changes to be made in accordance with the execution of the Plan and manage those changes having the potential to affect product quality in accordance with the CGMP requirements. Records that support decisions to carry out changes to approved procedures for manufacturing and release of products under the Plan should be retained at the site in accordance with the CGMP requirements (see, e.g., 21 CFR 211.180). Records FDA expects to be available include but are not limited to the following:\n\nAny supporting documentation for the Plan, including risk assessments and management approval for any change to an approved procedure or activity (e.g., delaying, substituting, or reducing the frequency of an approved procedure or activity)\n\nLot numbers and application numbers of each product manufactured under the Plan\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAnalytical data and relevant records for all products manufactured under an unapproved or nonstandard process, including the outcomes of delayed activities that are part of approved procedures or requirements for batch release (e.g., results from delayed specification tests)\n\nTimeline for completion of delayed or substituted activities that are part of the approved application or standard operating procedures, such as sample analysis and equipment calibrations and outcomes\n\nIf these records were to be reviewed during an inspection, FDA will consider the prevailing circumstances and the rationale used by a manufacturer to justify any observed discrepancies or deviations from a manufacturer\'s standard operating procedures and approved application(s).\n\nIV Optimization and Demonstration of Preparedness\n\nThe optimization of an emergency plan can be an iterative process that involves drafting, reviewing, testing, and revising the Plan, perhaps more than once. Optimization can involve progressing from a simple discussion-based ""table top"" event toward a more elaborate simulation demonstrating the capability of the Plan. To derive the most benefit from this process, any tests should strive to simulate anticipated emergency conditions as closely as possible and should be conducted in a no-fault environment with the goal to improve the plan and not place blame for mistakes or oversights.\n\nEach company should determine the most appropriate approach to ensure preparedness for execution of the Plan. CDER recommends that manufacturers conduct practice drills before an emergency appears imminent to increase familiarity of personnel at all levels with the Plan and their responsibilities under the Plan. CDER recommends considering the following activities, if feasible and practical:\n\nPracticing activation and deactivation of the Plan, involving all levels and roles within the company\n\nHaving fully trained employees observe cross-trained employees during an exercise and provide immediate constructive feedback\n\nCarrying out contingency analytical procedures in conjunction with standard procedures\n\nAny observations or outcomes resulting from these activities should be used to optimize the Plan and minimize any potential safety or product quality concerns. These corrections are typically best addressed through a formal meeting process following the exercise.\n\nV Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n\nThis guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).\n\nThe time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average 72 hours per response, including the time to review instructions, search existing data sources, gather the data needed, and complete and review the information collection. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or suggestions for reducing this burden to:\n\nOffice of Counter-Terrorism and Emergency Coordination, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 51, rm. 3341, Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002.\n\nThis guidance also refers to previously approved collections of information found in FDA regulations. The collections of information in 21 CFR 7.40 have been approved under OMB Control No. 0910-0249; the collections of information in 21 CFR part 211 have been approved under OMB Control No. 0910-0139; the collections of information in 21 CFR 314.81(b)(1) have been approved under OMB Control No. 0910-0001; the collections of information in 21 CFR 600.14 have been approved under OMB Control No. 0910-0458.\n--------------------\nContext title: Planning for the Effects of High Absenteeism to Ensure Availability of Medically Necessary Drug Products'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: ii.1.3 Selection of Batches (2.1.3)\n\nData from formal stability studies should be provided on at least three primary batches of the drug substance. The batches should be manufactured to a minimum of pilot scale by the same synthetic route as production batches and using a method of manufacture and procedure that simulates the final process to be used for production batches. The overall quality of the batches of drug substance placed on formal stability studies should be representative of the quality of the material to be made on a production scale.\n\nOther supporting data can be provided.\n\nii.1.4 Container Closure System (2.1.4)\n\nThe stability studies should be conducted on the drug substance packaged in a container closure system that is the same as or simulates the packaging proposed for storage and distribution.\n\nii.1.5 Specification (2.1.5)\n\nSpecification, which is a list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and proposed acceptance criteria, is addressed in ICH Q6A Specifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Chemical Substances and Q6B__Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSpecifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Biotechnological/Biological Products. In addition, specification for degradation products in a drug substance is discussed in ICH Q3A Impurities in New Drug Substances.\n\nStability studies should include testing of those attributes of the drug substance that are susceptible to change during storage and are likely to influence quality, safety, and/or efficacy. The testing should cover, as appropriate, the physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological attributes. Validated stability-indicating analytical procedures should be applied. Whether and to what extent replication should be performed should depend on the results from validation studies.\n\nTesting Frequency (2.1.6)\n\nFor long-term studies, frequency of testing should be sufficient to establish the stability profile of the drug substance. For drug substances with a proposed retest period of at least 12 months, the frequency of testing at the long-term storage condition should normally be every 3 months over the first year, every 6 months over the second year, and annually thereafter through the proposed retest period.\n\nAt the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of three time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g., 0, 3, and 6 months), from a 6-month study is recommended. Where an expectation (based on development experience) exists that the results from accelerated studies are likely to approach significant change criteria, increased testing should be conducted either by adding samples at the final time point or including a fourth time point in the study design.\n\nWhen testing at the intermediate storage condition is called for as a result of significant change at the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of four time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g., 0, 6, 9, 12 months), from a 12-month study is recommended.\n\nStorage Conditions (2.1.7)\n\nIn general, a drug substance should be evaluated under storage conditions (with appropriate tolerances) that test its thermal stability and, if applicable, its sensitivity to moisture. The storage conditions and the lengths of studies chosen should be sufficient to cover storage, shipment, and subsequent use.\n\nThe long-term testing should cover a minimum of 12 months' duration on at least three primary batches at the time of submission and should be continued for a period of time sufficient to cover the proposed retest period. Additional data accumulated during the assessment period of the registration application should be submitted to the authorities if requested. Data from the accelerated storage condition and, if appropriate, from the intermediate storage condition can be used to evaluate the effect of short-term excursions outside the label storage conditions (such as might occur during shipping).\n\nLong-term, accelerated, and, where appropriate, intermediate storage conditions for drug substances are detailed in the sections below. The general case should apply if the drug substance is not specifically covered by a subsequent section. Alternative storage conditions can be used if justified.\n\nIt is up to the applicant to decide whether long-term stability studies are performed at (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/60\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) or (30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/65\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}).\n\n** If (30^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/65\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) is the long-term condition, there is no intermediate condition.\n\nIf long-term studies are conducted at (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}/60\\%\\mathrm{\\ RH}\\pm 5\\% \\mathrm{\\ RH}) and significant change occurs at any time during 6 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, additional testing at the intermediate storage condition should be conducted and evaluated against significant change criteria. Testing at the intermediate storage condition should include all tests, unless otherwise justified. The initial application should include a minimum of 6 months' data from a 12-month study at the intermediate storage condition.\n\nSignificant change for a drug substance is defined as failure to meet its specification.\n\nData from refrigerated storage should be assessed according to the evaluation section of this guidance, except where explicitly noted below.\n\nIf significant change occurs between 3 and 6 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, the proposed retest period should be based on the real time data available at the long-term storage condition.\n\nIf significant change occurs within the first 3 months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, a discussion should be provided to address the effect of short-term excursions outside the label storage condition (e.g., during shipping or handling). This discussion can be supported, if appropriate, by further testing on a single batch of the drug substance for a period shorter than 3 months but with more frequent testing than usual. It is considered unnecessary to continue to test a drug substance through 6 months when a significant change has occurred within the first 3 months.\n\nFor drug substances intended for storage in a freezer, the retest period should be based on the real time data obtained at the long-term storage condition. In the absence of an accelerated storage condition for drug substances intended to be stored in a freezer, testing on a single batch at an elevated temperature (e.g., (5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 3^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) or (25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\pm 2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})) for an appropriate time period should be conducted to address the effect of short-term excursions outside the proposed label storage condition (e.g., during shipping or handling).\n\nDrug substances intended for storage below -20({}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) (2.1.7.4)\n\nDrug substances intended for storage below -20({}^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}) should be treated on a case-by-case basis.\n\n8 Stability Commitment (2.1.8)\n\nWhen available long-term stability data on primary batches do not cover the proposed retest period granted at the time of approval, a commitment should be made to continue the stability studies postapproval to firmly establish the retest period.\n\nWhere the submission includes long-term stability data on three production batches covering the proposed retest period, a postapproval commitment is considered unnecessary. Otherwise, one of the following commitments should be made:\n\nIf the submission includes data from stability studies on at least three production batches, a commitment should be made to continue these studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nIf the submission includes data from stability studies on fewer than three production batches, a commitment should be made to continue these studies through the proposed retest period and to place additional production batches, to a total of at least three, on long-term stability studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nIf the submission does not include stability data on production batches, a commitment should be made to place the first three production batches on long-term stability studies through the proposed retest period.\n\nThe stability protocol used for long-term studies for the stability commitment should be the same as that for the primary batches, unless otherwise scientifically justified.\n\n9.1.9 Evaluation (2.1.9)\n\nThe purpose of the stability study is to establish, based on testing a minimum of three batches of the drug substance and evaluating the stability information (including, as appropriate, results of the physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological tests), a retest period applicable to all future batches of the drug substance manufactured under similar circumstances. The degree of variability of individual batches affects the confidence that a future production batch will remain within specification throughout the assigned retest period.\n\nThe data may show so little degradation and so little variability that it is apparent from looking at the data that the requested retest period will be granted. Under these circumstances, it is normally unnecessary to go through the formal statistical analysis; providing a justification for the omission should be sufficient.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1A(R2) Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products""

57,"Delving into Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What is unique about the ingredient labeling of dietary supplements?","['--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What is unique about the ingredient labeling of dietary supplements?\n--------------------\nContext: Small Entity Compliance Guide on Structure/Function Claims\n\nJANUARY 2002\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (P.L. 104-121). This guidance document restates in plain language the legal requirements set forth in a regulation concerning labeling claims for dietary supplements. This is a Level 2 guidance document published for immediate implementation in accordance with FDA\'s good guidance practices (21 CFR 10.115). The regulations are binding and have the force and effect of law. However, this guidance document represents the agency\'s current thinking on this subject and does not, itself, create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute and regulations.\n\nSummary\n\nOn January 6, 2000, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a final rule in the Federal Register defining the types of statements that may be used on the label and in the labeling of dietary supplements without prior review by the agency (65 FR 1000) (http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/(\\sim)lrd/fro00106.html ). Called structure/function claims, these claims are statements that describe the effect a dietary supplement may have on the structure or function of the body. The regulation also provides criteria to assist you in determining when a statement about a dietary supplement is a disease claim, that is, a claim to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease. Disease claims require prior approval by FDA and may be made only for products that are approved drug products or for foods under separate legal provisions that apply to claims called ""health claims.""\n\nThis guidance discusses only the requirements that apply to determining whether a claim is a structure/function claim or a disease claim. It should be noted that other regulations also cover labeling and packaging requirements for dietary supplements. These requirementswere published as final rules in the Federal Registers of September 23, 1997 (62 FR 49826), June 5, 1998 (63 FR 30615), and Jan 15, 1997 (62 FR 2218)\n\n(https://www.federalregister.gov/ (https://www.federalregister.gov/)) (see Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) Parts 101 and 111).(1).\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\nThe regulation added $101.93(f) and (g) to Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 101. These two sections define what types of claims are structure/function claims and what types of claims are disease claims. In addition to these definitions, the regulation includes criteria that are intended to assist you in determining whether a particular statement is or is not a disease claim. Finally, the preamble to this rule clarifies several legal issues that are important to understand if you use structure/function claims on the labels or in the labeling of your products. They are restated below.\n\nBasic Legal Requirements for Structure/Function Claims. What are structure/function claims? The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) added section 403(r)(6) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)2. This section of the law states that a dietary supplement may bear certain statements on its label or in its labeling if the claim meets certain requirements. Section 101.93(f) simply restates part of the definition of the types of claims that may be made under section 403(r)(6) of the FD&C Act. Section 101.93(f) reads: (f) Permitted structure/function statements. Dietary supplement labels or labeling may, subject to the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, bear statements that describe the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans or that characterize the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, provided that such statements are not disease claims under paragraph (g) of this section. If the label or labeling of a product marketed as a dietary supplement bears a disease claim as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, the product will be subject to regulation as a drug unless the claim is an authorized health claim for which the product qualifies. Are there other claims that can be made for dietary supplements under this section of the law? Yes. Section 403(r)(6) also states that dietary supplements can use claims about nutrient deficiency diseases (for example, vitamin C and scurvy) or that describe the effect of the dietary supplement on general well-being. What requirements must I meet to make any of these types of claims for my dietary supplement?There are three requirements you must meet. First, the law says you can make these claims if you have substantiation that the claims are truthful and not misleading. You must have this substantiation before you make the claims. Second, you must notify FDA that you are using the claim within 30 days of first marketing your product. Third, the claim must include a mandatory disclaimer statement that is provided for in the law.\nWhere can I find information on the mandatory disclaimer and the notification I need to send in?\n\nWe have published regulations that describe exactly what the disclaimer must say and what you must include in your notification to us and where you must send it in the September 23, 1997 Federal Register (62 FR 49859 and 49883, respectively). These requirements can be found in 21 CFR 101.93(b) through (e) and 21 CFR 101.93(a), respectively.\nB. When and What You Must Do To Comply With the New Regulation.**\n\nWhen does this rule become effective?\n\nThe rule became effective on February 7, 2000, for any products marketed for the first time after publication of the final rule or for any new claims made for an existing product after publication of the final rule (i.e., new claims made after January 6, 2000).\nIf I have existing inventory, do I need to re-label it now?\n\nLarge businesses had until January 7, 2001, to bring existing claims on products into compliance. FDA granted this period for firms to use up their label inventories. Small businesses had until July 7, 2001, to bring existing claims on products into compliance. Any existing inventory not used up after these dates would need to be relabeled.\nC. How Do I Determine if a Claim is a Structure/Function Claim or a Disease Claim?\n\nIt may not be possible always to draw a bright line between structure/function and disease claims. You should look at the objective evidence in your labeling to assess whether a claim explicitly or implicitly is a disease claim. For example, a statement may not mention a disease but may refer to identifiable characteristic signs or symptoms of a disease such that the intended use of the product to treat or prevent the disease may be inferred. It is important that you keep in mind two things. First, the context of the statement, decided from information on the label and in other labeling, will determine if the statement is considered to be a disease claim. Second, dietary supplements may not bear disease claims, explicit or implied, unless the claim has undergone premarket review by FDA and has been authorized or approved under the rules for health claims or drugs, as appropriate. To assist you in deciding whether a claim is or isn\'t a disease claim, the new regulation contains a definition for disease, and then includes 10 criteria intended to help clarify the types of claims that may be made for dietary supplements without prior authorization or approval by FDA. We are providing that disease definition and an explanation of the 10 criteria below.\n\nWhat is the definition of a disease?Section 101.93(g) defines disease as:\n\n...damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition.\n\nWhat are the criteria for determining if a statement is a disease claim?\n\nThere are 10 criteria in the rule that are useful in determining if a statement is a disease claim.\n\nCriterion 1: Claims an effect on a disease or class of diseases (see section E, starting on page 1012 of the preamble to the rule).\n\nA statement is a disease claim if it mentions a specific disease or class of diseases. For example, a claim that a product is ""protective against the development of cancer"" or ""reduces the pain and stiffness associated with arthritis"" would be a disease claim.\n\nA statement also is a disease claim if it implies that it has an effect on a specific disease or class of diseases by using descriptions of the disease state. Examples of implied disease claims are ""relieves crushing chest pain (angina),"" ""improves joint mobility and reduces inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis),"" or ""relief of bronchospasm (asthma).""\n\nCriterion 2: Claims an effect on characteristic signs or symptoms of disease using scientific or lay terminology (see section F, starting on page 1015 of the preamble to the rule).\n\nHow can I tell if a particular claimed effect is a sign or symptom of a specific disease?\n\nThe test of whether claimed effects are characteristic signs or symptoms depends on 2 questions: (1) Is the condition, to which the signs and symptoms refer, related to a disease; and (2) are the signs and symptoms referred to in the labeling characteristic of the disease and permit the inference that the product is intended to affect that disease.\n\nDoes it matter if I don\'t use every sign or symptom of a condition or if I use layman\'s terms instead of technical language?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide on Structure:Function Claims'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What is unique about the ingredient labeling of dietary supplements?\n--------------------\nContext: How Do the Nutrient Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels Differ?\n\nBoth the content and format of the Supplement Facts label have been updated to correspond to the Nutrition Facts label, wherever possible. However, there are still some differences between the two. On the Supplement Facts label, information on calories and serving size was not made more prominent through increased type size, as it has been on the Nutrition Facts label. While the percentage of the RDI for protein for foods purported to be for infants through 12 months of age is allowed on Nutrition Facts labels, this declaration must be omitted for Supplement Facts labels (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)).\n\nIn addition, the new ordering for vitamins and minerals on the Supplement Facts label is as follows: vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate and folic acid, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, choline, calcium, iron,phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, potassium, and fluoride (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(B)).\n\nHas Nutrient Compliance or the Level of Variance Allowed Changed?\n\nThere are still two classes of nutrients for compliance purposes. Class I covers those added nutrients in fortified or fabricated foods (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(i)), and Class II nutrients are those that are naturally occurring, or indigenous, nutrients (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(ii)). For compliance purposes, if both Class I and Class II nutrients are present in the final food product, then the total amount of the nutrient (both indigenous and exogenous) is subject to class I requirements.\n\nThe updated rule does not change the level of variances allowed in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and 101.9(g)(5), but the rule also now includes soluble fiber and insoluble fiber in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and added sugars in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Therefore, 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) now states that a food with a label declaration of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat will be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the FD&C Act, unless the nutrient content of the composite is formulated to be at least equal to the declared value for the vitamin, mineral, protein, or dietary fiber meeting the definition of a Class I nutrient (potassium has been removed), or the nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to 80 percent of the declared value for the vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber meeting the definition of a Class II nutrient (potassium and ""other carbohydrate"" have been removed). Our regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5), state that a food with a label declaration of calories, sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium will be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the FD&C Act if the nutrient content of the composite is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label. Reasonable excesses of soluble fiber, insoluble fiber and sugar alcohols, and reasonable deficiencies of added sugars are also now acceptable within current good manufacturing practices.\n\nWhich Version of the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International Should be Used?\n\nThe final rule now incorporates by reference the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International, 19th edition (2012) (21 CFR 101.9(l)(1)(i)).\n\nVIII. How Do I Comply with the Formatting Requirements?\n\nThere are required formats for Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels. We strongly recommend that the nutrition information be presented using the graphic specifications below (see also Appendix B to 21 CFR part 101 and Ref. 8).\n\nVIII.1 How Do I Comply with the Standard Version of the Nutrition Facts Label?\n\nFigures 3 through 5 reflect what a standard vertical Nutrition Facts label must look like (see 21 CFR 101.9(d)(12)). This format is to be used except on foods where the tabular display is\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]\n\n11 How Has the Formatting Changed for the ""Nutrition Facts"" Header on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe ""Nutrition Facts"" heading must be in a type size no smaller than all other print size in the nutrition label, except for the numerical information for ""Calories,"" which according to 21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii) must be in a type size no smaller than 22 point for the standard label (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)). It must be set the full width of the nutrient information, unless impractical (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)). It is not required to be set the full width of the nutrient information for labels presented according to the following formats: tabular display, aggregate display, tabular dual column display, tabular display for small or intermediate-sized packages, and linear display for small or intermediate-sized packages (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)).\n\nA thin horizontal line (i.e., a hairline rule) is to be inserted directly beneath the Nutrition Facts heading, before the servings per container statement (except on the linear display discussed below) (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(v)).\n\nFigure 5: Standard Vertical, Mandatory and Voluntary Nutrients\n\n11.2 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declaration of Calories on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe type size has increased for ""Calories"" and the numeric value of ""Calories."" On the standard vertical display of the Nutrition Facts label, the numeric value of ""Calories"" must be listed in a type size no smaller than 22 point, as well as in bold or extra bold type highlighting (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). The word ""Calories"" must be listed in a type size no smaller than 16 point, as well as in bold or extra bold type highlighting (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 3 through 5.\n\n3 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declarations of Serving Size and Servings Per Container on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe "" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container"" declaration now immediately follows the ""Nutrition Facts"" heading and must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i)).\n\nBelow "" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container"" is the declaration of ""Serving size."" ""Serving size"" is to be highlighted in bold or extra bold and in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(ii)). While the ""Serving size"" declaration is still left-justified, the corresponding numerical value is now right-justified on Nutrition Facts labels only (not on Supplement Facts labels), provided that adequate space is available (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(ii)). If the ""Serving size"" declaration does not fit in the allocated space, then a type size no smaller than 8 point may be used on packages of any size.\n\nFor further information on the updates made to the Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed and Serving Size regulations, please reference the Small Entity Compliance Guide entitled ""Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments: Guidance for Industry"" (Ref. 9), as well as the final guidance entitled ""Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Size-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics"" (Ref. 10).\n\n4 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declaration of Vitamins and Minerals on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nNutrient information for vitamins and minerals (except sodium) are to be separated from information regarding other nutrients by a bar (21 CFR 101.9(d)(8)). They may be listed vertically (Figures 3 and 5) or horizontally (Figure 4). If listed horizontally in two columns, then vitamin D and calcium should be listed on the first line, and iron and potassium should be listed on the second line (21 CFR 101.9(d)(8)). Nutrient information must be in a type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)).\n\n11.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhile ""Calories from fat"" can no longer be declared, ""Calories from saturated fat"" is still allowed (21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(ii)). When declared, it is to be indented under the statement of calories and must be in a type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(5)).\n\n11.4 Where, and How, Do I Declare ""Added Sugars"" on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe statement ""Includes \'X\' g Added Sugars"" must be used to declare added sugars content (except on packages of single ingredient sugars), and this statement must be indented directly beneath the listing for ""Total Sugars"" on the Nutrition Facts label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The \'X\' will be filled in with the respective added sugar content (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). In Appendix B to 21 CFR 101, we illustrate our recommendation to shorten the length of the hairline requirement between total sugars and added sugars to help denote that ""added sugars"" are a subcomponent of ""total sugars."" As mentioned above, a DRV has been established for added sugars for most population groups, and the % Daily Value declaration is required as well (21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii)). Added sugars must also be declared on the Supplement Facts label (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAdded sugars content must be expressed to the nearest gram, except in the following circumstances:\n\nThe statement ""Contains less than 1 gram"" or, alternatively, ""less than 1 gram"" may be used if a serving contains less than 1 gram added sugars; or\n\nThe added sugars content may be expressed as zero if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram.\n\nSee 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels'

It specifically explains how FDA intends to consider exercising enforcement discretion when a conflict occurs between compliance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), section 101.9(c), and compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(g) such that compliance with both sections is not possible.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nFDA\'s regulations in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 describe requirements for nutrition labeling in conventional foods and dietary supplements, respectively. The requirements for declaring the nutrient value in a serving of conventional food are in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8). Certain dietary ingredients in dietary supplements are also required to be declared in accordance with these requirements (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)). These dietary ingredients are listed in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2) and are referred to as ""(b)(2)-dietary ingredients."" Unlike nutrients in conventional food, the (b)(2)-dietary ingredients can only be declared when they are present in dietary supplements in amounts that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling according to 21 CFR 101.9(c) (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nFDA\'s regulations under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and (5) describe compliance requirements for declaring nutrients and dietary ingredients2 in nutrition labeling. A conventional food or dietary supplement declaring the amount of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in its labeling is misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)] if:\n\nFootnote 2: See 21 CFR 101.36(f)(1).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber is below 80 percent of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).3 Footnote 3: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of calories, total sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).4 Footnote 4: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).\n\nFor the remainder of this document, we refer to 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) as ""the compliance requirements.""\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nIn many cases, the amount of a nutrient or (b)(2)-dietary ingredient declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) will not conflict with the compliance requirements. However, certain small amounts of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients cannot be declared in accordance with both 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) and the compliance requirements. In these cases, the amount declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) is below or above the level provided by the compliance requirements.\n\nExample 1 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(iv), monounsaturated fat content must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams. Therefore, if the analyzed value of monounsaturated fat is 0.75 to 1.00 grams, the amount of monounsaturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 1.00 gram (or 1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value is 0.80 gram or greater. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value of monounsaturatedfat is 0.75 to 0.79 gram because values in this range are not at least equal to 80 percent of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 1 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are below 80 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are greater than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable excesses of nutrients, such as monounsaturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nExample 2 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i), saturated fat must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams, unless the amount is less than 0.5 gram. Therefore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.50 to 0.74 gram, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 0.50 gram (0.5g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 0.50 to 0.60 gram. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.61 to 0.74 gram because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 0.50 gram.\n\nFurthermore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 1.00 to 1.24 grams, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i) is 1.00 gram (1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.20 grams or less. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.21 to 1.24 grams because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 2 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are above 20 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are less than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable deficiencies of nutrients, such as saturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nFor certain nutrients, such as total fat and its components (including monounsaturated fat and saturated fat), if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the amount must be expressed as zero in nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(c)). Unlike nutrients in conventional food, (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in dietary supplements must not be declared in nutrition labeling when the amount is zero (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nIV FDA\'s Policy\n\nAs discussed, when the analyzed value of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients present in small amounts is declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8), the declared amount may conflict with the compliance requirements. In such cases, we intend to consider the use of our enforcement discretion with respect to the compliance requirements and recommend that manufacturers declare nutrients and (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What is unique about the ingredient labeling of dietary supplements?\n--------------------\nContext: On May 27, 2016, we issued a final rule titled ""Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels"" (81 FR 33742) (""final rule""). In the final rule, we stated that we needed additional time to fully consider the information provided in the citizen petition and the comments we received to the proposed rule (81 FR 33742 at 33796). Therefore, we did not reach a decision as to whether allulose should be excluded from the declaration of ""Total Carbohydrate,"" ""Total Sugars,"" and/or ""Added Sugars."" We stated that allulose, as a monosaccharide, must be included in the amount of the declaration of ""Total Carbohydrate,"" ""Total Sugars,"" and ""Added Sugars"" pending any future rulemaking that would otherwise consider excluding allulose from the declaration.\n\nAfter we issued the final rule, we received two citizen petitions regarding allulose. One citizen petition, submitted by the Food Lawyers (Docket Number FDA-2016-P-2030) (Ref. 3), requested, among other things, that we amend 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(i) by adding the following:\n\n""(G) Using the following general factor for caloric value of Allulose (also known as D-Allulose, D-psicose): Allulose -- 0.4 calories per gram.""\n\nThe citizen petition included information to support the caloric value of 0.4 kcal/g for allulose.\n\nAnother citizen petition, submitted by Tate & Lyle (Docket Number FDA-2017-P-1463) (Ref. 4), requested, among other things, that we amend 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(i) to include the following in a new section (G):\n\n""(G) Using the following general factor for caloric value of Allulose (also known as, D-allulose, D-psicose): Allulose - 0.2 calories per gram.""\n\nThe petition included information to support the caloric value of 0.2 kcal/g for allulose.\n\nIn a comment to the Tate & Lyle citizen petition, the Food Lawyers stated that they fully supported a caloric value for allulose of 0.2 kcal/g.\n\nOn August 13, 2018, Tate & Lyle submitted the results from a clinical trial that assessed the impact of allulose on dental plaque pH. On August 22, 2018, Matsutani Chemical Industry Co. LTD submitted the results of a clinical trial that assessed the impact of allulose consumption on dental plaque pH as well as a copy of U.S. Patent No. 8,496,915, including an in vitro study that examined the final medium pH and the growth of a bacterial strain that causes dental caries when cultured with allulose.5 We considered these studies in our review of the scientific evidence related to the cariogenic potential of allulose (Ref. 8).\n\nFootnote 5: Both the Tate & Lyle and Matsutani Chemical Industry submissions were in support of the 2015 Tate & Lyle citizen petition. The submissions can be found in docket FDA-2015-P-1201.\n\nIn the Federal Register of April 18, 2019 (84 FR 16272), we announced the availability of a draft guidance titled ""The Declaration of Allulose and Calories from Allulose on Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels: Guidance for Industry,"" in which we announced our tentative views on the declaration of allulose on Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels and caloric content of allulose. The draft guidance also advised manufacturers of our intent to exercise enforcement discretion for the exclusion of allulose from the amount of ""Total Sugars"" and ""Added Sugars"" declared on the label, and for use of a general factor of 0.4 kcal/g for allulose when determining ""Calories"" on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels pending review of the issues in a rulemaking. We have considered comments to the draft guidance, and we have made modifications, where appropriate, that are reflected in this final guidance. We also conducted an independent review of the scientific evidence on the cariogenic potential, metabolism, and caloric value of, and glycemic response to, allulose (Ref. 8).\n\n3 Declaration of Allulose on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels\n\nFDA\'s Consideration of the Caloric Value of Allulose\n\nWe did not determine a specific caloric value for allulose in the final rule. Therefore, under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(B), a caloric value of 4 kcal/g must currently be used for allulose because it is a carbohydrate. The citizen petitions from the Food Lawyers (Ref. 3) and from Tate & Lyle (Ref. 4) identified two human studies on the metabolism of allulose. Our search of the literature did not reveal any additional human studies that determined a caloric value of allulose. We provide a summary of the studies in our memorandum to the file (Ref. 8).\n\nThe two citizen petitions (Refs. 4 and 3) provided data supporting the use of 0.2 kcal/g for allulose and 0.4 kcal/g for allulose.6 Based on our review of the evidence (Ref. 8), we conclude that the caloric contribution of allulose is very low (i.e., no more than 0.4 kcal/g) because the majority of allulose is excreted intact in the urine, and because allulose is poorly fermented in the gut. We have limited evidence from human studies, using different methodologies, upon which to determine the caloric value of allulose. Therefore, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion for the use of a caloric value of 0.4 kcal/g for allulose because, based on the range of data we have, such a caloric value would not underestimate the caloric contribution. We intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the use of a caloric value of 0.4 kcal/g when calculating declarations on Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels pending rulemaking to consider amending 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(i) regarding the use of a general factor for the caloric value of allulose.\n\n2 FDA\'s Consideration of Allulose as a Carbohydrate\n\nTotal Carbohydrate content is determined for the purposes of nutrition labeling by subtraction of the sum of the crude protein, total fat, moisture, and ash from the total weight of the food (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)). The calculation method is described in A.L. Merrill and B.K. Watt, ""Energy Value of Foods-Basis and Derivation"" (Ref. 2). ""Carbohydrate"" as a class captures a variety of substances ranging from mono and disaccharides to numerous types of non-digestible carbohydrates, some of which are dietary fibers. As previously mentioned, allulose is a monosaccharide. It has the chemical composition of a carbohydrate and is captured under the method for determination of Total Carbohydrate in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6).\n\nThe 2015 Tate & Lyle citizen petition (Ref. 1) suggested that allulose should not be included in the Total Carbohydrate definition because, in part, it does not raise blood glucose levels, and thus could be confusing for individuals who are interested in monitoring their blood glucose levels, such as diabetics. We have traditionally based our decision on labeling of carbohydrates on whether a substance is chemically a carbohydrate (79 FR 11880 at 11900). As we explained in the final rule, we had invited comment on and considered:\n\nwhether carbohydrates should be classified and declared in nutrition labeling based on their chemical definition (which is the current method) or on their physiological effect (e.g., attenuation of blood sugar or laxation), and whether additional types of carbohydrates (e.g., starch) should be listed separately on the Nutrition Facts label. We explained that carbohydrates include starch, sugars, sugar alcohols, and dietary fibers and that different carbohydrates have different physiological effects [79 FR 11879 at 11901]. Within the different types of carbohydrate (i.e., starch, sugars, sugar alcohols, and dietary fibers), too, specific carbohydrates may have different physiological effects (e.g., different types of dietary fibers) making it difficult to apply a definition that is based on physiological effects across a category of carbohydrates. Furthermore, analytical methods for measuring different types of carbohydrates are based on chemical structure rather than physiological effect. Given the various components of total carbohydrate and different types of physiological effects of each, we decided not to change our provisions for the classification or declaration of carbohydrates specified in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6).\n\n33742 at 33795.\n\nIn summary, we considered whether a physiological effect-based definition was appropriate for total carbohydrates and determined that it was not because of the wide variety of effects of different types of carbohydrates.\n\nFurthermore, as discussed in the final rule, the information in the Nutrition Facts label is not targeted to individuals with acute or chronic disease (e.g., diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or cardiovascular disease). The nutrient declaration and percent Daily Values on the label are to help consumers make more informed choices to consume a healthy diet and not intended for the clinical management of an existing disease (81 FR 33742 at 33750). Inclusion of allulose in the declaration of ""Total Carbohydrate"" on Nutrition and Supplement Facts label is also consistent with how we have considered the declaration of other substances that are captured under the method that is currently used for the determination of ""Total Carbohydrate"" on the label, including those that provide few or no calories, such as sugar alcohols and dietary fibers.\n\nTherefore, because allulose is a carbohydrate, it is captured under the calculation method for ""Total Carbohydrate"" described in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6), like a number of other substances without significant caloric contribution. We have determined that our existing definition of carbohydrate is the most appropriate and allulose must be included in the amount of ""Total Carbohydrate"" declared on the label under the existing regulations.\n\n3 FDA\'s Consideration of Allulose as a Sugar\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- The Declaration of Allulose and Calories from Allulose on Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels'

It is intended to help small businesses better understand the new over-the-counter (OTC) labeling requirements set forth in 21 CFR 201.66 and prepare new labeling. Additional information is available in the guidance for industry Labeling OTC Human Drug Products Questions and Answers.2\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nFootnote 2: We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the CDER guidance Web page at http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm.\n\nII Background\n\nIn the Federal Register of March 17, 1999 (64 FR 13254), the FDA published a final regulation (SS 201.66) establishing standardized content and format for the labeling of OTC drug products (Drug Facts labeling). The Drug Facts labeling for OTC drug products is intended to make it easier for consumers to read and understand OTC drug product labeling and use OTC drug products safely and effectively.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\n(c)(1) Title6 (Drug Facts or Drug Facts (continued))\n\n(c)(2) Active ingredient(s)\n\n(c)(3) Purpose(s)\n\n(c)(4) Use(s)\n\n(c)(5) Warning(s)\n\n(c)(6) Directions\n\n(c)(7) Other information\n\n(c)(8) Inactive ingredients\n\n(c)(9) Questions? or Questions or comments? (optional)\n\nThis information must appear on the outside container or wrapper of the retail package, or on the immediate container label if there is no outside container or wrapper.\n\nDrug product trade names and company names cannot appear within the Drug Facts box or similar enclosure (SS 201.66(d)(7)).\n\nThe following specific information for each heading must appear in the Drug Facts section.\n\nAppendix A Title (SS 201.66(c)(1))\n\nIf the Drug Facts labeling appears on more than one panel or side of the labeling, the title Drug Facts (continued)7 must appear at the top of each subsequent panel containing such information. See also the guidance for industry Labeling OTC Human Drug Products Using a Column Format for guidance on the title when a column format is used in the drug product\'s labeling.\n\nFootnote 7: The term Title refers to the heading listed at the top of the required OTC drug product labeling, as set forth in § 201.66(c)(1).\n\nFootnote 7: The word (continued) appears in regular type.\n\nAppendix B Active ingredient(s) (SS 201.66(c)(2))\n\nAn active ingredient is any component that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body. The term includes those components that may undergo chemical change in the manufacture of the drug product and be present in the drug product in a modified form intended to furnish the specified activity or effect (SS 201.66(b)(2)).\n\nDepending on the type of drug product (oral or topical), the active ingredients can be stated in one of two ways. As the amount ""in each"":\n\n[for oral dosage forms] use the dosage unit stated in the directions for use (e.g., tablet, 5 mL teaspoonful) or Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n[for topical dosage forms marketed with discrete dosage units] use gram, as stated in SSSS 333.110 and 333.120, where the first aid antibiotic active ingredients are stated as an amount in each gram of the drug product\n\nDrug products marketed without discrete dosage units (e.g., topicals) must state the proportion (rather than the quantity) of each active ingredient (e.g., 1%), unless otherwise provided in an applicable OTC drug monograph or approved drug application. For example, the OTC anticaries final monograph (21 CFR part 355) lists fluoride active ingredients as a percent fluoride with an available fluoride ion concentration of a certain number of parts per million (ppm). Because the concentration expressed in ppm may be confusing to consumers, the available ion concentration must be expressed on the label in fluoride ion percent (i.e., ppm converted to a percent weight to volume notation of available fluoride ion). These anticaries products must list under this heading the ingredient percent, followed by fluoride ion concentration in percent notation (e.g., Sodium fluoride 0.24% (0.14% W/V fluoride ion)).\n\nFor OTC drug products that contain both drug and cosmetic ingredients, the drug ingredients are considered the active ingredients, and the cosmetic ingredients are considered the inactive ingredients. (See SSSS 201.66(b)(2) and 201.66(b)(8).)\n\nPurpose(s) (SS 201.66(c)(3))\n\nEach active ingredient in the drug product is to be followed by a description of the ingredient\'s purpose, unless this information is specifically exempted in an OTC drug monograph. The statement of identity that appears in an applicable OTC drug monograph shall be stated as the purpose of the active ingredient. If there is no statement of identity or no applicable OTC drug monograph, then we recommend that one of the following factors be used in stating the ingredient\'s purpose:\n\nIts general pharmacological category(ies)\n\nThe principal intended action(s) of the drug\n\nIf two active ingredients in a drug product have the same purpose (e.g., two sunscreen or skin protectant ingredients are present in the drug product), then the purpose can be stated only once as long as the purpose is clearly associated with both active ingredients. (See the example in section VI., Format Labeling Requirements.)\n\nUse(s) (SS 201.66(c)(4))\n\nThe uses are the specific indications or approved uses for the drug product. For drug-cosmetic products, only the drug-related indications can be included in the Use(s) section.\n\nWarning(s) (SS 201.66(c)(5))\n\nWith regard to subject-specific warnings described in SSSS 201.66(c)(5)(ii)(A) through (5)(ii)(G), except for the Reye\'s syndrome warning, which must appear first when required, there is no required order in which these specific warning statements must appear. We suggest that manufacturers list the specific warning statements in the order of importance or impact.\n\nWhen applicable, the following information must appear under the respective subheadings in the Warnings section.\n\n1. Do not use (SS 201.66(c)(5)(iii))\n\nInformation appearing under this subheading includes situations in which consumers should not use the drug product unless a prior diagnosis has been established by a doctor, or for situations in which consumers should not use the drug product under any circumstances regardless of whether a doctor or health care professional is consulted.\n\nIn some instances, manufacturers need to convert existing warnings to the new Drug Facts labeling format (see SS 201.66(a)). For example, the current warning ""Do not use this product on irritated skin, on any area that is infected or reddened, if you are a diabetic, or if you have poor blood circulation"" would be formatted to appear after the Do not use subleading as follows:\n\non irritated skin\n\non any area that is infected or reddened\n\nif you are a diabetic\n\nif you have poor blood circulation\n\n2. Ask a doctor before use if you have (SS 201.66(c)(5)(iv))\n\nInformation under this subheading includes all warnings for persons with certain preexisting conditions (excluding pregnancy) and all warnings for persons experiencing certain symptoms. The warnings under this subheading are intended only for situations when consumers should not use the drug product until a doctor is consulted. Examples of such situations include: 1) high blood pressure, heart disease, thyroid disease, glaucoma, diabetes, and other conditions listed in various OTC drug monographs or approved drug applications; and 2) certain types of cough (i.e., persistent or chronic cough such as occurs with smoking, asthma, or emphysema, or if cough is accompanied by excessive phlegm). For example, in the new Drug Facts labeling format, these warnings would appear as follows:\n\nAsk a doctor before use if you have\n\nheart disease\n\ncough that occurs with too much phlegm (mucus)\n\nchronic cough that lasts as occurs with smoking, asthma, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema\n\n3 Ask a doctor or pharmacist before use if you are (SS 201.66(c)(5)(v))\n\nInformation under this subheading includes all drug-drug and drug-food interaction warnings. Examples include: sedatives or tranquilizers with antihistamines and a prescription drug for asthma with an OTC bronchodilator.\n\n4 When using this product (SS 201.66(c)(5)(vi))\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling OTC Human Drug Products; Small Entity Compliance Guide Guidance for Industry']","['Ingredients that are sources of dietary ingredients may be listed within the ""Supplement Facts"" panel, e.g., ""Calcium (as calcium carbonate).""

58,"When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?","['--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA intends to monitor the drug distribution system for abuses or exploitation of this exercise of enforcement discretion.\n\nWe note that pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(9), returns by hospitals, health care entities, and charitable institutions are excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution, provided that the returns comply with 21 CFR SS 203.23.\n\nF. Shipping/Delivery Arrangements\n\n27. Is a pedigree required if a manufacturer drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer (i.e., ships the product directly to the non-ADR\'s customer)?Yes. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50, the non-ADR seller must provide a pedigree to the purchaser.\n\nIs a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n\nYes. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50, the non-ADR seller must provide a pedigree to the purchaser.\n\nWhat is the status of third party logistics providers (TPLP or 3PLs) in the context of PDMA? For example, is a TPLP considered to be a distributor or contractor for the manufacturer for whom the TPLP works?\n\nBased on comments that FDA received from a TPLP, TPLPs typically act as distributors for manufacturers. Therefore, unless the TPLP has ADR status with the manufacturer (which should be posted on the manufacturer\'s website and reflected in a written contract), the TPLP would be required to provide a pedigree prior to each wholesale distribution. Because of the unique ongoing relationship between a TPLP and a manufacturer, most, if not all, TPLPs distributing prescription drugs on behalf of a manufacturer would be able to obtain ADR status from the manufacturer with which they are doing business. Therefore, the TPLP would be listed on any subsequent pedigree because the TPLP was involved in the prior sale, purchase, or trade of the prescription drug. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\n3 Inventory\n\nIs a pedigree required for products already in the supply chain as of December 1, 2006?\n\nIt depends. A pedigree would be required for prescription drug products that are sold, purchased, or traded by a non-ADR after December 1, 2006. In order to give wholesalers sufficient time to prepare and deplete stock that would require a pedigree after December 1, FDA provided 6 months\' notice that the stay would expire on December 1, 2006. However, FDA recognizes that there may be some situations where a wholesaler has prescription drugs in stock that were purchased while the wholesaler considered itself an ADR, yet the wholesaler clearly will not be an ADR for those drugs under 21 C.F.R. SS 202.3(u) after December 1, 2006. FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion until April 1, 2007 regarding the pedigree requirement for such drugs, provided that the wholesaler can furnish documentation that the drugs were purchased prior to December 1, 2006, and that it had purchased the same type of drugs from the manufacturer on at least two prior occasions in the previous 24 months. Bills of sale or invoices could be used for this documentation. Wholesalers that cannot meet this criteria with respect to their inventories will be expected to provide a pedigree for those drugs. FDA believes that the combination of the six month notice that the stay would expire, along with additional four months of enforcement discretion, as described above,provides the wholesalers described above with sufficient time to deplete their pre-December 1, 2006 inventories.\n\n31. If there are two products on a shelf in a pharmacy, with the same lot number, but one was purchased from an ADR and the other was not, how would the pharmacy know which product came from the ADR and which product came from the non-ADR?\n\nInventory control is a business process. FDA expects firms to be able to identify and differentiate drug products that have been obtained from different sources and maintain appropriate records in compliance with PDMA.\n\n32. Is a pedigree required for inventory acquired through a pharmacy acquisition, merger, or buyout?\n\nNo. The purchase of a pharmacy by another pharmacy would not be considered a wholesale distribution, provided that the drugs purchased by the second pharmacy are dispensed or distributed by that pharmacy in the normal practice of retail pharmacy. Therefore, no pedigree would be required. However, the sale, purchase, or trade of those drugs to another pharmacy or wholesale distributor would be considered a wholesale distribution and a pedigree must be provided if that other pharmacy or distributor is not an ADR. If pedigrees are part of the record for the inventory, they must be provided with the sale, purchase, or trade of the product and retained for the appropriate length of time, as required under 21 CFR SSSS203.50(b) and 203.60(d).\n\nH. Pedigrees\n\n33. What does ""date of each previous transaction"" refer to in 21 C.F.R.\n\nSS 203.50(a)(7)?\n\n""Date of each previous transaction"" refers to the date of each prior sale, purchase, or trade of the product. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nI. Electronic Pedigrees\n\n34. Will electronic pedigrees that conform to the EPCglobal electronic drug pedigree standards be considered PDMA-compliant? At the time of printing, these standards have not been officially adopted or recognized. Therefore, it is premature for FDA to comment on whether they comply with PDMA requirements.\n\n35. Can paper or electronic pedigrees be used?\n\nSection 203.60(a)(2) states that ""combinations of paper records and electronic records, electronic records and handwritten signatures executed on paper, or paper records and electronic signatures or handwritten signatures executed to electronic records, may be used to meet any of the record and signature requirements of the PDMA."" Both paper and electronic documents and signatures may be used to meet the pedigree requirement of the Act, provided that the requirements of 21 CFR SS 203.60 are met.\n\nIs RFID the only way to achieve an electronic pedigree?\n\nNo. The PDMA and existing regulations do not require any particular technology for pedigrees. Although FDA has stated on several occasions that RFID is the most promising means to achieve an electronic pedigree, electronic pedigree can also be accomplished using bar codes or other track and trace technologies.\n\nCompliance/Enforcement\n\nWhere should a report be sent if there are concerns regarding a pedigree that has been received?\n\nCriminal activity, possible fraud, diversion, counterfeiting, or any other suspicious activity associated with a pedigree should be reported to FDA\'s Office of Criminal Investigations at rxdrugcops@oci.fda.gov.\n\nWhat are some examples of issues that might raise questions about the pedigree?\n\nDrugs that are sold below market price\n\nUnexplained gaps in the pedigree\n\nUnexplained differences in ordered product vs. shipped product\n\nUnexplained, unexpected, or unusual changes in supplier chain\n\nUnusual variety of lot numbers relative to the size of the shipment\n\nMultiple, unknown wholesalers from various states listed on the pedigree\n\nIncomplete paperwork, invoices, or other materials that do not match pedigree\n\nPattern of discrepancies in ordered vs. shipped product\n\nDiscrepancies in or missing covert/overt anti-counterfeiting measures\n\nSupplier refuses to provide a wholesale license from the state licensing authority\n\nSupplier wants payment in cash only\n\nA non ADR refuses to provide pedigree documentation\n\nSupplier refuses to divulge source of the prescription drug\n\nIf a company says that it is an ADR and not required to provide a pedigree, yet the purchaser has reason to believe that the company is not an ADR, what should the purchaser do?\n\nIf a purchaser has reason to believe that the wholesaler is not an ADR, FDA recommends that the purchaser contact the manufacturer to determine whether the entity is an ADR for that product. This is an especially important action to take in those instances where unsolicited offers are received from unfamiliar companies that meet some of the above mentioned causes for concern. In addition, report any concerns as suggested in Question 38.\n\n40 Does the PDMA Compliance Policy Guide 160.900 apply to pharmacies and chain pharmacy warehouses?\n\nYes. CPG 160.900 relates to the PDMA pedigree requirements. Retail pharmacies and chain pharmacy warehouses are included in the definition of wholesale distributors at 21 CFR SS 203.3(dd) and are required to comply with the PDMA. Please see Addendum at:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cder/regulatory/PDMA/PDMA_addendum.pdf\n\n**ADDENDUM to FDA\'s Guidance for Industry: PDMA Pedigree Requirements - Questions and Answers Related to the Preliminary Injunction ordered 12/5/06 in RXUSA Wholesalers, Inc. v. HHS 12.15.06\n\nA What is affected by the preliminary injunction?\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(a). The court order enjoins FDA from implementing 21 CFR SS 203.50(a). 21 CFR SS 203.50(a)(6), states that information regarding ""each prior transaction involving the drug, starting with the manufacture"" be included in the pedigree. However, while the preliminary injunction is in effect, pedigrees shall include information regarding prior transactions going back to the manufacturer or the last ADR that sold, purchased, or traded the prescription drugs. FDA encourages wholesalers to include information regarding each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer when that information is available.\n--------------------\nContext title: Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) Requirements- Questions and Answers'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: Does a chain pharmacy warehouse have to provide a pedigree for drugs that it sends to its retail outlets?\n\nNo. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.33(cc)(1), intra-company sales are excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution. FDA considers intra-company transfers, such as those from a chain pharmacy warehouse to its own retail outlets, to fall within the scope of an intra-company sale.\n\nDo pharmacies have to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the pedigree? If so, how should they do this?\n\nNo. Pharmacies do not have this express responsibility under the PDMA, but they are encouraged to perform due diligence in verifying the accuracy of the information and integrity of the source of the drug product.\n\nC Recordkeeping Requirements\n\nWhat are the recordkeeping requirements for pedigree recipients?\n\nPursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(b), the pedigree is subject to the record retention requirements in 21 CFR SS 203.60, and must be retained by all wholesale distributors involved in the distribution of the drug product, whether ADR or non-ADR, for 3 years.\n\nIf the pharmacy receiving the pedigree will not itself engage in further distribution of the product to persons other than a consumer or patient, then the pharmacy is not required to maintain that pedigree under 21 CFR SS 203.60. However, consistent with the spirit of the PDMA, FDA encourages pharmacies and other end users to retain the pedigree for 3 years. As a result, if there is any question about the source or history of the product, it can be traced back through the drug supply chain.\n\nIf an ADR obtains drugs from a non-ADR, is the ADR required to maintain the pedigree?\n\nYes. Although an ADR is not required to provide a pedigree, pursuant to 21 CFR SSS 203.50(b), and 203.60(d), an ADR is required to retain the pedigree for 3 years.\n\nPDMA Scope\n\nDoes PDMA apply to veterinary prescription drugs?\n\nNo. PDMA applies only to prescription drugs intended for use by man. However, FDA is aware that many human prescription drugs are sold to veterinarians. Given that the human drugs are subject to section 503(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,the pedigree requirements apply to them under section 503(e). Accordingly, wholesale distributors who are not ADRs must provide a pedigree prior to wholesale distribution of human prescription drugs to veterinarians.\n\nIs a pedigree required for the distribution of drug samples?\n\nNo. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(7), the distribution of drug samples by manufacturers and authorized distributor\'s representatives is exempt from the definition of wholesale distribution, so the pedigree requirement does not apply. However, those distributing drug samples must comply with the separate requirements set forth in 21 USC SSS 353(c) and (d) and 21 CFR Part 203..\n\nIs a pedigree required for medical kits that contain prescription drugs, sometimes referred to as convenience kits?\n\nYes. ""Medical kits"" that contain devices and prescription drugs are combination products under 21 CFR SS3.2(e)(2), which are defined as ""two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of a drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products."" The ""medical kits"" referred to in the question consist of separable finished devices and drugs that are combined in a kit for ready availability and use together in a medical setting. The drug product in the kit retains its separate form and individual packaging. Although these kits may be assigned to FDA\'s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) as the lead Center for regulatory review when the primary mode of action of the kit is attributable to its device component, regulations for the drug and the device components continue to apply. Because a prescription drug component of a convenience kit is separable, and in the same form as when distributed independently, it is subject to the same pedigree requirements as when it is independently distributed. The pedigree must contain the drug\'s lot or control number(s), pursuant to 21 CFR SS203.50(a). We recognize that the convenience kit itself may have a lot or control number that is different than that on the prescription drug component. The outer container of the kit should also list the lot or control number of the prescription drug component so that the integrity of the kit\'s seal would not have to be compromised to confirm that the drug\'s lot number is the same as that listed in the pedigree. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nDoes PDMA apply to bulk drug substances?\n\nYes. The PDMA applies to drugs subject to SS 503(b) of the Act (i.e., prescription drugs). Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.1, the requirements in 21 CFR Part 203 apply to wholesale distribution of bulk drug substances.\n\nReturns\n\nIs a pedigree required for prescription drugs that are returned from a pharmacy or a physician\'s office to a wholesaler?Pursuant to the definition of wholesale distribution and other relevant provisions under SS 503(e) of the Act and 21 CFR Part 203, a pedigree is required for returns from a pharmacy or physician\'s office to a wholesaler unless that pharmacy or physician\'s office is an ADR for those prescription drugs. Prescription drugs generally are returned for two reasons: (1) the pharmacy or physician\'s office ordered too much and returns the drug to the wholesaler or manufacturer from whom they purchased the drugs, or (2) the drug is expired or close to expiring, in which case the product is returned to the wholesaler or manufacturer from which it was purchased, or to a reverse distributor for destruction. Pharmacies and physicians\' offices generally are not ADRs, and they would find it extremely difficult to provide a pedigree when they return prescription drugs because they would not have received a pedigree if the drugs were purchased from an ADR.\n\nFDA recognizes the disruption that this could cause to the more than 55,000 pharmacies and the hundreds of thousand physicians\' offices in the United States. Therefore, FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion to allow pharmacies and physicians\' offices to return drugs that are expired, damaged, recalled, or in some other non-saleable condition, without having to provide a pedigree, provided that (1) they return the drugs to the wholesaler or manufacturer from which they purchased the drugs, or to a licensed reverse distributor for destruction, and (2) they maintain for a period of three years records that document each return and the source from which the pharmacy or physician\'s office originally purchased the drugs. If the returned prescription drugs are in saleable condition and may subsequently be sold, purchased, or traded by the wholesaler or reverse distributor, then that wholesaler or reverse distributor would be required and expected to pass a pedigree if they are not an ADR for those prescription drugs. Any subsequent pedigree should reflect that the drugs were sold, purchased, or traded to the pharmacy or physician\'s office and subsequently returned. Because the wholesaler to which the drugs are returned originally sold them to the pharmacy or physician\'s office, the wholesaler would have all the necessary information to provide a pedigree, even without the pedigree from the pharmacy or physician\'s office.\n\nFDA intends to monitor the drug distribution system for abuses or exploitation of this exercise of enforcement discretion.\n\nWe note that pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(9), returns by hospitals, health care entities, and charitable institutions are excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution, provided that the returns comply with 21 CFR SS 203.23.\n\nF. Shipping/Delivery Arrangements\n\n27. Is a pedigree required if a manufacturer drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer (i.e., ships the product directly to the non-ADR\'s customer)?Yes. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50, the non-ADR seller must provide a pedigree to the purchaser.\n\nIs a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n\nYes. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50, the non-ADR seller must provide a pedigree to the purchaser.\n\nWhat is the status of third party logistics providers (TPLP or 3PLs) in the context of PDMA? For example, is a TPLP considered to be a distributor or contractor for the manufacturer for whom the TPLP works?\n\nBased on comments that FDA received from a TPLP, TPLPs typically act as distributors for manufacturers. Therefore, unless the TPLP has ADR status with the manufacturer (which should be posted on the manufacturer\'s website and reflected in a written contract), the TPLP would be required to provide a pedigree prior to each wholesale distribution. Because of the unique ongoing relationship between a TPLP and a manufacturer, most, if not all, TPLPs distributing prescription drugs on behalf of a manufacturer would be able to obtain ADR status from the manufacturer with which they are doing business. Therefore, the TPLP would be listed on any subsequent pedigree because the TPLP was involved in the prior sale, purchase, or trade of the prescription drug. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\n3 Inventory\n\nIs a pedigree required for products already in the supply chain as of December 1, 2006?\n--------------------\nContext title: Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) Requirements- Questions and Answers'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: Supplier refuses to divulge source of the prescription drug\n\nIf a company says that it is an ADR and not required to provide a pedigree, yet the purchaser has reason to believe that the company is not an ADR, what should the purchaser do?\n\nIf a purchaser has reason to believe that the wholesaler is not an ADR, FDA recommends that the purchaser contact the manufacturer to determine whether the entity is an ADR for that product. This is an especially important action to take in those instances where unsolicited offers are received from unfamiliar companies that meet some of the above mentioned causes for concern. In addition, report any concerns as suggested in Question 38.\n\n40 Does the PDMA Compliance Policy Guide 160.900 apply to pharmacies and chain pharmacy warehouses?\n\nYes. CPG 160.900 relates to the PDMA pedigree requirements. Retail pharmacies and chain pharmacy warehouses are included in the definition of wholesale distributors at 21 CFR SS 203.3(dd) and are required to comply with the PDMA. Please see Addendum at:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cder/regulatory/PDMA/PDMA_addendum.pdf\n\n**ADDENDUM to FDA\'s Guidance for Industry: PDMA Pedigree Requirements - Questions and Answers Related to the Preliminary Injunction ordered 12/5/06 in RXUSA Wholesalers, Inc. v. HHS 12.15.06\n\nA What is affected by the preliminary injunction?\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(a). The court order enjoins FDA from implementing 21 CFR SS 203.50(a). 21 CFR SS 203.50(a)(6), states that information regarding ""each prior transaction involving the drug, starting with the manufacture"" be included in the pedigree. However, while the preliminary injunction is in effect, pedigrees shall include information regarding prior transactions going back to the manufacturer or the last ADR that sold, purchased, or traded the prescription drugs. FDA encourages wholesalers to include information regarding each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer when that information is available.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(a)(1)-(5). The court order also enjoins FDA from implementing the language in 21 CFR SS 203.50 that requires pedigrees to include lot and control numbers, dosage, container size, and number of containers. As described in more detail below, however, the preliminary injunction does not affect the statutory requirement that pedigrees contain the dates of all listed transactions and the names and addresses of all parties involved in those transactions. In addition, since the court did not enjoin implementation of 21 CFR SS 203.3(u), a written agreement between a manufacturer and a wholesaler may limit ADR status to a particular lot number(s), dosage, or the number or size of the containers of prescription drugs. We also note that, without the lot number on the pedigree, it would be extremely difficult to track the inventory that matches the pedigree if the inventory is further sold, purchased or traded. Therefore, FDA recommends that the lot or control number, dosage, and the number and size of the prescription drug containers be included on the pedigree even though it is not required while the preliminary injunction is in effect.\n\nPedigrees for all current and future inventory are affected by the preliminary injunction as long is it remains in effect.\n\nB What is not affected by the preliminary injunction?\n\nPedigrees still must be passed by non-authorized distributors of record (non-ADR) prior to each wholesale distribution. In addition, the court does not mention other pedigree-related regulations or other agency-issued documents relating to the pedigree requirement. Accordingly, those regulations and documents, some of which are described below, are not affected by the preliminary injunction.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.3(u). This regulation, which went into effect on December 1, 2006, defines ""ongoing relationship"" for the purposes of determining who qualifies as an authorized distributor of record (ADR.) As of December 1, 2006, only thosewholesale distributors who have an ongoing relationship (including a written agreement) with the manufacturer, as that term is defined by this regulation, are exempt from the pedigree requirement.\n\nCompliance Policy Guide (CPG) 160.900, which issued in November 2006, remains in effect until December 1, 2007. The CPG describes how FDA intends to prioritize its enforcement efforts regarding the pedigree requirements in the first year after the effective date of 21 CFR SSS 203.3(u) and 203.50. However, FDA will not enforce 203.50(a) as long as the preliminary injunction remains in effect.\n\nAll other definitions in 21 CFR Part 203 that relate to the pedigree requirement, including but not limited to, the definitions of manufacturer and wholesale distribution, have been in effect since December 2000 and remain in effect despite the injunction.\n\nThe names and addresses of all parties to the transaction and the date of the transactions are required by the statute and must be included in the pedigree.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(b). This regulation, which went into effect on December 1, 2006, requires all wholesale distributors (both ADRs and non-ADRs) involved in the distribution of a prescription drug to retain a copy of the pedigree for three years. Accordingly, all wholesale distributors that provide or receive pedigrees after December 1, 2006, must retain copies of the pedigrees for three years.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(c). This regulation, which also went into effect on December 1, 2006, provides that a manufacturer that subjects a drug to additional manufacturing processes is not required to provide a pedigree identifying previous sales of the drug or its components.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(d). This regulation also went into effect on December 1, 2006, and requires manufacturers to maintain a current written list of all ADRs, to specify whether each ADR is authorized to distribute all of the manufacturer\'s drug products or only particular products, to update its list of ADRs on a continuing basis, and to make its list of ADRs available for public inspection or copying. Accordingly, as of December 1, 2006, all manufacturers should have available for public inspection a current list of ADRs that indicates which drug products the ADR is authorized to distribute.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.60. This regulation sets forth certain requirements with respect to the use of electronic records and signatures, record retention, and the availability of records for review and reproduction by FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory and law enforcement officials. This regulation has been in effect since December 2000 and remains in effect despite the injunction.\n\nC Since the court\'s order only applies to 21 CFR SS 203.50(a), does this mean that the statutory requirement that non-ADRs provide pedigrees that include ""each prior sale, purchase, or trade"" of the drugs is still in effect?\n\nYes. The court order does not enjoin FDA from enforcing the statute. The court order affects only the regulations at 21 CFR SS 203.50(a). It has been FDA\'s longstanding position, consistent with the language of the PDMA and its legislative history, that, 21 CFR SS 203.50 notwithstanding, the statute itself requires non-ADRs to provide pedigrees that documents each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer. FDA recognizes, however, that confusion regarding the pedigree requirement could cause disruptions or delays in the nation\'s drug distribution system. Accordingly, as long as the court order remains in effect, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, as described below. To this end, FDA does not intend to enforce the statute insofar as it requires pedigrees to contain information regarding each transaction going back to the manufacturer. Rather, FDA intends to permit non-ADRs to provide pedigrees that include information regarding transactions going back to the manufacturer or the last ADR that handled the prescription drugs. FDA, however, encourages all wholesalers to provide complete pedigrees documenting each prior transaction involving the prescription drug when that information is available.\n\nAppendix D How will FDA apply the court\'s order outside of the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) and to wholesale distributors that are not plaintiffs in the lawsuit?\n\nFDA believes that limiting application of the preliminary injunction to either the named plaintiffs or the EDNY could lead to confusion and possible disruptions or delays in the nation\'s drug distribution system and could provide undue advantage to certain wholesale distributors. Accordingly, to the extent that it could be argued that the injunction should be limited in scope, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion in a manner that is consistent with the court\'s opinion. To this end, as long as the court\'s order is in effect, FDA does not intend to initiate any enforcement actions against any wholesalers solely for (1) failing to include lot numbers, dosage, container size, or number of containers on a pedigree; or (2) failing to provide a pedigree that goes back to the manufacturer so long as the pedigree otherwise identifies the last authorized distributor of record that handled the drugs.\n\nAppendix E How does the court\'s order impact what FDA said in the Guidance to Industry: PDMA Pedigree Requirements - Questions and Answers (http://www.fda.gov/cder/regulatory/PDMA/PDMA_qa.pdf)?\n\nTo the extent that Questions 2, 9, 10, 11, 14, 24, 29, and 33 refer to 21 CFR SS 203.50(a), as long as the preliminary injunction is in effect, such references are limited to the scope of the court\'s order. For example, if the question states that a pedigree include information about each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer, then the answer would be limited to including information going back to the manufacturer or the last ADR that handled the drugs.\n--------------------\nContext title: Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) Requirements- Questions and Answers'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: Is placing the list of ADRs on the manufacturer\'s web site adequate to meet the provision of making the list available on request to the public, pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(d)?\n\nYes. We highly encourage manufacturers to post their ADR list on their website in a place and manner that is readily accessible, although they are not required to do so. We note that 21 CFR SS 203.50(d) requires the list to be maintained at the manufacturer\'s corporate offices even when the list is posted on a website.\n\n8 Where can a pharmacist find the list of ADRs?\n\nPursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(d)(3), manufacturers are required to make their list of ADRs available to the public upon request. However, we recognize that it may be time consuming to get this information from manufacturers\' corporate offices. Therefore, we highly encourage manufacturers to post it on their website in a place and manner that is readily accessible. FDA will monitor the accessibility of these lists and determine whether further measures are needed to make this information more readily available to pharmacies.\n\nWhat information does a manufacturer have to provide to a wholesaler to enable that wholesaler to comply with the PDMA?\n\nManufacturers are not required under the PDMA to provide any specific information to wholesale customers. However, the information required under 21 CFR SS 203.50(a) for a pedigree statement may be included in the invoice or similar document that would typically accompany or be associated with any shipment of prescription drug products from a manufacturer to a wholesale distributor. FDA encourages manufacturers to do their part to protect public health by furnishing pedigree information to all of their supply chain partners. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nWhat information does an ADR have to provide to a non-ADR to enable that non-ADR to comply with the PDMA (e.g., to pass a pedigree that lists all prior transactions back to the manufacturer)?\n\nADRs are not required to provide a pedigree, whether they obtained the drug directly from a manufacturer, from an ADR, or from a non-ADR. However, to further advance the shared goals of protecting the public health, FDA encourages all parties in the prescription drug supply chain to cooperate fully by providing pedigrees and information to trading partners for each sale, transfer, or trade of prescription drugs. Therefore, when an ADR sells prescription drugs to another ADR or to a non-ADR, the ADR is encouraged to provide pedigree information obtained at the time of the original purchase of the prescription drugs to its wholesale customers. Each wholesale customer of that ADR, in turn, could then provide updated pedigree information with each successive wholesale distribution. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nIf a wholesaler has ADR status for a particular drug product, but it buys that drug from a non-ADR, is the wholesaler still an ADR for that specific quantity of drugs?\n\nYes. If the specific quantity of drugs purchased from the non-ADR falls within the description contained in the written agreement between that purchasing ADR and the manufacturer, then that purchasing wholesaler would have ADR status for that specific quantity of drugs. However, even though the ADR is not required to provide the pedigree when the product is further distributed, to further advance the shared goals of protecting the public health, FDA encourages all parties in the prescription drug supply chain to cooperate fully by providing pedigree documents and information to trading partners for each sale, transfer, or trade of prescription drugs. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nWhat definition is used to determine who is a manufacturer and, thus, exempt from providing a pedigree?\n\nFor purposes of the PDMA, ""manufacturer"" is defined under 21 CFR SS 203.3(s), which incorporates the definition from 21 CFR SS 201.1.\n\n13 Are contract manufacturers considered ""manufacturers"" under the PDMA?\n\nYes. A contract manufacturer falls within the definition of a ""manufacturer"" under 21 CFR SS 203.3(s), which incorporates by reference the definition of ""manufacturer"" set forth in 21 CFR SS 201.1. FDA has received several inquiries regarding the status of an NDA-holder under 21 CFR SSS 203.3(s)/201.1 when that NDA-holder\'s prescription drugs are made by a contract manufacturer. Unless the NDA-holder has performed the operations necessary to achieve ""manufacturer"" status under 21 CFR SS 201.1, that NDAholder is not technically a ""manufacturer"" of the drugs within the meaning of the 21 CFR SS 203.3(s). In such instances, the NDA-holder would therefore not be exempt from the pedigree requirements on the grounds that it was a manufacturer. Thus, for purposes of the PDMA pedigree requirements only, FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion as follows: In those instances where a third party contract manufacturer manufacturers prescription drugs for an NDA-holder, that NDA-holder may also be regarded as a manufacturer of those drugs for purposes of that NDA-holder\'s compliance with SS 503(e)(1)(A) of the Act, entering into ADR agreements for those prescription drugs, and for purposes of pedigrees created for those prescription drugs. This exercise of enforcement discretion is not intended to relieve the contract manufacturer of its obligations as a manufacturer, including its obligation to register under SS 510 of the Act, nor is it intended to require the NDA-holder to file such a registration unless the NDA-holder would otherwise be obligated to do so.\n\n14 Is a repackager or relabeler exempt from providing a pedigree?\n\nNo. Relabelers and repackagers are not considered to be manufacturers under 21 CFR SS 201.1. Therefore, unless a repackager or relabeler has ADR status with the manufacturer of that product, they are required to provide a pedigree identifying each prior sale, purchase, or trade of the drug. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\n15 Is a pedigree required if an exclusive distribution agreement exists?\n\nNo, so long as the agreement is in writing. By definition, an exclusivity agreement is a written agreement under which the distributor is authorized to distribute the manufacturer\'s products for a period or time or for a specified volume of products.\n\nAccordingly, such a written agreement would satisfy the requirements related to ADR status in 21 C.F.R. 203.3(u). Please note that, in such instances, the wholesale distributor named in the agreement would have to be included in the manufacturer\'s list of ADRs under 21 CFR SS 203.50(d).\n\n16 Do non-ADRs have to provide a pedigree if the customer is a physician\'s office?\n\nYes. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) requires non-ADRs to provide a pedigree before each wholesale distribution of a drug. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc), wholesale distribution is defined as the distribution of prescription drugs to persons other than a consumer or patient. Although a physician\'s office is not explicitly mentioned in 21 CFR SS 203.50, which discusses pedigree, it is contemplated within the scope of the language set forth in SS 503(e)(1)(A) of the Act that a pedigree would be provided because physicians offices are not specifically excluded.\n\n17 Are pharmacies required to provide a pedigree when they transfer drug product between pharmacies?For transfers other than intra-company transfers, unless the transfer of prescription drug product from one pharmacy to another is for a documented medical emergency (see 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(5)), or the sale is of minimal quantities of drugs by retail pharmacies to licensed practitioners for office use (see 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(10)), retail pharmacies that are not ADRs for the prescription drug products sold or transferred to other retail pharmacies will have to provide a pedigree.\n\nDoes a chain pharmacy warehouse have to provide a pedigree for drugs that it sends to its retail outlets?\n\nNo. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.33(cc)(1), intra-company sales are excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution. FDA considers intra-company transfers, such as those from a chain pharmacy warehouse to its own retail outlets, to fall within the scope of an intra-company sale.\n\nDo pharmacies have to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the pedigree? If so, how should they do this?\n\nNo. Pharmacies do not have this express responsibility under the PDMA, but they are encouraged to perform due diligence in verifying the accuracy of the information and integrity of the source of the drug product.\n\nC Recordkeeping Requirements\n\nWhat are the recordkeeping requirements for pedigree recipients?\n\nPursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(b), the pedigree is subject to the record retention requirements in 21 CFR SS 203.60, and must be retained by all wholesale distributors involved in the distribution of the drug product, whether ADR or non-ADR, for 3 years.\n\nIf the pharmacy receiving the pedigree will not itself engage in further distribution of the product to persons other than a consumer or patient, then the pharmacy is not required to maintain that pedigree under 21 CFR SS 203.60. However, consistent with the spirit of the PDMA, FDA encourages pharmacies and other end users to retain the pedigree for 3 years. As a result, if there is any question about the source or history of the product, it can be traced back through the drug supply chain.\n\nIf an ADR obtains drugs from a non-ADR, is the ADR required to maintain the pedigree?\n\nYes. Although an ADR is not required to provide a pedigree, pursuant to 21 CFR SSS 203.50(b), and 203.60(d), an ADR is required to retain the pedigree for 3 years.\n\nPDMA Scope\n\nDoes PDMA apply to veterinary prescription drugs?\n--------------------\nContext title: Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) Requirements- Questions and Answers']","['Yes.

(2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: G. Carcinogenicity (2.7)\n\nThe appropriateness of a carcinogenicity assessment for anticancer pharmaceuticals is described in ICH S1A. Carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer.\n\nH. Immunotoxicity (2.8)\n\nFor most anticancer pharmaceuticals, the design components of the general toxicology studies are considered sufficient to evaluate immunotoxic potential and support marketing. For immunomodulatory pharmacokinetics, additional endpoints (such as immunophenotyping by flow cytometry) might be included in the study design.\n\nI. Photosafety testing (2.9)\n\nAn initial assessment of phototoxic potential should be conducted prior to Phase 1, based on photochemical properties of the drug and information on other members in the class. If assessment of these data indicates a potential risk, appropriate protective measures should be taken during outpatient trials. If the photosafety risk cannot be adequately evaluated based on nonclinical data or clinical experience, a photosafety assessment consistent with the principles described in ICH M3 should be provided prior to marketing.\n\n3 Nonclinical data to support clinical trial design and Marketing (3)\n\nStart Dose for First Administration in Humans (3.1)\n\nThe goal of selecting the start dose is to identify a dose that is expected to have pharmacologic effects and is reasonably safe to use. The start dose should be scientifically justified using all available nonclinical data (e.g., pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicity), and its selection based on various approaches (see Note 2). For most systemically administered small molecules, interspecies scaling of the animal doses to an equivalent human dose is usually based on normalization to body surface area. For both small molecules and biopharmaceuticals, interspecies scaling based on body weight, AUC, or other exposure parameters might be appropriate.\n\nFor biopharmaceuticals with immune agonistic properties, selection of the start dose using a minimally anticipated biologic effect level (MABEL) should be considered.\n\nDose Escalation and the Highest Dose in a Clinical Trial (3.2)\n\nIn general, the highest dose or exposure tested in the nonclinical studies does not limit the dose-escalation or highest dose investigated in a clinical trial in patients with cancer. When a steep dose- or exposure-response curve for severe toxicity is observed in nonclinical toxicology studies, or when no preceding marker of severe toxicity is available, smaller than usual dose increments (fractional increments rather than dose doubling) should be considered.\n\nDuration and Schedule of Toxicology Studies to Support Initial Clinical Trials (3.3)\n\nIn Phase 1 clinical trials, treatment can continue according to the patient\'s response, and in this case, a new toxicology study is not called for to support continued treatment beyond the duration of the completed toxicology studies.\n\nThe design of nonclinical studies should be appropriately chosen to accommodate different dosing schedules that might be utilized in initial clinical trials. It is not expected that the exact clinical schedule always will be followed in the toxicological study, but the information provided from the toxicity studies should be sufficient to support the clinical dose and schedule and to identify potential toxicity. For example, one factor that can be considered is the half-life in the test species and the projected (or known) half-life in humans. Other factors could include exposure assessment, toxicity profile, saturation of receptors, etc. Table 1 provides examples of nonclinical treatment schedules that are commonly used in anticancer pharmaceutical development and can be used for small molecules or biopharmaceuticals. In cases where the available toxicology information does not support a change in clinical schedules, an additional toxicology study in a single species is usually sufficient.\n\nDuration of Toxicology Studies to Support Continued Clinical Development and Marketing (3.4)\n\nThe nonclinical data to support Phase 1 and the clinical Phase 1 data would normally be sufficient for moving to Phase 2 and into second or first line therapy in patients with advanced cancer. In support of continued development of an anticancer pharmaceutical for patients with advanced cancer, results from repeat dose studies of 3 months\' duration following the intended clinical schedule should be provided prior to initiating Phase 3 studies. For most pharmaceuticals intended for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer, nonclinical studies of 3 months\' duration are considered sufficient to support marketing.\n\nWhen considering a change in the clinical schedule, an evaluation of the existing clinical data should be conducted to justify such change. If the clinical data alone are inadequate to support the change in schedule, the factors discussed in section III.C (3.3) above should be considered.\n\nCombination of Pharmaceuticals (3.5)\n\nPharmaceuticals planned for use in combination should be well studied individually in toxicology evaluations. Data to support a rationale for the combination should be provided prior to starting the clinical study. In general, toxicology studies investigating the safety of combinations of pharmaceuticals intended to treat patients with advanced cancer are not warranted. If the human toxicity profile of the pharmaceuticals has been characterized, a nonclinical study evaluating the combination is not usually warranted. For studies in which at least one of these compounds is in early stage development (i.e., the human toxicity profile has not been characterized), a pharmacology study to support the rationale for the combination should be provided. This study should provide evidence of increased activity in the absence of a substantial increase in toxicity on the basis of limited safety endpoints, such as mortality, clinical signs, and body weight. Based on available information, a determination should be made whether or not a dedicated toxicology study of the combination is warranted.\n\nNonclinical Studies to Support Trials in Pediatric Populations (3.6)\n\nThe general paradigm for investigating most anticancer pharmaceuticals in pediatric patients is first to define a relatively safe dose in adult populations and then to assess some fraction of that dose in initial pediatric clinical studies. The recommendations for nonclinical testing outlined elsewhere in this document also apply for this population. Studies in juvenile animals are not usually conducted in order to support inclusion of pediatric populations for the treatment of cancer. Conduct of studies in juvenile animals should be considered only when human safety data and previous animal studies are considered insufficient for a safety evaluation in the intended pediatric age group.\n\nOther Considerations (4)\n\nConjugated Products (4.1)\n\nConjugated products are pharmaceuticals covalently bound to carrier molecules, such as proteins, lipids, or sugars. The safety of the conjugated material is the primary concern. The safety of the unconjugated material, including the linker used, can have a more limited evaluation. Stability of the conjugate in the test species and human plasma should be provided. A toxicokinetic evaluation should assess both the conjugated and the unconjugated compound after administration of the conjugated material.\n\nLiposomal Products (4.2)\n\nA complete evaluation of the liposomal product is not warranted if the unencapsulated material has been well characterized. As appropriate, the safety assessment should include a toxicological evaluation of the liposomal product and a limited evaluation of the unencapsulated pharmaceutical and carrier (e.g., a single arm in a toxicology study). The principle described here might also apply to other similar carriers. A toxicokinetic evaluation should be conducted as appropriate. If possible, such an evaluation should assess both the liposomal product and the free compound after administration of the liposomal product.\n\nEvaluation of Drug Metabolites (4.3)\n\nIn some cases, metabolites that have been identified in humans have not been qualified in nonclinical studies. For these metabolites, a separate evaluation is generally not warranted for patients with advanced cancer.\n\nEvaluation of Impurities (4.4)\n\nIt is recognized that impurity standards have been based on a negligible risk, as discussed in ICH Q3A and Q3B. Exceeding the established limits for impurities identified in these ICH guidances could be appropriate for anticancer pharmaceuticals, and a justification should be provided in the marketing application. The justification could include the disease being treated and the patient population, the nature of the parent pharmaceutical (pharmacologic properties, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, etc.), duration of treatment, and the impact of impurity reduction on manufacturing. Further, the qualification assessment could include consideration of either the dose or concentration tested in nonclinical study relative to clinical levels. For genotoxic impurities, several approaches have been used to set limits based on increase in lifetime risk of cancer. Such limits are not appropriate for pharmaceuticals intended to treat patients with advanced cancer, and justifications described above should be considered to set higher limits. Impurities that are also metabolites present in animal and/or human studies are generally considered qualified.\n\nV Notes (5)\n\nFor nonrodent studies, dose groups usually consist of at least 3 animals/sex/group, with an additional 2/sex/group for recovery, if appropriate (see section II.D (2.4)). Both sexes should generally be used, or justification should be given for specific omissions.\n--------------------\nContext title: S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section ""2.9 Photosafety Testing"" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: Photosafety Tests Using In Vivo Assays and Dermal Administration (3.5)\n\nThe main recommendations provided for investigating the systemic route of administration also apply to dermal administration, including those for species selection, study duration, and irradiation conditions. For dermal drug products in general, the clinical formulation should be tested. The intended clinical conditions of administration should be used to the extent possible. Irradiation of the exposed area should take place at a specified time after application, and the interval between application and irradiation should be justified based on the specific properties of the formulation to be tested. Signs of phototoxicity should be assessed based on relevant endpoints (see section III.D(3.4)). The sensitivity of the assay should be demonstrated using appropriate reference compounds. Assessment of systemic drug levels is generally not warranted in dermal phototoxicity studies.\n\nFor dermal drug products, contact photoallergy has often been assessed in a nonclinical study along with acute phototoxicity (photoirritation). However, no formal validation of such assays has been performed. Although the acute photoirritation observed in these studies is considered relevant to humans, the predictivity of these studies for human photoallergy is unknown. For regulatory purposes, such nonclinical photoallergy testing is generally not recommended.\n\nIV Clinical Photosafety Assessment (4)\n\nThere are various options for collecting human data, if warranted, ranging from standard reporting of adverse events in clinical studies to a dedicated clinical photosafety trial. The precise strategy is determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nV Assessment Strategies (5)\n\nThe choice of the photosafety assessment strategy is up to the drug developer. ICH M3(R2) suggests that an initial assessment of the phototoxicity potential based on photochemical properties and pharmacological/chemical class be undertaken before outpatient studies. Characterization of the UV-visible absorption spectrum is recommended as the initial assessment because it can obviate any further photosafety evaluation. In addition, the distribution to skin and eye can be evaluated to inform further on the human risk and the recommendations for further testing. Then, if appropriate, an experimental evaluation of phototoxicity potential (in vitro, in vivo, or clinical) should be undertaken before exposure of large numbers of subjects (phase 3).\n\nFigure 1 provides an outline of possible phototoxicity assessment strategies. The figure is based on the strategies outlined in this section of this guidance. The strategies are flexible. Depending on the particular situation, some portions of the assessment are optional and might not be conducted.\n\nRecommendations for Pharmaceuticals Given via Systemic Routes (5.1)\n\nv.1.1 Assessment of Phototoxicity Potential (5.1.1)\n\nIf the substance does not have an MEC greater than 1000 L mol-1 cm-1 (between 290 and 700 nm), no photosafety testing is recommended and no direct phototoxicity is anticipated in humans. However, it should be noted that phototoxicity by indirect mechanisms (e.g., pseudoporphyria or porphyia), although rare, could still occur. For compounds with MEC values of 1000 L mol-1 cm-1 or higher, if the drug developer chooses to conduct a test for photoreactivity, a negative result could support a decision that no further photosafety assessment is warranted (see section III.B(3.2)). Otherwise, nonclinical and/or clinical photosafety assessment of the substance should be conducted. Available data on the phototoxicity of chemical class-related compounds should be evaluated because this could inform on the approach to be taken.\n\nv.1.2 Evaluation of Phototoxicity (5.1.2)\n\nTo reduce the use of animals in accordance with the 3R principles, a validated in vitro method should generally be considered before conducting animal testing (see, for example, Directive 2010/63/EU). If the drug developer chooses an in vitro approach, the 3T3 NRU-PT is currently the most widely used assay and in many cases could be considered as an initial test for phototoxicity. The high sensitivity of the 3T3 NRU-PT results in good negative predictivity and the negative results are generally accepted as sufficient evidence that a substance is not phototoxic. In such cases no further testing is recommended and no direct phototoxicity is anticipated in humans.\n\nIn some situations (e.g., poorly soluble compounds), an initial assessment of phototoxicity in an in vitro assay might not be appropriate. In this case, an assessment in animals or in humans could be considered. Alternatively, if drug distribution data are available, they could, on a case-by-case basis, support a decision that no further photosafety assessment is warranted (see section II.B(2.2)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSome properties of the clinical formulation that could influence the potential phototoxic response (e.g., penetration into skin, intracellular uptake) cannot be evaluated using the 3T3 NRU-PT alone. Therefore, confirmation of the overall negative result in an evaluation using the clinical formulation and/or monitoring during clinical trials can still be warranted.\n\nReconstructed human skin models can be used to assess the phototoxicity potential of clinical formulations. Under adequate test conditions (see section III.C(3.3)), a negative result in a reconstructed human skin assay indicates that the direct phototoxicity potential of the formulation can be regarded as low. In this case, generally no further phototoxicity testing is recommended (see Note 5 for exception).\n\nIf an appropriate in vitro assay is not available, the initial test could be an in vivo phototoxicity test on the clinical formulation. A negative result in an appropriately conducted in vivo animal phototoxicity study would be sufficient evidence that the formulation is not directly phototoxic and no further phototoxicity testing is recommended (see Note 5 for exception). Alternatively, the phototoxicity potential can be assessed in the clinical setting.\n\nFor dermal products where the API or any new excipient has an MEC value greater than 1000 L mol({}^{\\text{-1}}) cm({}^{\\text{-1}}) at any wavelength between 290 and 700 nm, a photoullergy assessment is generally warranted in addition to phototoxicity testing. Because the predictivity of nonclinical photoullergy tests is unknown, this would typically be a clinical assessment using the to-be-marketed formulation and conducted during phase 3.\n\nPhotosafety evaluation of the clinical formulation delivered via dermal patches can follow the above described principles for clinical dermal formulations. For transdermal patches, the principles for both dermal and systemic drugs should be applied. In addition, the intended clinical use (e.g., skin area recommended for use, duration of application) and the properties of the patch matrix (e.g., being opaque to UV and visible light) should be considered for the overall risk assessment.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n""otherwise"": data do not support a low potential for phototoxicity or have not been generated (assay/test/evaluation not conducted)\n\nA ""negative"" result in an appropriately conducted in vivo phototoxicity study supersedes a positive in vitro result. A robust clinical phototoxicity assessment indicating no concern supersedes any positive nonclinical results. A positive result in an in vitro phototoxicity test could also, on a case-by-case basis, be negated by tissue distribution data (see text). In the United States, for products applied dermally, a dedicated clinical trial for phototoxicity on the to-be-marketed formulation can be warranted in support of product approval.\n\nClinical evaluation could range from standard reporting of adverse events in clinical studies to a dedicated clinical photosafety trial.\n\nTissue distribution is not a consideration for the phototoxicity of dermal products.\n\nFigure 1: Outline of Possible Phototoxicity Assessment Strategies for Pharmaceuticals Given via Systemic and Dermal Routes\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nVI Endnotes (6)\n\nNote 1:For compounds that absorb at relevant wavelengths, have an MEC value greater than 1000 L mol({}^{\\text{1}}) cm({}^{\\text{-1}}), and are given via ocular routes (e.g., eye drops, intraocular injections), an evaluation of the phototoxicity potential should be undertaken in accordance with the general principles of phototoxicity assessment. Biodistribution of drug in the eye and optical properties of the eye should also be considered. Any available information on the compound or chemical class-related compounds should be considered in the overall assessment.\n\nCompounds that only absorb light at wavelengths below 400 nm and are to be administered as intraocular injections behind the lens (e.g., in the vitreous) are of low concern for retinal phototoxicity, because only light of wavelengths greater than 400 nm reaches the back of the adult eye. However, the lens in children of less than approximately 10 years of age is not completely protective against wavelengths below 400 nm.\n\nNote 2:Testing for photogenotoxicity is not recommended as a part of the standard photosafety testing program. In the past, some regional guidelines (e.g., CPMP/SWP/398/01) have recommended that photogenotoxicity testing be conducted preferentially using a photoclastogenicity assay (chromosomal aberration or micronucleus test) in mammalian cells in vitro. However, experience with these models since the CPMP/SWP guideline was issued has indicated that these tests are substantially oversensitive and even incidences of pseudo-photoclastogenicity have been reported (Ref. 8). Furthermore, the interpretation of photogenotoxicity data regarding its meaning for clinically relevant enhancement of UV-mediated skin cancer is unclear.\n--------------------\nContext title: S10 Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals'

(2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: 4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor either species, this design could be adapted to replace the corresponding standard chronic study and a separate juvenile animal study in some circumstances.\n\nThe appropriateness of carcinogenicity testing should be addressed before long-term exposure in pediatric clinical trials. However, unless there is a significant cause for concern (e.g., evidence of genotoxicity in multiple tests, or concern for pro-carcinogenic risk based on mechanistic considerations or findings from general toxicity studies), carcinogenicity studies are not recommended to support the conduct of pediatric clinical trials.\n\nXiii. Immunotoxicity (13)\n\nAs stated in the ICH S8 guidance (Ref. 14), all new human pharmaceuticals should be evaluated for the potential to produce immunotoxicity using standard toxicity studies and additional immunotoxicity studies conducted as appropriate based on a weight-of-evidence review, including immune-related signals from standard toxicity studies. If additional immunotoxicity studies are indicated, these should be completed before exposure of a large population of patients (e.g., phase 3).\n\nXiv. Photosafety Testing (14)\n\nThe appropriateness or timing of photosafety testing in relation to human exposure should be influenced by: (1) the photochemical properties (e.g., photoabsorption and photostability) of the molecule, (2) information on the phototoxic potential of chemically related compounds, (3) tissue distribution, and (4) clinical or nonclinical findings indicative of phototoxicity.\n\nAn initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on a drug\'s photochemical properties and pharmacological/chemical class should be performed. If assessment of all the available data and the proposed clinical plan indicates a potential for a significant human phototoxicity risk, appropriate protective measures should be taken during outpatient clinical studies. In addition, a subsequent evaluation of the nonclinical drug distribution to skin and eye should be completed to inform further on the human risk and the need for further testing. Then, if appropriate, an experimental evaluation (nonclinical, in vitro or in vivo, or clinical) of phototoxic potential should be undertaken before exposure of large numbers of subjects (phase 3).\n\nAlternatively, instead of the above stepwise approach, a direct assessment of phototoxic potential in a nonclinical or clinical study can be undertaken. If this study is negative, an early assessment of eye/skin distribution studies and clinical protective measures are not called for.\n\nIf the phototoxicity assessment indicates a potential photocarcinogenic risk, the risk can usually be adequately managed in patients by protective measures including a warning statement in the informed consent for clinical trials and in product information for marketing (Note 6).\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor drugs that produce central nervous system activity, regardless of therapeutic indication, it should be considered whether or not an evaluation of abuse liability is warranted. Nonclinical studies should support the design of clinical evaluations of abuse potential, classification/scheduling by regulatory agencies, and product information. There are regional guidance documents on the conduct of nonclinical abuse liability assessment that can be helpful in designing specific abuse liability packages.\n\nNonclinical data collected early in the drug development process can be useful in identification of early indicators of abuse potential. These early indicators would typically be available before first human dose and include the PK/PD profile to identify the duration of action, similarity of chemical structure to known drugs of abuse, receptor binding profile, and behavioural/clinical signs from in vivo nonclinical studies. When no abuse potential is apparent from these early studies, extensive testing in nonclinical abuse liability models might not be warranted. Generally, if the active substance shows signals associated with known abuse liability patterns or the active substance has a novel mechanism of action on the central nervous system, further nonclinical studies are recommended to support large clinical trials (e.g., phase 3).\n\nWhen the metabolite profile and the target for drug activity in rodent are consistent with that of human, the nonclinical abuse liability evaluations should be conducted in rodents. Nonhuman primates should be reserved only for those limited cases where there is clear evidence that they would be predictive of human abuse liability and the rodent model is inadequate. Three types of studies are often completed to evaluate the potential for abuse liability: drug discrimination, self-administration of the compound, and an assessment of withdrawal. When conducted, studies of drug discrimination and self-administration are generally stand-alone. Assessments of withdrawal can sometimes be incorporated within the design of the reversibility arm of a repeated-dose toxicity study. A maximum dose that produces a plasma concentration several-fold higher than that obtained at the therapeutic clinical dose is considered appropriate for these nonclinical abuse assessments.\n\nOther Toxicity Studies (16)\n\nAdditional nonclinical studies (e.g., to identify potential biomarkers, to provide mechanistic understanding) can be useful if previous nonclinical or clinical findings with the product or related products have indicated special safety concerns.\n\nThe approaches for qualifying impurities and degradants are outlined in ICH Q3A and Q3B (Refs. 12 and 13). If specific studies are warranted to qualify an impurity or degradant, generally these studies are not warranted before phase 3 unless there are changes that result in a significant new impurity profile (e.g., a new synthetic pathway, a new degradant formed by interactions between the components of the formulation). In these latter cases, appropriate qualification studies can be warranted to support phase 2 or later stages of development.\n\nCombination Drug Toxicity Testing (17)\n\nThis section covers combination drugs that are intended to be co-packaged or administered in a single dosage form (""fixed formulation""). The principles outlined can also apply whendeveloping products that will have product information recommendations for co-use with a specific drug, even if not in a fixed combination, and for which there is minimal clinical information regarding the combination.\n\nCombinations covered might involve: (1) two or more late stage entities (defined as compounds with significant clinical experience (i.e., from phase 3 studies and/ or post marketing))\' (2) one or more late stage entity(ies) and one or more early stage entities (defined as compounds with limited clinical experience (i.e., phase 2 studies or less)); or (3) more than one early stage entity. For most combinations which involve two late stage entities and for which there is adequate clinical experience with co-administration, combination toxicity studies would generally not be recommended to support clinical studies or marketing unless there is significant toxicological concern (e.g., similar target organ toxicity). This concern would be modified depending on the margins of safety and the ability to monitor the adverse effects in humans. If a study is being conducted to address a cause for significant toxicological concern, it should generally be completed before carrying out clinical studies with the combination.\n\nWhere there are two late stage products for which there is not adequate clinical experience with co-administration, but there are no causes for significant toxicological concern based on the available data, nonclinical combination studies generally are not recommended to support small-scale, relatively short-duration clinical studies (e.g., phase 2 studies of up to 3 months\' duration). Nonclinical combination studies, however, are recommended before large-scale or long-term combination trials, as well as for marketing.\n\nFor combinations of an early stage entity(ies) with clinical experience with a late stage entity(ies), for which there is no significant toxicological concern, combination toxicity studies are not recommended to support clinical proof-of-concept studies of up to one months\' duration. The clinical study of the combination should not be longer than the clinical experience of the individual entities. Later stage or longer duration clinical studies should be supported by a nonclinical combination toxicity study.\n\nFor combinations of two early stage entities, nonclinical combination toxicity studies are recommended to support clinical trials.\n\nProvided complete nonclinical development programs are being conducted on the individual entities and a nonclinical combination toxicity study is warranted to support combination clinical trials, the duration of the combination study should be equivalent to that of the clinical trial, up to a maximum duration of 90 days. A 90-day combination toxicity study would also support marketing. A combination toxicity study of shorter duration can also support marketing, depending on the duration of the intended clinical use.\n\nThe design of the nonclinical studies recommended to characterize the combination will depend on the pharmacological, toxicological and PK profiles of the individual entities, the treatment indication(s), the intended patient population, and the available clinical data.\n\nCombination nonclinical studies should generally be limited to a single relevant species. If unexpected toxicity is identified, additional testing can be appropriate.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen complete nonclinical development programs are not conducted on the individual entities, then a complete nonclinical toxicology program with the combination only can be appropriate, provided that the individual agents are only intended for use in combination.\n--------------------\nContext title: M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section ""2.9 Photosafety Testing"" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: Photosensitization is a general term occasionally used to describe all light-induced tissue reactions. However, in order to clearly distinguish between photoallergy and phototoxicity, the term photosensitization is not used in this guidance.\n\nFor a chemical to demonstrate phototoxicity and/or photoallergy, the following characteristics are critical:\n\nabsorbs light within the range of natural sunlight (290-700 nm)\n\ngenerates a reactive species following absorption of UV-visible light\n\ndistributes sufficiently to light-exposed tissues (e.g., skin, eye)\n\nIf one or more of these conditions are not met, a compound will usually not present a concern for direct phototoxicity. However, increased sensitivity of skin to light can also occur through indirect mechanisms. Such mechanisms are not generally addressed by the testing outlined in this guidance (see also section II.D(2.4)).\n\nII Factors to Consider in the Photosafety Evaluation (2)\n\nPhotochemical Properties (2.1)\n\nThe initial consideration for assessment of photoreactive potential is whether a compound absorbs photons at any wavelength between 290 and 700 nm. A compound that does not have a molar extinction coefficient (MEC) greater than 1000 L mol({}^{-1}) cm({}^{-1}) at any wavelength between 290 and 700 nm (Ref. [3]) is not considered to be sufficiently photoreactive to result in direct phototoxicity (see Note 3 for further details).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nexperience with melanin binding drugs suggests such binding alone does not present a photosafety concern.\n\nA single-dose tissue distribution study, with animals assessed at multiple timepoints after dosing, will generally provide an adequate assessment of relative tissue to plasma concentration ratios, tissue residence time, and the potential for retention and accumulation. Assessment timepoints should be appropriately spaced in such a study to account for the drug half-life.\n\nCompounds activated by visible light and exhibiting long elimination half-lives in internal tissues have been demonstrated to cause injury to those tissues if exposed to intense light during medical procedures. Consequently, for those compounds activated by visible light with potent in vivo phototoxicity or known to be phototoxic based on their mechanism of action, such as photodynamic therapy drugs, distribution to internal tissues should be measured and tissue-specific half-lives estimated. Drugs that only absorb ultraviolet (UV) light or have short tissue elimination half-lives are not likely to present a risk to internal tissues even if they are known to be photoreactive.\n\nMetabolite Considerations (2.3)\n\nMetabolites generally do not warrant separate photosafety assessments, because metabolism does not typically result in chromophores that are substantially different from those in the parent molecule.\n\nPharmacological Properties (2.4)\n\nIn many cases, drug-induced phototoxicity is due to the chemical structure and not the pharmacology. However, certain pharmacologic properties (e.g., immunosuppression, perturbation of heme homeostasis) can enhance susceptibility to light-induced effects, such as skin irritation or UV-induced skin tumor formation. The testing strategies outlined in this document are not designed to detect these types of indirect mechanisms. Some of these indirect mechanisms can be identified and evaluated in other nonclinical pharmacology/toxicity testing; however, phototoxicity related to other indirect mechanisms might only become apparent with human experience.\n\nIII Nonclinical Photosafety Tests (3)\n\nGeneral Considerations (3.1)\n\nCarefully selected conditions that consider both the model system and exposure to a relevant radiation spectrum are critical for nonclinical photosafety testing. Ideally, a nonclinical assay should exhibit both high sensitivity and specificity (i.e., low false negative and low false positive rates). However, to support the assessment strategies described in this document, it is most important that nonclinical photosafety assays show high sensitivity resulting in a low frequency of false negatives (i.e., a high negative predictive value). This is because negative assay results usually do not warrant further photosafety evaluation. The available nonclinical assays, both in vitro and in vivo, are focused primarily on detecting potential phototoxicity, which might or might not translate into clinically relevant phototoxicity.\n\nSelection of irradiation conditions is critical for both in vitro and in vivo assays. Natural sunlight represents the broadest range of light exposure that humans might be exposed to regularly. However, sunlight per se is not well defined and depends on many factors, such as latitude, altitude, season, time of day, and weather. In addition, sensitivity of human skin to natural sunlight depends on a number of individual factors (e.g., skin type, anatomical site and tanning status). Standardized sunlight exposure conditions have been defined by various organizations. Such standards (e.g., CIE-85-1989 (Ref. 5)) should be considered in order to assess suitability of a sunlight simulator light source, and irradiance and irradiation dose should be normalized based on the ultraviolet light A (UVA) part of the applied spectrum. UVA doses ranging from 5 to 20 J/cm({}^{2}) are successfully used in current in vitro and in vivo phototoxicity assays. These UVA doses are comparable to those obtained during prolonged outdoor activities on summer days around noon time, in temperate zones, and at sea level. In humans, sunburn reactions caused by ultraviolet light B (UVB) normally limit total sunlight exposure. In nonclinical phototoxicity assays, however, the amount of UVB should not limit the overall irradiation and might be attenuated (partially filtered) so that relevant UVA doses can be tested without reducing assay sensitivity. Penetration of UVB light into human skin is mainly limited to the epidermis, while UVA can reach capillary blood. Therefore, clinical relevance of photochemical activation by UVB is considered less important than activation by UVA for systemic drugs. However, UVB irradiation is relevant for topical formulations applied to light-exposed tissues.\n\nThe selection and monitoring of appropriate light sources (spectral distribution, irradiance, and dose) and the procedures used should be clearly described in the study methodology (e.g., OECD TG 432 (Ref. 6)).\n\nPhotoreactivity Tests Using Chemical Assays (3.2)\n\nIf a drug developer chooses to assess photoreactivity, the assay should be qualified using pharmaceutical agents under appropriate conditions to demonstrate assay sensitivity. One such assay is an ROS assay (e.g., Ref. 7). Data suggest that this assay has high sensitivity for predicting direct in vivo phototoxicants. However, this assay has a low specificity, generating a high percentage of false positive results. A negative result in this assay, conducted under the appropriate conditions, would indicate a very low probability of phototoxicity, provided a test concentration of 200 (\\mu)M can be achieved, whereas a positive result (at any concentration) would only be a flag for follow-up assessment.\n\nPhototoxicity Tests Using In Vitro Assays (3.3)\n\nA number of in vitro assays have been developed for assessing the phototoxicity potential of chemicals. Some of these assays have not been qualified for use with pharmaceuticals. Some assays involve testing compounds that are dissolved in the culture medium, and such methods are often appropriate for the active ingredient or excipients in drug products, depending on their solubility. Other assays involve direct application to the surface of a tissue preparation and can be appropriate for testing entire formulations intended to be administered topically.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe most widely used in vitro assay for phototoxicity is the 3T3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity test (3T3 NRU-PT) for which an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline (Ref. 6) is available. This is currently considered the most appropriate in vitro screen for soluble compounds.\n\nAlthough the formal European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) validation exercise conducted on this assay indicated a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 84%, experience within the pharmaceutical industry suggests a much lower specificity. The original OECD protocol was not validated for pharmaceuticals specifically. Thus, some modifications to the original OECD protocol have been proposed to address the low specificity observed with drug substances (see Note 4). These proposed changes are appropriate for the testing of pharmaceuticals. The sensitivity of the 3T3 NRU-PT is high, and if a compound is negative in this assay, it would have a very low probability of being phototoxic in humans. However, a positive result in the 3T3 NRU-PT should not be regarded as indicative of a likely clinical phototoxic risk, but rather a flag for follow-up assessment.\n\nThe BALB/c 3T3 cell line is sensitive to UVB, and the initially recommended irradiation conditions (Ref. 6) involve the use of filters to attenuate wavelengths below 320 nm. However, depending on the light source and filters used, the ratio of UVB to UVA can be adjusted such that it is possible to assess UVB-induced phototoxicity in this test. UVB-induced phototoxicity is rarely a problem for pharmaceuticals with systemic exposure because UVB minimally penetrates beyond the epidermis. However, UVB-induced phototoxicity is more relevant for topical products. For components of topically applied products that absorb predominately in the UVB range, and if in vitro assessment is desired, the use of the 3T3 NRU-PT with modified irradiation conditions (see above) can be considered. Alternatively, in vitro skin models, which better tolerate UVB, could be considered.\n--------------------\nContext title: S10 Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section ""2.9 Photosafety Testing"" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: Tissue distribution is not a consideration for the phototoxicity of dermal products.\n\nFigure 1: Outline of Possible Phototoxicity Assessment Strategies for Pharmaceuticals Given via Systemic and Dermal Routes\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nVI Endnotes (6)\n\nNote 1:For compounds that absorb at relevant wavelengths, have an MEC value greater than 1000 L mol({}^{\\text{1}}) cm({}^{\\text{-1}}), and are given via ocular routes (e.g., eye drops, intraocular injections), an evaluation of the phototoxicity potential should be undertaken in accordance with the general principles of phototoxicity assessment. Biodistribution of drug in the eye and optical properties of the eye should also be considered. Any available information on the compound or chemical class-related compounds should be considered in the overall assessment.\n\nCompounds that only absorb light at wavelengths below 400 nm and are to be administered as intraocular injections behind the lens (e.g., in the vitreous) are of low concern for retinal phototoxicity, because only light of wavelengths greater than 400 nm reaches the back of the adult eye. However, the lens in children of less than approximately 10 years of age is not completely protective against wavelengths below 400 nm.\n\nNote 2:Testing for photogenotoxicity is not recommended as a part of the standard photosafety testing program. In the past, some regional guidelines (e.g., CPMP/SWP/398/01) have recommended that photogenotoxicity testing be conducted preferentially using a photoclastogenicity assay (chromosomal aberration or micronucleus test) in mammalian cells in vitro. However, experience with these models since the CPMP/SWP guideline was issued has indicated that these tests are substantially oversensitive and even incidences of pseudo-photoclastogenicity have been reported (Ref. 8). Furthermore, the interpretation of photogenotoxicity data regarding its meaning for clinically relevant enhancement of UV-mediated skin cancer is unclear.\n\nNote 3:Standardized conditions for determination of MECs are critical. Selection of an adequate solvent is driven by both analytical requirements (e.g., dissolving power, UV-visible light transparency) and physiological relevance (e.g., pH 7.4-buffered aqueous conditions). Methanol is recommended as a preferred solvent and was used to support the MEC threshold of 1000 L mol({}^{\\text{-1}}) cm({}^{\\text{-1}}) (Ref. 3). When measuring UV-visible light spectra, potential limitations (e.g., artifacts due to high concentrations or low solubility, including slow precipitation) should be considered. If the chromophore of the molecule appears to be pH-sensitive (e.g., phenolic structure, aromatic amines, carboxylic acids), an additional spectrum obtained under aqueous, pH 7.4-buffered conditions could add valuable information regarding differences in the shape of the absorption spectrum and in the MECs. If significant differences are seen between measurements obtained in methanol versus pH-adjusted conditions, the MEC threshold of 1000 L mol({}^{\\text{-1}}) cm({}^{\\text{-1}}) cannot be used to obviate further photosafety assessment.\n\nNote 4:A survey of pharmaceutical companies indicated that the 3T3 NRU-PT, as described in OECD TG 432, generates a high percentage of positive results (approximately 50%), the majority of which do not correlate with phototoxicity responses in animals or humans (Ref. 9). Following a retrospective review of data for pharmaceuticals, a reduction of the maximum test concentration from 1000 to 100 (\\upmu)g/mL appears justified (Ref. 10). Compounds without any significant cytotoxicity (under irradiation) up to this limit can be considered as being devoid of relevant phototoxicity. In addition, the category named ""probable phototoxicity"" per OECD TG 432 (i.e.,photoiritation factor (PIF) values between 2 and 5 or mean photo effect (MPE) values between 0.10 and 0.15) is of questionable toxicological relevance for systemic drugs. Compounds in this category generally do not warrant further photosafety evaluations. For compounds with a PIF value between 2 and 5, and for which it is not possible to determine an IC({}_{50}) in the absence of irradiation, it is important to check that the compound is not classified as positive using the MPE calculation (i.e., that the MPE is less than 0.15).\n\nSystemic drugs that are positive in the 3T3 NRU-PT only at in vitro concentrations that are many times higher than drug concentrations likely to be achieved in light-exposed tissues in humans, can, on a case-by-case basis and in consultation with regulatory authorities, be considered to be low risk for phototoxicity in humans, without follow-up in vivo testing.\n\nNote 5: In the United States, for products applied dermally, a dedicated clinical trial for phototoxicity (photoiritation) on the to-be-marketed formulation (API plus all excipients) can be warranted in support of product approval.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nVII Glossary (7)\n\n3T3 NRU-PT:In vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity test.\n\nAssessment:In the context of this document, an assessment is an evaluation of all available information and does not always mean an additional test is conducted.\n\nChromophore:The substructure of a molecule that absorbs visible or ultraviolet light.\n\nDermal Drugs:Products applied topically to the skin.\n\nDirect Phototoxicity:Phototoxicity induced by absorption of light by the drug or excipient.\n\nIndirect Phototoxicity:Phototoxicity due to cellular, biochemical, or physiological alterations caused by the drug or excipient, but not related to photochemical reactivity of the drug or excipient (e.g., perturbation of heme homeostasis).\n\nIrradiance:The intensity of UV or visible light incident on a surface, measured in W/m({}^{2}) or mW/cm({}^{2}).\n\nIrradiation:The process by which an object/subject is exposed to UV or visible radiation.\n\nMec:Molar extinction coefficient (also called molar absorptivity) reflects the efficiency with which a molecule can absorb a photon at a particular wavelength (typically expressed as L mol({}^{-1}) cm({}^{-1})) and is influenced by several factors, such as solvent.\n\nMpe:The mean photo effect is calculated for results of the 3T3 NRU-PT.

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAny proposals for GMP relevant changes should be drafted, reviewed, and approved by the appropriate organizational units and reviewed and approved by the quality unit(s). (13.12)\n\nThe potential impact of the proposed change on the quality of the intermediate or API should be evaluated. A classification procedure may help in determining the level of testing, validation, and documentation needed to justify changes to a validated process. Changes can be classified (e.g., as minor or major) depending on the nature and extent of the changes, and the effects these changes may impart on the process. Scientific judgment should determine what additional testing and validation studies are appropriate to justify a change in a validated process. (13.13)\n\nWhen implementing approved changes, measures should be taken to ensure that all documents affected by the changes are revised. (13.14)\n\nAfter the change has been implemented, there should be an evaluation of the first batches produced or tested under the change. (13.15)\n\nThe potential for critical changes to affect established retest or expiry dates should be evaluated. If necessary, samples of the intermediate or API produced by the modified process can be placed on an accelerated stability program and/or can be added to the stability monitoring program. (13.16)\n\nCurrent dosage form manufacturers should be notified of changes from established production and process control procedures that can affect the quality of the API. (13.17)\n\nXiv Rejection and Re-Use of Materials (14)\n\nRejection (14.1)\n\nIntermediates and APIs failing to meet established specifications should be identified as such and quarantined. These intermediates or APIs can be reprocessed or reworked as described below.\n\nThe final disposition of rejected materials should be recorded. (14.10)\n\nReprocessing (14.2)\n\nIntroducing an intermediate or API, including one that does not conform to standards or specifications, back into the process and reprocessing by repeating a crystallization step or other appropriate chemical or physical manipulation steps (e.g., distillation, filtration, chromatography, milling) that are part of the established manufacturing process is generally considered acceptable. However, if such reprocessing is used for a majority of batches, such reprocessing should be included as part of the standard manufacturing process. (14.20)Continuation of a process step after an in-process control test has shown that the step is incomplete is considered to be part of the normal process. This is not considered to be reprocessing. (14.21)\n\nIntroducing unreacted material back into a process and repeating a chemical reaction is considered to be reprocessing unless it is part of the established process. Such reprocessing should be preceded by careful evaluation to ensure that the quality of the intermediate or API is not adversely affected due to the potential formation of by-products and over-reacted materials. (14.22)\n\nReworking (14.3)\n\nBefore a decision is taken to rework batches that do not conform to established standards or specifications, an investigation into the reason for nonconformance should be performed. (14.30)\n\nBatches that have been reworked should be subjected to appropriate evaluation, testing, stability testing if warranted, and documentation to show that the reworked product is of equivalent quality to that produced by the original process. Concurrent validation is often the appropriate validation approach for rework procedures. This allows a protocol to define the rework procedure, how it will be carried out, and the expected results. If there is only one batch to be reworked, a report can be written and the batch released once it is found to be acceptable. (14.31)\n\nProcedures should provide for comparing the impurity profile of each reworked batch against batches manufactured by the established process. Where routine analytical methods are inadequate to characterize the reworked batch, additional methods should be used. (14.32)\n\nRecovery of Materials and Solvents (14.4)\n\nRecovery (e.g., from mother liquor or filtrates) of reactants, intermediates, or the API is considered acceptable, provided that approved procedures exist for the recovery and the recovered materials meet specifications suitable for their intended use. (14.40)\n\nSolvents can be recovered and reused in the same processes or in different processes, provided that the recovery procedures are controlled and monitored to ensure that solvents meet appropriate standards before reuse or commingling with other approved materials. (14.41)\n\nFresh and recovered solvents and reagents can be combined if adequate testing has shown their suitability for all manufacturing processes in which they may be used. (14.42)\n\nThe use of recovered solvents, mother liquors, and other recovered materials should be adequately documented. (14.43)\n\nReturns (14.5)\n\nReturned intermediates or APIs should be identified as such and quarantined. (14.50)\n\n11.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the conditions under which returned intermediates or APIs have been stored or shipped before or during their return or the condition of their containers casts doubt on their quality, the returned intermediates or APIs should be reprocessed, reworked, or destroyed, as appropriate. (14.51)\n\nRecords of returned intermediates or APIs should be maintained. For each return, documentation should include the following: (14.52)\n\nName and address of the consignee\n\nIntermediate or API, batch number, and quantity returned\n\nReason for return\n\nUse or disposal of the returned intermediate or API\n\nXv. Complaints and Recalls (15)\n\nAll quality-related complaints, whether received orally or in writing, should be recorded and investigated according to a written procedure. (15.10)\n\nComplaint records should include the following: (15.11)\n\nName and address of complainant\n\nName (and, where appropriate, title) and phone number of person submitting the complaint\n\nComplaint nature (including name and batch number of the API)\n\nDate complaint is received\n\nAction initially taken (including dates and identity of person taking the action);\n\nAny follow-up action taken\n\nResponse provided to the originator of complaint (including date response sent)\n\nFinal decision on intermediate or API batch or lot\n\nRecords of complaints should be retained to evaluate trends, product-related frequencies, and severity with a view to taking additional, and if appropriate, immediate corrective action. (15.12)\n\nThere should be a written procedure that defines the circumstances under which a recall of an intermediate or API should be considered. (15.13)\n\nThe recall procedure should designate who should be involved in evaluating the information, how a recall should be initiated, who should be informed about the recall, and how the recalled material should be treated. (15.14)\n\nIn the event of a serious or potentially life-threatening situation, local, national, and/or international authorities should be informed and their advice sought. (15.15)\n\nXvi Contract Manufacturers (Including Laboratories) (16)\n\nAll contract manufacturers (including laboratories) should comply with the GMP defined in this guidance. Special consideration should be given to the prevention of cross-contamination and to maintaining traceability. (16.10)\n\nCompanies should evaluate any contractors (including laboratories) to ensure GMP compliance of the specific operations occurring at the contractor sites. (16.11)\n\nThere should be a written and approved contract or formal agreement between a company and its contractors that defines in detail the GMP responsibilities, including the quality measures, of each party. (16.12)\n\nA contract should permit a company to audit its contractor's facilities for compliance with GMP. (16.13)\n\nWhere subcontracting is allowed, a contractor should not pass to a third party any of the work entrusted to it under the contract without the company's prior evaluation and approval of the arrangements. (16.14)\n\nManufacturing and laboratory records should be kept at the site where the activity occurs and be readily available. (16.15)\n\nChanges in the process, equipment, test methods, specifications, or other contractual requirements should not be made unless the contract given is informed and approves the changes. (16.16)\n\nXvii Agents, Brokers, Traders, Distributors, Repackers, and Relabellers (17)\n\nApplicability (17.1)\n\nThis section applies to any party other than the original manufacturer who may trade and/or take possession, repack, relabel, manipulate, distribute, or store an API or intermediate. (17.10)\n\nAll agents, brokers, traders, distributors, repackers, and relabelers should comply with GMP as defined in this guidance. (17.11)\n\nTraceability of Distributed APIs and Intermediates (17.2)\n\nAgents, brokers, traders, distributors, repackers, or relabelers should maintain complete traceability of APIs and intermediates that they distribute.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?\n--------------------\nContext: Generally, if studies using a proposed new animal drug product\'s final formulation are not available for inclusion in the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable), this will limit the applicability of the information.29 The acceptability of published studies will depend on the complexity of the formulation, how much control the sponsor had over the manufacturing process, etc. CVM will evaluate the drug product used in each published study included in the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable) using information on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and physical form. The level of documentation and known information is usually not the same as what is included in a single adequate and well-controlled study submitted to CVM with raw data. However, the assessment of how much a formulation and other critical quality attributes can deviate from the proposed/final formulation is generally the same regardless of the type of study (SRMA or single prospectively designed study). Footnote 29: Formulation changes to a drug product may occur over time and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine their potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug as these factors relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug. These principles are discussed in more detail in Guidance for Industry #83, “Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved NADA or ANADA” (May 2007). In some cases, studies will be necessary to establish the equivalence of different formulations (e.g., pharmacokinetic studies, and/or clinical studies as appropriate).\n\nAs noted in section III.B.3. Critical Factors, literature using the proposed final formulation manufactured by or for the sponsor provides the best, most rigorous evaluation and the highest evidentiary weight. If a sufficient number of studies using an acceptable formulation are not available or a connection to information found in the CMC technical section cannot be made, the SR approach will be unlikely to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness. Footnote 29: The sponsor should provide CVM with an assessment of the information, a meaningful evaluation of the new animal drug used in the publishedreport included in the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable) and a justification that it is appropriate to use the data generated in the study along with other studies in the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable). The decision about the value of the information from the published studies to the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable) will be made with the collaboration of ONADE\'s Division of Manufacturing Technologies and the target animal review team.\n\nAdequate and well-controlled studies, including SRs, include the use of methods to assess the animal response to the use of the new animal drug that are well defined and reliable (21 CFR 514.117(b)(8)). Sponsors should consider whether there are a sufficient number of studies which report the appropriate endpoint(s) in a consistent manner which would allow for quantification of the effect of the new animal drug.\n\nProtocol considerations specific to effectiveness:\n\nReview question: The review question should closely match the objectives of the study and follow the format described in section III.B.3.b.i. Developing the Review Question of this guidance. In general, effectiveness study review questions follow the format: ""Evaluation of the effectiveness of [drug product and dose if appropriate] for [indication] as compared to [control type] in [species/class/animal age as appropriate].""\n\nDefinition of the control: Please refer to section III.B.3.b.ii. Writing the protocol (Control Type).\n\nInclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Examples of screening inclusion/exclusion criteria which may be assessed based on the title, abstract, and/or key words include:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\nScreening Inclusion & Screening Exclusion \\ \\hline Study types: Complete reports (published or unpublished) on & Incomplete reports (abstracts and \\ randomized controlled trials (RCTs), & reviews), or insufficient information \\ cluster RCTs, and select non- & to assess these criteria (incomplete \\ randomized controlled studies & reports may not be excluded if full \\  & information could be obtained from \\  & the study investigator) \\ \\hline Study includes intended target animal & Study includes animals that are not \\ species and class & representative of the target animal \\  & species and class \\ \\hline Use of the drug product of interest (at & Drug product of interest not a part \\ screening phase, identification of & of the study \\ active ingredient may be sufficient) & \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nExamples of eligibility inclusion/exclusion criteria based on assessment of the full text of the publication:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\nEligibility Inclusion & Eligibility Exclusion \\ \\hline Drug product as defined in the protocol & Study does not include drug product \\  & as defined in protocol, or \\  & publication does not provide \\  & sufficient information to identify \\  & the drug product (unable to confirm \\  & formulation used in the study) \\ \\hline Study uses intended label dosage (dose,  frequency, and route of administration) & Dosage used in study inconsistent \\  & with the intended label dosage \\ \\hline Study includes the use of acceptable & Study includes the use of \\   concurrent therapies (e.g., the studies & concurrent therapy that may \\   may employ concurrent therapies per & confound the effectiveness \\   the current standards of care; however, & evaluation \\   these considerations should be & \\   described clearly within the protocol.) & \\ \\hline Study designed to evaluate endpoint(s) & Study not designed to evaluate \\   of interest & endpoint(s) of interest \\ \\hline Screening and eligibility inclusion and exclusion criteria should only evaluate & whether the measurement of an effectiveness outcome is present and should \\   not specify a particular effectiveness outcome for inclusion in the & \\   effectiveness database. For example, studies that do not demonstrate the & \\   desired level of effect or that report a poor effectiveness outcome should not & \\   be excluded from the effectiveness database. & \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n* Basis of study conclusion: The protocol should clearly state the criteria on which study conclusions will be based. The study objectives and the statistical analysis results should be considered when defining the criteria. For example, a threshold for an effect size or a threshold for the limits of a confidence interval for the effect size could be used as criterion. In addition, the study conclusion should also consider bias investigation results.\n\n4 Reasonable Expectation of Effectiveness\n\nSection 571 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360ccc) provides for a qualified approval pathway, open only to certain qualifying new animal drug products based on indication and type, called conditional approval. Conditional approval allows a sponsor to legally market a new animal drug after demonstrating the drug is safe and manufactured in accordance with the full approval standards, and that there is a reasonable expectation of effectiveness. To obtain conditional approval, all technical sections must be complete except the effectiveness technical section, which isreplaced with RXE. The sponsor can market the conditionally approved new animal drug product for up to 5 years while gathering the remaining data required to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness. The pathway requires annual renewal of the conditional approval to determine whether the sponsor is making sufficient progress toward meeting the effectiveness standard for full approval. Literature may be used as one of the pathways to support RXE. Screening and eligibility criteria for publications that may be used to support RXE are generally the same as for substantial evidence of effectiveness; however, the overall body of evidence may be smaller and information gaps may still be present. Full scoping or systematic literature reviews are not routinely expected but may be appropriate.\n\nAppendix E Target Animal Safety\n\n1. Scope of Use\n\nSection 512 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360b) establishes the requirements for new animal drug approval, including target animal safety. See FD&C Act section 512(d)(1)(A), (B), and (D) (21 U.S.C. 360b(d)(1)(A), (B), and (D)).\n\nLiterature, including narrative reviews, SR, and meta-analysis, may be acceptable to fulfill all or part of the requirements for target animal safety for a new animal drug application or an application for conditional approval (see FD&C Act section 571(a)(2)(B)). Literature is most commonly used to evaluate the extent and quality of information available on the safety of a new animal drug for the proposed indication or proposed conditions of use, support the design of the target animal safety evaluation, and/or provide information to predict potential adverse effects in the target species. In some cases, literature may provide all or a portion of the information required to demonstrate whether a new animal drug is safe for the intended use and conditions of use.\n\nCVM encourages sponsors to request meetings early in the development plan to discuss options for presenting the available information, designing protocols, and determining viability of using literature to fulfill some or all of the target animal safety requirements.\n\nAppendix B Preliminary Information\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #106 The Use of Published Literature in Support of New Animal Drug Approvals'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to applicants on preparing and using comparability protocols for postapproval changes in chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC). The guidance applies to comparability protocols that would be submitted in new animal drug applications (NADAs), abbreviated new animal drug applications (ANADAs), or supplements to these applications. Well-characterized synthetic peptides submitted in these applications are included within the scope of this guidance. This guidance also applies to comparability protocols submitted in investigational new animal drug (INAD), generic investigational new animal drug (JINAD) and veterinary master file (VMF) submissions that are referenced in applications. The FDA is providing this guidance in response to requests from those interested in using comparability protocols.\n\nFDA guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nAs an applicant, you are responsible for assessing, prior to distribution of a product, the effect of any postapproval CMC changes on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the product as these factors relate to the safety or efficacy of the product (section 506A(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act)). Such an assessment often includes demonstration that the pre- and postchange products (i.e., products manufactured prior to and subsequent to a change) are equivalent. Postapproval CMC changes must be reported to FDA in one of four reporting categories (Section 506A of the Act):* Annual Report (AR)1\n\nFootnote 1: The annual report is the Minor Changes and Stability Report (MCSR) according to 21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iii).\n\nThe annual submission to the approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having minimal potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product.\n\nChange-Being-Efficected Supplement (CBE)\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having moderate potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A CBE supplement must be received by FDA before or concurrently with distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nChange-Being-Efficed-in-30-Days Supplement (CBE-30).\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having moderate potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A CBE-30 supplement must be received by FDA at least 30 days before distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nPrior Approval Supplement (PAS)\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having a substantial potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A PAS supplement must be received and approved by FDA prior to distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nIn many cases, using a comparability protocol will facilitate the subsequent implementation and reporting of CMC changes, which could result in moving a product into distribution sooner than if a protocol was not used.\n\nThis guidance describes the general principles and procedures associated with developing and submitting a comparability protocol to the FDA. The guidance also describes the basic elements of a comparability protocol and specific issues to consider when developing comparability protocols for changes in:* the manufacturing process\n* analytical procedures2\n* manufacturing equipment\n* manufacturing facilities\n* container closure systems\n* process analytical technology (PAT)\n\nFootnote 2: The term analytical procedure, as used in this guidance, includes chemical, physical, microbiological, and biological test procedures.\n\nThe guidance also discusses submitting comparability protocols as investigational new animal drug submissions, generic investigational new animal drug submissions and veterinary master file submissions.\n\nAppendix A What is a Comparability Protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?\n--------------------\nContext: Recommendations for executed (completed) batch records are provided in CVM guidance for industry [42]: Animal Drug Manufacturing Guidelines-Series of Four Guidelines (1994). CVM encourages the submission of executed batch records for lots of drug substance and drug product used in support of the application as they provide valuable detail and insight into the manufacturing process and proposed controls.\n\na.1.1 Pharmaceutical Development Reports\n\nSponsors are encouraged to provide pharmaceutical development reports (PDRs) that describe the scientific rationale for the chosen manufacturing process(es) and controls for fermentation-derived intermediates, drug substances, and related drug products. A sponsor's ability to demonstrate process understanding can be factored into CVM's risk-based decision making (e.g., Pre-Approval Inspection Decision Support System (PAIDSS)). Suggestions for PDRs can be found in ICH Q8: Pharmaceutical Development.\n\na.1.2 Cell Growth (Propagation) and Harvest\n\nA description should be provided that includes a flow diagram illustrating each step in propagation from the original inoculum (e.g., cells from one or more vials of the working cell bank) through the last harvesting operation.\n\nAll steps should be included along with the relevant information, such as the growth conditions and in-process tests performed (e.g., cell concentrations, volumes, pH, cultivation times, temperatures).\n\nCritical steps and intermediates for which specifications are established should be identified, along with sampling plans and testing time points.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe flow diagram can be supplemented with information presented in tabular form, if appropriate.\n\nA narrative describing each manufacturing step in the process should accompany the flow diagram:\n\nIdentify all process controls and the associated numeric ranges, limits, or acceptance criteria\n\nHighlight any process controls that are considered critical\n\nIdentify the intended scale of the process. The amounts indicated should be representative of a maximum-sized production batch.\n\nWe recommend the following be included in the narrative:\n\nA description of the major equipment involved in each step\n\nA description of inoculation and each step in propagation with growth conditions specified\n\nThe composition of the media used at each step, including water quality and additives used\n\nThe sterilization procedures for media (e.g. a batch sterilization process or continuous system)\n\nThe equipment (e.g. fermentation vessel), feeds, and other materials added during the fermentation process\n\nProcess parameters monitored and controls for critical steps and intermediates\n\nProcedures used to transfer material between steps\n\nProcedures used to minimize contamination by adventitious agents\n\nProcess controls to confirm the effectiveness of the specific manufacturing steps used to inactivate and or remove adventitious agents\n\nCriteria for harvesting\n\nCriteria for rejecting/accepting a fermentation batch if contamination occurs\n\nThe determination of yields\n\nCriteria for pooling more than one harvest, if applicable\n\nStorage conditions and time limits if the harvested crude fermentation product is held prior to further processing\n\n3. Purification and Downstream Processing\n\nThe description should include a flow diagram that illustrates and a narrative that describes all the steps involved in isolating and purifying the crude fermentation product to its final form, along with any relevant information (e.g., volumes, pH, temperatures, holding times). Critical steps and intermediates for which specifications are established should be identified, along with testing time points.\n\nThe narrative describing each manufacturing step should accompany the flow diagram and should identify all process controls and the associated numeric ranges, limits, or acceptance criteria and include the following:\n\nMethods used in purification or separation of the crude fermentation product (e.g. precipitation, centrifugation, filtration) including major equipment (e.g. columns, membranes* Process parameters monitored\n\nThe in-process controls and analytical tests used to show identity, purity, and concentration and to evaluate levels of process- and product-related impurities\n\nThe determination of yields\n\nPrecautions taken to prevent or control microbial contamination during purification\n\nConditions for reuse and/or procedures for regeneration of columns, membranes, and adsorbents\n\nStorage conditions and time limits, if the purified fermentation product is held prior to further processing\n\n4. Modification Reactions (If Applicable)\n\nChemical Modifications\n\nWhen a product of fermentation is to be subjected to further molecular change through chemical means, a description of the synthetic steps should be included in the procedural narrative.\n\nAdditionally, a flow diagram of the synthetic process should be provided. For more details, see CVM guidance for industry 169: Drug Substance: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\nEnzymatic Modifications\n\nWhen the fermentation product is further modified using enzyme catalysts, the steps should be included in the flow diagram and detailed in the procedural narrative. Enzymatic reactions are considered chemical reactions since the conversion of substrate product involves breaking and forming chemical bonds. Thus, much of the information submitted in the manufacturing description should be the same as that submitted for chemical processes (drug substance).\n\nHowever, because enzymatic functionality requires carefully controlled conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, osmolarity), the description should contain detailed information on reaction controls and the optimum range of operation. Furthermore, the biological source of the enzyme should be provided along with a description of the enzyme's preparation and information about its purity.\n\n5. Reprocessing, Reworking, Recycling, Regeneration, and Salvaging\n\nWhen appropriate, reprocessing, reworking, recycling, regeneration, and salvaging operations should be described. For more detail, see CVM guidance for industry 169: Drug Substance: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\nAppendix C Control of Materials\n\nA list of materials used in the manufacture of fermentation-derived intermediates, drug substances, and drug products should be provided (i.e., the microorganism, cell bank system, media components, solvents, reagents, auxiliary materials). Information pertaining to the quality and control of these materials should also be provided.\n\n1. _Microorganism_Information about the microorganism used for production (i.e., genus, species, and type strain) and known genotypic and phenotypic characteristics should be provided. Additionally, the origin of the source material (or isolate) should be identified or described.\n\n2. Cell Bank System a. Master Cell Bank\n\nA brief description of the procedures used to generate the master cell bank (MCB) and the criteria used for qualification should be provided. The information should include:\n\nMethod, reagents, and media used in preparation\n\nDate of preparation\n\nProcess controls\n\nStorage conditions\n\nProcedures used in testing for relevant phenotypic and genotypic markers and determining culture purity\n\nProcedures used to ensure the absence of contamination from adventitious agents (e.g., microbial contamination and cross-contamination by other cell types) with tests and acceptance criteria specified\n\nb. Working Cell Bank\n\nPreservation of the microbial purity of the MCB is an important factor in maintaining the production strain. Often a working cell bank (WCB) is created so that the MCB will be less likely to be compromised. Creation of a WCB occurs via the propagation of the MCB through defined culture conditions, and then aliquots of the resultant homogenous culture suspension are partitioned into individual storage containers of appropriate size for routine production purposes.\n\nA brief description of the procedures used to derive a WCB from the MCB and the criteria used for qualification should be provided. Information similar to that submitted for the MCB should also be submitted for the WCB.\n\n3. Media Components\n\nA list of the media components used at each stage of the fermentation process should be included in the submission. Specifications should be provided for each component for verification that the material is of suitable quality for its intended purpose.\n\nIf ruminant-based media components are used in the fermentation process, they should comply with the proposed BSE Medical Products Rule, issued on January 12, 2007 (72 FR 1582).\n\nAll animal-derived components should be identified and appropriate mitigation steps taken to prevent the transmission of adventitious agents.\n\n4. Solvents, Reagents, Auxiliary Materials\n\nA list of solvents, reagents, and other auxiliary materials used in the fermentation process should be provided. Specifications for each material should be included for verification that the material is of suitable quality for its intended purpose. When water is used in the process, it should be of an appropriate quality for its intended use.\n\nControl of Critical Steps and Intermediates\n\nAll critical process controls and their associated numeric ranges, limits, or acceptance criteria should be identified and justified and a brief description of the test provided. Furthermore, any experimental data to support the justification should be included.\n\nGood controls are essential during fermentation to ensure product consistency.\n\nEnd product testing alone is not adequate for demonstrating a fermentation process is under control.\n\nManufacturing processes, including fermentation, should be controlled to ensure that the product meets previously identified quality attributes.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #216 Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) Information - Fermentation-Derived Intermediates, Drug Substances, and Related Drug Products for Veterinary Medicinal Use""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?\n--------------------\nContext: Demonstration of state of control with the modified/changed manufacturing process might include, but is not limited to, such items as:\n\nEstablishment of modified specifications for raw, source and starting materials, and reagents;\n\nAppropriate bioburden and/or viral safety testing of the postchange cell banks and cells at the limit of in vitro cell age for production;\n\nAdventitious agent clearance;\n\nRemoval of product- or process-related impurities, such as residual host cell DNA and proteins; and\n\nMaintenance of the purity level.\n\nFor approved products, an appropriate number of postchange batches should be analyzed to demonstrate consistent performance of the process.\n\nTo support the analysis of the changes and the control strategy, the manufacturer should prepare a description of the change that summarizes the prechange and the postchange manufacturing process and that clearly highlights modifications of the process and changes in controls in a side-by-side format.\n\nDemonstration of Comparability During Development (2.4)\n\nDuring product development, it is expected that multiple changes in the manufacturing process will occur that could impact drug product quality, safety, and efficacy. Comparability exercises are generally performed to demonstrate that nonclinical and clinical data generated with prechange product are applicable to postchange product in order to facilitate further development and, ultimately, to support the marketing authorization. Comparability studies conducted for products in development are influenced by factors such as the stage of product development, the availability of validated analytical procedures, and the extent of product and process knowledge, which are limited at times due to the available experience that the manufacturer has with the process.\n\nWhere changes are introduced in development before nonclinical studies, the issue of assessing comparability is not generally raised because the manufacturer subsequently conducts\n\nnonclinical and clinical studies using the postchange product as part of the development process. During early phases of nonclinical and clinical studies, comparability testing is generally not as extensive as for an approved product. As knowledge and information accumulate, and the analytical tools develop, the comparability exercise should utilize available information and will generally become more comprehensive. Where process changes are introduced in late stages of development and no additional clinical studies are planned to support the marketing\n\nauthorization, the comparability exercise should be as comprehensive and thorough as one\n\nconducted for an approved product. Some outcomes of the comparability studies on quality attributes can lead to additional nonclinical or clinical studies.\n\nIn order for a comparability exercise to occur during development, appropriate assessment tools should be used. Analytical procedures used during development might not be validated, but should always be scientifically sound and provide results that are reliable and reproducible. Due to the limitations of the analytical tools in early clinical development, physicochemical and biological tests alone might be considered inadequate to determine comparability; therefore, bridging nonclinical and/or clinical studies, as appropriate, might be needed.\n\nNonclinical and Clinical Considerations (2.5)\n\n2.5.1 Factors To Be Considered in Planning Nonclinical and Clinical Studies (2.5.1)\n\nDeterminations of product comparability can be based solely on quality considerations (see section 2.2) if the manufacturer can provide assurance of comparability through analytical studies as suggested in this document. Additional evidence from nonclinical or clinical studies is considered appropriate when quality data are insufficient to establish comparability. The extent and nature of nonclinical and clinical studies will be determined on a case-by-case basis in consideration of various factors, which include among others:\n\nQuality findings\n\nDrug product -- The type, nature, and extent of differences between the postchange product and the prechange product with respect to quality attributes including product-related substances, the impurity profile, stability, and excipients. For example, new impurities could warrant toxicological studies for qualification;\n\nResults of the evaluation/validation studies on the new process including the results of relevant in-process tests;\n\nAvailability, capabilities, and limitations of tests used for any comparability studies.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe nature and the level of knowledge of the product\n\nProduct complexity, including heterogeneity and higher order structure -- Physicochemical and in vitro biological assays might not be able to detect all differences in structure and/or function;\n\nStructure-activity relationship and strength of the association of quality attributes with safety and efficacy;\n\nRelationship between the therapeutic protein and endogenous proteins and the consequences for immunogenicity;\n\nMode(s) of action (unknown vs. known, single vs. multiple active sites).\n\nExisting nonclinical and clinical data relevant to the product, aspects of product use, and product class\n\nTherapeutic indications/target patient groups -- The impact of possible differences can vary between patient groups, e.g., risk for unintended immunogenicity. It may be appropriate to consider the consequences separately for each indication;\n\nPosology, e.g., dosing regimen, route of administration -- The risk of certain possible consequences of a difference, such as immunogenicity, could be higher with chronic administration as compared to short-term administration; subcutaneous administration might induce immunogenicity more often than intravenous administration;\n\nThe therapeutic window/dose-response curve -- The impact of a certain change could be different for products that have a wide therapeutic window as compared to those with a more narrow window. The safety or efficacy of products with a steep or a bell-shaped dose-response curve can be affected by minor changes in pharmacokinetics or receptor-binding;\n\nPrevious experience, e.g., immunogenicity, safety -- The experience with the original product or with other products in the same class can be relevant, especially with regard to rare adverse effects, e.g., knowledge about the consequences of immunogenicity;\n\nPharmacokine (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) relation, distribution, clearance.\n\n2.2.2 Type of Studies (2.5.2)\n\nThe nonclinical and clinical studies referred to in this document might include, depending on the situation, PK studies, PD studies, PK/PD studies, clinical efficacy studies, specific safety studies, immunogenicity studies, and pharmacovigilance studies. The purpose of these studies is to enable comparison of pre- and postchange product. Where appropriate, these studies should be direct comparative studies.\n\nGLOSSARY (3)\n\nComparability Bridging Study: A study performed to provide nonclinical or clinical data that allows extrapolation of the existing data from the drug product produced by the current process to the drug product from the changed process.\n\nComparable: A conclusion that products have highly similar quality attributes before and after manufacturing process changes and that no adverse impact on the safety or efficacy, including immunogenicity, of the drug product occurred.

61,"Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?","['--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: No, heroic measures need not be taken. Storage conditions should be consistent with the knowledge of the stability of the mixture under conditions of use and reasonable so as not to permit accelerated decomposition.\n\nWhat are the details of the Agency\'s reserve sample retention policy?\n\nWith regard to reserve sample retention, the GLPs provide as follows:\n\nReserve samples are to be retained from each batch of test and control article prepared in accord with section 58.105(a) for all nonclinical laboratory studies lasting more than 4 weeks. For the purposes of these sections, the 4-week period includes initial dosing to the final in vivo observations. Only sufficient sample need be retained to permit meaningful reanalysis. The samples need be retained either for the terms specified in section 58.105 or for the useful life of the sample (dependent on the stability or the quality of the sample) whichever is shorter. Storage conditions should be those commonly accepted as minimizing the deterioration of sample quality and need not require exhaustive study to determine those which maximize stability. All batches of test and control article mixtures are to be retained even if they are prepared daily.\n\nFor medical devices, how can stability be demonstrated any more effectively than by the continued functioning of a device within specifications during an in vivo nonclinical study?\n\nThe stated procedure is acceptable.\n\nThe cost of chemical assay development and assay of dosage forms prior to conducting acute studies far exceeds the cost of doing the experiment. Will data confirming the weighing, mixing and administration of the test article be considered sufficient?\n\nNo. The test article must be sufficiently characterized to ensure that the same article is used in any further studies.\n\nDoes FDA expect a firm to conduct long-term stability tests on test article-carrier mixtures, which are used within a day of preparation?\n\nThe firm must determine the stability of the mixtures over the period of their use. The GLPs require retention of samples of all batches of test article-carrier mixtures for studies that last longer than 4 weeks. The regulations do not require stability studies on such samples. Samples placed in storage may be analyzed periodically to determine their useful storage life.\n\nAm I correct in assuming that the chemical testing done by the sponsor to characterize the test article is not covered by the GLPs when the test article is subsequently submitted to a contract laboratory as a blind sample for safety testing?\n\nThe GLPs do not cover the basic exploratory chemical tests done to derive the specifications of the test article. They do cover those chemical tests done on discrete batches of test article to determine identity, strength, purity and composition.\n\nDoes the phrase ""mixtures of articles and carriers"" also refer to solutions and suspensions, e.g., a solution of a test article in distilled water?\n\nYes.\n\nFor acute studies, is it necessary for the laboratory to analyze each batch of test article-carrier mixture prior to dosing the test system?\n\nNo. Uniformity of the mixture must be known and periodic batch analyses need to be done.\n\nWill dialogues such as this and recent inspectional experience bring about substantive changes in the final regulations through FDA initiated proposed amendments? Whatchanges are anticipated in the reserve sample retention requirements?\n\nThe Agency does not believe the initiative to change the GLPs rests with FDA. Petitions for change may be submitted to the Agency in accord with the 21 CFR 10.30. As was mentioned at the meeting, the Agency recognizes that the reserve sample retention requirements are extensive and expensive and a petition for change would be considered.\n10. What guidelines can be used by a laboratory or sponsor in deciding how frequently concentration analyses should be made?\n\nThe Agency has not established guidelines with regard to the frequency of periodic reanalysis of test article-carrier mixtures. Enough batches should be analyzed to assure that the test systems are being exposed to the quantities of test article in the specified protocol.\n11. How long must one retain samples of feed used in nonclinical laboratory studies and should they be frozen?\n\nThe sample retention period differs for the various regulated products and the periods are listed in section 58.195. Feed samples need not be frozen for storage.\n12. What is the definition of carrier?\n\nCarrier is the material with which the test article is mixed for administration to the test system. It can be feed, water, solvents and excipients depending on dosage form and route of administration.\n13. Once stability of a given concentration of a test article-carrier mixture is substantiated, is it necessary to establish a stability profile for each batch at that concentration?\n\nNo. Stability need be determined only on a single batch of test article-carrier mixture; however, periodic reanalysis to determine concentration must be done.\n14. In the course of a 14-C tissue residue study in the target animal, is it necessary to retain:\n\nAll samples listed in a - d and f above should be retained for the term listed in section 58.195.\n\na. sample of the 14-C labeled drug,\n\nb. samples of the diet fed control and experimental animals,\n\nc. samples of urine and feces after completion of the analyses,d. samples of collected tissues after completion of the analyses, e. if they must be retained, for how long? f. is similar sample retention necessary when doing ""cold"" tissue residue studies in target animals?\n15. If a battery of different tests on a substance is being conducted by different contractors, is it necessary to run replicate stability analyses from each and every contractor especially when long-term stability has been documented for the substance?\n\nNo. Once stability has been determined in accord with good science, it is not necessary to continually replicate the stability determination.\n\n58.120 Protocol\n\n58.130 Conduct of a Nonclinical Laboratory Study\n\nIn as much as only wet tissues, blocks and slides are necessary to reconstruct the histopathologic aspects of a study by a third party, are written notes, tapes, etc. of the histopathological\'s thought process in arriving at a final report legitimately considered ""raw data"" in the presence of a signed and dated final report? Does the Agency have the right to inspect the written notes from the pathologist?\n\nRaw data in this case, refers only to the signed and dated final report of the pathologist. Agency investigators may wish to examine the interim notes and reports in an attempt to reconstruct the study but not to second-guess the scientific process used to arrive at the final report. The GLPs do not require that these interim reports and notes be retained.\n2. What is considered to be raw data in computer systems when the data is generated from dictated results?\n\nTranscribed dictation, which has been proofread and corrected for typographical -and transcription errors, is raw data.\n3. Do the GLPs require that the protocol be amended to reflect the actual starting date of the study?\n\nYes, this is a critical piece of information, which should be supplied by way of a formal protocol amendment.\n\nIt is said that raw data may be any verified exact copy of the original data. In a computerized data system where data is put directly on disc thence to tape, what documentation of the program performing this transfer is required to assure that the tape copy is exact? The standard operating procedures, which cover computer operations, should describe the computer program and the procedure used to assure the production of an exact tape copy.\n\nIf reformatting of data is done as part of the transfer described in question 4 above, is the new file not raw data even if all data is transferred intact although in a different organization? The Agency can not precisely answer this question without further details of the new data format.\n\nAre initials and dates on data printouts (e.g., scintillation counters, gas chromatographs), when these printouts include standards, sufficient documentation for standardization? Yes.\n\nIs there a time limit for submission of the final report of a nonclinical laboratory study after its conclusion? Generally no. On occasion, for marketed products, the Agency may establish time frames for study conduct. Of course alarming findings on marketed products should be reported as soon as possible.\n\nIs it permissible to list changes in a final report on a page, which is appended, to the original final report? Yes.\n\nDoes ""studies in progress on June 20, 1979"" refer to the phase of dosing of the test system or the phase post-dosing but not yet reported? The quotation pertains to all studies for which the final report has not yet been completed. Included are all post-dosing phases.\n\nThe final report requires a list of participants. Should this include technicians as well as people who perform support functions?The final report should include the name of the study director, the names of other scientists or professionals, and the names of all supervisory personnel involved in the study.\n\nWhen an analysis protocol is developed for the first time by using standard scientific technique, who shall validate the protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: It is important that the CGMP regulations are harmonized to the extent possible with other widely used quality management systems, including ISO 9000, non-U.S. pharmaceutical quality management requirements, and FDA's own medical device quality system regulations. This guidance serves as a first step to highlight common elements between the CGMP regulations and Quality Management Systems. With the globalization of pharmaceutical manufacturing and the increasing prevalence of drug- and biologic-device combination products, the convergence of quality management principles across different regions and among various product types is very desirable.\n\nThe FDA has concluded that modern quality systems, when coupled with manufacturing process and product knowledge and the use of effective risk management practices, can handle many types of changes to facilities, equipment, and processes without the need for prior approval regulatory submissions. Manufacturers with a robust quality system and appropriate process knowledge can implement many types of improvements. In addition, an effective quality system, by lowering the risk of manufacturing problems, may result in shorter and fewer FDA inspections.\n\nA quality system can provide the necessary framework for implementing quality by design4 (building in quality from the development phase and throughout a product's life cycle), continual improvement, and risk management in the drug manufacturing process. A quality system adopted by a manufacturer can be tailored to fit the specific environment, taking into account factors such as scope of operations, complexity of processes, and appropriate use of finite resources. Footnote 4: See ICH Q8 Pharmaceutical Development.\n\nScope of the Guidance\n\nThis guidance applies to manufacturers of drug products (finished pharmaceuticals), including products regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). It may also be useful to manufacturers of components (including active pharmaceutical ingredients) used in the manufacture of these products.\n\nThis document is not intended to create new requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturing that go beyond those established in the current regulations, nor is the guidance intended to be a guide for the conduct of FDA inspections. Rather, the document explains how implementing comprehensive quality systems can help manufacturers achieve compliance with 21 CFR parts210 and 211. Although the QS working group found that many of the quality system elements correlate with specific CGMP requirements, some do not. The Agency expects compliance with CGMP regulations, and FDA's inspection program will remain focused on compliance with those regulations.\n\nOrganization of this Guidance\n\nTo provide a reference familiar to industry, the quality systems model described in section IV of this guidance is organized -- in its major sections -- according to the structure of international quality standards. Major sections of the model include the following:\n\nManagement Responsibilities\n\nResources\n\nManufacturing Operations\n\nEvaluation Activities\n\nUnder each of these sections the key elements found in modern quality systems are discussed. When an element correlates with a CGMP regulatory requirement, that correlation is noted. In some cases, a specific CGMP regulation is discussed in more detail as it relates to a quality system element. At the end of each section, a table is included listing the quality system elements of that section and the specific CGMP regulations with which they correlate. A glossary is included at the end of the document.\n\nIII CGMPS and the Concepts of Modern Quality Systems\n\nSeveral key concepts are critical for any discussion of modern quality systems. The following concepts are used throughout this guidance as they relate to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.\n\nQuality\n\nEvery pharmaceutical product has established identity, strength, purity, and other quality characteristics designed to ensure the required levels of safety and effectiveness. For the purposes of this guidance document, the phrase achieving quality means achieving these characteristics for a product.\n\nQuality by Design and Product Development\n\nQuality by design means designing and developing a product and associated manufacturing processes that will be used during product development to ensure that the product consistently attains a predefined quality at the end of the manufacturing process.5 Quality by design, in conjunction with a quality system, provides a sound framework for the transfer of product knowledge and process understanding from drug development to the commercial manufacturing processes and for post-development changes and optimization. The CGMP regulations, when viewed in their entirety, incorporate the concept of quality by design. This guidance describes how these elements fit together.\n\nAppendix C Quality Risk Management\n\nQuality risk management is a valuable component of an effective quality systems framework.6 Quality risk management can, for example, help guide the setting of specifications and process parameters for drug manufacturing, assess and mitigate the risk of changing a process or specification, and determine the extent of discrepancy investigations and corrective actions.\n\nFootnote 6: See ICH Q9 Quality Risk Management.\n\nCAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action)\n\nCAPA is a well-known CGMP regulatory concept that focuses on investigating, understanding, and correcting discrepancies while attempting to prevent their recurrence. Quality system models discuss CAPA as three separate concepts, all of which are used in this guidance.\n\nRemedial corrections of an identified problem\n\nRoot cause analysis with corrective action to help understand the cause of the deviation and potentially prevent recurrence of a similar problem\n\nPreventive action to avert recurrence of a similar potential problem\n\nChange Control\n\nChange control is another well-known CGMP concept that focuses on managing change to prevent unintended consequences. The CGMP regulations provide for change control primarily through the assigned responsibilities of the quality control unit. Certain major manufacturing changes (e.g., changes that alter specifications, a critical product attribute or bioavailability) require regulatory filings and prior regulatory approval (21 CFR 314.70, 514.8, and 601.12).\n\nEffective change control activities (e.g., quality planning and control of revisions to specifications, process parameters, procedures) are key components of any quality system. In this guidance, change is discussed in terms of creating a regulatory environment that encourages change towards continual improvement. This means a manufacturer is empowered to make changes subject to the regulations based on the variability of materials used in manufacturing and process improvements resulting from knowledge gained during a product's lifecycle.\n\nAppendix F The Quality Unit\n\nMany of the modern quality system concepts described here correlate very closely with the CGMP regulations (refer to the charts later in the document). Current industry practice generally divides the responsibilities of the quality control unit (QCU), as defined in the CGMP regulations, between quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) functions.\n\nQC usually involves (1) assessing the suitability of incoming components, containers, closures, labeling, in-process materials, and the finished products; (2) evaluating the performance of the manufacturing process to ensure adherence to proper specifications and limits; and (3) determining the acceptability of each batch for release.\n\nQA primarily involves (1) review and approval of all procedures related to production and maintenance, (2) review of associated records, and (3) auditing and performing/evaluating trend analyses.\n\nThis guidance uses the term quality unit7 (QU) to reflect modern practice while remaining consistent with the CGMP definition in SS 210.3(b)(15). The concept of a quality unit is also consistent with modern quality systems in ensuring that the various operations associated with all systems are appropriately planned, approved, conducted, and monitored.\n\nFootnote 7: Generally, the term quality unit is used in this guidance. However, quality control unit is used when directly quoting parts 210 and 211.\n\nThe CGMP regulations specifically assign the QU the authority to create, monitor, and implement a quality system. Such activities do not substitute for, or preclude, the daily responsibility of manufacturing personnel to build quality into the product. The QU should not take on the responsibilities of other units of a manufacturer's organization, such as the responsibilities handled by manufacturing personnel, engineers, and development scientists.8 Manufacturing personnel and the QU are both critical in fulfilling the manufacturer's responsibility to produce quality products.\n\nFootnote 8: See Reference #1, comment 91.\n\nOther CGMP assigned responsibilities of the QU are consistent with modern quality system approaches (SS 211.22):\n\nEnsuring that controls are implemented and completed satisfactorily during manufacturing operations\n\nEnsuring that developed procedures and specifications are appropriate and followed, including those used by a firm under contract to the manufacturer\n\nApproving or rejecting incoming materials, in-process materials, and drug products\n\nReviewing production records and investigating any unexplained discrepancies\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: Is the master schedule sheet intended to be prospective or historical? If it is historical, what is the required retention period?\n\nThe master schedule sheet is intended to include a listing of all nonclinical laboratory studies currently in progress as well as those which have been conducted during the terms specified in section 58.195 of the GLPs.\n* Does the master schedule sheet have to list studies on compounds for which no data has yet been submitted to the Agency?\n\nYes. The GLPs cover all nonclinical laboratory studies of Agency regulated products that support or are intended to support applications for research or marketing permits.\n* The GLPs state that the quality assurance unit should assure that the final report reflects the study results. Is it required that every final report be reviewed by the quality assurance unit?\n\nYes. This procedure helps to ensure the accuracy of the final report.\n* Does the quality assurance unit review of each final study report have to be reported to management?\n\nYes. The quality assurance unit must make periodic reports to management and the study director on each study. These reports should include the results of the final report review.\n* At our facility the quality assurance unit reports directly to the executive vice president of the company and not to the vice president of research and development. Is it necessary for us to formulate a separate quality assurance unit within the research and development department?The GLPs require that the quality assurance unit director and the study director cannot be the same person. The quality assurance unit must report to a level of management that has the authority to effect the corrective action as indicated by the quality assurance unit inspection reports. How this is accomplished organizationally is a management prerogative.\n17. Is it acceptable for the quality assurance unit to report to the management person who is also responsible for drug safety evaluation? This is acceptable provided that the management person is not the study director for the studies being inspected by the quality assurance unit.\n18. Is it permissible to have a pharmacologist in the research division serve as the director of the quality assurance unit? The GLPs state that a person may not perform both quality assurance functions and study direction and conduct functions for the same study. Thus, a pharmacologist in a research division could serve as the director of the quality assurance unit as long as he or she did not otherwise participate in the studies under review by the quality assurance unit.\n19. How is the requirement for a quality assurance unit to be interpreted when the testing facility is itself a quality assurance unit? By definition, a testing facility could not be a quality assurance unit. A quality assurance unit, which conducts nonclinical laboratory studies, should make separate provision for the performance of the GLP quality assurance functions.\n20. Is a member of the statistical department of a testing facility entitled to be a member of the quality assurance unit? This decision rests with facility management but such a choice is acceptable.\n21. Company A is conducting a study. Company B performs animal work for Company A to the extent of implanting test material, recovering test materials and tissues, and returning these to Company A for analysis and conclusions. Which company is designated as the testing facility, which company designates the study director, and which company does the study director work for? In the cited example, Company A would be the study sponsor while Company B would be a contract laboratory performing a portion of a nonclinical laboratory study. Both companies would be considered testing facilities, but, since the GLPs require a single study director for each study, Company A would designate the study director. Company B would, no doubt, designate a participating scientist in charge of the animal work and would have the responsibility of submitting a participating scientist\'s report to Company A for inclusion into the final report.\n* Is it acceptable to have two study directors for a single study at the same time?\n\nNo. The regulations require a single point of study control, which has been vested in the study director.\n* Do the GLPs permit the designation of a ""deputy"" or ""acting"" study director to be in charge of a nonclinical laboratory study when the study director is out of town, on vacation, etc.?\n\nYes.\n* Must the study director personally verify all observations made during a nonclinical laboratory study?\n\nNo. The study director must assure that study procedures are adequate to ensure the collection of valid data.\n* A study is only as good as the people who perform it and most importantly as the person who directs it. What does the Agency do to assess the training and experience of toxicologists?\n\nThe assessment of the training and experience of personnel is a routine part of the GLP Compliance Program. Agency investigators collect summaries of training and experience for individuals participating in the study. These summaries are evaluated by the headquarters scientific review staff.\n* In view of the shortage of board certified pathologists, is it permissible to permit either non-veterinarians or non-board certified veterinary pathologists to conduct necropsies? Is certification required for a pathologist to participate in a nonclinical laboratory study?\n\nThe Agency recognizes the serious shortage of trained and certified pathologists as well as toxicologists. The GLPs require that personnel possess the appropriate combination of education, training and experience needed to do their jobs. Therefore, it is permissible to have non-veterinarians conduct necropsies provided their training and experience are adequate. The GLPs do not require board certification for either pathologists or toxicologists.\n\nWhat does the agency consider to be the minimal acceptable educational requirements for someone appointed as ""study director? "" Due to the wide range of nonclinical laboratory studies and the numerous combinations of education, training and experience, which would be acceptable, the Agency did not specify minimal educational requirements for nonclinical laboratory study participants. The GLPs specify that the study director should have the appropriate mixture of education, training and experience to permit the performance of the assigned functions.\n\nWill I, as the director rector of a contract pathology laboratory, be required to have a quality assurance unit and to store slides, blocks, wet tissues, etc. in the archives? The GLPs require that the quality assurance functions be performed. In your case, either you or the sponsor must have a quality assurance unit. Again, either you, the sponsor, or a separate commercial facility will have to store slides, blocks, wet tissues, etc., and the archives will have to specify the storage location.\n\nSUBPART C FACILITIES\n\nGeneral\n\n58.43 AnIMAL CARE FACILITIES\n\n58.45 AnIMAL SUPPLY FACILITIES FOR HANDLIING TEST AND CONTROL ARTICLES\n\n58.49 LABORATORY OPERATION AREAS\n\n58.51 Specim and data storage facilities\n\n58.53 Administrative and Personnel facilities\n\nWould there be any criticism of a laboratory where animals of the same species, used concurrently in 6-8 short-term eye or dermal irritation studies, were housed in the same room, assuming there is sufficient spatial separation? No. This procedure would be acceptable provided that precautions were taken to prevent animal and experimental mix-ups and cross-contamination.\n\nWhat is the relationship between the FDA and the USDA inspection of animal facilities?\n\nThe USDA inspection is directed towards ensuring the humane care of animals used in research whereas the FDA inspection is directed towards ensuring the quality of data obtained from safety experiments that involve animals.\n\nWe feel that storage of test article - diet mixtures in animal rooms in well-labeled, vermin proof containers will lead to fewer errors than storage in a central common area. Is this permissible in light of section 58.47(b)?\n\nYes. Section 58.47(b) requires separate areas for test article diet mixtures, which need not be a separate common area or a separate room. In the cited example, each animal room could have a separate area devoted to feed storage.\n\nIs it necessary to provide space for the isolation of diseased animals if they are immediately removed from the study and sacrificed?\n\nNo. The intent of the regulations is to ensure that diseased animals are handled in a manner that will not adversely impact on the nonclinical laboratory study.\n\nIs it acceptable for a nonclinical laboratory to quarantine all newly arrived animals for the required period and then begin the study in the same area?\n\nYes.\n\n58.61 Equipment Design\n\nMaintenance and Calibration of Equipment\n\nRegarding GLP required standard operating procedures for preventive maintenance, is it expected that detailed instructions be prepared for each piece of laboratory equipment? Can the standard operating procedures refer to an equipment manual for detailed instructions as appropriate?\n\nSpecific standard operating procedures are required for each piece of equipment. These procedures can incorporate verbatim the instructions contained in the equipment manuals.\n\nIn order to calibrate a scale used to weigh large farm animals is it necessary to use a set of standard weights similar to those used for laboratory animal scales only much, much heavier?\n\nIn this case, calibration and maintenance of a periodic nature can be performed by a manufacturer\'s representative and the records should reflect these operations.\n\nAdditionally, calibration can be accomplished through use of secondary standards.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:19]\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: When an application for Premarket Approval for a Class III Device is scrutinized, would a GLP audit by FDA become a criterion for premarket approval? Safety data are required for Class III Devices and such data are to be collected under the GLPs, but an FDA audit will not automatically become part of the premarket approval mechanisms.\n\nAre Class I, II and III Devices regulated products within the meaning of the GLPs? Yes.\n\nAre data contained in a 510(k) notification subject to the GLPs? No.\n\nHow do the GLPs apply to the testing of electromechanical medical devices (non-animal work)?It is presumed that the question refers to engineering tests and in vitro tests of such devices conducted to assess functionality. In these cases, the GLPs do not apply.\n\nPlease elaborate on the preamble statement (43 FR 59989) that studies involving ""diagnostic products"" and ""medical devices, which do not come in contact with or are implanted in man"" are not within the scope of the GLPs. Failure of diagnostic products or medical devices, which do not come in contact with man or are not implanted does pose a safety hazard. This is also true for implantable devices. Tests to establish the reliability of these articles are functionality tests, not safety tests. The GLPs cover implantable devices, which may cause adverse tissue reactions or may have components, which leach into the tissues and cause a toxic response.\n\nIs an in vitro study to quantitate the amounts of residual proteolytic enzyme on a soft contact lens (the enzyme is used to clean the lens) a safety study which is covered by the GLPs? No, the enzyme is part of the lens manufacturing process and its analysis would be covered by the GMPs and not the GLPs. If, however, the proteolytic enzyme is sold as a means of cleaning lenses after purchase by a person, the enzyme is an accessory to a medical device and the safety studies supporting the use of the enzyme would be subject to the GLPs.\n\nDo engineering laboratory tests done on components of implantable medical devices fall under the GLPs? No.\n\nAre safety tests conducted on biological products exempt from the GLPs? Two kinds of safety tests are performed on human biological products. Those which are performed by the manufacturer prior to licensing, and those performed post licensing. The tests performed prior to licensing establish the basic safety profile of the product and they are covered by the GLPs. The safety tests performed post licensing are part of the required quality control assays, which permit the release of each batch of product. These tests are not covered by the GLPs. Safety testing of interstate biological products for use in animals is not covered by the GLPs since these products are not regulated by FDA.\n\nDo the GLPs apply to veterinary drug and biological manufacturers even when the end products are strictly for veterinary use?\n\nThe GLPs apply to animal drugs used on a prescription basis but they do not apply to interstate veterinary biologists since these products are regulated by USDA. Intrastate veterinary biologists, which are considered to be new animal drugs, are also covered by the GLPs.\n\nIf an organization has separate divisions for basic research and for toxicological safety testing, will the basic research division be subject to inspection under the GLPs? No, as long as the basic research division is not providing any service function for the safety-testing unit.\n\nDo the GLP requirements apply to an equal degree to acute, medium-term, and long-term studies? The GLPs apply equally to all nonclinical laboratory studies. It should be recognized, however, that short-term (less than 6 months) studies need not be inspected as frequently as long term (more than 6 months) studies by the quality assurance unit.\n\nAre preliminary protocol development or design studies that employ laboratory animals covered by the GLPs? No, these are preliminary exploratory studies.\n\nIf an acute oral toxicity study, a 9o-day oral toxicity study, and a two-year chronic study are done, is only the two-year study required to be done under the GLPs? No. Each study, regardless of its duration or complexity should be considered in terms of its purpose. A study, which is conducted for the purpose of estimating the safety of a product in, humans or animals and which will be submitted to FDA, is covered under the GLPs. This includes acute oral toxicity studies as well as 9o-day oral toxicity studies and two-year chronic studies. In early phases of research, acute studies are often used to select the most promising product from a group of candidate products. In this sense acute studies are exploratory or screening in nature and would be exempted from the GLPs. There are also special situations where a 9o-day oral toxicity study or even a chronic oral toxicity study may be exempted from GLPs. For example, a multinational company may want to develop Product A for a very specific foreign market. The company has no intention of ever applying to FDA for an investigational or marketing permit for Product A. Long-term safety studies with Product A for the purpose of foreign registration would be exempted from GLPs.\n\nWill you please ease define a range-finding study and will such studies be inspected? A range-finding study is conducted to gather information such as dose range or toxicological end point to permit the more proper design of a subsequent nonclinical laboratory study. Such studies, which are usually short-term, are preliminary exploratory studies, which are exempt from the GLPs if properly labeled as ""range-finding"" or ""preliminary pilot study"" or similar designation. These studies will usually not serve as the basis of inspection, but may be reviewed to determine whether the operation of a facility is in compliance with the GLPs. Although the studies are exempt from the GLPs, they must still be submitted to the Agency as part of the respective application for a research or marketing permit.\n\nDoes the Agency agree that the GLPs are applicable to safety studies intended for submission to the Agency in support of the approval of a regulated product and that they are not applicable to preliminary exploratory studies, screening studies, and range finding studies whose purpose is to develop or improve the experimental design of a planned nonclinical laboratory study?\n\nYes.\n* Many toxicological studies are conducted on products or formulations, which are comprised entirely of materials which are known to be safe. Such studies are intended to be a quality control measure to determine lack of product integrity or to detect adulteration.

The GLPs apply to safety studies intended for submission to the Agency in support of product approval. Food microbiology studies are quality control studies not subject to the regulations.\n* Do the GLPs apply to laboratories, which perform routine sterility analyses on marketable medical devices, which have been treated with gas for the purpose of sterilization?\n\nNo.\n* Are studies of approved drugs or devices undertaken for physician education, advertising or pharmaceutical marketing purposes subject to the GLPs?\n\nNo.\n* Do the GLPs apply to safety substantiation studies conducted on over-the-counter drugs, which are covered by a final monograph?\n\nNo.\n* It is not clear whether a laboratory involved solely in chemical analysis support of a nonclinical laboratory study would be required to comply with the GLPs. Can this be clarified?\n\nYes. Analytical laboratories must comply with the GLPs to the extent that they provide data, which support the nonclinical laboratory study. Only those portions of the laboratory, those procedures and those personnel involved are required to be in compliance with the GLPs.\n* What is FDA\'s position regarding the testing of ""medical foods"" according to GLP requirements?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry'

At Step 4 of the Process the final draft is recommended for adoption to the regulatory bodies of the European Union, Japan and USA.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n1 Introduction\n\nObjective\n\nThis document (Guide) is intended to provide guidance regarding good manufacturing practice (GMP) for the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) under an appropriate system for managing quality. It is also intended to help ensure that APIs meet the requirements for quality and purity that they purport or are represented to possess.\n\nIn this Guide ""manufacturing"" is defined to include all operations of receipt of materials, production, packaging, repackaging, labelling, relabelling, quality control, release, storage and distribution of APIs and the related controls. In this Guide the term ""should"" indicates recommendations that are expected to apply unless shown to be inapplicable or replaced by an alternative demonstrated to provide at least an equivalent level of quality assurance. For the purposes of this Guide, the terms ""current good manufacturing practices"" and ""good manufacturing practices"" are equivalent.\n\nThe Guide as a whole does not cover safety aspects for the personnel engaged in the manufacture, nor aspects of protection of the environment. These controls are inherent responsibilities of the manufacturer and are governed by national laws.\n\nThis Guide is not intended to define registration/filing requirements or modify pharmacopoeial requirements. This Guide does not affect the ability of the responsible regulatory agency to establish specific registration/filing requirements regarding APIs within the context of marketing/manufacturing authorizations or drug applications. All commitments in registration/filing documents must be met.\n\nRegulatory Applicability\n\nWithin the world community, materials may vary as to the legal classification as an API. When a material is classified as an API in the region or country in which it is manufactured or used in a drug product, it should be manufactured according to this Guide.\n\nScope\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 4: Specifications must be scientifically sound and appropriate (§ 211.160(b)), test procedures must be validated as to their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility (§ 211.165(e)), and the suitability of the test procedures under actual conditions of use must be documented (§ 211.194(a)(2)). For products that are the subjects of new drug applications (NDAs), abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), or investigational new drug applications (INDs), specifications are contained in the application or DMF. Specifications for nonapplication products may be found in official compendia or established by the manufacturer.\n\nBoth finished pharmaceuticals and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are to be manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practice under section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act. Current good manufacturing practice for APIs includes the performance of scientifically sound raw material testing, in-process monitoring, release and stability testing, process validation, and adequate investigations of any OOS result obtained from such testing. All citations to part 211 in this document pertain to finished pharmaceuticals, but these referenced regulatory requirements are also consistent with Agency guidance on CGMP for APIs with respect to laboratory controls, which include out-of-specification investigations. See FDA'sguidance for industry Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (September 2016) (ICH Q7) for specific recommendations.5\n\nFootnote 5: We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the CDER guidance page at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/guidances-drugs.\n\nThe responsibility of a contract testing laboratory in meeting these requirements is equivalent to that of a manufacturing firm.\n\nIII Identifying and Assessing OOS Test Results -- Phase I: Laboratory Investigation\n\nFDA regulations require that an investigation be conducted whenever an OOS test result is obtained (SS 211.192).6 The purpose of the investigation is to determine the cause of the OOS result. The source of the OOS result should be identified either as an aberration of the measurement process or an aberration of the manufacturing process. Even if a batch is rejected based on an OOS result, the investigation is necessary to determine if the result is associated with other batches of the same drug product or other products. Batch rejection does not negate the need to perform the investigation. The regulations require that a written record of the investigation be made, including the conclusions and follow-up (SS 211.192).\n\nFootnote 6: Although the subject of this document is OOS results, much of the guidance may be useful for examining results that are out of trend.\n\nTo be meaningful, the investigation should be thorough, timely, unbiased, well-documented, and scientifically sound. The first phase of such an investigation should include an initial assessment of the accuracy of the laboratory's data. Whenever possible, this should be done before test preparations (including the composite or the homogenous source of the aliquot tested) are discarded. This way, hypotheses regarding laboratory error or instrument malfunctions can be tested using the same test preparations. If this initial assessment indicates that no causative errors were made in the analytical method used to arrive at the data, a full-scale OOS investigation should be conducted. For contract laboratories, the laboratory should convey its data, findings, and supporting documentation to the manufacturing firm's quality unit (QU). The manufacturing firm's QU should then initiate the Phase 2 (full-scale) OOS investigation, whenever no clearly causative laboratory error was identified.\n\nResponsibility of the Analyst\n\nThe first responsibility for achieving accurate laboratory testing results lies with the analyst who is performing the test. The analyst should be aware of potential problems that could occur during the testing process and should watch for problems that could create inaccurate results.\n\nIn accordance with the CGMP regulations in SS 211.160(b)(4), the analyst should ensure that only those instruments meeting established performance specifications are used and that all instruments are properly calibrated.\n\nCertain analytical methods have system suitability requirements, and systems not meeting these requirements should not be used. For example, in chromatographic systems, reference standard solutions may be injected at intervals throughout chromatographic runs to measure drift, noise, and repeatability. If reference standard responses indicate that the system is not functioning properly, all of the data collected during the suspect time period should be properly identified and should not be used. The cause of the malfunction should be identified and, if possible, corrected before a decision is made whether to use any data prior to the suspect period.\n\nAnalysts should check the data for compliance with test specifications before discarding test preparations or standard preparations. When unexpected results are obtained and no obvious explanation exists, test preparations should be retained, if stable, and the analyst should inform the supervisor. An assessment of the accuracy of the results should be started immediately.\n\nIf errors are obvious, such as the spilling of a sample solution or the incomplete transfer of a sample composite, the analyst should immediately document what happened. Analysts should not knowingly continue an analysis they expect to invalidate at a later time for an assignable cause (i.e., analyses should not be completed for the sole purpose of seeing what results can be obtained when obvious errors are known).\n\nResponsibilities of the Laboratory Supervisor\n\nOnce an OOS result has been identified, the supervisor's assessment should be objective and timely. There should be no preconceived assumptions as to the cause of the OOS result. Data should be assessed promptly to ascertain if the results might be attributed to laboratory error, or whether the results could indicate problems in the manufacturing process. An immediate assessment could include re-examination of the actual solutions, test units, and glassware used in the original measurements and preparations, which might provide more credibility for laboratory error hypotheses.\n\nThe following steps should be taken as part of the supervisor's assessment:\n\nDiscuss the test method with the analyst; confirm analyst knowledge of and performance of the correct procedure.\n\nExamine the raw data obtained in the analysis, including chromatograms and spectra, and identify anomalous or suspect information.\n\nVerify that the calculations used to convert raw data values into a final test result are scientifically sound, appropriate, and correct; also determine if unauthorized or unvalidated changes have been made to automated calculation methods.\n\nConfirm the performance of the instruments.\n\nDetermine that appropriate reference standards, solvents, reagents, and other solutions were used and that they met quality control specifications.\n\nEvaluate the performance of the test method to ensure that it is performing according to the standard expected based on method validation data and historical data.\n\nFully document and preserve records of this laboratory assessment.\n\nThe assignment of a cause for OOS results will be greatly facilitated if the retained sample preparations are examined promptly. Hypotheses regarding what might have happened (e.g., dilution error, instrument malfunction) should be tested. Examination of the retained solutions should be performed as part of the laboratory investigation.\n\nExamples:\n\nSolutions can be re-injected as part of an investigation where a transient equipment malfunction is suspected. Such hypotheses are difficult to prove. However, reinjections can provide strong evidence that the problem should be attributed to the instrument, rather than the sample or its preparation.\n\nFor release rate testing of certain specialized dosage form drugs that are not destroyed during testing, where possible, examination of the original dosage unit tested might determine whether it was damaged during laboratory handling in a way that affected its performance. Such damage would provide evidence to invalidate the OOS test result, and a retest would be indicated.\n\nFurther extraction of a dosage unit, where possible, can be performed to determine whether it was fully extracted during the original analysis. Incomplete extraction could invalidate the test results and should lead to questions regarding validation of the test method.\n\nIt is important that each step in the investigation be fully documented. Laboratory management should ascertain not only the reliability of the individual value obtained, but also the significance these OOS results represent to the laboratory quality assurance program. Laboratory management should be especially alert to developing trends. As part of an effective quality system, a firm's upper management should appropriately monitor these trends and ensure that any problematic areas are addressed.\n\nLaboratory error should be relatively rare. Frequent errors suggest a problem that might be due to inadequate training of analysts, poorly maintained or improperly calibrated equipment, or careless work. Whenever laboratory error is identified, the firm should determine the source of that error and take corrective action to prevent recurrence. To ensure full compliance with the CGMP regulations, the manufacturer also should maintain adequate documentation of the corrective action.\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigating Out-of-Specification (OOS) Test Results for Pharmaceutical Production - Level 2 revision Guidance for Industry""]","['No. The GLPs require that, if absorption studies are needed to achieve the scientific objectives of the study plan, the protocol should describe the methods to be used to determine absorption.

A single animal species, that is scientifically justified, is usually sufficient. All relevant information should be considered for selection of the animal species, including pharmacology data and tissue cross reactivity for biological products, as applicable, to compare distribution in animal and human tissues.\n\nThe sponsor should evaluate radioactivity in organs over time post-administration, using sufficient duration of sampling (e.g., 5 x effective half-lives) to generate the time-integrated activity curves, also referred to as cumulated activity(Siegel et al. 1999). The sampling interval should be scientifically justified. Pharmacokine parameters should be collected. The sponsor should consider daughter decays and their half-lives when designing the animal biodistribution study. Duration of data collection can be adjusted as needed (e.g., when a long effective half-life or a multiexponential time-integrated activity curve may necessitate many sampling time points and a substantial increase in the number of animals). In such cases, alternative approaches and modeling can be considered to integrate the terminal portion of the activity time curve. If alternative approaches and modeling are used, the sponsor should describe them in the investigational new drug application (IND).\n\nThe design of an animal biodistribution study should incorporate aspects of the planned clinical biodistribution and dosimetry study that might affect distribution of the product. For instance, if the planned clinical study includes patients being pretreated with thyroid-protecting agents to reduce radioiodine uptake by the thyroid, then this same design should be considered in the animal biodistribution study. Additionally, because the amount of radioactive and nonradioactive materials in the dosing mixture can affect the biodistribution, the ratio used in animal studies should be comparable to that proposed in patients or be justified. Multiple dose levels in biodistribution studies can provide useful information on the amount of radioactive and nonradioactive materials needed for an optimal distribution in organs.\n\nOrgans assessed for distribution of time-integrated activity generally include the adrenals, bone and bone marrow, brain, small and large intestine walls, stomach, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, muscles, ovaries, pancreas, spleen, testes, thymus, thyroid, urinary bladder, uterus, and total body. Additional organs can be included as appropriate based on the potential distribution specific to the particular radiopharmaceutical (e.g., eyes and skin for melanin-binding compounds). Excretion data in urine and feces should be collected. The number of organs assessed can be abbreviated if adequately justified. The abbreviated organ list should generally include bone marrow and organs of excretion, such as kidneys and liver, because these organs are generally affected, regardless of target binding. An example of using a limited number of organs in a biodistribution study is when the intention is to show comparability of two related radiopharmaceuticals (bridging study) such that the clinical data with one radiopharmaceutical may be used to select the starting dose of the other radiopharmaceutical for a human dosimetry study.\n\nBoth male and female animals should be included in the study for uptake of radioactivity by male- and female-specific organs, unless the indication is sex-specific. Biodistribution and dosimetry in large animals (e.g., monkeys) are usually done with imaging techniques; hence, a small number of animals (e.g., three males and three females) may be sufficient to assess activity levels and distribution over time. For small animals, such as mice and rats, there should be a sufficient number of animals per time point when a method requiring animal sacrifice is used (e.g., autoradiography).\n\nThe activity time curve in organs of animals can be used to estimate the percent administered activity (%ID), residence time, and time-integrated activity in human organs. See the Glossary (Estimation of human values of activity and residence time in source organs) for examples of methods used for animal-to-human extrapolations; other methods can be used and should be described in the IND. The estimated human values should be used to generate the radiation\n\nabsorbed doses in human organs, through mathematical calculations or appropriate software programs (Stabin and Xu 2014). The sponsor should describe dosimetry methodology and associated software, including version identification, in the IND.\n\nV Toxicology\n\nGeneral Toxicology\n\nv.1.1 Toxicology Studies to Support the FIH Therapeutic Phase\n\nThe sponsor should evaluate both radiation- and ligand-related toxicities. Such evaluations can be through toxicology studies or biodistribution studies, as appropriate. Generally, no toxicity studies are warranted before a FIH study when the radiopharmaceutical is a neat radionuclide (i.e., contains no ligand). Toxicities of the radiopharmaceutical are from the radionuclide decay; thus, the results of the animal biodistribution study with added safety endpoints can be used to determine short-term radiation-related toxicities. Below are recommendations for radiation- and ligand-related safety assessment.\n\nEvaluation of radiation-induced toxicity: A general toxicology study with the radiopharmaceutical usually is not warranted. The animal biodistribution study, together with the general knowledge of organ-specific radiation-induced toxicities, is usually sufficient to address toxicities from the radiation. Published articles on organ-specific, radiation-induced toxicities should be included in the submission. The sponsor should consider adding safety endpoints, such as clinical signs, body weight (BW), hematology, and serum chemistry, to the design of the biodistribution study.\n\nEvaluation of ligand-induced toxicity: To identify any ligand-related toxicities, the sponsor should conduct a general toxicology study with the cold pharmaceutical in a relevant species before initiation of a FIH study. Ligand-related toxicities have been observed but are usually minor compared with radiation-induced toxicities; hence, a study in one species is generally considered sufficient. Unless otherwise justified, the species selected for toxicology study should be the same as the species used for animal biodistribution and dosimetry study. Frequency of administration in the toxicology study should follow recommendations in the ICH guidance for industry S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmacoeticals (March 2010) and should take into account the frequency of administration in the FIH trial (both the human biodistribution and dosimetry and the therapeutic phase that follows it).\n\nv.1.2 Long-Term Toxicity Assessments to Support Marketing\n\nIn general, the nonclinical data generated in support of the FIH study and the clinical phase 1 data should be sufficient for moving to phase 2. The sponsor should conduct long-term toxicity assessment studies and should submit the results with the marketing application. These studies should assess both ligand- and radiation-related toxicities. The dosing period in animals can follow ICH S9. For most pharmaceuticals intended for the treatment of patients with advancedcancer, nonclinical studies of 3 months' duration are considered sufficient to support marketing. Below are recommendations for study design and circumstances when studies may not be needed.\n\nEvaluation of ligand-induced toxicity: Chronic toxicity studies of the cold pharmaceutical may not be needed in several circumstances: when a limited number of doses are administered to patients (e.g., two or three doses), when the ligand is for delivery purposes only and administration will result in a small dose (e.g., in microgram ranges), or when the cold pharmaceutical has a short half-life and dosing frequency is low (e.g., every 4 to 8 weeks). When a chronic (i.e., 3-month) study is needed, a study in a single species is generally considered sufficient. This study can be combined with the late radiation toxicity study when a late radiation toxicity study is being conducted.\n\nEvaluation of late radiation toxicity: An assessment of late radiation toxicities is warranted when patients have a long life expectancy that could be affected by late radiation adverse effects. The assessment could be based on an integrated summary that takes into consideration the distribution of radiation (from animal biodistribution and human dosimetry studies) and publications describing late radiation effects. Alternatively, an animal study can be conducted. For recommendations on animal study design and endpoints, see the guidance for industry Nonclinical Evaluation of Late Radiation Toxicity of Therapeutic Radiopharmaceuticals. Identification of a no-observed-adverse-effect level is not needed. The study in a single species is generally considered sufficient. When a limited number of organs is examined by histopathology, the organs selected should be justified. Any organs with gross pathology findings should be examined microscopically.\n\nGenotoxicity, Reproductive Toxicology, and Carcinogenicity Studies\n\nNo genetic or reproductive toxicity or carcinogenicity study with the radiopharmaceutical or the cold pharmaceutical is warranted during drug development or for approval. Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation cause deoxyribonucleic acid damage and are inherently genotoxic and carcinogenic and damage male and female germ cells and a developing conceptus. These risks should be communicated in product labeling (see section VII., Labeling Recommendations).\n--------------------\nContext title: Oncology Therapeutic Radiopharmaceuticals- Nonclinical Studies and Labeling Recommendations Guidance for Industry""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: The goal of the adequate and well-controlled animal studies is to demonstrate that the investigational drug is statistically significantly superior to placebo and confers a treatment or prevention effect considered likely to be clinically meaningful. Sponsors should discuss power considerations and a proposed statistical analysis plan with the FDA before initiating planned studies.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nii.1.3 Selection of an Effective Dosing Regimen in Humans\n\nTo support human dose selection for an investigational drug, sponsors should characterize the PK profile of the drug in healthy humans and both the PK profile and the PD profile of the drug in the surrogate orthopoxvirus animal models that are used to demonstrate efficacy. In addition, the PK profile of the drug in infected animals should be compared with the PK profile of the drug in healthy animals to determine whether the specific orthopoxvirus infection affects the drug's PK profile. It is critical that the PK data in humans and the PK and PD data in animals are obtained in well-controlled studies using fully validated bioanalytical assays for determining drug concentrations. For each of the surrogate orthopoxvirus animal models used to establish efficacy, the exposure-response relationship of the drug should be established and the fully effective dose and the drug exposure associated with the fully effective dose should be determined. Furthermore, sponsors should consider interspecies differences in absorption, distribution (including plasma protein binding), metabolism, and excretion when determining the human dose.\n\nThe determination of treatment duration will depend on several factors including, but not limited to, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug, the proposed indication (i.e., treatment or prophylaxis), and the pathophysiology and disease course in animal models of orthopoxvirus infection versus humans with smallpox.\n\nAs described in the guidance for industry Product Development Under the Animal Rule, sponsors should select human doses that provide exposures that exceed the exposures in animals associated with the fully effective dose (ideally by severalfold if the drug's safety profile supports such dosing). This selection serves to accommodate any uncertainties relating to the similarity of the exposure-response relationship between humans and animals.\n\nPharmacology/Toxicology Considerations\n\nPharmacology/toxicology considerations for safety evaluation should follow the standard drug development paradigms for small molecules as outlined in the ICH guidance for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals (January 2010) or for biologics as outlined in the ICH guidance for industry S6(R1) Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals (July 1997). Historical clinical data suggest that some patients (e.g., immunocompromised) with variola virus infection may have had clinical disease lasting longer than 2 weeks; therefore, we recommend that initial toxicology and safety studies take this possibility into account. Duration of studies to support investigational new drug application (IND) and new drug application (NDA)/biologics license application (BLA) filings are outlined in the respective ICH guidances.\n\nWe do not anticipate that carcinogenicity studies will be needed for drugs that might be used only to treat established smallpox because the administration of such drugs will not, in most cases, exceed 6 months. However, if there is a cause for concern (e.g., positive genotoxicity or other risks for carcinogenicity), then follow-up discussions with DAVP may be warranted. Lastly, see the guidances for industry Product Development Under the Animal Rule and Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nProviding Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format -- Standardized Study Data (December 2014) regarding requirements for electronic submission of nonclinical pharmacology/toxicology as well as nonclinical efficacy datasets.\n\nAppendix C Nonclinical Virology Considerations\n\nStudy reports for the investigational drug should provide results and analyses describing its mechanism of action, establish its specific antiviral activity in cell culture and animal models, provide data on the development and potential mechanisms of viral drug resistance (or reduced susceptibility of the virus to the drug) in cell culture and animal models, and assess its cytotoxicity and mitochondrial toxicity. Additional information on virology studies can be found in the guidance for industry Antiviral Product Development -- Conducting and Submitting Virology Studies to the Agency (June 2006).\n\nWe recommend that sponsors evaluate the investigational drug's antiviral activity against a broad panel of orthopoxviruses, including vaccinia virus and other orthopoxviruses expected to be used in animal models (e.g., monkeypox virus, rabbitpox virus, ectromelia virus). Such assessments constitute a broad-based orthopoxvirus testing strategy to screen for potential relevance to variola virus and assess the potential of the investigational drug to treat vaccine complications or human monkeypox. Ultimately, sponsors should explore the potential appropriateness of testing the antiviral activity of the investigational drug against variola virus isolates if other data are sufficiently promising to proceed to this stage.\n\nOrthopoxvirus DNA polymerases replicate their viral genomes with high fidelity, complicating the genotypic analysis of resistance in animal studies. To aid in the interpretation of drug resistance results from animal studies, sponsors should include plans to evaluate the performance of their nucleotide sequencing assay(s) to help distinguish between nucleotide sequence changes caused by their resistance assay versus those occurring in vivo and possibly contributing to drug resistance.\n\nSponsors should submit information on sample collection, assays performed, and validation approaches for these assays. Using a specific procedure, method, or test system in an investigational protocol for a nonclinical laboratory study, or as a laboratory procedure supporting a clinical trial, does not constitute FDA endorsement of that procedure, method, or test system, or FDA approval for clinical laboratory use.12\n\nFootnote 12: Submission of an investigational device exemption to the Center for Devices and Radiological Health may be warranted if an investigational assay is used in a clinical trial.\n\nThe FDA performs independent assessments of virologic and resistance data. Sponsors should consult with DAVP before submitting virology datasets to obtain information on the most recent recommended formats. In the case of next-generation sequence analysis, sponsors should refer to the guidance for industry and technical specification document Submitting Next Generation Sequencing Data to the Division of Antiviral Products (July 2019), which describes the procedure for submission of files in the FASTQ format (containing sequence nucleotides and quality information).\n\nLaboratory work with certain orthopoxviruses must comply with applicable regulations (e.g., the select agent regulations found at 42 CFR part 73)13 and should incorporate relevant biosafety and biosecurity procedures as appropriate to the viruses studied. Sponsors should contact relevant government agencies, such as the CDC and the National Institutes of Health, for more information regarding biosafety procedures.14 Sponsors should also be aware that all studies of variola virus must be conducted in collaboration with CDC and will require approval from the World Health Organization.\n\nFootnote 13: Information on the Federal Select Agent Program can be found at https://www.selectagents.gov.\n\nFootnote 14: Information on biosafety can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/index.htm and https://www.nih.gov/research-training/safety-regulation-guidance.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nFor the FDA to approve a drug for treating or preventing smallpox under the Animal Rule, the safety of the drug must be established.15 However, the Animal Rule does not provide specific provisions for evaluating safety. Therefore, the FDA evaluates these drugs under preexisting NDA/BLA regulations for establishing the safety of new drugs or biological products. Under most conditions, the human safety data for smallpox drugs will come from healthy volunteer studies and/or relevant human safety data for the same drugs developed for other indications. Evaluating important drug-drug interactions also may involve healthy volunteer studies. In the event of a smallpox public health emergency, human safety and efficacy data also can be obtained by using investigational smallpox drugs in clinical field trials. For drugs approved under the Animal Rule, postmarketing clinical trials are required when feasible and ethical (21 CFR part 314, subpart I, for drugs and 21 CFR part 601, subpart H, for biologics).\n\n1.1 Healthy Volunteer Safety Trials\n\nOutside of a public health emergency, the safety evaluation of drugs developed solely for treating or preventing smallpox largely depends on safety trials in healthy volunteers. Nonclinical safety and activity data of the investigational drug should be available before the initiation of human trials to support safety and to guide clinical trial design (e.g., dose, duration), as outlined in the respective ICH guidances for small molecules (ICH M3(R2)) or biologics (ICH S6(R1)). Sponsors should discuss any concerns related to the safety or ethics of healthy volunteer trials with the FDA early in the drug development program.\n--------------------\nContext title: Smallpox (Variola Virus) Infection- Developing Drugs for Treatment or Prevention Guidance for Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: The SR should evaluate a specific formulation of drug produced in accordance with appropriate manufacturing practices. Formulation should be taken into consideration when selecting the studies that are appropriate for inclusion.\n\nA meta-analysis may not be appropriate for all submissions that include a literature or systematic review. Other types of analyses (i.e., a multicriteria decision analysis or a weight-of-evidence analysis) or a qualitative assessment may be more appropriate. The available information should be used to determine what conclusions can be drawn, such as an evaluation of the risk of adverse events or safety concerns for the animal associated with the use of the drug at the proposed dose under the intended conditions of use, and identify any gaps remaining in the target animal safety evaluation. Using the literature to develop a hazard characterization may be adequate to frame the further studies and study designs needed to meet the target animal safety requirements. The strength of support provided by the body of available literature is useful in determining the number and type of necessary studies and the potential adverse reactions or safety impacts that may be observed. If gaps are identified, the available information can be used to inform methods used to address the gaps and the design of one or more studies to address the gaps, which include alternative or non-traditional studies. Information from the literature may be used to inform the design of the margin of safety study in an evaluation and the prediction of potential adverse effects that may occur in the target species.\n\n4 Other Laboratory Safety Studies\n\nFor certain indications or conditions of use and for certain dosage forms, additional safety studies, such as evaluation of injection sites or application sites for topically administered drugs, a reproductive safety study, or other specific studies, may be needed in addition to a margin of safety study. Literature may be appropriate for addressing the requirements for these specifically designed studies as described in GFI #185.\n\nSafety information from field studies: Studies conducted to evaluate effectiveness may provide a source of information which addresses important safety endpoints. Studies included in an SR to address effectiveness, or the combination of sponsor-conducted studies and studiesreported in the published literature, may provide adequate information to address certain animal safety considerations.\n\nStandard of conduct\n\nCVM expects nonclinical laboratory studies intended for target animal safety to be conducted in accordance with GLPs. An SRMA for target animal safety is not considered a nonclinical laboratory study, as defined by 21 CFR 58.3, but may include one or more nonclinical laboratory studies. Generally, published studies do not state a standard of conduct and do not include the level of detail that permit assessment of all GLP requirements (or components). Depending on the question asked for the SRMA, studies of multiple types or designs may be included in an SRMA for target animal safety.\n\nAppendix F Human Food Safety\n\nPublished literature is normally considered in the human food safety evaluation of products regulated by CVM. Information extracted from the literature can be used either as pivotal or as corroborative information in the human food safety assessment.\n\nMicrobial food safety (antimicrobial resistance)\n\nCVM\'s draft revised Guidance for Industry (GFI) #152, ""Evaluating the Safety of Antimicrobial New Animal Drugs with Regard to Their Microbiological Effects on Bacteria of Human Health Concer"" (December 2022), outlines a risk assessment approach to evaluate the microbial food safety of antimicrobial new animal drugs. It states, ""[w]ithin the context of risk assessment, many possible mechanisms to address the development of antimicrobial resistance resulting from the use of antimicrobial new animal drugs in food-producing animals are available to the sponsor. Alternative processes that may be more appropriate to a sponsor\'s drug and its intended conditions of use may be used to characterize the microbial food safety of that drug."" This guidance states the submission of current and relevant literature can be a source of quality data to characterize the hazard and to assess the risk to human health. GFI #152 also provides examples of types of data and information that may be used.\n\nToxicology and residue chemistry\n\nCVM recommends a standard series of toxicology and residue chemistry studies (see GFI #3, ""General Principles for Evaluating the Human Safety of New Animal Drugs Used in Food-Producing Animals"" (June 2018)), but also accepts alternative approaches, such as risk-based or weight-of-evidence approaches that may include consideration of information from published literature. Literature-based, scientifically valid evidence is often considered as supportive information in the review process. Literature-based information may be accepted as the sole basis to satisfy toxicology and residue chemistry requirements on a case-by-case basis. The type of information (level of details, study and data quality, etc.) in the published literature should be adequate to allow CVM to address a specific toxicology or residue chemistry question with reasonable certainty or be sufficient to meet the toxicology and residue chemistry requirements.\n\nV Glossary\n\nFor purposes of this guidance, the following definitions apply:\n\nActive control: The new animal drug is compared with known effective therapy. The use of this control is appropriate when the use of a placebo control or of an untreated concurrent control would unreasonably compromise the welfare of the animals. Similarity of the new animal drug and the active control drug can mean either that both drugs were effective or that neither was effective. The study report should assess the ability of the study to have detected a difference between treatments. The evaluation of the study should explain why the new animal drugs should be considered effective in the study, for example, by reference to results in previous placebo-controlled studies of the active control (21 CFR 514.117(b)(4)(iii) and GFI #204, ""Active controls in studies to demonstrate effectiveness of a new animal drug for use in companion animals"" (December 2015)).\n\nAttribution bias: Bias due to systematic differences between treatment and comparison groups in withdrawals or exclusions from the results of a study (Hoffmann et al. 2017).31\n\nCitation bias: Citation bias refers to bias due to the citation or non-citation of research findings, depending on the nature and direction of the results (https://methods.cochrane.org/bias/reporting-biases - Accessed on December 6, 2022).\n\nCritical Quality Attribute (COA): a physical, chemical, biological, or microbiological property or characteristic that should be within an appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the desired product quality. CQAs are generally associated with the drug substance, excipients, intermediates (in-process materials), and drug product.\n\nDetection bias: Detection bias refers to bias due to systematic differences between groups in how outcomes are determined (Hoffmann et al. 2017).\n\nGrey literature: (1) studies not indexed in commercial bibliographic databases32; (2) materials and research produced by organizations outside of the traditional commercial or academic publishing and distribution channels. Common grey literature publication types include reports (annual, research, technical, project, etc.), working papers, government documents, white papers and evaluations33; (3) conference proceedings; and (4) for the purposes of this guidance, grey literature may also include research produced by the sponsor (e.g., pilot studies and other proprietary reports).\n\nFootnote 32: See footnote 19 on p. 12.\n\nFootnote 33: “Grey Literature.” Available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_literature - Accessed on March 2, 2023.\n\nC_Historical control: The results of treatment with the new animal drug are quantitatively compared with experience historically derived from the adequately documented natural history of the disease or condition or with a regimen (therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic) whose effectiveness is established in comparable animals. Because historical control populations usually cannot be as well assessed with respect to pertinent variables as can concurrent control populations, historical control designs are usually reserved for special circumstances. Examples include studies in which the effect of the new animal drug is self-evident or studies of diseases with high and predictable mortality, or signs and symptoms of predictable duration or severity, or, in the case of prophylaxis, predictable morbidity (21 CFR 514.117(b)(4)(iv)).\n\nIntervention: The act of intervening, interfering, or interceding with the intent of modifying the outcome. In medicine, an intervention is usually undertaken to help treat or cure a condition (https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=34214).\n\nLanguage bias: The publication of research findings in a particular language, depending on the nature and direction of the results (http://methods.cochrane.org/bias/reporting-biases).\n\nLocation bias: The publication of research findings in journals with different ease of access or levels of indexing in standard databases, depending on the nature and direction of results (http://methods.cochrane.org/bias/reporting-biases).\n\nMeta-analysis: A meta-analysis is the statistical combination of results from multiple individual studies.\n\nNegative control (untreated concurrent control): The new animal drug is compared with the absence of any treatment. The use of this control may be appropriate when objective measurements of effectiveness, not subject to observer bias, are available (21 CFR 514.117(b)(4)(ii)).\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #106 The Use of Published Literature in Support of New Animal Drug Approvals'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Animal Efficacy Studies\n\nUnder the Animal Efficacy Rule, a sponsor can rely on animal studies to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness for certain new drug products intended to reduce or prevent the toxicity of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear substances. Under SSS 314.610(a)(2), one of the requirements for approval based on effectiveness data from animals alone is that the effect be demonstrated in more than one animal species expected to react with a response predictive for humans, unless the effect is demonstrated in a single animal species that represents a sufficiently well-characterized animal model for predicting the response in humans. Determination of the number of animal studies needed to support approval of a particular NDA will be made on a case-by-case basis, as will the determination of what constitutes a sufficiently well-characterized animal model for a given product or indication. In FDA\'s experience, animal efficacy studies found in the published literature or conducted without the express purpose of supporting regulatory submissions have often lacked adequate scientific rigor. Furthermore, unless there are sufficient pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic data to conclude that a rodent species will adequately predict the human response, FDA believes that the effectiveness of a proposed decorporation agent will need to be demonstrated in a second, probably nonrodent, animal species.\n\n1.1.1 Considerations Regarding Efficacy Studies Supporting Approval\n\nThe following considerations and study characteristics are important in designing and interpreting the animal studies that will be used to support product approval (this list is not comprehensive):\n\nEvaluation of efficacy in an appropriate animal species; the pharmacokinetic profile of the product and the distribution of the radioactive contaminant in the selected species should be similar to what is observed or expected in humans.\n\nInclusion of both male and female animals; the number of animals and the inclusion of appropriate controls should be adequate for proper statistical analysis.\n\nUse of a test product that is pharmaceutically equivalent to that intended for humans.\n\nEvaluation of a range of doses and calibration of a dose-response relationship.\n\nUse of a dosing frequency and route of administration that are similar, if not identical, to that intended for humans; determination of the efficacy window (i.e., the timing of product administration relative to radioactive contamination and duration of treatment).\n\nEfficacy can be based on direct measurement of the elimination of the radioactive contaminant through feces and/or urine (or exhalation, as appropriate) at various time points after administration of the decorporation agent; alternatively, the residual body burden may be measured. These measurements can then be used to calculate changes in whole-body committed radiation dose following product administration. It is generally acknowledged that the long-term risk of cancer is a function of the radiation dose received. Clinically meaningful reduction in whole-body committed radiation dose (see Glossary definition) following administration of a decorporation agent in the animal efficacy study or studies intended to support approval is ""clearly related to the desired benefit in humans, generally the enhancement of survival or prevention of major morbidity"" (21 CFR 314.610(a)(3)).26 Footnote 26: Studies evaluating long-term cancer risk or survival following radioactive contamination may not be feasible or ethical and would generally not be required to support approval of a new decorporation agent or a new indication for a previously approved product.\n\nDesigning the study using the relevant characteristics of an adequate and well-controlled study as described in 21 CFR 314.126, including reduction of bias, a clear protocol, and a statistical plan. To support approval, the decorporation agent should demonstrate statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in whole-body committed radiation dose compared to the control.\n\niii.4.2 Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Compliance\n\nBecause efficacy studies will not be conducted in humans when a product is approved under the Animal Efficacy Rule, it is essential to ensure the quality and reliability of the animal efficacy data. Therefore, efficacy studies supporting approval must be conducted in compliance with GLPs (see 21 CFR part 58).\n\nAppendix D Animal Safety Pharmacology and Toxicology Studies\n\nSponsors must conduct animal safety studies to define pharmacological and toxicological effects before initiation of first-in-human clinical trials to establish a safe starting dose for decorporation agents that are new molecular entities (see 21 CFR 312.23(a)(8)). The product used for definitive animal safety pharmacology and toxicology studies should be pharmaceutically equivalent to the product proposed for human studies. If the decorporation agent is a product that has already been approved for marketing, or if comprehensive animal or human data are available under another NDA that the sponsor either owns or has a right of reference to, additional safety pharmacology and toxicology studies may not be required, unless the route of administration, dosing regimen, and/or formulation is new.\n\nd.0.1 Safety Pharmacology Studies\n\nSafety pharmacology studies investigate potential undesirable pharmacodynamic effects on physiologic functions in relation to exposure in the therapeutic range and above. FDA recommends that sponsors perform safety pharmacology studies assessing effects on the cardiovascular, central nervous, pulmonary, and renal systems before first administration in humans.[27, 28] Follow-up or supplemental studies may also be needed if there is cause for concern. Information from adequately designed and conducted toxicology studies that address safety pharmacology endpoints may result in reduction or elimination of some of the safety pharmacology studies.[27] For products that are not systemically absorbed, it may be necessary to conduct safety studies using intravenous administration to assess the potential risk that may arise in special populations (e.g., ulcerative colitis patients). Sponsors should thoroughly evaluate local gastrointestinal toxicity for such products.\n\niv.2.2 Toxicokinetic and Pharmacokine Studies\n\nFDA recommends that exposure in animals be evaluated before human safety studies.[29] FDA believes that absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) data in animals should be available to compare human and animal pharmacokinetic profiles.\n\niv.2.3 Toxicology Studies\n\nToxicology studies should include the following:\n\nExpanded single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies in two mammalian species (one nonrodent). The duration of the repeat-dose toxicity studies should be equal to or exceed the duration of the intended treatment in humans.[30]\n\nGenotoxicity studies in vitro and in vivo[31, 32]\n\nReproductive toxicity studies (Segment I & II).[33, 34] For oral decorporation agents that are not systemically absorbed, reproductive studies may not be needed.\n\nSee ICH guidance S7A Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human Pharmaceuticals, for further discussion of safety pharmacology study designs.\n\nIn September 2004 (69 FR 55164), the Agency issued a revised, draft ICH guidance S7B Nonclinical Evaluation of the Potential for Delayed Ventricular Repolarization (QT Interval Prolongation) by Human Pharmaceuticals.\n\nSee ICH guidance S3A Toxicokinetics: The Assessment of Systemic Exposure in Toxicity Studies.\n\nSee ICH guidance S4A Duration of Chronic Toxicity Testing in Animals (Rodent and Nonrodent Toxicity Testing).\n\nSee ICH guidance S2A Specific Aspects of Regulatory Genotoxicity Tests for Pharmaceuticals.\n\nSee ICH guidance S2B Genotoxicity: A Standard Battery of Genotoxicity Tests of Pharmaceuticals.\n\nSee ICH guidance S5A Detection of Toxicity to Reproduction for Medicinal Products.\n\nSee ICH guidance S5B Detection of Toxicity to Reproduction for Medicinal Products: Addendum on Toxicity to Male Fertility.\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nLocal tolerance studies in animals using routes relevant to the proposed clinical route of administration. The assessment of local tolerance may be part of other toxicity studies.\n\nSafety studies in juvenile animals if the decorporation agents are likely to be used in pediatric populations.35\n\nCarcinogenicity studies, but only if there is cause for concern, such as evidence of preneoplastic lesions in repeat-dose toxicity studies.\n\nFootnote 35: In 2003, the Agency issued the draft guidance for industry Nonclinical Safety Evaluation of Pediatric Drug Products.\n\nAny special toxicology study requirements will be determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on product characteristics. Animals used to determine efficacy may also be assessed for toxicity. For example, safety endpoints may include assessment of physiologic functions during the study, as well as determination of histology of tissues obtained at necropsy.\n\nSponsors should refer to the appropriate Agency guidances for information regarding (1) the conduct of safety pharmacology and toxicology studies, (2) the timing of these studies relative to the initiation of human studies, and (3) appropriate methods for dose extrapolation that may be used for estimating a safe starting dose in human clinical trials.36\n\nFootnote 36: See FDA guidance entitled Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers.\n\nAppendix E Clinical Pharmacology and Biopharmaceutics Studies\n--------------------\nContext title: Internal Radioactive Contamination —Development of Decorporation Agents'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Appendix E Target Animal Safety\n\n1. Scope of Use\n\nSection 512 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360b) establishes the requirements for new animal drug approval, including target animal safety. See FD&C Act section 512(d)(1)(A), (B), and (D) (21 U.S.C. 360b(d)(1)(A), (B), and (D)).\n\nLiterature, including narrative reviews, SR, and meta-analysis, may be acceptable to fulfill all or part of the requirements for target animal safety for a new animal drug application or an application for conditional approval (see FD&C Act section 571(a)(2)(B)). Literature is most commonly used to evaluate the extent and quality of information available on the safety of a new animal drug for the proposed indication or proposed conditions of use, support the design of the target animal safety evaluation, and/or provide information to predict potential adverse effects in the target species. In some cases, literature may provide all or a portion of the information required to demonstrate whether a new animal drug is safe for the intended use and conditions of use.\n\nCVM encourages sponsors to request meetings early in the development plan to discuss options for presenting the available information, designing protocols, and determining viability of using literature to fulfill some or all of the target animal safety requirements.\n\nAppendix B Preliminary Information\n\nGFI #185 (VICH GL43), ""Target Animal Safety for Veterinary Pharmaceutical Products"" (April 2009), describes the use of knowledge about the pharmacology and toxicology of an investigational veterinary pharmaceutical product (IVPP) to assist in the determination of the types of studies necessary in the evaluation of the safety of an IVPP in the intended species under the proposed conditions of use; in the design (dose, frequency of dosing, overdose levels, durations of treatment, and endpoints) of such studies; and in the prediction of potential adverse effects. GFI #185 recommends the use of published literature, in addition to preliminary studies from target and non-target laboratory animal studies, as potential sources of the pharmacology and toxicology data.\n\n3.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA review of the published literature may provide information about the known pharmacologic and toxicological properties in target or non-target species of the drug, to include carriers, excipients, inactive ingredients, APIs, or about closely related compounds that may be useful in planning the target animal safety evaluation.\n\nInformation that may be useful includes the following:\n\nMechanism of action\n\nMechanism of toxicity\n\nToxicological syndrome/target organs or tissues\n\nClinical signs of toxicity/biomarkers of toxicity\n\nTime of onset and duration of clinical signs of toxicity\n\nVariability/tolerance among animals (species, breed, class, age, or other differences)\n\nSeverity, chronicity, and likelihood of toxic effects\n\nDifferences by animal age/life stage/production class/breed\n\nPharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics\n\nPotential for drug-drug interactions\n\nEffects of other diseases/conditions on toxicity\n\nEndpoints that can be collected from other required studies\n\nEffects on reproduction\n\nEffects at the site of administration (injection, topical, etc.)\n\nGenerally, a narrative literature review or a scoping review, rather than an SR, is appropriate for presenting the pharmacologic and toxicologic information to CVM for the purposes of supporting the target animal safety development plan and the design of safety studies.\n\n4 Literature to Satisfy Target Animal Safety Requirements\n\nThe safety of a new animal drug in the target animal is typically based on one or more non-clinical laboratory studies (margin of safety studies) and observations from field studies. As described in GFI #185, other specific studies, such as reproductive safety, injection site, or other specifically designed studies, may be needed to address the animal safety requirements. The need for these specific studies depends on the drug and the intended conditions of use.\n\nThe literature may provide information from target and non-target species, including laboratory animals, which may be used in lieu of the margin of safety study or other studies (injection site, reproductive safety, etc.) typically needed to satisfy the target animal safety requirements, a justification that typical studies (or certain endpoints within these studies) are not needed, an identification of information ""gaps,"" or theidentification of safety observations that could be obtained during the effectiveness study(ies).\n\nMargin of safety study.\n\nTypically, the margin of safety study includes multiples of the highest intended drug dosage (daily dose, frequency, and duration) where the study results demonstrate the margin of safety above the maximum dosage. The study must adequately demonstrate that the new animal drug is safe for the intended target animal/class under the proposed conditions of use, that the chosen endpoints are the most appropriate outcomes for the evaluation of safety, and that valid inferences can be drawn to the target population. The number of studies needed to assess overall safety, or a particular endpoint will depend on the size and number of studies, intended use/conditions of use, breadth of the indication, consistency of results, the quality of the studies, and/or the quality of the reporting of the studies.\n\nIn some cases, a sufficient amount of information exists in the published literature and/or in preliminary studies to either: (1) justify that a margin of safety study is not needed (negligible systemic exposure to the API and based on pre-existing knowledge in pharmacology and toxicology there is no safety concern30); or (2) perform an SR (+/- meta-analysis) which provides adequate information to determine the safety of the new animal drug in the target animal. The literature may provide a volume and variety of evidence that far exceeds the data traditionally available from a margin of safety study.\n\nFootnote 30: Per GFI #185, even if a margin of safety study is not needed, a safety study at the site of administration is recommended.\n\nb. Performing an SR to satisfy target animal safety requirements\n\nWhen considering literature to satisfy any or all animal safety requirements, and before developing the protocol, the sponsor should perform a high-level initial screen of available literature with considerations such as dose, formulation, endpoints appropriate for an animal safety evaluation, conditions of use, and inferential value for the target population. This screen should be performed in a way that minimizes bias in case a future SR and/or meta-analysis will be performed; the person or persons performing the high-level screening should not be involved in the design of the protocol for the conduct of the regulatory SR.\n\nAn SR of the literature may provide a broader overview of the safety of the drug in the target animal population when compared to a more comprehensive evaluation in a small number of individual animals (e.g., a laboratory margin of safety study). For some drugs and indications, an assessment under more variable conditions of use may be preferable for the evaluation of animal safety. Typical assessment of animal safety relies substantially on clinical outcomes, assessments of those outcomes, and impacts on the animal with regard to determining the margin of safety. Statistical analyses may be of more importance in identifying dose response trends or observations of most interest.\n\nFor an SR and/or meta-analysis to evaluate safety, the review question may be broad, to capture any abnormal observations related to administration of the new animal drug, or specific, to address a certain safety-related endpoint. An adequate target animal safety assessment will include the identification of target organs, where possible, and confirmation of the margin of safety for the labeled dosage regimen (dose, route, frequency, duration) in the intended species/class(es).\n\nThe SR should evaluate a specific formulation of drug produced in accordance with appropriate manufacturing practices. Formulation should be taken into consideration when selecting the studies that are appropriate for inclusion.\n\nA meta-analysis may not be appropriate for all submissions that include a literature or systematic review. Other types of analyses (i.e., a multicriteria decision analysis or a weight-of-evidence analysis) or a qualitative assessment may be more appropriate. The available information should be used to determine what conclusions can be drawn, such as an evaluation of the risk of adverse events or safety concerns for the animal associated with the use of the drug at the proposed dose under the intended conditions of use, and identify any gaps remaining in the target animal safety evaluation. Using the literature to develop a hazard characterization may be adequate to frame the further studies and study designs needed to meet the target animal safety requirements. The strength of support provided by the body of available literature is useful in determining the number and type of necessary studies and the potential adverse reactions or safety impacts that may be observed. If gaps are identified, the available information can be used to inform methods used to address the gaps and the design of one or more studies to address the gaps, which include alternative or non-traditional studies. Information from the literature may be used to inform the design of the margin of safety study in an evaluation and the prediction of potential adverse effects that may occur in the target species.\n\n4 Other Laboratory Safety Studies\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #106 The Use of Published Literature in Support of New Animal Drug Approvals'

Issued by: (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/cvm-gfi-45-guideline-uniform-labeling-drugs-daily-and-beef-cattle). Center for Veterinary Medicine\n\nRevised August 1993\n\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION CENTER FOR VETERIMARY MEDICINE\n\nThis Guideline represents the agency\'s position on a procedure or practice at the time of its issuance. This Guideline is not a legal requirement. A person may follow the Guideline or may choose to follow alternative procedures or practices. If a person chooses to use alternate procedures or practices that person may wish to discuss the matter further with the FDA/CVM to prevent an expenditure of money and effort on activities that may later be determined to be unacceptable. This Guideline does not bind the agency, and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, immunities, or benefits for or on any person. When a Guideline states a requirement imposed by statute or regulation, however, the requirement is law and its force and effect are not changed in any way by virtue of its inclusion in the guideline.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe objective of this uniform labeling initiative is to promote standard labeling that will be uniformly understood and interpreted by the user of dairy and beef cattle veterinary pharmaceuticals. Informational symbols are the tools that will be used to meet this objective.\n\nSymbolic representation of the following informational categories are presented in this document:\n\nPrescription versus Over-the-Counter marketing status\n\nIndications for Use by Class of Cattle\n\nMilk discard times\n\nSlaughter Withholding Times\n\nThis document is intended for the cooperative use of both the regulatory agencies and the animal pharmaceutical industry. The intent of this guideline, through its voluntary use, is to further control and reduce milk and meat residue violations and further promote the labeled use of dairy and beef cattle drugs. Labeling changes to incorporate the uniform labeling set out in this guideline are voluntary. Any revisions to the currently approved labeling, however, must be the subject of a supplemental new animal drug application and approved prior to use.\n\nGeneral regulations and considerations\n\nThe labeling requirements for both over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription (Rx) drugs are found in the Code of Federal Regulations Title 21. These requirements may differ, depending on the specific drug. As an aid to the user of this guideline, a summary of these regulations follows.\n\nSection 21 CFR Summary\n\nSS 1.24(b) Exempts veterinary injectable OTC drugs from the requirement of labeling contents in terms of the U.S. gallon, quart, pint and ounce, but rather, permits the net contents to be expressed in terms of liters, milliliters, or cubic centimeters. While this regulation provides for use of ""cubic centimeters,"" the Center prefers use of milliliter"" to express liquid quantities.\n\nSS 201.1 Provides for name and place of business of manufacturer, packer or distributor.\n\nSS 201.2 Provides for NDC number.\n\nSS 201.5 Discusses adequate directions for use on the label of an OTC drug.\n\nSS 201.17 Provides for the location of the Expiration Date.\n\nSS 201.18 Explains the significance of the Lot Number.\n\nSS 201.51 Net contents labeling requirements for a prescription drug.\n\nSS 201.62 Net contents labeling requirements for an OTC drug.\n\nSS 201.105 Veterinary prescription drug labeling requirements.\n\n23.8.25.2.37737 NOTE: The prescription veterinary product must bear the legend: ""Caution: Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian"".\n\nSS 211.137 Provides for the product expiration date.\n\nSS 211.130(b) Provides for the Lot Number.\n\nSS 329.10(d)(2) Labeling for chlorobutanol used as a preservative.\n\nSS 369.9 Warnings to keep the drug from children.\n\nSS 510.105 Milk discard provisions for drugs used in dairy animals.\n\nSS 510.106 Milk discard provisions for antibiotic-containing drugs intended for the use in milk producing dairy cattle.\n\nThese are the regulations which contain the primary labeling rules enforced by the FDA.\n\nThere are additional regulations issued by other agencies and individual states which may apply to drugs used in dairy cattle. Examples include the container disposal statement required by EPA, and the special statements required for registration by the State of California. Where warning statements are required because of state laws such as, ""Restricted Drug-Use Only As Directed"", it is recommended that the name of the state requiring such a restriction, be placed in parenthesis, e.g., ""Restricted Drug (California)-Use Only As Directed.""\n\nCVM Policy Guidance\n\nThe Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has additional guidance pertaining to labeling criteria.\n\nPolicy and Procedure Manual Guide 1240.4000 entitled ""Identification/Promotion of Product Approval"" provides for the label and package labeling to bear the statement, ""NADA..... #, Approved by FDA.""\n\nStatements such as ""For Veterinary Use Only"", ""Sales to Graduate Veterarians Only"" and ""Sold only to Veterinaries"" are often confused with the veterinary prescription legend. These statements should not appear on labels or package labeling. Alternatively, statements such as ""For Animal Use Only"" or ""Not for Human Use"" are acceptable.\n\nAny sulfamethazine - containing product intended for use in dairy cattle should bear the label statement ""Not for use in female dairy cattle over 2o months of age.""\n\nSymbolic Representation and Information Location\n\nGeometric Forms\n\n1. DIVIDED SQUARE FORMSa. Over-the-Counter versus Prescription Designation\n\n(1) Over-the-counter, designated by ""OTC"".\n\n(2) Prescription, designated by ""Rx"".\n\n(3) The Over-The-Counter or Prescription letter designation should appear on all symbols regardless of size of the square in the center of the symbol. The location of the letter designation is not interchangeable with other positions in the symbol.\n\n(4) The ""Rx"" symbol should appear on the labeling of those animal drugs that are required to bear the veterinary prescription legend ""Caution: Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian."" The ""OTC"" symbol should appear on the labels of animal drugs indicated for cattle that are not required to bear the veterinary prescription legend.\n\nb. Indications for Use by Class of Cattle\n\n(1) Lactating Dairy Cattle: An adult female dairy cow producing milk at the time of drug administration, designated by the letter ""L"".\n\n(2) Dry Cows: An adult female dairy cow in a non-lactating, i.e. ""dry"", state, at the time of drug administration, designated by the letter ""D"".\n\n(3) Heifers: Female dairy cattle under 20 months of age, designated by the letter ""H"".\n\n(4) Beef Cattle: Beef Cattle including dairy breed steers and bulls, designated by the letter ""B"".\n\n(5) Veal Calves: Bob Veal and Fancy Veal Calves, designated by the letter ""V"".\n\n(6) Calves: Beef and Dairy Calves excluding Veal Calves, designated by the letter ""C"".\n\n(7) Multiple classes of cattle should be represented for a particular drug product by shading and/or lettering the appropriate triangular sections. All sections within the symbol should be outlined as shown below. The triangular sections are not interchangeable and each individual position represents a particular class of cattle. For those labels which are too small to bear the cattle class lettering, shading only the appropriate triangular area(s) is acceptable. CVM encourages sponsors to incorporate the narrative description information into the labeling that is likely to accompany the unit being distributed to the user of the product.\n\nc. Recommended Symbol Locations\n\n(1) Front Main Panel: center bottom of carton.\n\n(2) Package Insert: top center, page one of the insert.\n\n(3) Vials: withdrawal symbols have priority.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\nCIRCULAR FORM\n\na. For drug residue warnings\n\n(1) Milk discard symbol.\n\n(2) Slaughter withdrawal symbol.\n\nb. Symbol Location\n\n(1) Back carton panel near Residue Warning Statement or (2) Package Insert below written residue warning statement and centered.\n\n(3) Front Center - Upper 1/4 of 5o lb. bag Mediated Feeds (only where written Residue Warning statements are required).\n\n(4) Vial label where possible.\n\nc. Other Considerations\n\n(1) The circular symbol and accompanying printed test should be used in addition to rather than in place of other residue warning symbols and information present on the label. Other residue warning symbols and information must remain on the label.\n\n(2) The circular residue warning symbols and accompanying printed text should be employed on all drugs even if the milk withholding and/or slaughter withdrawal times are zero.\n\nNOTE: The Residue Warning symbols for Lactating and Dry cows products should have light and dark shaded backgrounds, respectively. The purpose of these different shaded backgrounds is to control the accidental misuse of a lactating product in place of a dry cow product and vice versa. The color of the dark background is optional.\n\nSpatial and Size Relationships of Symbols and\n\nStatements\n\nThe divided square symbol should be isolated from the circular forms. Their size should be as large as possible but not so small that they are ineffective. Divided Square Forms\n\n1/2 inch X 1/2 inch minimum (basic square box)\n\nThe circular residue warning symbols should be placed in proximity to the written residue warning statements where possible. Their size should be as large as possible but not so small that they are ineffective.\n\na. 1 inch in diameter\n\nb. number in the wording should be at least 1/4 inch wide and 1/4 inch high.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #45 Guideline for Uniform Labeling of Drugs for Dairy and Beef Cattle']",['Provide a rationale for locations of dosimeters for dose mapping studies.'],0.0,0.0

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nFDA has developed this guidance document to assist industry in following appropriate human factors and usability engineering processes to maximize the likelihood that new medical devices will be safe and effective for the intended users, uses and use environments.\n\nThe recommendations in this guidance document are intended to support manufacturers in improving the design of devices to minimize potential use errors and resulting harm. The FDA believes that these recommendations will enable manufacturers to assess and reduce risks associated with medical device use.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this one, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Scope\n\nThis guidance recommends that manufacturers follow human factors or usability engineering processes during the development of new medical devices, focusing specifically on the user interface, where the user interface includes all points of interaction between the product and the user(s) including elements such as displays, controls, packaging, product labels, instructions for use, etc. While following these processes can be beneficial for optimizing user interfaces in other respects (e.g., maximizing ease of use, efficiency, and user satisfaction), FDA is primarily concernedthat devices are safe and effective for the intended users, uses, and use environments. The goal is to ensure that the device user interface has been designed such that use errors that occur during use of the device that could cause harm or degrade medical treatment are either eliminated or reduced to the extent possible.\n\nAs part of their design controls1, manufacturers conduct a risk analysis that includes the risks associated with device use and the measures implemented to reduce those risks. ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971, Medical Devices - Application of risk management to medical devices, defines risk as the combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of the potential harm2. However, because probability is very difficult to determine for use errors, and in fact many use errors cannot be anticipated until device use is simulated and observed, the severity of the potential harm is more meaningful for determining the need to eliminate (design out) or reduce resulting harm. If the results of risk analysis indicate that use errors could cause serious harm to the patient or the device user, then the manufacturer should apply appropriate human factors or usability engineering processes according to this guidance document. This is also the case if a manufacturer is modifying a marketed device to correct design deficiencies associated with use, particularly as a corrective and preventive action (CAPA).\n\nFootnote 1: 21 CFR 820.30\n\nFootnote 2: ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971:2007, definition 2.16\n\nCDRH considers human factors testing a valuable component of product development for medical devices. CDRH recommends that manufacturers consider human factors testing for medical devices as a part of a robust design control subsystem. CDRH believes that for those devices where an analysis of risk indicates that users performing tasks incorrectly or failing to perform tasks could result in serious harm, manufacturers should submit human factors data in premarket submissions (i.e., PMA, 510(k)). In an effort to make CDRH\'s premarket submission expectations clear regarding which device types should include human factors data in premarket submissions, CDRH is issuing a draft guidance document List of Highest Priority Devices for Human Factors Review, Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Guidanc\n\neDocuments/UCM484097.pdf) When final, this document will represent the Agency\'s current thinking on this issue.\n\n3 Definitions\n\nFor the purposes of this guidance, the following terms are defined.\n\nAbnormal use\n\nAn intentional act or intentional omission of an act that reflects violative or reckless use or sabotage beyond reasonable means of risk mitigation or control through design of the user interface.\n\nCritical task\n\nA user task which, if performed incorrectly or not performed at all, would or could cause serious harm to the patient or user, where harm is defined to include compromised medical care.\n\nFormative evaluation\n\nProcess of assessing, at one or more stages during the device development process, a user interface or user interactions with the user interface to identify the interface\'s strengths and weaknesses and to identify potential use errors that would or could result in harm to the patient or user.\n\nHazard\n\nPotential source of harm.\n\nHazardous situation\n\nCircumstance in which people are exposed to one or more hazard(s).\n\nHuman factors engineering\n\nThe application of knowledge about human behavior, abilities, limitations, and other characteristics of medical device users to the design of medical devices including mechanical and software driven user interfaces, systems, tasks, user documentation, and user training to enhance and demonstrate safe and effective use.\n\nHuman factors engineering and usability engineering can be considered to be synonymous.\n\nHuman factors validation testing\n\nTesting conducted at the end of the device development process to assess user interactions with a device user interface to identify use errors that would or could result in serious harm to the patient or user. Human factors validation testing is also used to assess the effectiveness of risk management measures. Human factors validation testing represents one portion of design validation.\n\nTask\n\nAction or set of actions performed by a user to achieve a specific goal.\n\nUse error\n--------------------\nContext title: Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineering to Medical Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.4.2 Factors relevant to application of the algorithm.\n\nThe factors listed below are intended to further illustrate the kinds of issues that may be relevant when determining whether a new combination product presents safety and effectiveness issues similar to those presented by a previous combination product, or which are the most significant safety and effectiveness questions presented by a combination product. We note that the list of factors below is not all-inclusive. Also, FDA may consider individual characteristics of the specific product. Such case-by-case analysis allows the Agency to take into account, for example, technological developments, evolving scientific understanding, and specific factual information concerning the particular product, such as its composition, or mechanism of action for achieving an intended use.\n\nThe following questions are not listed in order of importance; indeed some factors may be weighted more than others depending on various issues presented by each individual combination product. If you believe FDA may need to consider the algorithm in the assignment of your product (i.e., if your product\'s most important therapeutic action cannot be determined with reasonable certainty), then we recommend you consider and address these and/or other safety and effectiveness issues, as applicable, for your product:\n\nWhat is the intended use(s)/indication(s) for use of the product?\n\nWhat is the overall therapeutic effect(s) of the product as a whole?\n\nDoes a device constituent part incorporate a novel or complex design or have the potential for clinically significant failure modes?\n\nIs a drug constituent part a new molecular entity or new formulation?\n\nHas a generic version of the drug been approved under section 505(j) of the FD&C Act?\n\nDoes the drug have a narrow therapeutic index?\n\nIs the biological product constituent part a particularly fragile molecule?\n\nHow well understood are the product\'s constituent parts? Is one constituent part relatively common, while another presents more significant safety and effectiveness issues relating to the risks it poses, its effectiveness, or its novelty?\n\nWhich constituent part raises greater risks?\n\nHave any of the constituent parts been previously approved or cleared for the same or a similar use?\n\nIs there a new indication, route of administration or a significant change in dose or use of one of the constituent parts?\n\nAddressing the assignment algorithm in your RFDIf you cannot determine with reasonable certainty the most important therapeutic action of your combination product, you must recommend an assignment for your product based on the assignment algorithm at 21 CFR 3.4(b). See 21 CFR 3.7(c)(3). Under the first step, you should consider whether FDA regulates other combination products that present similar questions of safety and effectiveness with regard to the combination product as a whole. In other words, you should consider whether an FDA Center has direct experience with a combination product similar to yours. You should identify any such other combination products that you are aware of that you believe FDA should consider in determining the assignment of your product, and explain how your product is similar. For example, if you have developed a new drug for treating glaucoma that will be combined with a contact lens, and you are aware of other products reviewed by FDA that consist of a contact lens and another drug for this intended use, you should identify those products.\n\nIf you do not believe that your product as a whole is similar to other combination products that a Center has already reviewed or that you are aware a Center is currently reviewing, you should address the second step of the algorithm. Even if you believe your product is similar to another, we recommend that you explain how you think we should assign your product should we find it necessary to move to this second step in the algorithm. For this part of the algorithm, you should identify the most significant safety and effectiveness questions presented by your combination product, and explain, in your opinion, which Center has the most expertise related to those questions. For example, if this is the first time the Agency is presented with a vision-correcting contact lens containing a glaucoma drug, then, using the factors described above, you should explain, in your opinion, which Center has more expertise to answer these questions. In this case, you might explain that the most significant safety and effectiveness questions are related to the characterization, manufacturing, and clinical performance of the drug component, while the safety and effectiveness questions raised by the vision-correcting contact lens are considered more routine. Based on these criteria, you might recommend that CDER has the most expertise related to these issues.\n\n10 Schedule and Duration of Use.\n\nSection 3.7(c)(2)(x)\n\nYou must briefly explain how often and for how long your product is intended to be used. For example, if your product is a non-combination device that would be implanted in the body during one surgical procedure, you should state the duration for which it is implanted or if it will be implanted with the expectation that, as long as the device functions, it will remain in the body indefinitely. In other cases, such as with a wound dressing, for instance, an RFD might explain that the dressing should be used over a four-hour period, after which a change of dressing would occur if needed, with a maximum of six dressings to be used over a 24-hour time period.\n\nAnother example would be that your product is a drug to be delivered by a device every twelve hours over a period of time not to exceed 10 days.\n\n11 Dose and Route of Administration.\n\nSection 3.7(c)(2)(xi)\n\nAs applicable, you should briefly explain the dose (amount) of the drug or biological product (or constituent part) to be used, and how it will be used in or on the body. For example, for a combination product wound dressing consisting of a drug and device delivery system, you would identify the specific amount of the drug contained in the device, and that it would be applied topically to the specific type of wound your product is intended to treat. If your product is an injectable drug, you would explain that the delivery device would be used to inject a specific dose of the drug intramuscularly, intravenously, etc.\n\nEven if you believe your product is a device (containing no drug or biological products), it may be helpful to provide information about the dose or route of administration for the product. For example, if your product is an injectable product, such as a wrinkle filler, you should describe the amount of product being injected and the site of the injection.\n\n12 Related Products.\n\nSection 3.7(c)(2)(xii)\n\nIf you think there are other products like yours, or other products with related components, you must briefly explain what they are, how they are regulated, and their regulatory status (e.g., approved, investigational, etc.) so that we can consider them when classifying and/or making the assignment for your product. Please include the product application numbers when available (e.g., 510(k) or NDA number). You should explain any similarities or differences between these products and your product and state how these are relevant to the classification and/or assignment of your product.\n\nIf you are not aware of other products like yours or other products with related components, please state this.\n\n13 Other Relevant Information.\n\nSection 3.7(c)(2)(xiii)\n\nIf you think there is anything else we should consider when determining the appropriate classification and/or assignment of your product, you should explain that in this portion of your RFD. For example, literature references describing the product, its components, and its modes of action are often helpful.\n\n14 Sponsor\'s Recommendation.\n\nSection 3.7(c)(3)\n\nThe final section of an RFD must include your recommendation for the classification (drug, device, biological product, or combination product) and assignment (CBER, CDER, or CDRH) of your product.\n\nIf you believe your product is a non-combination product, you should state whether you believe it meets the statutory definition of a drug, device, or biological product and your rationale for this recommendation. Your classification recommendation should be based on the composition, mode(s) of action, and intended use(s) of your product. Based on this recommended classification, you should then state your recommendation as to which Center (CBER, CDER, or CDRH) should regulate your product.\n\nIf you believe your product is a combination product, you should state what type of combination product it may be (e.g., drug/device) and your rationale for this recommendation. Next, you should explain which Center (CBER, CDER, or CDRH) should have primary jurisdiction (the ""lead"") for regulation of your product. This explanation should be based on the composition, intended use(s), modes of action, and PMOA of the product. If you cannot determine which single mode of action provides the most important therapeutic action of the product, you must use the algorithm set forth in 21 CFR 3.4(b) to make your recommendation of ""lead"" Center (see Section 9 above).\n\nIf you are unclear whether your product is a combination product or a non-combination product, we recommend you provide an analysis for the product being a combination product and for being a non-combination product.\n\nAppendix F How can I limit my submission to 15 pages including attachments as required by the regulation, and still provide all the information FDA needs to make its decision?\n--------------------\nContext title: How to Write a Request for Designation (RFD) Guidance for Industry'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA or ""we"") developed this guidance to clarify our position regarding manufacturers appropriately and responsibly sharing ""patient-specific information"" - information unique to an individual patient or unique to that patient\'s treatment or diagnosis that has been recorded, stored, processed, retrieved, and/or derived from a legally marketed medical device - with that patient at that patient\'s request. This guidance provides information and recommendations to industry, healthcare providers, and FDA staff about the mechanisms and considerations for device manufacturers sharing such information with individual patients when they request it.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nIncreasingly, patients seek to play an active role in their own healthcare. FDA is aware that sometimes a patient will request that a manufacturer share with her information about herself that has been recorded, stored, processed, retrieved, and/or derived from a legally marketed medical device. FDA is issuing this guidance to clarify our position regarding manufacturers appropriately and responsibly sharing ""patient-specific information"" - information unique to an individual patient or unique to that patient\'s treatment or diagnosis that has been recorded, stored, processed, retrieved, and/or derived from a legally marketed medical device - with that patient at that patient\'s request. FDA believes that sharing ""patient-specific information"" with patients upon their request may assist them in being more engaged with their healthcare providers in making sound medical decisions.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nFor purposes of this guidance, ""patient-specific information"" is information unique to an individual patient or unique to that patient\'s treatment or diagnosis that has been recorded, stored, processed, retrieved, and/or derived from a legally marketed medical device. This information may include, but is not limited to, recorded patient data, device usage/output statistics, healthcare provider inputs, incidence of alarms, and/or records of device malfunctions or failures. For the purposes of this guidance, patient-specific information does not include any interpretations of data by the manufacturer aside from those interpretations of data normally reported by the device to the patient or the patient\'s healthcare provider. For example, results of individual component tests for specific analytes that comprise or are utilized in a cleared assay but have not been individually approved or cleared to test for those specific analytes are not ""patient-specific information"" for purposes of this guidance and so fall outside the scope of the guidance.\n\nGenerally, categories of patient-specific information may include, but are not limited to: (1) data a healthcare provider inputs in the device to record the status and ongoing treatment of an individual patient or (2) information stored by the device to record usage, alarms, or outputs (e.g., pulse oximetry data, heart electrical activity, and rhythms as monitored by a pacemaker). Patient-specific case logs entered into a medical device by a healthcare provider may be included under this definition. This information may be used to facilitate continuity of care, to create an adequate patient treatment history and current treatment profile, and to record information relating to medical device functionality.\n\nIV. Patient-Specific Information Sharing Policy\n\nIn many cases, patient-specific information from a medical device is accessible by the patient\'s healthcare provider and patients can contact their healthcare provider to obtain such information. Alternatively, patients may contact the manufacturer directly and request access to their patient-specific information. In general, although not required under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), manufacturers may share patient-specific information about a patient with that patient at that patient\'s request. In general, manufacturers may do so without undergoing additional premarket review in advance. FDA generally would not consider patient-specific information to be ""labeling,"" as defined in section 201(m) of the FD&C Act. FDA is aware that when manufacturers share patient-specific information with patients, manufacturers also may provide them with supplemental information or other materials (e.g., descriptions of intended use, benefit and risk information, instructions for use) that may be considered labeling. Any labeling is subject to applicable requirements in the FD&C Act and FDA regulations.\n\nWe are aware that some devices are designed to record or transmit information in a format that is not easily provided to the patient. Other devices record and retain information in a closed system that is not accessible by the manufacturer. In such circumstances, it may not be feasible for manufacturers to share patient-specific information with patients as doing so would require manufacturers to redesign devices or gain access to information they do not have.\n\nGenerally, if patient-specific information is shared with patients by manufacturers, it should be comprehensive and contemporary. For example, if a patient requests from a manufacturer a history of her own blood pressure measurements from a device, the data should include all available data up through the most recent measurement. Manufacturers may also format the patient-specific information to facilitate its usability by the patient.\n\nFDA recognizes the important role healthcare providers play in providing interpretation of and context to patient-specific information. FDA recommends that manufacturers advise patients to contact their healthcare providers should they have any questions about their patient-specific information.\n\nFinally, this guidance does not affect any federal, state or local laws or regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) (42 U.S.C. SS 300gg; 29 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. SS 1320d et seq.) and the associated HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164), which may otherwise be applicable to the provision of patient-specific information. Moreover, the guidance does not change FDA\'s policy and is not intended to supersede any other relevant policies and guidances regarding manufacturers\' communications about their devices.\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturers Sharing Patient-Specific Information from Medical Devices with Patients Upon Request Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'

Available at https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm517504.pdf. Additionally, the guidance document entitled ""Acceptance and Filing Reviews for Premarket Approval Applications (PMAs); Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,"" dated January 30, 2018, may provide useful information to manufacturers when preparing PMAs. Available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulation andguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm313368.pdf.\n\n4 Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE)\n\nAn HDE provides a regulatory path for devices that are intended to benefit patients with rare diseases or conditions. To be eligible for an HDE, a device must first be designated as a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD).26 Additional information about the HUD designation process can be found in the draft guidance document entitled ""Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Program; Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,"" dated June 13, 2018,""27 available at https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm389275.pdf.\n\nFDA understands that applicants may have questions prior to submitting a premarket application. We have established a structured process for managing the various types of requests for feedback prior to a premarket submission, referred to as ""Q-Submissions."" FDA has issued guidance that provides an overview of the mechanisms available toapplicants through which they can request feedback from FDA regarding potential or planned medical device IDE applications or other premarket submissions, such as PMA applications, HDE applications, De Novo requests, 510(k)s, and BLAs.28\n\nFootnote 28: See Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff: Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff, dated September 29, 2017, available at:\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm311176.pdf.\n\nIV Combination Products\n\nConsistent with section 503(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, added by the Cures Act, and the Agency\'s approach to simplifying and streamlining the regulatory requirements for combination products in general, single entity combination products are generally reviewed under a single application.29 Devices intended for use with a specific RMAT may, together with the RMAT, be considered to comprise a biologic-led combination product and be evaluated for marketing under a BLA in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), with consulting review by other center(s) as appropriate.30\n\nFootnote 29: Section 503(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353(g)(1)(B)) provides that FDA shall review combination products in a single application, whenever appropriate. Note that under section 503(g)(6) of the FD&C Act, also added by the Cures Act, a sponsor may choose to submit separate applications for the constituent parts of a combination product, unless FDA determines that a single application is necessary.\n\nFootnote 30: See SMG 4101: Inter-Center Consult Request Process, June 2018, available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/StaffManualGuides/UCM283569.pdf.\n\nSome devices that can be used with approved RMATs may be evaluated independently using premarket submissions pathways identified in section III.B of this guidance. Examples may include some devices used in recovery (e.g., surgical tools, syringes, apheresis collection devices), or delivery (e.g., syringe, catheter). When a separate premarket application for a device to be used with an RMAT is appropriate, FDA will apply the least burdensome provisions of the FD&C Act as noted above to determine the ""minimum required information"" necessary for marketing authorization of that device.\n\nIn some instances, the device constituent part of an RMAT that is a combination product may be separately packaged. Separate marketing applications for each product may be appropriate, particularly, for example, if the delivery device may ultimately be labeled for use with multiple RMATs that have similar characteristics and administration requirements. In instances where there are separate applications for the RMAT(s) and device(s), fulfillment of regulatory requirements may be simplified or streamlined to reduce or avoid redundancy. For example, when appropriate and legally permissible, clinical or performance data generated in association with studies of one product may be submitted to support certain aspects of the approval or clearance of other, related product applications. It may also be possible for one regulatory submission to cross-reference existing performance data in another regulatory submission when available and when such reference is permissible. FDA intends to apply the least burdensome concept and principles in the guidance entitled, ""The Least Burdensome Provisions: Concept and Principles; Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,"" datedFootnote 20: https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM085999\n\nFootnote 21: https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidanceDocuments/UCM085999\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFebruary 5, 2019,31 in determining the data and information necessary to support marketing authorization for the device for its intended use. FDA intends to apply these least burdensome concept and principles in the manner described regardless of how the device is presented for review, e.g., under a standalone application for more general use; or a constituent part, reviewed under a separate device application, of an RMAT that is a combination product; or under a single application for a combination product as a whole.\n\nFootnote 31: The draft guidance is available at:\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM085999\n\nV Factors to Consider for when a device may be intended for use with only one particular type of cell-based RMAT or with more than one type of cell-based RMAT\n\nRMAT designation is granted for a specific therapeutic product and specific intended uses.\n\nRMATs may represent a highly diverse group of products with distinct biological and physical characteristics. These characteristics, along with other factors such as target patient population (e.g., adult vs pediatric), intended use and conditions for use must be considered when determining which device, or devices, may be suitable for use with a specified RMAT or type of RMAT. These same factors will influence when a device may be limited to a specific intended use with only one particular cell-based RMAT or type of cell-based RMAT.\n\nRMATs are likely to differ with regard to characteristics that can impact the way they interact with different devices, which may affect the RMAT\'s safety and effectiveness. In the case of cellular products that are RMATs, including cellular products that are constituent parts of combination products, the interaction between cells and a device can have an impact on critical characteristics, such as cell viability, differentiation potential, activation state and ability to respond to stimuli after administration. Further, differences in physical characteristics such as cell size and sensitivity to shearing forces can directly impact the potential utility of a given device with a specific RMAT or type of RMAT. For example, it may not be possible to use a small bore catheter or pen/jet injector to deliver an RMAT that contains a large delicate cell type because the shearing forces may negatively impact cell viability. In contrast, an RMAT that contains a smaller, more robust cell type may require the use of a small bore catheter to facilitate delivery to a specific tissue site, but have special requirements to prevent the cells from adsorbing to the interior catheter surface or to each other, resulting in occlusion of the tip. Such factors along with the demonstrated performance will influence whether the device can obtain marketing authorization for a broader use or should be limited to use with a specific RMAT(s).\n\nBecause cellular products can possess extremely variable sensitivities to physical and chemical stimuli, it may be necessary to repeat testing to assess interactions of each new device-RMAT combination. To leverage compatibility data for a different device-RMAT combination, a detailed and specific scientific rationale for the applicability of this data would be needed. Sufficient compatibility data should be provided to the Agency prior to initiation of clinical trials.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Evaluation of Devices Used with Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapies Guidance for Industry'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: The objectives of this guidance are:\n\nTo describe the factors FDA will use in determining device type eligibility for review by 3P510k Review Organizations\n\nTo outline FDA's process for the recognition, rerecognition, suspension, and withdrawal of recognition for 3P510k Review Organizations\n\nTo ensure consistent quality of work among 3P510k Review Organizations through the Medical Device User Fee Amendments (MDUFA) IV commitments authorized under FDARA7 to eliminate the need for routine, substantive re-review by FDA.8 FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nFootnote 7: Pub L. 115-52\n\nFootnote 8: See Eliminating Routine FDA Re-Review of Third Party 510(k) Reviews. Available at https://www.fda.gov/media/116168/download.\n\n2 Background\n\nBasis for 3P510k Review Program\n\nOn August 1, 1996, FDA launched a voluntary third party 510(k) review pilot program for selected medical devices. Under this pilot program, all class I devices that were not 510(k) exempt at that time, and 30 class II devices were eligible for 3P510k review.\n\nOn November 21, 1997, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA) was signed into law. Section 210 of FDAMA9 codified and expanded the pilot program by establishing section 523 of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 9: Pub. L. 105-115\n\nOn July 9, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA)10 was signed into law and required FDA to establish and publish criteria to accredit, reaccredit, and deny reaccreditation of 3P510k Review Organizations that perform 510(k) reviews of eligible devices.\n\nFootnote 10: Pub. L. 112-144\n\nOn August 18, 2017, FDARA11 was signed into law and required FDA to issue guidance on the factors FDA will use in determining whether a class I or class II device type, or subset of such device types, is eligible for review by 3P510k Review Organizations, including the risk of the device type and whether the device type is permanently implantable, life sustaining, or life supporting, and whether there is a detailed public health justification for permitting the review by an accredited person of such device type. This guidance also addresses several MDUFA IV commitments by including an early interaction consult policy and clarifying criteria for rerecognition of 3P510k Review Organizations and the suspension or withdrawal of recognition.12\n\nFootnote 12: Through the MDUFA IV Commitment Letter, FDA commits to improving the 3P Review Program with a goal of eliminating routine re-review by FDA of 3P510k reviews: See 163 CONG. REC. S4729-S4736 (daily ed. August 2, 2017) (Food and Drug Administration User Fee Reauthorization), also available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/media/102699/download.\n\nAppendix B General Overview of 3P510k Review Program\n\nThe 3P510k Review Program is intended to support CDRH's mission to protect and promote public health by enabling FDA to focus its internal scientific review resources on higher-risk and complex devices, while maintaining a high degree of confidence in the review of low-to-moderate risk and less complex devices by 3P510k Review Organizations, and to provide manufacturers of eligible devices a voluntary alternative review process that may yield more rapid decisions on 510(k)s. See section 523(a)(3) of the FD&C Act. Figure 1 below provides a schematic overview of the 3P510k Review Program.13\n\nFootnote 13: Figure 1 uses IEC/IEC 19510: Information technology – Object Management Group Business Process Model and Notation (2013).\n\nUnder the 3P510k Review Program, 3P510k Review Organizations review a 510(k) submission and then forward their review, the 510(k) submission, and a recommendation (e.g., substantially equivalent (SE) or not substantially equivalent (NSE)) to FDA. FDA reviews the 3P510k Review Organization's memo and recommendation and makes a final decision on the submission. Section 523(a)(2) of the FD&C Act requires FDA to make a determination with respect to the initial classification within 30 calendar days14 after receiving a recommendation from a 3P510k Review Organization. The 510(k) Submitter pays the 3P510k Review Organization directly; no user fee is due to FDA for the 510(k) reviewed by the 3P510k Review Organization.15 A general principle of the 3P510k Review Program is that the 3P510k Review Organization is the conduit for communication to and from the 510(k) Submitter and to and from the FDA. This ensures the\n\nFigure 1: A General Overview of the 3P510k Review Program\n\n3P510k Review Organization is fully informed and that communications do not undermine their role.\n\nA 3P510k Review Organization must be recognized by FDA under section 523(b) of the FD&C Act to be eligible to participate in the 3P510k Review Program. FDA recognizes 3P510k Review Organizations16 to review 510(k)s for certain device types eligible for the 3P510k Review Program.17\n\nFootnote 16: For a current list of recognized 3P Review Organizations under the 3P Review Program, please visit FDA’s website at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfThirdParty/Accredit.cfm.\n\nParticipation by 510(k) Submitters in the 3P510k Review Program is entirely voluntary. Manufacturers who do not wish to use a 3P510k Review Organization may submit their 510(k)s directly to the FDA for review, through either the Traditional, Special, or Abbreviated Programs, as appropriate.18, 19, 20\n\nFootnote 17: For a current list of elegible devices for 3P review under the 3P Review Program, please visit FDA’s website at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfThirdParty/current.cfm\n\nFootnote 18: The guidance document describing the 510(k) Program is available on FDA’s website at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/510k-program-evaluating-substantial-equivalence-premarket-notifications-510k.\n\nAs described in this guidance, the 3P510k Review Program includes features designed to ensure a high level of quality in the review of 510(k)s by a 3P510k Review Organization and to minimize risks to public health. In evaluating a 3P510k Review Organization for recognition or rerecognition, FDA will consider the application, as outlined in Section VIII of this guidance, provided by a 3P510k Review Organization. In addition, FDA may consider past premarket review performance of the 3P510k Review Organization as described in Section VIII.B.21\n\nFootnote 21: The guidance document for the Special 510(k) Program is available on FDA’s website at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/special-510k-program.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThis guidance outlines FDA's current thinking on key aspects of the 3P510k Review Program, including:\n\nFDA's expectations for 3P510k Review Organization reviews of 510(k) submissions, including the policy for early interaction consults (see Section VI)\n\nFactors used to establish device type eligibility in the 3P510k Review Program (see Section V)\n\nRequirements and recommendations for recognition and rerecognition of 3P510k Review Organizations under the 3P510k Review Program (see Section VII)\n\nContent and format of a 3P510k Review Organization's application for initial recognition and rerecognition (see Section VIII)\n\nProcess for suspension or withdrawal of recognition (see Section IX)6. Leveraging the International Medical Device Regulators Forum's (IMDRF's) requirements for Regulatory Reviewers under the Good Regulatory Review Practices (GRRP) and the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP), as appropriate (see Section X)\n\nCurrently accredited 3P510k Review Organizations should submit their application materials for recognition in the manner described in SectionVIII of this guidance within six months of the publication date of this guidance.\n\nIV Definitions\n\nThe definitions provided below explain the terms used by FDA in the context of this guidance. These terms are not intended to be applied in any context beyond this document and the 3P510k Review Program.\n\nDevice Type: A device type or category as set forth in a section of the Code of Federal Regulations, as well as a subset of such device type, such as that set forth in a product code.\n\n510(k) Submitter: An entity or person that submits a 510(k) submission to a 3P510k Review Organization for the purposes of demonstrating substantial equivalence (SE) of that device to a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval (PMA).\n\nFinal Reviewer: An individual within the 3P510k Review Organization who oversees the review of a 510(k) submission throughout the entire review process. The Final Reviewer is a regulatory reviewer who meets the criteria of an IMDRF Regulatory Reviewer (defined below) and who is responsible for ensuring that final recommendations regarding the device made by the Product Specialist (defined separately) are appropriately evaluated, organized, and documented before documents are sent to FDA. This individual has sufficient authority and competence within the 3P510k Review Organization to independently evaluate the quality and acceptability of the 3P510k review documentation. The Final Reviewer is a separate individual from the Product Specialist.\n\nIMDRF: International Medical Device Regulators Forum\n--------------------\nContext title: 510(k) Third Party Review Program Guidance for Industry, Food and Drug Administration Staff, and Third Party Review Organizations""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAs described in this guidance, FDA intends to apply its regulatory oversight to only those software functions that are medical devices and whose functionality could pose a risk to a patient\'s safety if the device were to not function as intended. This approach to overseeing device software functions is consistent with our existing approach to overseeing medical device functionality of a product and the risks it poses to patients regardless of the shape, size, or the platform. FDA believes that this subset of device software functions poses the same or similar potential risks to the public health as currently regulated devices if they fail to function as intended.\n\nFDA strongly recommends that manufacturers of all software functions that may meet the definition of a device follow the Quality System35 regulation (that includes good manufacturing practices) in the design and development of their device software functions, and initiate prompt corrections to their devices, when appropriate, to prevent patient and user harm.\n\nFootnote 35: See 21 CFR Part 820.\n\nFor device software functions, manufacturers must meet the requirements associated with the applicable device classification. If the device, on its own, falls within a medical device classification, its manufacturer is subject to the requirements associated with that classification. A device software function, like other devices, may be classified as class I (general controls), class II (special controls in addition to general controls), or class III (premarket approval).36\n\nFootnote 36: See “Device Advice: Classify Your Medical Device” at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/overview-device-regulation/classify-your-medical-device.\n\nAppendix A Device software functions: Subset of software functions that are the focus of FDA\'s regulatory oversight\n\nSoftware functions may take a number of forms, but it is important to note that FDA intends to apply its regulatory oversight to only the subset of software functions identified below and in Appendix C. These software functions can transform a general-purpose computing platform or mobile platform into a regulated medical device by using attachments, display screens, sensors, or other such methods. Regardless of the mechanism behind the transformation, FDA considers such software to be device software functions.\n\nThe following are software functions that FDA considers to be device software functions subject to regulatory oversight:\n\nSoftware functions that are an extension of one or more medical devices by connecting37 to such device(s) for purposes of controlling38 the device(s) or analyzing medical device data.Examples of these types of software functions include: software that provides the ability to control inflation and deflation of a blood pressure cuff through a mobile platform and mobile apps that control the delivery of insulin on an insulin pump by transmitting control signals to the pumps from the mobile platform. In some cases, software that meets the definition of a device may be used in combination with other devices. In these cases, the device software function may be considered an accessory if it supports, supplements, and/or augments the performance of one or more parent devices. FDA\'s ""Medical Device Accessories - Describing Accessories and Classification Pathways""39 guidance document should be referenced for information pertaining to the regulation of accessories to medical devices.\n\nFootnote 39: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/medical-device-accessories-describing-accessories-and-classification-pathways\n2. Software functions (typically, mobile apps) that transform the mobile platform into a regulated medical device by using attachments, display screens, or sensors or by including functionalities similar to those of currently regulated medical devices. Software functions that use attachments, display screens, sensors, or other such similar components to transform a mobile platform into a regulated medical device are required to comply with the device classification associated with the transformed platform. * Examples of these types of software functions include: a software function that uses a mobile platform for medical device functions, such as attachment of a blood glucose strip reader to a mobile platform to function as a glucose meter; or attachment of electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes to a mobile platform to measure, store, and display ECG signals; a software function that uses the built-in accelerometer on a mobile platform to collect motion information for monitoring sleep apnea; a software function that uses sensors (internal or external) on a mobile platform for creating electronic stethoscope function is considered to transform the mobile platform into an electronic stethoscope; manufacturers of such a mobile app are required to follow the requirements of 21 CFR 870.1875(b) (Electronic stethoscope); and similarly, a software function that displays radiological images for diagnosis transforms the mobile platform into a Medical image management and processing system under 21 CFR 892.2050. FDA has cleared several mobile medical apps with attachments to a mobile platform. Specifically, patient monitoring mobile apps that monitor a patient for heart rate variability from a signal produced by an electrocardiogram, vectorcardiograph, or blood pressure monitor are classified as cardiac monitoring software under 21 CFR 870.2300 (Cardiac monitor (includingcardiotachometer and rate alarm)). Other mobile medical apps that use a hardware attachment or interface to a monitoring system that have been cleared include an automatic electronic blood pressure monitor under 21 CFR 870.1130 and a perinatal monitoring system under 21 CFR 884.2740.\n3. Software functions that become a regulated medical device by performing patient-specific analysis and providing specific output(s) or directive(s) to health care professionals for use in the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation, cure, or prevention of a disease or condition. Additionally, software functions that perform patient-specific analysis and provide patient-specific diagnosis or treatment recommendations to patients, caregivers, or other users who are not health care professionals. * Examples of these types of software functions include: software functions that use patient-specific parameters and calculate dosage or create a dosage plan for radiation therapy; Computer Aided Detection software (CAD) image processing software;40 and radiation therapy treatment planning software;41 software function that analyzes patient-specific medical information to detect a life-threatening and/or time critical condition, such as stroke or sepsis, and generate an alarm or an alert to notify a health care professional;42 software function that analyzes readings from a blood glucose monitor and alerts the user of readings outside a predetermined range; software function that analyzes an ECG waveform output from an FDA-cleared device to detect or diagnose arrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation).43 We believe that these types of software present the same level of risk to patients regardless of the platform on which they run. FDA encourages manufacturers of such device software functions that perform patient-specific analysis to contact FDA to discuss what, if any, regulatory requirements may apply. For additional examples see Appendix C. Footnote 40: 21 CFR 892.2050.\n\nFootnote 42: Similar to Example 12 in Section V.C “Examples of Device Software Functions” of the CDS Guidance\n\nFootnote 43: Similar to Example 20 in Section V.C “Examples of Device Software Functions” of the CDS Guidance\n\nFootnote 44: 21 CFR 892.2050.\n\nAppendix B Software functions for which FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion (meaning that FDA does not intend to enforce requirements under the FD&C Act)\n\nIn general, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for software functions that:\n\nHelp patients (i.e., users) self-manage their disease or conditions without providing specific treatment or treatment suggestions; or\n\n2 Automate simple tasks for health care professionals.\n\nSome software functions in the above categories and listed below may be considered device software functions, and others might not. For these examples listed below that are devices, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion because they pose a low risk to patients.\n\nThe following examples represent software functions for which FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion:\n--------------------\nContext title: Policy for Device Software Functions and Mobile Medical Applications Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff']",['The following examples further illustrate how factors 2 and 3 are applied:'],0.0,0.0

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance outlines FDA\'s regulatory approach for approval of Class III in vitro diagnostic devices, as well as certain licensed1 or certain cleared2 in vitro diagnostic devices in cases, when a previously approved, licensed, or cleared assay is migrating (i.e., transitioning) to another system for which assay performance has not been evaluated by FDA.2 In this guidance the term ""new system"" refers to the system (assay, instrument, and software) to which the assay is migrating from a previously approved/licensed/cleared system. The term ""old system"" refers to the system (assay, instrument and software) which was approved/licensed/cleared from which the assay is migrating to a currently unapproved/unlicensed/uncleared system.\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance does not apply to immunohematology tests licensed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance can be used for 510(k) devices where the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy (http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm) does not apply (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests) and devices for which transitioning to a new system presents specific concerns, either because of the nature of the analyte and indications, or because of the specific technology used.\n\nThis guidance is focused on the study designs and performance criteria that should be fulfilled in order for a sponsor to utilize the migration study approach in support of the change. FDA will review information from the sponsor, including results of analytical and comparison studies outlined in this guidance, as well as device descriptions and risk analyses, to determine whether the use of the approved/licensed/cleared assay with the new system may compromise safety and effectiveness of the assay. The guidance document describes information that we recommend you include in a PMA (premarket approval application) supplement, a BLA (Biologicals License Application) supplement, or a 510(k) (premarket notification). For devices regulated by OIR (Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health, within CDRH), sponsors may contact OIR, and for those regulated by CBER, sponsors may contact CBER to obtain feedback concerning study plans.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe FDA believes that the assay migration study paradigm discussed in this guidance provides a least burdensome scientific and regulatory pathway for manufacturers to transfer a previously approved or licensed assay with full clinical data from an old system to a new system (not approved. licensed, or cleared). The paradigm is suitable in cases when sufficient knowledge can be derived from the documentation of design controls, risk analyses, and prior performance studies on an old system.\n\nIf you make further modifications or iterations of the old or new system you should compare back to the original old system that has full clinical data when performing new migration studies. However, if the old system with full clinical data is no longer available please contact the appropriate FDA CDRH or CBER Division for further discussion.\n\nThe migration studies approach is related to the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy that FDA uses for many Class I and Class II diagnostic devices.3 Similar to that policy, migration studies rest on the premise that as platform changes are made throughout the lifetime of an approved, licensed, or cleared assay, smaller and more focused analytical and clinical data sets, along with prior knowledge of device design and performance, could allow for a determination that the safety and effectiveness profile of the modified system has not been compromised.\n\nFootnote 3: http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm.\n\nThe assay migration study paradigm is practical, risk based, and consistent with FDA\'s Critical Path Initiative, which is intended to help bring new medical products to market successfully and efficiently4. FDA believes that with proper control and review, migration studies will meet regulatory thresholds for premarket review in a manner that will be least burdensome for both companies and FDA while protecting public health.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThis guidance is intended to be applied, where appropriate, to licensed donor screening tests5 and approved (Class III) in vitro diagnostic assays, as well as 510(k) cleared assays for which migration to a new system presents concerns. Possible scenarios for assay migration are when the assay is being transferred from a manual system to an automated or semi-automated instrument system or from a semi-automated instrument system to a fully automated instrument system, or from one automated instrument system to another (and vice versa for all scenarios). A broad variety of methodologies may use the migration studies paradigm depending on what is known about the two Systems involved. Assay transfer may be from one approved, licensed, or cleared old system to a new system that has the same technical characteristics. However, if scientific evidence suggests migration studies may not be adequate to predict actual clinical testing performance on the new system, the assay migration paradigm should not apply and FDA will recommend that traditional evaluation studies be performed.\n\nFootnote 5: FDA does not believe that this guidance is suitable for use in its entirety when immunohematology tests (e.g., blood grouping, blood group antibody detection and/or identification, crossmatching) are being migrated because of the differences in assay methodology and results reading and interpretation as compared to the other assays and systems described in this guidance. If you believe that your immunohematology reagents and system can be evaluated using the criteria outlined in this guidance, contact the responsible review division in CBER. Immunohematology products are reviewed in the Devices Review Branch, Division of Blood Applications, Office of Blood Research and Review, CBER.\n\nAssay migration studies are ideally suited for test systems for which the assay output (raw signal) is a numeric result or is expressed as a signal to cutoff (S/CO). Devices for which a numeric output is not available might be more difficult to analyze and may not be suitable candidates for use of this approach.\n\nMigration studies would not be applicable to the following devices or to system changes that are generally considered significant, such as:\n\nsystems intended for over-the-counter use,\n\nsystems intended for prescription home use, or\n\ndevices that do not meet the Critical Considerations criteria stated below.\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What is a study?\n--------------------\nContext: Migration Studies for Qualitative Assays\n\nAnalytical Studies for Qualitative Assays\n\nThe evaluations described below are based on the idea that similar studies were conducted previously for the old system. If the study design of the analytical studies conducted for the old system were different from the design of the studies described in this guidance, please contact the FDA for feedback. If you believe that some of the studies outlined in this document do not apply to your particular device, you should present your justification for FDA review.\n\nWe recommend that you use fresh clinical specimens for all analytical studies. If this is impractical, in some cases you may substitute or supplement fresh clinical specimens with archived samples. If archived samples are not available, spiked or diluted clinical samples may be used. In some instances, use of otherwise contrived matrix-specific samples may also be appropriate; however these should mimic clinical specimens as much as is feasible. We recommend that you contact FDA if you wish to discuss appropriate sample types for these evaluations. The matrix of any of these alternative specimens should be the same as that specified by the intended use of the old system.\n\na) Performance at Low Analyte Levels\n\nYou should evaluate the performance of the assay on the new system compared to the old system at low analyte levels (e.g., with dilution panels and seroconversion panels).\n\nWhere available, assay performance at low positive analyte levels usingdilution panels should be based on international standards (e.g., World Health Organization (WHO) standards, Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) standards) and compared with the old system.\n\nIf available and appropriate, test well-characterized seroconversion panels similar in number and type to the panels originally used to support approval/licensure/clearance. The seroconversion panels should be run on both the old system and the new system.\n\n3.2.2 Precision\n\nThis section describes precision study designs including panel composition.\n\n(i) Composition of Precision Panel\n\nThe categorical result of a qualitative test is determined using the numeric test data and a cutoff(s) (e.g., a numeric threshold), which define numeric ranges that correspond to the final result categories. For a qualitative test with two categorical results, a cutoff (one threshold) is used to define positive and negative results of the test. When the observed numeric test data exceeds the threshold, the final result is considered positive (or ""reactive"", ""detected""). When the observed numeric test result is below the cutoff, it is considered negative (or ""not reactive"", ""not detected"").\n\nQualitative assays discriminating between two classes of subjects (non-diseased vs diseased) can fall into two groups: 1) assays used in situations where non- diseased subject samples have a true zero concentration of the analyte of interest, and 2) assays used in situations where non-diseased subject samples have a detectable analyte concentration. For the latter, the cutoff was chosen to optimize clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity of the assay based on a clinical data set. Appropriate precision panels for these two types of assays, as well as assays that produce equivocal results, and/or have a re-test zone, are discussed in more detail in (a)-(c), below:\n\n(a) When non-diseased subject samples have a detectable amount of analyte.\n\nFor the non-diseased subject samples that have a detectable amount of analyte the cutoff of the assay is higher than the limit of the blank. A useful characteristic of the cutoff is that a sample with a concentration (determined by the mean signal to cutoff value from a large a series of replicate measurements) at the cutoff yields a positive result 50% of the time and a negative result 50% of the time when a large number of replicates of that sample are run under stipulated conditions (see Figure 1 below). We denote this concentration as C({}_{50}).\n\nFor samples with concentrations exceeding C({}{50}), one expects to see positive results more than 50% of the time, and similarly for samples with a concentration below C({}{50}), one expects to see positive results less than 50% of the time. In this guidance we refer to an analyte concentration that yields, upon evaluating many replicates, a positive result 95% of the time (and a negative result 5% of the time) as a Low Positive concentration (C({}{95}) concentration). We refer to a sample concentration which yields a positive result 5% of the time (and negative result 95% of the time) as a High Negative concentration (C({}{5}) concentration). Samples with concentrations of analyte close to C({}{95}) and C({}{5}) as determined by the old system are recommended for the within-laboratory precision (see CLSI8 document EP12). The panel should consist of at least four members, as described below (also, see Figure 2):\n\nFootnote 8: Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute. CLSI documents referenced in this guidance are listed in Section XI of this document.\n\nA True Negative sample: a sample with a true analyte concentration of zero.\n\nA High Negative sample: a sample that repeatedly tests negative approximately 95% of the time and positive 5% of the time by the old system. One should expect that the same concentration tested by the new system will also produce negative results approximately 95% of\n\nFigure 1: Results of a qualitative assay (probability density function) for a sample with a concentration at the cutoff measured multiple times.\n\nthe time (C({}{5}) concentration as determined by the old system).\n* A Low Positive sample: a sample with an analyte concentration around C({}{95}) as determined by the old system. Repeatedly testing this sample by the old system should give a positive result approximately 95% of the time and a negative result 5% of the time. One should expect that the same concentration tested by the new system will also produce positive results approximately 95% of the time. Note that if the LoB is used as a cutoff, then the concentration C({}_{95}) is the same as the LoD.\n* A Moderate Positive sample: a sample with a concentration close to the cutoff, and at which one observes positive results by the old system approximately 100% of the time (e.g., a sample with a signal approximately two to three times the signal at the cutoff if the cutoff=1.0, or a sample with concentration approximately two to three times the 95% LoD if the cutoff is based on LoB).\n\nFor the details of how the C({}{95}) and C({}{5}) concentrations can be evaluated from the previous precision studies of the old system, see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 1. For the precision study of the new system, it is not necessary to have the High Negative and Low Positive samples at exactly C({}{5}) or C({}{95}) of the old system. If the High Negative and Low Positive samples in the precision study of the new system are close enough to the cutoff that the standard\n\nFigure 2: Relationship between percent of positive results and the analyte cutoff concentration.\n\ndeviation (or percent coefficient of variation (CV) is approximately constant over the range around the cutoff, the C({}{5}) and C({}{95}) of the new system can be evaluated from this precision study (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 1).\n\n(b) When non-diseased subject samples have a true zero analyte concentration.\n\nWhen non-diseased subject samples have a true zero analyte concentration there are two types of assays: (1) assays for which samples with zero concentration have a distribution of numeric signals and the cutoff of the assay is the limit of blank (with some type I error, for example, 5%); and (2) ultrasensitive assays for which samples with zero analyte concentration almost always have a negative assay result (type I error is close to zero). These two types of assays are discussed further in the two bullets below.\n\nConsider assays where samples with zero analyte concentration have a distribution of numeric signals and the limit of blank is used as a cutoff. In this case the concentration C({}{95}) is the same as the limit of detection (LoD) and zero concentration (no analyte present in sample) is C({}{5}) as illustrated in Figure 3, below. The precision panel should consist of at least the following three members: True Negative, Low Positive (around LoD) and Moderately Positive.\n\nFigure 3: Relationship between the percent of positive results and the analyte concentration where True Negative samples produce numeric results and the C({}_{95}) concentration is the LoD of the assay.\n\nFor ultrasensitive assays that employ, for example, a signal amplification methodology (e.g., real-time PCR), the following approaches for precision panel members are recommended. For ultrasensitive assays, the concentration range that spans High Negative (around C({}{5})) to Low Positive (around C({}{95})=LoD) is narrow with respect to the observed concentration range of clinical specimens. Due to this narrow range, it may be difficult to prepare a sample with C({}{5}) concentration. If less than 10% of all subjects positive by the old system have an observed concentration less than C({}{95}), then samples at the C({}{5}) concentration could be excluded from the precision panel. In this case, samples which compose the precision panel should include the following concentrations: True Negative, Low Positive (around C({}{95})) and Moderately Positive. If more than 10% of all subjects positive by the old system have an observed concentration less than C({}{95}), then samples which compose the precision panel should include the following concentrations: True Negative, Low Positive (around C({}{95})), samples in the range of C({}{20}) to C({}{80}) and Moderately Positive as illustrated in Figure 4, below.\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What is a study?\n--------------------\nContext: Migration Studies for Point Of Care (POC) Assays\n\nBefore preparing to use the migration studies approach for a POC assay, you should determine whether the assay is quantitative, qualitative or semi-quantitative, according to the definitions in this guidance. The migration studies should be conducted in the hands of intended users of the POC assays. You should contact the appropriate FDA CDRH or CBER Division to obtain recommendations about migration studies for a POC device.\n\nVII Other Studies\n\nDepending upon the unique characteristics of the qualitative, quantitative or semi-quantitative assay being migrated to the new system, the following studies may be called for. If not previously conducted for the old system, they should be performed for the new system.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf you determine that a study described below is not applicable for your system, you should describe your reasoning in detail in your application to FDA. FDA will consider such explanations on a case-by-case basis particularly for manual to semi-automated or automated system migrations.\n\nCarry-over or cross-contamination studies: The importance of repeating these studies on a new system can be ascertained by a thorough analysis of the new system. As mentioned in Section V of this document, block diagrams and side-by-side comparison tables would be beneficial in this determination. Changes to specific physical features such as a change in sample pipettor design or the layout of the new system could indicate the need for new carry-over studies. If a carry-over study for the new system is appropriate and the new design is sufficiently similar to the old system, the new study can be the same as previously used for the old system. Samples with high positive concentrations of analyte should be tested alternating with analyte-negative samples in patterns dependent on the operational function of the instrument. The concentration of analyte in the high positive samples should exceed 95%-99% or more of the results normally obtained in clinical samples from diseased patients in the intended use population. This testing should be done over multiple runs (at least 5 runs are recommended by the Commission of European Communities10). Footnote 10: Commission Decision 2002/364/EC of 7 May 2002 on common technical specifications for in vitro-diagnostic medical devices [Official Journal L 131 of 16.05.2002].\n\nMatrix equivalency and recovery studies: Presumptively, because there are no changes to the assay, there should be no new effects on the assay performance due to different matrices unless physical alterations of the new system could create such an effect. Similarly, recovery studies should not be affected by the migration of an assay from an old to a new system.\n\nInterfering substances studies: Presumptively, with no changes to the assay, there should be no new effects on the assay performance due to interfering substances.\n\nOn-board reagent/calibrator and sample stability studies: Unless there are physical or process changes to the new system, presumptively, there should be no effect on assay performance due to on-board reagent or sample stability.\n\nCross-reactivity studies: Presumptively, as there are no changes in assay components, a migration to a new system should have no effect on the existing cross-reactivity.\n\nHook effect studies: Presumptively, because there is no assay change, the parameters of the hook effect should be the same, unless physical alterations in the new system could create such an effect.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nVerification of kit control material and calibrators: Presumptively because there is no change to the assay, the control results and calibration ranges should remain the same, unless physical alterations in the new system could create new effects.\n\nIf new analyte-specific information requires new studies to bring the assay\'s performance characteristics up-to-date, please contact FDA for guidance.\n\nVIII. Molecular Assays\n\nThere are specific criteria that are unique to nucleic acid tests (NAT) and therefore NATs present additional specific concerns over serological and antigen assays:\n\nWhen appropriate, you should provide testing with panels showing a rise in viral titer over time from serial bleeds (viremic profile). Similar to seroconversion panels, they should have a minimum number of days between bleeds and begin with at least one negative bleed. They should be of clinical relevance to the appropriate individual marker.\n\nCarryover studies: Because of the increased risks of carryover due to the amplification methodologies utilized in molecular testing (e.g., PCR, TMA), you should perform carryover studies for all NAT migration studies.\n\nSample stability: Because of the nature of DNA and especially RNA, careful attention should be given to the stability of samples in relation to on-board storage and manipulation.\n\nSample processing: The processes of purification and extraction of DNA or RNA from clinical samples is critical to the success of molecular tests. You should evaluate any additions or modifications associated with the new system that could affect these processes.\n\nValidation of control material and calibrators: You should perform these studies on the new system due to the sensitive nature of molecular assays.\n\nFor molecular assays detecting multiple analytes, please contact FDA for further discussion.\n\nIX. Regulatory Outcomes\n\nShould the acceptance criteria noted in Sections VI.A.4 or VI.B.4 above be met, it would be appropriate for the sponsor to claim that the new system does not compromise the results as compared to the old system. It would not be appropriate to claim improved performance characteristics. It would also not be appropriate to compute clinical performance claims for the new system based on the migrationstudies described here, since these studies are analytical, rather than clinical. Should you wish to develop more extensive claims, the migration studies paradigm would not be an appropriate scientific approach.\n\nIf the acceptance criteria are not met and the aberrant performance could affect clinical management, you will be asked to perform a complete clinical study presenting the clinical performance of the assay on the new system.\n\nX Glossary\n\nFor the purposes of this document the following definitions are used. HTD referenced terms are based on the CLSI Harmonized Terminology Database.\n\nC({}_{\\$}): a concentration at which repeated tests of a sample with this concentration under stipulated conditions are 95% negative (or 5% positive) (see CLSI EP12-A2).\n\nC({}_{\\$}): a concentration at which repeated tests of a sample with this concentration under stipulated conditions are 95% positive (see CLSI EP12-A2).\n\nC({}_{\\$}): a concentration at which repeated tests of a sample with this concentration under stipulated conditions are 50 % positive (or 50% negative). Under ideal circumstances, C({}_{50}) will exactly equal the cutoff established by the manufacturer.\n\nCalibrators: a substance or device that is based on a reference preparation or in which the analyte concentration or other quantity has been determined by an analytical procedure of stated reliability. Calibrators are used to calibrate, graduate, or adjust a measurement [HTD].\n\nCarry-over: amount of analyte carried by the measuring system from one sample reaction into subsequent sample reactions, thereby erroneously affecting the apparent amounts in subsequent samples [HTD].\n\nControl material: a device, solution, or preparation intended for use in the quality control process to monitor the reliability of a test system and to evaluate its performance within established limits.\n\nCross-reactivity: the ability of a drug, metabolite, a structurally similar compound other than the primary analyte, or even unrelated compound to affect the assay [HTD].\n\nCutoff value (CO): for a qualitative test, the threshold above which the result of the test is reported as positive and below which the result is reported as negative.\n\nHigh negative sample (C({}_{\\$})): a sample with a concentration of analyte close to the C({}_{\\$}) as determined by the old system. This term is equivalent to a ""weak negative sample"" for example as used in the guidance document ""Recommendations for CLIA Waiver Applications for Manufacturers of IVDs"",\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo\n\ncuments/ucm070890.pdf.\n\nHook effect (high dose hook effect): effect of a suboptimal antigen-antibody reaction in which either the antibody or antigen is in excess resulting in an incomplete, or blocked reaction leading to a decreasing signal response at very high levels of analyte. It is used interchangeably with ""prozone effect,"" [HTD].\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nInterfering substances: endogenous (e.g., blood components, acidic polysaccharides) or exogenous (e.g., talc, anticoagulant) substances in clinical samples that can cause false-positive or false-negative results in a test system [HTD].\n\nLimit of blank (LoB): highest measurement result that is likely to be observed (with a stated probability) for a blank sample (a sample with concentration at or near zero) (CLSI EP17-A; [HTD]).\n\nLimit of detection (LoD): the lowest concentration of analyte that can be reported to be present at a specified level of confidence, although perhaps not quantified to an exact value. Similarly, an amount of analyte in a sample for which the probability of falsely claiming the absence is (\\beta) (type II error) given a probability (\\alpha) (type I error) of falsely claiming its presence (CLSI EP17-A; [HTD])\n\nLimit of quantitation (LoQ): the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be quantitatively determined with {stated} acceptable precision and {stated, acceptable} accuracy, under stated experimental conditions (CLSI EP17-A; [HTD]).\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What is a study?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 22: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/assay-migration-studies-vitro-diagnostic-devices.\n\nOption 3: As an alternative to comparison study designs, for certain test systems, flex and human factors engineering studies may provide sufficient assurance that the change in user populations and environment of use between non-waived and waived settings will not adversely impact the results provided by the candidate test; i.e., that the likelihood of erroneous results by the users is negligible. Possible study design approaches that may be suitable include flex study designs described in section IV above and human factor study designs described in FDA\'s guidance ""Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineeringto Medical Devices.""23 FDA believes this approach is generally appropriate for test systems for which:\n\nFootnote 23: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/applying-human-factors-and-usability-engineering-medical-devices.\n\ncollection of a specimen is either always performed by a professional (for example, an endocervical swab collected by a doctor) or always by a patient (for example, a urine specimen collected by the patient), and\n\nother pre-analytical steps are very simple (for example, placement of the entire specimen in the analyzer), and\n\nintended use patient populations are sufficiently similar.\n\nAdditionally, another scenario where this option may be appropriate is a CLIA waiver application for a modification of a previously waived test system where the Quick Reference Guide was not modified (or minimally modified). FDA encourages manufacturers considering modification of a test system previously waived by application to contact FDA through a Pre-Submission to discuss planned modifications, as well as study designs and analyses to validate that the modified test system meets the statutory criteria for CLIA waiver.24\n\nFootnote 24: A Pre-Submission is a type of Q-Submission. For information regarding the process for obtaining feedback from the FDA, see the guidance “Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.\n\nOption 4: Comparison study designs in which the results of the candidate test in the hands of untrained operators are directly compared to the results of an appropriate comparative method in the hands of trained operators. This option is also useful for Dual Submissions where a 510(k) and CLIA waiver are being sought concurrently.\n\nFor general recommendations on comparison study design and analysis for Options 1 and 4, we recommend you follow appropriate FDA-recognized consensus standards, such as:\n\nFor quantitative tests: CLSI EP21,25 CLSI EP27.26 Footnote 25: CLSI EP21 Evaluation of Total Analytical Error for Quantitative Medical Laboratory Measurement Procedures.\n\nFor qualitative tests: CLSI EP12.27 Footnote 26: CLSI EP27 How to Construct and Interpret an Error Grid for Quantitative Diagnostic Assays.\n\nFor Options 1, 2, and 4, if sufficient valid scientific evidence on the imprecision of the test and the performance of the test at low levels (limit of detection and limit of quantitation) when performed by untrained operators is not available from the studies described above, additional studies should be performed to allow comparison of the imprecision and limit of detection/limit of quantitation of the test when performed by untrained and trained operators. We recommend following appropriate FDA-recognized consensus standards (e.g., CLSI EP05,28 CLSI EP12, CLSI EP1729) for these studies.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApplicants are strongly encouraged to submit a Pre-Submission to obtain feedback from FDA on planned study designs prior to conducting the study. FDA welcomes discussion of additional study design approaches besides the four options presented in this guidance.30\n\nFootnote 30: For information regarding the process for obtaining feedback from the FDA, see the guidance “Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The O-Submission Program,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.\n\nAppendix B Considerations in Satisfying CLIA Waiver Requirements\n\nOne statutory criteria that a test can meet to obtain a CLIA waiver centers on the simplicity of the test and whether the user can conduct the test with a negligible likelihood of erroneous results.31 All tests have some likelihood of erroneous results, but whether the likelihood of erroneous results in the hands of waived test users is negligible will vary from test to test depending on a number of factors. These factors include intended use, context of use (e.g., patient population, use environment), and the probable benefit(s) and probable risk(s)/harm(s) associated with waived use of the test. FDA intends for its approach to benefit-risk considerations to be consistent with the principles expressed, to the extent applicable, in FDA\'s other guidances.32 Accordingly, the appropriate acceptance criteria for the studies performed using the design options described above will vary from test to test. For example, for a qualitative test performed following study Options 1 or 2, the minimum level of agreement between results of the test in the hands of untrained and trained users for demonstrating comparable performance should generally be higher for a test for which erroneous results in waived settings are associated with a higher extent of probable patient risk/harm than for tests with lower probable risk/harm in waived settings.\n\nFootnote 31: 42 U.S.C. § 263a(d)(3)(A).\n\nFootnote 32: See, for example, “_Benefit-Risk Factors to Consider When Determining Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications (510(k)) with Different Technological Characteristics,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/benefit-risk-factors-consider-when-determining-substantial-equivalence-premarket-notifications-510k, and “_Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/factors-consider-when-making-benefit-risk-determinations-medical-device-premarket-approval-and-de.\n\nAppendix C General Study Design Considerations\n\nFor all study design options, FDA recommends that applicants evaluate test performance in settings designed to replicate, as closely as possible, actual CLIA-waived settings, patients, samples, and test operators. Therefore, study designs should include the following:\n\nTesting sites that are representative of the intended use of the waived test.\n\nSubject populations that are representative of the intended patient population(s).\n\nIntended sample type and matrix.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nUntrained operators representative of those at intended waived settings. We encourage you to enroll operators with the least amount of training that might be encountered at the types of sites for which this device is intended.\n\nTesting should be integrated into the daily workflow of the facility where the operators are often multitasking between patient care, testing, and other duties.\n\nTesting sites\n\nYou should conduct the study to support CLIA waiver at a minimum of three sites that are representative of both the intended use patient population and the intended operators in CLIA-waived settings. Generally, the sites should include different demographic and geographic locations (e.g., outpatient clinic, physician\'s office), since patient populations and intended operators typically vary among different demographic locations. In your CLIA waiver application, you should present a brief description of each site, including its name, address, and the date the study was performed. If there were sites that were included at the beginning, but then did not complete the study, you should provide a brief explanation for why those sites did not complete the study.\n\nFor study Options 1 and 2, trained operators may perform testing at the same sites as the untrained operators, or at a different laboratory site. For study Option 4, trained operators should perform testing with the comparative method at an appropriate laboratory site.\n\nOperators\n\nUntrained operators\n\nThe study should include 1-3 untrained operators at each site and at least nine (9) untrained operators across all sites. You should ensure that the untrained operator study participants enrolled represent anticipated operators of the device you propose for CLIA waiver. Untrained operators should have limited or no training or hands-on experience in conducting laboratory testing and should not have previous training or experience with the candidate test, but may have limited experience with other waived or home use tests. Untrained operators should be personnel currently employed in the selected intended use sites and testing should be integrated into the daily workflow of the facility where the operators are often multitasking between patient care, testing, and other duties. We recommend that you record and tabulate the education (including experience and training) and the occupation of each untrained operator to demonstrate that these participants meet the definition of intended operators and include this in your CLIA waiver application. In addition, for each study site, we recommend you report the same information on other personnel that were available at the testing site but that were not chosen to participate.\n\nTrained operators\n--------------------\nContext title: Recommendations for Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) Waiver Applications for Manufacturers of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'

FDA encourages sponsors to use the streamlined process described in this guidance when possible to reduce administrative burden on sponsors and FDA and to maintain the current level of regulatory review.\n\nFootnote 2: 21 CFR 812.2(c).\n\nA study involving an investigational IVD that is determined to be NSR must follow the abbreviated requirements outlined in 21 CFR 812.2(b).3 A study involving an investigational IVD that is determined SR requires an IDE application to be submitted and is subject to the full IDE requirements.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\nIII Description of the Streamlined Submission Process\n\nThe sponsor should submit to the appropriate center (CBER or CDER) all information about the oncology codevelopment program (including information about the investigational IVD) in the trial protocol for the IND. As part of the IND review, CBER or CDER will consult with CDRH or CBER, as appropriate, and determine if the investigational IVD is SR, NSR, or exempt. The sponsor should consider the following for the submission:\n\nOne sponsor should take the lead in communicating with FDA about the IND. FDA intends to communicate all feedback (including feedback about the investigational IVD) to the same lead sponsor. Sponsors should consider the following:\n\nIn the case where multiple IVDs are used in the oncology therapeutic trial, the drug and IVD sponsors should determine who will serve as the lead sponsor for communications with FDA\n\nThe lead sponsor should ensure that FDA receives appropriate letters of authorization to cross-reference the premarket submissions or incorporate relevant content by reference\n\nThe list below highlights how a sponsor should present information in the original IND submission to facilitate the streamlined submission process, when applicable:\n\nOn Form FDA 1571, Investigational New Drug Application, (in section 11 under ""Other""), sponsors should include the text Streamlined IVD SRD to indicate the intent to utilize the streamlined submission process. A sponsor also can include this information in a cover letter if the sponsor intends to submit a cover letter with the IND and indicate which section(s) of the electronic common technical document contains relevant information.\n\nIn the protocol submitted to the IND,6 a sponsor should include information about how the IVD will be used in the trial; however, detailed information about the performance of the device is generally not required. Types of information to add to the protocol include the following:\n\nDescription of the device\n\nHow the results from the investigational IVD will be applied in the clinical trial\n\nA description of the population and information regarding what is known about the prevalence of the biomarker (evaluated by the investigational IVD) in the patient population\n\nThe specimen type that will be collected for investigational IVD testing (including the anatomical site) and whether any biopsy conducted exclusively for\ninvestigational IVD testing could present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of the subject7 Footnote 7: 21 CFR 812.3(m). * By signing Form FDA 1571 (section 17) sponsors provide assurance of an institutional review board review of the complete clinical trial protocol and activities for the investigational IVD and the investigational drug.8 FDA recommends that informed consent documents reviewed by the IRB address any risks associated with the trial, including the consequences of an incorrect biomarker test result from the investigational IVD during the screening phase as well as risks associated with the investigational drug. Footnote 8: See 21 CFR 312.66 for investigational drugs and 21 CFR 812.62 for investigational IVDs.\n\nWithin the 30-day review time for the IND, CBER or CDER will consult with CDRH or CBER, as appropriate, and determine if the use of the investigational IVD in the clinical trial is SR, NSR, or exempt. If the investigational IVD is NSR, CBER or CDER will confirm the NSR determination in an appendix to the Study May Proceed Letter, which may also include a statement such as ""You should ensure that NSR procedures are used in obtaining any biopsies taken for testing with the investigational IVD and submit unanticipated adverse device effect reports to the IND."" If the investigational IVD is SR, CBER or CDER will confirm the SR determination in the Study May Proceed Letter and will ask the sponsor to submit an IDE application to CDRH or CBER and to wait to initiate the trial until after the IDE is approved. If the investigational IVD is exempt from IDE requirements, CBER or CDER will confirm the exempt status in the Study May Proceed Letter.\n\n3 Glossary\n\nExempt device\n\nA device that is used in a manner consistent with the criteria for an exempt investigation as outlined in 21 CFR 812.2(c).\n\nInvestigational in vitro diagnostic (IVD)\n\nAn investigational IVD is an IVD ""that is the object of an investigation"" (21 CFR 812.3(g)). An investigation is defined as a ""clinical investigation or research involving one or more subjects to determine the safety or effectiveness of a device"" (21 CFR 812.3(h)). A subject is defined as ""a human who participates in an investigation, either as an individual on whom or on whose specimen an investigational device is used on or as a control"" and ""may be in normal health or may have a medical condition or disease"" (21 CFR 812.3(p)).\n\nInvestigational device exemption (21 CFR 812)\n\nAn exemption that permits a sponsor to lawfully ship a device that otherwise would be required to comply with a performance standard or to have premarket approval. The exemption is for the purpose of conducting investigations of that device.\n\nInvestigational new drug (21 CFR 312.3)\n\nA new drug or biological product used in a clinical investigation. The term also refers to a biological product that is also an IVD used in a clinical investigation.\n\nNoninvasive\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigational In Vitro Diagnostics in Oncology Trials- Streamlined Submission Process for Study Risk Determination Guidance for Industry']","['Study - as used in this document, covers the systematic evaluations conducted in the development of an IVD product, including the feasibility, analytical assessments, method comparison, and evaluations to determine clinical utility of a product.']",0.5888888888692593,0.0

FDA will also seek to minimize, though not necessarily avoid, missing additional application goal dates due to travel restrictions during the COVID-19 public health emergency. These objectives will also be balanced with the effort to reduce any backlog of assigned inspections.\n\nAppendix B Manufacturing and Supply Chain Change Requests\n\nThe following questions and answers are intended to provide information regarding common queries related to changes in manufacturing facilities for approved pharmaceutical products.\n\nQ8: How do I add or change a facility in my application in response to supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nA8: Refer to the established guidance documents listed in section V. References, for changing or adding a facility to your application.\n\nIf your marketing application19 relates to the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 or to a drug that is on FDA\'s drug shortage list,20 the cover letter to the submission should clearly state ""Priority Review Requested"" and should include information to support your priority review designation request. If the product could enter, or is currently in drug shortage, also contact CDER DRUG SHORTAGES (DRUGSHORTAGES(rFDA.HHS.GOV). See https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/drug-shortages for more information. For products regulated by CBER, contact cbershortage(r)fda.hhs.gov. Except as described above, FDA intends to continue following the procedures outlined in relevant Manuals of Policies and Procedures (MAPPs) and Standard Operating Procedures and Policies (SOPPs).21\n\nQ9: What data are required to support manufacturing process or facility changes needed to address disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nA9: Refer to the Agency\'s existing guidance documents on making changes to an approved marketing application, as well as scale-up and postapproval change guidance documents for specific dosage forms (see section V. References). Should circumstances resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic warrant atypical or flexible submission strategies, for CDER-regulated products, contact CDER-OPQ-Inquiries@fda.hhs.gov; for CBER-regulated products, contact the office responsible for the product\'s regulation for further assistance.\n\nQ10: How can the implementation of postapproval manufacturing changes to an ANDA, NDA, or BLA for products needed during the COVID-19 pandemic be accelerated?\n\nA10: FDA is using multiple tools to facilitate implementation of manufacturing changes such as risk-based reduction in supplement reporting categories and flexible assessment practices.\n\nConsistent with FDA\'s regulations for marketing applications related to postapproval chemistry, manufacturing, and controls changes, FDA may consider available information and approaches to mitigate the risk to product quality associated with the change to support a reporting category for certain supplements that is lower than what otherwise would be most suitable (if such information and risk-mitigation approaches were not provided). During this public health emergency, FDA is willing to consider requests from applicants to submit certain changes using a lower reporting category based on such risk-mitigation information for marketing applications related to products in shortage or intended to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent COVID-19.\n\nBefore submitting a supplement with a lower reporting category, applicants should contact FDA for feedback and concurrence. For CDER-regulated products, applicants should contact CDER-OPO-Inquiries@fda.hhs.gov. For CBER-regulated products, applicants should contact the office responsible for the product\'s regulation.\n\nIf the product could enter, or is currently in, drug shortage, include CDER DRUG SHORTAGES (DRUGSHORTAGES((\\underline{\\text{DRUGSHORTAGES}})@FDA.HHS.GOV) for products regulated by CDER and cbershortage@fda.hhs.gov for products regulated by CBER.\n\nApplicants wishing to request a lower supplement reporting category should clearly provide (1) their rationale, (2) supporting information, and (3) risk-mitigation approaches, because this information is needed to consider a reduction in reporting category.\n\nFDA may additionally implement flexible assessment practices such as expediting assessment of supplements, adjusting submission data requirements as part of a risk-benefit assessment, and using additional tools when determining the need for inspections.\n\nCan I submit an application if it includes facilities in regions that are impacted by COVID-19-related travel restrictions?\n\nYes. Reference in an application to a facility in a region impacted by COVID-19 travel restrictions does not preclude submission to FDA.\n\nIV For Additional Information\n\nFor additional questions about manufacturing and supply chain changes, contact CDER-OPO-Inquiries_a_fda.hhs.gov, or for CBER, contact the office responsible for the product\'s regulation. Include ""COVID-19 inquiry"" in the subject line of the email.\n\nV References [22, 23, 24] Draft and Final Guidances\n\n[1]Changes to an Approved Application for Specified Biotechnology and Specified Synthetic Biological Products (July 1997)\n\n[2]Changes to an Approved Application: Biological Products (July 1997)\n\n[3]Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA; Questions and Answers (January 2001)\n\n[4]Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA (April 2004)\n\n[5]CMC Postapproval Manufacturing Changes To Be Documented in Annual Reports (March 2014)\n\n[6]Changes to an Approved Application: Biological Products: Human Blood and Blood Components Intended for Transfusion or for Further Manufacture (December 2014)\n\n[7]CMC Postapproval Manufacturing Changes for Specified Biological Products To Be Documented in Annual Reports (August 2017)25_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nChemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved Application: Certain Biological Products (December 2017)26 Footnote 26: When final, this guidance will represent the FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nRemote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (April 2021)\n\nScale-Up and Postapproval Changes Guidances\n\nImmediate Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms; Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls, In Vitro Dissolution Testing, and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation (November 1995)\n\nSUPAC-IR: Questions and Answers about SUPAC-IR Guidance (February 1997)\n\nNonsterile Semisolid Dosage Forms; Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Release Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation (May 1997)\n\nSUPAC-MR: Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms; Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Dissolution Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation (September 1997)\n\nSUPAC: Manufacturing Equipment Addendum (December 2014)\n\nManual of Policies and Procedures\n\nMAPP 5240.3 Rev. 5 Prioritization of the Review of Original ANDAs, Amendments, and Supplements\n\nMAPP 5310.3 Rev. 1 Requests for Expedited Review of New Drug Application and Biologics License Application Prior Approval Supplements Submitted for Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes\n\nStandard Operating Procedures and Policies\n\nSOPP 8401 Administrative Processing of Original Biologics License Applications (BL4) and New Drug Applications (NDA)\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats such as emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to describe how we will request and conduct voluntary remote interactive evaluations at facilities2 where drugs3 are manufactured, processed, packed, or held; facilities covered under FDA\'s bioresearch monitoring (BIMO) program; and outsourcing facilities registered under section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nFootnote 2: In this guidance, the term facility covers persons, sites, and establishments subject to FDA drug manufacturing and bioresearch monitoring regulations and statutory authority.\n\nFootnote 3: In this guidance, the term drug includes biologics.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]\n\nconduct an evaluation. In this guidance, we refer to our use of any combination of these interactive tools as a remote interactive evaluation. FDA may request to conduct a remote interactive evaluation prior to or following other types of regulatory oversight activities (e.g., an inspection or a request for records or other information).7\n\nFootnote 7: A remote interactive evaluation is not the same as an inspection as described in section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act or a request for records or other information in advance of or in lieu of an inspection, as described in section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act. Similarly, a remote interactive evaluation or a request under section 704(a)(4) does not constitute an inspection for purposes of section 510(h)(3) of the FD&C Act. Section 704(a)(4) does not apply to every inspection program covered by this guidance (e.g., section 704(a)(4) does not apply to the BIMO inspection program). Failure to cooperate with either an inspection or a 704(a)(4) request for records or other information may constitute a limiting of inspection and as a result, FDA may deem the relevant drugs manufactured at these establishments adulterated. See the guidance for industry Circumstances that Constitute Delaying, Denying, Limiting, or Refusing a Drug Inspection (October 2014) for further information.\n\nIII Planning a Remote Interactive Evaluation\n\nFDA may request to conduct a remote interactive evaluation whenever a program office determines it is appropriate based on mission needs and any travel limitations. FDA conducts inspections for many purposes and programs, and we will consider each of those inspection program areas as possible candidates for a remote interactive evaluation. This policy applies to all drug inspection programs including, but not limited to:\n\nPre-Approval Inspections (PAIs) and Pre-License Inspections (PLIs): FDA may perform a PAI or PLI to assess a marketing application. FDA uses these inspections to ensure that any facility named or referenced in support of an application can perform the proposed manufacturing operations in conformance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements, to verify conformance with the application, and to confirm that data submitted in the application are accurate and complete.\n\nPost-Approval Inspections (PoAIs): PoAIs focus on a specific drug and changes to its manufacturing operations, the evaluation of process validation, any changes submitted to the application, and the execution of supporting activities according to application commitments and CGMP requirements.\n\nSurveillance Inspections: Surveillance drug quality inspections examine overall operations, including controls that ensure manufacturing processes produce quality drugs, thereby reducing the risk of adulterated or misbranded drugs reaching consumers and patients. FDA uses surveillance inspections to evaluate the CGMP compliance of manufacturing operations. Surveillance inspections are performed at active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product manufacturing facilities, as well as outsourcing facilities that have registered with FDA under section 503B of the FD&C Act.\n\nFollow-Up and Compliance Inspections: When a specific drug quality problem or facility issue comes to FDA\'s attention, we may initiate a follow-up or compliance drug quality inspection. For example, FDA may conduct an inspection to investigate: (1) product safety, effectiveness, or quality concerns arising from defect reports; (2) information provided by an informant about a facility; (3) violata facility that were discovered during the inspection of another facility; or (4) corrective actions undertaken by a facility in response to, for example, a warning letter or regulatory meeting.\n--------------------\nContext title: Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry'

FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to provide answers to frequently asked questions about regulatory and policy issues related to inspections, pending drug applications, and changes in manufacturing facilities for approved pharmaceutical products.1 This document updates the guidance of the same title issued in August 2020, and revised in January 2021.\n\nFootnote 1: In this guidance, the terms drug and pharmaceutical product include biological products.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS) (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\nFDA has issued guidance on how to implement manufacturing process and facility changes; relevant guidances that describe the process for reporting changes to an application can be found in section V. References. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), and the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) remain fully capable of continuing daily activities, such as application assessments, including facility evaluation and certain inspection activities, while responding to public health needs related to the current COVID-19 pandemic. As this remains an evolving and very dynamic situation, FDA will continue to be flexible and as transparent as possible.\n\nInspections\n\nThe following questions and answers are intended to provide information regarding common queries related to inspections for facilities manufacturing pharmaceutical products and sites involved in the conduct of clinical, analytical, and nonclinical studies.\n\nQ1: How are inspections impacted by COVID-19?\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA has continued, on a case-by-case basis, to conduct mission-critical inspections and other activities to ensure that FDA-regulated pharmaceutical products are meeting applicable FDA requirements.\n\nIn the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA announced that it was temporarily postponing all domestic and foreign routine surveillance facility inspections. Similarly, routine surveillance inspections in support of the Bioresearch Monitoring (BIMO) program were postponed.\n\nBeginning the week of July 20, 2020, FDA resumed prioritized domestic inspections, as described in the FDA statement ""Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA prepares for resumption of domestic inspections with new risk assessment system"" issued on July 10, 2020.4 As explained in this statement, FDA uses its COVID-19 Advisory Rating system to determine what categories of regulatory activity can take place in a given geographic region. Based on this determination, FDA is either continuing, on a case-by-case basis, to conduct only ""mission-critical"" inspections,5 or, where possible to do so safely, resuming prioritized domestic inspections, which generally include preapproval, pre-license, surveillance, and for-cause inspections. For the foreseeable future, prioritized domestic inspections will be pre-announced to FDA-regulated businesses.6 This helps ensure the safety of the investigator and the firm\'s employees, providing the safest possible environment to accomplish FDA\'s regulatory activities, while also ensuring the appropriate staff are on-site to assist FDA staff with inspection activities.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCurrently, certain inspections (e.g., foreign preapproval, surveillance, and for-cause inspections that are not deemed mission-critical) remain temporarily postponed.\n\nWhile inspections that can be conducted by FDA during the public health emergency are limited due to factors including travel restrictions, FDA intends to continue using alternative tools, when appropriate, to evaluate facilities. This includes requesting existing inspection reports from other trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements,7 requesting information from applicants, requesting records and other information directly from facilities and other inspected entities, and conducting remote interactive evaluations8 where appropriate.\n\nFootnote 7: For existing FDA mutual recognition agreements with the European Union and the United Kingdom, this includes the use of official inspection reports issued by a recognized authority for manufacturing facilities located inside and outside the territory of the issuing authority.

These factors include, but are not limited to, whether the product has received breakthrough therapy designation, orphan-drug designation, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation; is included in the Drug Shortage or CBER-Regulated Products Shortage list; is used for critical care or as a medical countermeasure; is used to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a serious disease or medical condition, including COVID-19, for which there is no other appropriate and available treatment. Therefore, for-cause (including follow-up and where a specific drug quality problem or facility issues come to FDA\'s attention), preapproval, and pre-license inspections can be deemed mission-critical. When determining whether to conduct a mission-critical inspection, FDA also takes into account concerns about the safety of its investigators, employees at a site or facility, and where applicable, clinical trial participants and other patients at investigator sites.\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'

When determining whether to conduct a mission-critical inspection, FDA also takes into account concerns about the safety of its investigators, employees at a site or facility, and where applicable, clinical trial participants and other patients at investigator sites.\n\n2.3 Does FDA determine what is ""mission-critical"" using the same factors for both domestic and foreign inspections?\n\nA3: Yes, the determination is made considering the same factors regardless of whether the site is domestic or foreign.\n\n2.2.4 How will FDA ensure the quality of imported products while inspections are limited?\n\nA4: During this interim period, FDA is expanding the use of other tools and approaches for assessing manufacturing facilities, when appropriate, to help ensure the quality of the drug products imported into the United States. These may include physical examinations of products arriving at U.S. borders or product sampling and testing before release into commerce, reviewing the compliance histories of facilities, using information shared by trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements, requestingrecords directly from facilities ""in advance of or in lieu of"" certain drug inspections,9 and conducting remote interactive evaluations where appropriate. If a product appears not to meet applicable standards for safety, effectiveness, or quality based on these approaches, FDA has the authority to refuse admission of the product into the United States.10\n\nFDA continues to work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to target products intended for importation into the United States that violate applicable legal requirements for FDA-regulated products. FDA has the ability to use a risk-based analytics tool (Predictive Risk-based Evaluation for Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT)) to electronically screen regulated shipments imported or offered for import into the United States.11 PREDICT uses automated data mining, pattern discovery, and automated queries of FDA databases to determine the potential risk of a shipment. It takes into consideration the inherent risk of a product and also information about the previous history of importers, manufacturers, and shippers.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 10: See section 801(a) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: For more details visit FDA’s Entry Screening Systems and Tools page at https://www.fda.gov/industr/import-systems/entry-screening-systems-and-tools.\n\nQ5: How will travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency affect my application?\n\nA5: During the COVID-19 public health emergency, FDA is using all available tools and sources of information to support regulatory decisions on applications12 that include sites impacted by travel restrictions due to COVID-19. For example, FDA will continue the assessment of all applications per normal assessment operations for all disciplines, where all manufacturing facilities will be evaluated using a risk-based approach consistent with existing guidelines. Similarly, the need for and selection of sites for BIMO inspections will continue to be risk-based, considering application and site-specific factors. During this interim period, FDA is using alternative tools, where available, to determine or mitigate the need for an inspection and to support the application assessment. This includes reviewing a firm\'s previous compliance history, using information sharing from trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements, requesting records ""in advance of or in lieu of"" facility inspections13 or voluntarily from facilities and sites, and conducting remote interactive evaluations where appropriate.\n\nFootnote 12: See 21 CFR 314.50(d), 314.94(a), and 601.20(d).\n\nCDER and CBER are continuing to evaluate applications, strategically applying a holistic approach in the decision-making process to determine if an inspection is warranted or if an inspection is no longer needed due to information gained through the use of the alternative tools mentioned above. FDA will continue to work directly with the applicants of those impacted applications.\n\nFDA is also working directly with facilities to communicate any issues identified through a review of records or other information requested. For example, for both CDER- and CBER-regulated products, interim processes have been implemented to communicate with manufacturing facilities regarding issues identified following a review of records or other information requested ""in advance of or in lieu of"" a preapproval or pre-license inspection. Responses from the facility regarding these issues will, as feasible, be considered before taking an action on a pending application.\n\nThe Agency encourages applicants to be in communication with all their facilities and sites to ensure timely responses to any inquiries to support application assessment.\n\nQ6: If my application includes sites that cannot be inspected because of travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency will my application automatically receive a complete response letter?\n\nA6: No, FDA will not automatically issue a complete response (CR) letter if FDA cannot conduct an inspection because of travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency.14 Decisions regarding applications will be based on the totality of the information available to FDA, including information obtained from use of the alternative tools as described in Q5/A5.\n\nFootnote 14: For mission-critical and prioritized domestic inspections needed to support application approval, FDA aims to conduct those inspections during the review of the application. However, in cases where travel restrictions due to the public health emergency prevent FDA from performing those inspections during the review clock, recommendations in Q6/A6 are applicable.\n\nBased on an assessment of the product information provided in the application and based on available information about the facility or site, FDA will take one of the following actions:\n\nFDA plans to *approve\n\nthe application if\n\nAvailable information, including information obtained from the use of alternate tools, supports the adequacy of the facilities and sites named in a pending application, no other deficiencies have been identified, and the application otherwise satisfies the requirements for approval.15 Footnote 15: See 21 CFR 314.50, 314.94, and 601.2.\n\nIn this case, the need for an inspection could be sufficiently mitigated by the FDA\'s use of alternate tools, including a firm\'s responses to outstanding issues identified from the use of alternate tools (see Q5/A5).\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter with facility- or site-related deficiencies\n\nAvailable information from a prior FDA or mutual recognition agreement inspection or the use of alternate tools identifies concerns about the adequacy of a facility or site, and an inspection needed to address those concerns cannot be completed during the review cycle, or\n\nResponses to outstanding issues identified from requested records and other alternate sources (see Q5/A5) are not sufficient to address the issues identified for a facility or site.\n\nIn this case, FDA intends to inform the applicant of the facility or site issues as soon as possible during the review cycle. Specifically, FDA intends to inform the applicant that an inspection will be needed before the application can be approved\nand that the inspection may not be conducted before the action date due to restrictions on travel. * FDA generally intends to issue a CR letter, including a deficiency related to the facility or site, if the inspection has not been conducted by the action date.\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter without facility or site deficiencies\n\nAn inspection is necessary because there is insufficient information currently available to make a determination on the acceptability of a facility or site16,17 and other deficiencies have been identified.\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: From what I\'ve read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: The potential for missing data is also a limitation when switching from in-person to remote assessment using paper-based PRO or ObsRO assessments, if the trial participant or observer fails to complete all or part of the questionnaire within a given timeframe. To mitigate potential for missing data, sponsors should consider remote electronic capture of these assessments through technologies that can remind trial participants to complete the questionnaires and/or verbal administration at the time instructed (assuming appropriate steps are taken to minimize bias from verbal administration).\n\nQ15. I am a study monitor and am unable to conduct on-site monitoring visits due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. May I remotely perform the site monitoring visit? What recommendations does FDA have for how I can remotely perform source document review?\n\nFDA regulations require sponsors to monitor the conduct and progress of their clinical investigations.39 The regulations are not specific about how sponsors must conduct such monitoring and are therefore compatible with a range of approaches to monitoring that may vary depending on multiple factors. Therefore, certain aspects of site monitoring visits may be done remotely if technically feasible. FDA understands that there may be deviations from the timing of on-site monitoring visits set forth in the trial monitoring plan and procedures, and that sponsors may consider ways to replace on-site monitoring visits with remote monitoring visits during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Further, there may be components of an on-site monitoring visit, as outlined in the trial monitoring plan, that cannot be completed remotely.\n\nFootnote 39: See 21 CFR 312.50, 312.53(d), 312.56(a), 812.40, 812.43(d), and 812.46.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 public health emergency, traditional on-site monitoring might be difficult for reasons such as (1) sites may not be able to accommodate monitoring visits (e.g., due to staffing limitations or site closures) or (2) monitors may not be able to travel to trial sites. Whenplanned on-site monitoring visits are not possible, the reason should be documented and available for review by the sponsor and during FDA inspections.\n\nThe sponsor should consider using a risk-based approach to prioritize sites for remote monitoring, including as many study sites as feasible (and with a frequency as close to that described in the site monitoring plan as feasible). The decision regarding which sites to prioritize for remote monitoring should be guided by centralized monitoring or other information available about site performance (e.g., frequency and severity of protocol deviations previously identified during monitoring visits or currently identified by centralized monitoring, number of randomized active trial participants, experience of site staff, known history of prior major audit or inspection findings).\n\nRemote monitoring should be focused on review of critical study site documentation and source data. If the materials identified for review include participants\' medical records that normally would be reviewed at the site (and such a review is consistent with the trial participants\' informed consent documents) then, as discussed below, remote review of medical records may be explored with trial sites to complete source document review. When the study monitor cannot access the site to review critical source documents, requests for review of source documents that may include private health information should be consistent with requirements for source document validation and review as described in the current study monitoring plan or other appropriate study-specific document. When remote monitoring processes and procedures have not previously been described by the sponsor, these processes and procedures should be established (e.g., in a revised study monitoring plan or in updates to existing sponsor policies and procedures).\n\nDuring remote monitoring, the study monitor should focus on trial activities that are essential to the safety of trial participants and/or data reliability. Sponsors and monitors may wish to consider one or more of the following options to facilitate remote monitoring access to clinical site records:\n\nIf the site can provide appropriate resources and technical capabilities, consider establishing a secure remote viewing portal that would permit site staff to provide access to the site\'s study documentation and/or trial participants\' source documents for the study monitor\'s review. In addition, the potential for remote access to trial participants\' electronic health records may be explored with trial sites.\n\nSites could upload certified copies40 of source records to a sponsor-controlled electronic system or other cloud-based repository that contains appropriate security controls. In the setting of a blinded or partially blinded study, if source documents contain potentially unblind information, controls to protect the study blind should be in place prior to transfer of source documents (e.g., use of an unblinded study monitor to review source documents, restricted access to folders containing copies of source documents). It is not necessary for the clinical site to have control of certified copies of source documents uploaded to such a repository; however, the clinical investigator should maintain control of the original source records.\n\nRegarding retention of copies of source documents used for remote review, it would not be necessary to retain the certified copies of source documents used for remote review, provided the clinical investigator retains the original source documents according to FDA regulations for the retention of records.41\n\nFootnote 41: See 21 CFR 312.62 and 812.140(a)\n\nIn addition, processes and procedures should be established for the handling of source document copies that were placed in temporary storage locations for remote review and that are no longer needed after the remote monitoring has concluded.\n\nRemote monitoring activities, including remote review of source documents, should be documented in the same level of detail as on-site monitoring activities, and any resulting actions to address issues identified from the remote source document review should be consistent with procedures and processes described in the study monitoring plan.\n\nQ16.: I am a sponsor of commercial INDs and electronic common technical document (eCTD) requirements cannot be met due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. Who do I contact for assistance?\n\nCommercial sponsors may qualify for a short-term waiver from the eCTD requirements under section 745A of the FD&C Act in unique and rare circumstances and for a limited duration. During the COVID-19 public health emergency, rare circumstances may arise in which a sponsor cannot meet eCTD requirements (e.g., if the current COVID-19 public health emergency has impacted computer operations). Companies experiencing technical difficulties with transmission of their electronic submissions to FDA should consult FDA\'s electronic submission staff (contact information provided below) for technical assistance, rather than submitting a waiver request, as described in Section III.E of FDA\'s guidance for industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format--Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specifications (February 2020, Revision 7):\n\nFDA may grant temporary waivers of the requirement for eCTD submission if one or more of the following events or circumstances exist:\n\nExtraordinary events or circumstances occur that are beyond the control of the submitter that justify a waiver, including but not limited to, natural disasters that impact computer operations.\n\nAn unplanned long-term Internet disruption or other unplanned event occurs that would preclude the sponsor from submitting in eCTD format (e.g., malware attacks).\n\nThe sponsor intends to request a withdrawal of an application that has not yet converted to eCTD format.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe sponsor submitted a request for withdrawal and has not yet received FDA\'s acknowledgement of the withdrawal.42\n\nFootnote 42: See the guidance for industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format—Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specifications (February 2020, Revision 7), available on the FDA guidance web page. To the extent that the guidance provides criteria for waivers and exemptions from the eCTD reporting requirements under section 745A(a) of the FD&C Act, it has binding effect pursuant to statute.\n\nThe guidance also states:\n\nThe sponsor or applicant\'s request to waive the eCTD electronic format requirement must include all of the following as supporting documentation to justify the waiver:\n\nA description of the circumstances or event-including the anticipated duration of the circumstance or event-giving rise to the need for a waiver\n\nThe requested duration of the waiver\n\nA description of the proposed alternative submission format the sponsor or applicant will be using for the duration of the waiver\n\nThe request should reference all products that are to be covered by the waiver. The waiver request should be clearly titled ""WAIVER REQUEST-eCTD REQUIREMENTS"" in bold capital letters at the top of the first page of the submission.43\n\nFootnote 43: Ibid.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Institutional Review Boards']","['Where alternate tools are not available, insufficient, or otherwise will not satisfy the need for an inspection, FDA will use a risk-based approach to prioritize inspections, which includes consideration for (a) how product availability could impact public health; (b) investigator safety; and (c) travel restrictions and/or advisories associated with the location of the facility or site (e.g., country or region/state/province within the country, U.S. state, county, or territory).

Often, higher risk subgroups and patients with concomitant illnesses that require use of other drugs are excluded from clinical trials, and long-term treatment data are limited. Moreover, patients in trials are closely monitored for evidence of adverse events. In clinical practice, monitoring is less intensive, a broader range of patients are treated (age, co-morbidities, drugs, genetic abnormalities), and events too rare to occur in clinical trials may be observed (e.g., severe liver injury). These factors underlie the need for continuing analysis of relevant safety, efficacy,1 and effectiveness1 information throughout the lifecycle of a medicinal product - promptly, as important findings occur - and periodically - to allow an overall assessment of the accumulating data. Although the majority of new information will be safety-related, new information about effectiveness, limitations of use, alternative treatments, and many other aspects of the drug's place in therapy may be pertinent to its benefit-risk assessment.\n\nFootnote 1: The terms efficacy and effectiveness are not standardised, and have different meanings across some regions. See Section 2.6\n\nThe ICH Guideline E2C, Clinical Safety Data Management: Periodic Safety Update Reports for Marketed Drugs, achieved Step 4 in 1996, and was intended to harmonise the periodic reporting requirements to regulatory authorities and to provide, in a common format, the worldwide interval safety experience of a medicinal product at defined times post-approval. At that time, the focus of the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) was on relevant new safety information in the context of patient exposure, to determine if changes were needed to the Reference Safety Information* (RSI) in order to optimise the continued safe use of the product. The Guideline was revised in 2003, to provide needed clarification, guidance and flexibility.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline""

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , Does the scope of section 13 of the PBRER only include controlled clinical trials?\n--------------------\nContext: One of the motivating factors behind revision of the ICH E2C(R1) Guideline was the desire to enhance efficiency by decreasing the duplication of effort required for the preparation of various regulatory documents. This Guideline has been developed, therefore, such that corresponding sections of the PBRER, Development Safety Update Report (DSUR, ICH E2F), and safety specification of a risk management plan (ICH E2E) can be identical in content. (See also Section 1.4, Relation of the PBRER to Other ICH Documents)\n\nObjectives\n\nThe main objective of a PBRER is to present a comprehensive, concise, and critical analysis of new or emerging information on the risks of the medicinal product, and on its benefit in approved indications, to enable an appraisal of the product's overall benefit-risk profile. The PBRER should contain an evaluation of new information relevant to the medicinal product that became available to the MAH during the reporting interval, in the context of cumulative information by:\n\nSummarising relevant new safety information that could have an impact on the benefit-risk profile of the medicinal product;\n\nSummarising any important new efficacy/effectiveness information that has become available during the reporting interval;* Examining whether the information obtained by the MAH during the reporting interval is in accord with previous knowledge of the medicinal product's benefit and risk profile; and\n\nWhere important new safety information has emerged, conducting an integrated benefit-risk evaluation for approved indications.\n\nWhen appropriate, the PBRER should include proposed action(s) to optimise the benefit-risk profile.\n\nUrgent safety information should be reported through the appropriate mechanism; the PBRER is not intended to be used to provide initial notification of significant new safety information or to provide the means by which new safety concerns* are detected.\n\nScope of the PBRER\n\nThe main focus of each PBRER is the evaluation of relevant new safety information from the available data sources,2placed within the context of any pertinent efficacy/effectiveness information that may have become available since the International Birth Date* (IBD), the date of the first marketing approval in any country in the world, or the Development International Birth Date (DIBD), the date of first authorisation for the conduct of an interventional clinical trial in any country.3 All pertinent new safety and efficacy/effectiveness information discovered during the reporting interval3 should be discussed in the appropriate sections of the PBRER.\n\nFootnote 2: For the purpose of this document, the terms “authorisation” and “authorised” refer to clinical trials and the terms “approval” and “approved” refer to marketing applications.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , Does the scope of section 13 of the PBRER only include controlled clinical trials?\n--------------------\nContext: Relation of the PBRER to Other ICH Documents\n\nAt present, some ICH countries and regions accept submission of separate types of periodic reports to fulfil national and regional requirements within the post-approval period: the PSUR (ICH Guideline E2C(R1)) for periodic reporting of the safety of approved medicinal products, the DSUR (ICH Guideline E2F) for periodic reporting on the safety of medicinal products that remain in clinical development, and the safety specification component of ICH Guideline E2E that might be submitted at the time of marketing application and/or PSUR submission to aid in the planning of pharmacovigilance activities. As these documents have different regulatory purposes, different periodicities, and can be reviewed by different divisions within a single regulatory authority, each document needs to be complete in its own right - a comprehensive document that can stand alone.\n\nNevertheless, overlap and inconsistencies between the content of the DSUR, PSUR, and safety specification can lead to inefficiencies in the production of the documents by the MAH.\n\nModular Approach\n\nThis Guideline aims to facilitate flexibility by encouraging the use of individual sections that are common to more than one report - ""modules"" that can be used for different regulatory authorities and for different purposes. Therefore, the PBRER has been developed in such a way that the content of several sections may be used for sections of other documents as a basis for a modular approach. For example, if the DIBD of a DSUR for a medicinal product is aligned to the IBD of the PBRER for the same product as suggested in ICH E2F, the content of a number of sections of the DSUR can also be used in the PBRER when the Data Lock Points (DLPs) are the same, i.e., when each report covers an interval of one year based on the IBD.\n\nAppendix D of this Guideline lists the PBRER sections that can be shared with either the DSUR (ICH E2F) or safety specification of a risk management plan (ICH E2E), if appropriate.\n\nThe use of common sections across the PBRER, DSUR and safety specification as a modular approach has a number of advantages:\n\nMaximizes the utility of the modules across multiple regulatory documents;\n\nPromotes consistency across the PBRER, DSUR and safety specification;\n\nAvoids unnecessary duplication of effort;\n\nIs expected to improve efficiency for MAHs in the preparation of these documents;\n\nFacilitates flexible utilisation of existing sections (modules) when, for example, the PBRER covers different time intervals or needs to be submitted at different times to multiple different authorities. In these circumstances, only modules that include new information or new evaluation would need to be updated when submitting the PBRER.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline']","['No. Although Section 13 of the E2C(R2) guidance is titled ""Lack of Efficacy in Controlled Clinical Trials,"" the intent of this section is that it should include lack of efficacy data arising from all types of clinical trials conducted or completed during the reporting interval.']",0.0,0.0

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to applicants on preparing and using comparability protocols for postapproval changes in chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC). The guidance applies to comparability protocols that would be submitted in new animal drug applications (NADAs), abbreviated new animal drug applications (ANADAs), or supplements to these applications. Well-characterized synthetic peptides submitted in these applications are included within the scope of this guidance. This guidance also applies to comparability protocols submitted in investigational new animal drug (INAD), generic investigational new animal drug (JINAD) and veterinary master file (VMF) submissions that are referenced in applications. The FDA is providing this guidance in response to requests from those interested in using comparability protocols.\n\nFDA guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nAs an applicant, you are responsible for assessing, prior to distribution of a product, the effect of any postapproval CMC changes on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the product as these factors relate to the safety or efficacy of the product (section 506A(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act)). Such an assessment often includes demonstration that the pre- and postchange products (i.e., products manufactured prior to and subsequent to a change) are equivalent. Postapproval CMC changes must be reported to FDA in one of four reporting categories (Section 506A of the Act):* Annual Report (AR)1\n\nFootnote 1: The annual report is the Minor Changes and Stability Report (MCSR) according to 21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iii).\n\nThe annual submission to the approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having minimal potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product.\n\nChange-Being-Efficected Supplement (CBE)\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having moderate potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A CBE supplement must be received by FDA before or concurrently with distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nChange-Being-Efficed-in-30-Days Supplement (CBE-30).\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having moderate potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A CBE-30 supplement must be received by FDA at least 30 days before distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nPrior Approval Supplement (PAS)\n\nA submission to an approved application reporting changes that FDA has identified as having a substantial potential to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. A PAS supplement must be received and approved by FDA prior to distribution of the product made using the change.\n\nIn many cases, using a comparability protocol will facilitate the subsequent implementation and reporting of CMC changes, which could result in moving a product into distribution sooner than if a protocol was not used.\n\nThis guidance describes the general principles and procedures associated with developing and submitting a comparability protocol to the FDA. The guidance also describes the basic elements of a comparability protocol and specific issues to consider when developing comparability protocols for changes in:* the manufacturing process\n* analytical procedures2\n* manufacturing equipment\n* manufacturing facilities\n* container closure systems\n* process analytical technology (PAT)\n\nFootnote 2: The term analytical procedure, as used in this guidance, includes chemical, physical, microbiological, and biological test procedures.\n\nThe guidance also discusses submitting comparability protocols as investigational new animal drug submissions, generic investigational new animal drug submissions and veterinary master file submissions.\n\nAppendix A What is a Comparability Protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: From what I\'ve read in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , For release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n--------------------\nContext: One aspect of CVM\'s review of proprietary names for new animal drugs focuses on the avoidance of medication errors. Examples of medication errors include incorrect drug selection, incorrect dosage or route of administration, or use in unintended species or classes. These types of errors may cause animal injury or a lack of drug effectiveness, which could contribute to outcomes like complication of a disease and possible death of an animal. Medication errors in food-producing animals may result in drug residues in edible tissues (including milk or eggs) that may cause residue violations for livestock owners, and may result in potentially unsafe food for consumers.\n\nCVM considers whether the name can cause confusion or otherwise contribute to medication errors. The medication use system for animal drugs in the United States (US) generally includes the following phases: selection and procurement, ordering or prescribing, order processing, dispensing, and administration. Opportunities for medication errors arise in each of these phases.\n\nCVM also considers the entire medication  use system when evaluating  the potential  of proprietary names to cause confusion and medication  error. This includes  the specific environment  in which the product  will be used (i.e., clinic,  barn, home, etc.), the veterinary  prescriber population,  and/or the knowledge  and experience of the animal owner or animal caretaker who  will be administering  the drug.  For example,  for a product  expected to be used exclusively  in beef cattle by beef cattle  producers, the proprietary name review will consider  a potential for confusion with other products  used by beef cattle producers.\n\nAdditionally,  CVM will  compare the proposed proprietary name to other proposed proprietary names submitted  to FDA for products  not yet approved.  Such proposed names are often confidential;  therefore, it is possible  that CVM may identify  conflicts with pending products of  which the sponsors  or public  is not aware.5\n\nFootnote 5: Proposed names may be associated with drug products subject to (generic) investigational new animal drug ((J)INAD) files, (abbreviated) new animal drug applications ((A)NADA), investigational new drug applications (INDs), new drug applications (NDAs), biologics license applications (BLAs), or abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs). In those instances when a conflict is identified with a proposed proprietary name of a pending drug application, FDA will generally accept the proposed name of whichever application is approved first and notify the other applicant that they must seek a new name.\n\nCVM may object to a proposed name if it may  the product for reasons not solely  related to medication  error prevention.  Among other things, the FD&C Act provides  that a drug  or device  shall be deemed misbranded  if its labeling  is false or misleading  in any particular  (section 502(a) of the FD&C Act). Labeling  may be misleading,  for example, if it employs  a fanciful proprietary name  that suggests that a drug has some unique  effectiveness or composition  when it does not, or  makes misrepresentations  with  respect to safety or effectiveness (see 21 CFR 201.10(c)(3)).\n\nDistributor  product labeling  is not required to be reviewed and approved by FDA prior  to distribution.  Nevertheless, distributor  products are subject to the provisions  of 21 CFR  514.80(b)(5)(iii),  and so the principles  laid out in this guidance  are applicable  to proprietary names  of distributor  products.  Distributor  products deemed misbranded  are subject to the same sanctions  applicable  to any misbranded  new animal drug.\n\nV Naming Attributes That May Misprand The Product\n\nThis section identifies  attributes of proprietary names that may  misbrand  a new animal  drug product.  We recommend that you  evaluate proposed proprietary names for these attributes.  The  appendix  provides a checklist to aid in the assessment of  proposed proprietary  names and provides  FDA\'s  thinking  with respect to each of these attributes.\n\nSimilarities in Spelling and Pronunciation\n\nProprietary names that look  alike  or  sound alike  can increase the risk of medication  errors  when selecting, prescribing, dispensing,  or administering  the product.  Generally, proprietary names should not be similar  in spelling  or pronunciation  to other proprietary names,established names, or ingredients of other animal or human drug products. FDA may consider a proposed proprietary name to be misleading if it may be confused with the proprietary name or the established name of a different drug or ingredient because of similar spelling or pronunciation (see 21 CFR 201.10(c)(5)).\n\nProprietary names also should not incorporate the sponsor\'s name or a part of the sponsor\'s name across multiple products (e.g., ""SponsorName X,"" ""SponsorName Y,"" ""SponsorName Z""). This practice can result in creating multiple similar proprietary names, which may increase the risk of confusion among the products. Confusion may occur when such products are stored alphabetically in distributor or pharmacy locations or when products are ordered from alphabetized lists.6,7,8\n\nFootnote 6: Lambert, BL, S-J Lin, K-Y Chang et al., 1999, Similarity as a risk factor in drug-name confusion errors: The look-alike (orthographic) and sound-alike (phonetic) model, Medical Care, 37(12):1214–1225.\n\nInert or Inactive Ingredients\n\nProprietary names should not incorporate any reference to an inert or inactive ingredient in a way that creates an impression that the ingredient\'s value is greater than its true functional role in the formulation because such names may be misleading (see 21 CFR 201.10(c)(4)).\n\nProducts with Multiple Active Ingredients\n\nProprietary names of drug products that contain more than one active ingredient should not include or suggest the name of one or more, but not all, of its active ingredients (see 21 CFR 201.6(b)). Such names can mislead the end user by implying that the product contains only the ingredient(s) included in the name. (See section 201(n) of the FD&C Act).\n\nUnited States Adopted Names (USAN) Council Stems\n\nProprietary names should not incorporate United States Adopted Name (USAN) stems in the position that the USAN Council designates for the stem. The USAN Council is generally responsible for selecting simple, informative, and unique established names for drug substances. USAN stems are standardized syllables within established names that relate new chemical entities to existing drug families and are intended to indicate a pharmacological or chemical trait of a drug. For example, the stem -cillin is used for penicillins, such as ampicillin, and the stem -inhib is used for kinase inhibitors, such as ockatinib. A single stem may be applicable to multiple drug products. Stems may appear at the beginning,middle, or the end of the established name. Each stem can emphasize a specific chemical structure type, a pharmacologic property, or a combination of these attributes.\n\nUse of these stems in the position designated by USAN within proprietary names, even when such use is consistent with the USAN meaning, can result in the creation of multiple similar proprietary names and/or proprietary names that are similar to established names, leading to an increased risk of medication errors because of name confusion. You should screen proposed proprietary names against the stem list created by the USAN Council to ensure a USAN stem is not present in the stem position in the proprietary name.9\n\nIn rare circumstances, it might be acceptable to include a USAN stem in the USAN-designated position within the proposed proprietary name. Such circumstances could arise if the proposed name includes a word that can only be spelled in the English language using a stem in the position designated by USAN. For example, if a proposed proprietary name includes the word ""congestion,"" the use of the letters ""gest"", which are the USAN stem, is unavoidable.\n\nFootnote 9: See the list of approved USAN stems, available at http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-science/united-states-adopted-names-council/naming-guidelines/approved-stems.page.\n\nReuse of Proprietary Names\n\nYou should not reuse the proprietary name of a discontinued product when marketing a different drug because there is a risk that users may continue to associate the name with the original discontinued product.10 Proprietary names associated with discontinued drug products also may continue to appear in drug product reference texts for extended periods of time.\n\nFootnote 10: See Tu, CM, Taylor, K, and Chai, G. Use of Proprietary Names by Prescribers for Discontinued Brand Drug Products With Existing Generic Equivalents. Drug Information Journal, published on line August 21, 2012, available at http://dii.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/08/21/0092861512456282.full.pdf+html.\n\nNames That Include Reference to Product-Specific Attributes\n\nWe recommend that you avoid incorporating product-specific attributes, such as manufacturing characteristics (e.g., ""DrugnameLyophyllized""), dosage form (e.g., ""DrugnameTabs""), or route of administration (e.g., ""DrugnameOral"") as part of the proposed proprietary name. Including references to product-specific attributes in the proprietary name might be acceptable if the reference to the product-specific attribute is accurate, consistent with the approved product labeling, and does not pose additional risks for medication error. However, when developing proprietary names that include or make reference to product-specific attributes, you should also consider that future changes in the product, such as changes in dosage form or route of administration or manufacturing characteristics, may render the original proprietary name inaccurate.\n\nDosing Interval\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #240 Proprietary Names for New Animal Drugs'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: From what I\'ve read in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , For release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n--------------------\nContext: Generally, if studies using a proposed new animal drug product\'s final formulation are not available for inclusion in the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable), this will limit the applicability of the information.29 The acceptability of published studies will depend on the complexity of the formulation, how much control the sponsor had over the manufacturing process, etc. CVM will evaluate the drug product used in each published study included in the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable) using information on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and physical form. The level of documentation and known information is usually not the same as what is included in a single adequate and well-controlled study submitted to CVM with raw data. However, the assessment of how much a formulation and other critical quality attributes can deviate from the proposed/final formulation is generally the same regardless of the type of study (SRMA or single prospectively designed study). Footnote 29: Formulation changes to a drug product may occur over time and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine their potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug as these factors relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug. These principles are discussed in more detail in Guidance for Industry #83, “Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved NADA or ANADA” (May 2007). In some cases, studies will be necessary to establish the equivalence of different formulations (e.g., pharmacokinetic studies, and/or clinical studies as appropriate).\n\nAs noted in section III.B.3. Critical Factors, literature using the proposed final formulation manufactured by or for the sponsor provides the best, most rigorous evaluation and the highest evidentiary weight. If a sufficient number of studies using an acceptable formulation are not available or a connection to information found in the CMC technical section cannot be made, the SR approach will be unlikely to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness. Footnote 29: The sponsor should provide CVM with an assessment of the information, a meaningful evaluation of the new animal drug used in the publishedreport included in the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable) and a justification that it is appropriate to use the data generated in the study along with other studies in the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable). The decision about the value of the information from the published studies to the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable) will be made with the collaboration of ONADE\'s Division of Manufacturing Technologies and the target animal review team.\n\nAdequate and well-controlled studies, including SRs, include the use of methods to assess the animal response to the use of the new animal drug that are well defined and reliable (21 CFR 514.117(b)(8)). Sponsors should consider whether there are a sufficient number of studies which report the appropriate endpoint(s) in a consistent manner which would allow for quantification of the effect of the new animal drug.\n\nProtocol considerations specific to effectiveness:\n\nReview question: The review question should closely match the objectives of the study and follow the format described in section III.B.3.b.i. Developing the Review Question of this guidance. In general, effectiveness study review questions follow the format: ""Evaluation of the effectiveness of [drug product and dose if appropriate] for [indication] as compared to [control type] in [species/class/animal age as appropriate].""\n\nDefinition of the control: Please refer to section III.B.3.b.ii. Writing the protocol (Control Type).\n\nInclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Examples of screening inclusion/exclusion criteria which may be assessed based on the title, abstract, and/or key words include:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\nScreening Inclusion & Screening Exclusion \\ \\hline Study types: Complete reports (published or unpublished) on & Incomplete reports (abstracts and \\ randomized controlled trials (RCTs), & reviews), or insufficient information \\ cluster RCTs, and select non- & to assess these criteria (incomplete \\ randomized controlled studies & reports may not be excluded if full \\  & information could be obtained from \\  & the study investigator) \\ \\hline Study includes intended target animal & Study includes animals that are not \\ species and class & representative of the target animal \\  & species and class \\ \\hline Use of the drug product of interest (at & Drug product of interest not a part \\ screening phase, identification of & of the study \\ active ingredient may be sufficient) & \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nExamples of eligibility inclusion/exclusion criteria based on assessment of the full text of the publication:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\nEligibility Inclusion & Eligibility Exclusion \\ \\hline Drug product as defined in the protocol & Study does not include drug product \\  & as defined in protocol, or \\  & publication does not provide \\  & sufficient information to identify \\  & the drug product (unable to confirm \\  & formulation used in the study) \\ \\hline Study uses intended label dosage (dose,  frequency, and route of administration) & Dosage used in study inconsistent \\  & with the intended label dosage \\ \\hline Study includes the use of acceptable & Study includes the use of \\   concurrent therapies (e.g., the studies & concurrent therapy that may \\   may employ concurrent therapies per & confound the effectiveness \\   the current standards of care; however, & evaluation \\   these considerations should be & \\   described clearly within the protocol.) & \\ \\hline Study designed to evaluate endpoint(s) & Study not designed to evaluate \\   of interest & endpoint(s) of interest \\ \\hline Screening and eligibility inclusion and exclusion criteria should only evaluate & whether the measurement of an effectiveness outcome is present and should \\   not specify a particular effectiveness outcome for inclusion in the & \\   effectiveness database. For example, studies that do not demonstrate the & \\   desired level of effect or that report a poor effectiveness outcome should not & \\   be excluded from the effectiveness database. & \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n* Basis of study conclusion: The protocol should clearly state the criteria on which study conclusions will be based. The study objectives and the statistical analysis results should be considered when defining the criteria. For example, a threshold for an effect size or a threshold for the limits of a confidence interval for the effect size could be used as criterion. In addition, the study conclusion should also consider bias investigation results.\n\n4 Reasonable Expectation of Effectiveness\n\nSection 571 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360ccc) provides for a qualified approval pathway, open only to certain qualifying new animal drug products based on indication and type, called conditional approval. Conditional approval allows a sponsor to legally market a new animal drug after demonstrating the drug is safe and manufactured in accordance with the full approval standards, and that there is a reasonable expectation of effectiveness. To obtain conditional approval, all technical sections must be complete except the effectiveness technical section, which isreplaced with RXE. The sponsor can market the conditionally approved new animal drug product for up to 5 years while gathering the remaining data required to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness. The pathway requires annual renewal of the conditional approval to determine whether the sponsor is making sufficient progress toward meeting the effectiveness standard for full approval. Literature may be used as one of the pathways to support RXE. Screening and eligibility criteria for publications that may be used to support RXE are generally the same as for substantial evidence of effectiveness; however, the overall body of evidence may be smaller and information gaps may still be present. Full scoping or systematic literature reviews are not routinely expected but may be appropriate.\n\nAppendix E Target Animal Safety\n\n1. Scope of Use\n\nSection 512 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360b) establishes the requirements for new animal drug approval, including target animal safety. See FD&C Act section 512(d)(1)(A), (B), and (D) (21 U.S.C. 360b(d)(1)(A), (B), and (D)).\n\nLiterature, including narrative reviews, SR, and meta-analysis, may be acceptable to fulfill all or part of the requirements for target animal safety for a new animal drug application or an application for conditional approval (see FD&C Act section 571(a)(2)(B)). Literature is most commonly used to evaluate the extent and quality of information available on the safety of a new animal drug for the proposed indication or proposed conditions of use, support the design of the target animal safety evaluation, and/or provide information to predict potential adverse effects in the target species. In some cases, literature may provide all or a portion of the information required to demonstrate whether a new animal drug is safe for the intended use and conditions of use.\n\nCVM encourages sponsors to request meetings early in the development plan to discuss options for presenting the available information, designing protocols, and determining viability of using literature to fulfill some or all of the target animal safety requirements.\n\nAppendix B Preliminary Information\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #106 The Use of Published Literature in Support of New Animal Drug Approvals'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: From what I\'ve read in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , For release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n--------------------\nContext: Was the specific proposed commercial formulation used in the literature?\n\nWere the lots used in the published study tested according to the proposed release testing and are the results of the release testing published or available for review?\n\nDoes the sponsor have experience with manufacturing the product under current good manufacturing practices (CGMP) (FD&C Act section 501(a)(2)(B)) conditions and can historical data be provided to support the proposed release and stability specifications?\n\nIf a direct connection cannot be made between the proposed commercial formulation and the published literature (e.g., a different drug product was used in the studies described in the published literature), the sponsor should consider:\n\nIf the literature indicates that a specific safety (e.g., byproduct of manufacturingprocess or stability that could lead to toxicity) or effectiveness (e.g., narrow therapeutic range) issue exists that should be controlled in the manufacturing process.\n\nIf bridging studies (e.g., bioequivalence) have been performed to demonstrate the relevance of the information in the literature to the proposed drug product.\n\nDepending on the complexity of the drug product and the manufacturing process, if general specifications (e.g., assay 90-110 percent), based on appropriate VICH or CVM guidance documents or United States Pharmacopeia (USP) chapters or monographs, can be utilized.\n\nIf there are any critical quality attributes of the drug product where a link to clinical safety and effectiveness data is needed (e.g., release characteristics, new dosage form, bioassay, viability), reference to published scientific literature alone may not be sufficient to support the approval of the new animal drug product.\n\n4 Effectiveness\n\n1. Scope of Use\n\nLiterature may be used to fulfill all or part of the requirements for the effectiveness technical section for new animal drug product approvals or the reasonable expectation of effectiveness (RXE) technical section for conditional new animal drug product approvals. For example, SRs and meta-analyses may provide substantial evidence of effectiveness for either all or a portion of the indication. Individual literature reports may provide information to satisfy a particular data gap, lead to the identification of a data gap, or satisfy RXE.\n\nThe degree of support that literature submissions may provide toward fulfilling requirements for substantial evidence of effectiveness or reasonable expectation of effectiveness cannot fully be determined until after review of the submission and review of other technical information such as chemistry and pharmacokinetic data. CVM encourages sponsors to request meetings early in the approval process to discuss options for presenting the available information, designing protocols, and determining viability of a path forward.\n\n2. Dosage Characterization\n\nDosage characterization is the justification of the dosage (dose or dose range, dosing frequency, and the dosing duration) and a characterization of the critical aspects of the dose-response relationship related to each intended use and associated conditions of use. Dosage characterization is part of the effectiveness technical section of an INAD file and may be derived from dose titration studies, pilot studies, foreign studies, scientific literature, or other sources. Scientific literature, including individual or multiple sources, may be used to support a portion or all of the justification of the dosage and may significantly assist protocol development. For example, literature may provide information integral for the selection of optimal study time points or specify study design parameters for protocols for novel drugs and drugs with modified-release characteristics or extended duration of action. In general, sufficient scientific literature to reasonably support the basis for the dose characterization is acceptable; for example, a narrative review. Full scoping or systematic literature reviews are not routinely expected. If the use of literature to fulfill a portion or all other technical sections is contemplated, any literature used to characterize the dosage should be identified and evaluated in an independent manner to avoid biasing a future systematic review.\n\n3 Substantial Evidence of Effectiveness\n\nRegulatory standards: Effectiveness must be demonstrated by substantial evidence consisting of one or more adequate and well-controlled studies (FD&C Act sections 512(d)(1)(E) and (d)(3); 21 CFR 514.1(b)(8)(ii); 21 CFR 514.4(a); and 21 CFR 514.117). Substantial evidence is defined in 21 CFR 514.4(a) as ""evidence consisting of one or more adequate and well-controlled studies...on the basis of which it could fairly and reasonably be concluded by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the new animal drug involved that the new animal drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof. Substantial evidence shall include such adequate and well-controlled studies that are, as a matter of sound scientific judgment, necessary to establish that a new animal drug will have its intended effect."" An SR intended to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness of a new animal drug for an original or supplemental NADA must be adequate and well-controlled (21 CFR 514.4(a)). The protocol for an SR should provide details relative to the study design, conduct, and analysis in accordance with the characteristics of an adequate and well-controlled study (21 CFR 514.117(a)-(b)). When using an SR to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness, the review objective is generally the same as a traditional clinical study (e.g., the objective of the study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of a specific formulation of drug, given at a specific dosage, for specific indications (and conditions of use) in specific species/classes). Things to consider when developing a proposal for an SR to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness:\n\nThe regulations (21 CFR 514.4) require a demonstration of substantial evidence of effectiveness for the new animal drug, and 21 CFR 514.117(b)(3) requires that adequate and well-controlled studies be conducted with ""...a new animal drug that is produced in accordance with appropriate manufacturing practices, which include, but are not necessarily limited to, the manufacture, processing, packaging, holding, and labeling of the new animal drug such that the critical characteristics of\nidentity, strength, quality, purity, and physical form of the new animal drug are known, recorded, and reproducible, to permit meaningful evaluations of and comparisons with other studies conducted with the new animal drug"" [emphasis added]. Therefore, for SRs, as is the case for other types of adequate and well-controlled studies, critical factors in the study design are the identity, strength, quality, purity, physical form, and critical quality attributes28 of the new animal drug product used in the study. All individual studies included in the SR should have sufficient detail to confirm the identity of the drug product. In some cases, author contact may facilitate the retrieval of additional product specific information (lot numbers, batch numbers, certificates of analysis) useful for the SR and confirmation of appropriate manufacturing practices. Footnote 28: ICH Q8(R2), “Pharmaceutical Development” (November 2009).\n\nGenerally, if studies using a proposed new animal drug product\'s final formulation are not available for inclusion in the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable), this will limit the applicability of the information.29 The acceptability of published studies will depend on the complexity of the formulation, how much control the sponsor had over the manufacturing process, etc. CVM will evaluate the drug product used in each published study included in the SR (and accompanying meta-analysis, if applicable) using information on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and physical form. The level of documentation and known information is usually not the same as what is included in a single adequate and well-controlled study submitted to CVM with raw data. However, the assessment of how much a formulation and other critical quality attributes can deviate from the proposed/final formulation is generally the same regardless of the type of study (SRMA or single prospectively designed study). Footnote 29: Formulation changes to a drug product may occur over time and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine their potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug as these factors relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug. These principles are discussed in more detail in Guidance for Industry #83, “Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved NADA or ANADA” (May 2007). In some cases, studies will be necessary to establish the equivalence of different formulations (e.g., pharmacokinetic studies, and/or clinical studies as appropriate).\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #106 The Use of Published Literature in Support of New Animal Drug Approvals'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: From what I\'ve read in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , For release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n--------------------\nContext: Published data;\n\nTest results generated by the animal drug product sponsor.\n\nThe principles described in ICH Q9, ""Quality Risk Management,""3 and ICH Q3D should be considered. Control approaches should be proportional to the level of risk (see Q5, Q9, Q10, and Appendix I).\n\nFootnote 3: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/q9-quality-risk-management.\n\nQ4. How should the potential for the container closure and manufacturing equipment to leach elemental impurities into the drug product be addressed?\n\nA. CVM considers the risk of elemental impurities from the container closure to be low in most cases. The probability of elemental leaching into solid dosage forms is minimal and does not require further evaluation in the risk assessment. For liquid and semi-solid dosage forms, if the primary container closure components may introduce elemental impurities into the drug product at levels that present a safety concern, adequate controls should be in place. If the supplier certifies that the materials of construction of the primary packaging meet the applicable requirements of the USP and the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the animal drug product sponsor will not be asked to confirm the COA results for extractable metals. If a statement or data are unavailable from the manufacturer of the primary packaging regarding elemental impurities, CVM recommends performing at a minimum a test for heavy metals, such as the procedure previously described in USP <231>, for containers used for liquid and semi-solid dosage forms. The probability of elemental leaching into solid dosage forms is minimal and does not require further evaluation in the risk assessment. If the primary container closure components are expected to introduce elemental impurities into the drug product at levels that present a safety concern, adequate controls should be in place or testing of the drug product may be necessary.\n\nCVM considers the risk from manufacturing equipment to be low in most cases if appropriate, qualified equipment is selected for the process and GMP requirements (21 CFR parts 210, 211, and 226) are met. Unless an unusual amount of chemical corrosion or mechanical erosion of equipment results from the manufacturing process, no further assessment is expected.\n* Can a non-specific test, such as the test for heavy metals previously described in USP <231>, be used to test a component, or should instrumental methods, such as those described in USP <233> be used?\n* Procedures with selectivity and sufficient sensitivity for individual elements, such as the procedures described in USP <233>, should be used where controls for individual elements are necessary based on the risk assessment (see Appendix I for additional guidance). Non-specific tests, such as the procedures previously described in USP <231>, are unsuitable for controlling elemental impurities below acceptable limits. Non-specific tests for components determined to be low risk based on the risk assessment may be maintained at the sponsor\'s discretion. Previously reported non-specific tests can typically be deleted (see Q6 below). If you choose to maintain a non-specific test, it can be kept on site and should not be submitted to the file.\n* For approved products, should we continue to perform the USP <231> test for heavy metals where it is included in the approved specifications for components of a drug product?\n* The USP <231> test for heavy metals has significant limitations and we therefore do not recommend that it be used for controlling elemental impurities below acceptable limits where controls for individual elements are necessary based on the risk assessment. The heavy metals test and limit may be deleted, and the change may be reported in the next Minor Changes and Stability Report (MCSR). If the test method is maintained, it can be kept on site and should not be submitted to the file.\n* Some USP monographs contain limits for specific elements and, in some cases, a different general chapter, such as USP <211>, Arsenic, or USP <251>, Lead, is referenced. Do these limits apply to veterinary products?\n* At a minimum, these materials should continue to meet the requirements in the monograph, including the limits for specified elements, unless a risk-based justification supports their omission. An instrumental method consistent with those described in USP <233> may be used as an alternative to the referenced procedure.\n* If a certificate of analysis for an excipient or drug substance contains test results for specific elements using an instrumental method per USP <233>, do these tests need to be confirmed as part of vendor qualification?\n* This depends on the risk assessment. Communication with the supplier regarding the reason for including limits for specific elements is recommended. The results should be confirmed by the animal drug product sponsor only when deemed necessary by the risk assessment (see Q10 and Appendix I).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nQ9. When specified elements are known to be present in one or more of the excipients or the drug substance, how should the elemental impurity daily exposure from the drug product be assessed?\n\nA. The daily exposure to the elements should be calculated based on the supplier\'s limit, the amount of the excipient or drug substance in the drug product, and the maximum daily dose. If the same element may be introduced by more than one component of the drug product, the total exposure should be calculated. CVM generally considers the Permitted Daily Exposures (PDEs) for humans established in ICH Q3D in units of (\\mu)g/day acceptable for the safety of animal drug products. The calculated elemental impurity daily exposure should result in a level equal to or below the ICH Q3D PDE for the drug product; however, CVM recognizes that the PDEs in ICH Q3D are for humans. If the calculated elemental impurity content of the animal drug product exceeds the PDE in ICH Q3D, the animal drug product spons may provide a justification or contact CVM to discuss the product and veterinary-specific considerations.\n\nQ10. Even in cases where the COA includes results for elemental impurities and a specific risk factor has been identified, often the excipient or drug substance make up a small percentage of the drug product or the COA results demonstrate that the elements are controlled at low levels. Is there a threshold at which we would not be expected to confirm the COA results?\n\nA. If the elemental impurity content listed on the COA will lead to a daily exposure that is not more than 30% of the PDE for an element, the risk from the component can usually be considered below the threshold at which additional testing by the drug product manufacturer is necessary (see Appendix I), and confirmation of the COA values for elemental impurities will not be requested. If the 30% control threshold will be applied, the total daily exposure should not exceed 30% of the PDE in cases where the same element may be introduced by multiple components of the drug product.\n\nIf the 30% threshold is exceeded but the elements are below the PDE, the drug product manufacturer should confirm the component COA results for vendor qualification, or, alternatively, test every lot of the drug product to ensure that the element does not exceed the PDE. A test that is selective for the element should be used unless an alternative approach can be justified. The test method(s) and limit(s) should be submitted to the file (see Q11 below). Reduced testing may be appropriate for a qualified supplier in accordance with 21 CFR 211.84(d)(2). The test may also be discontinued if sufficient data are generated to support that the element remains below 30% of the PDE.\n\nQ11. What information should be submitted to the file?\n\nA. If test methods and limits for elemental impurities in components or the drug product are deemed necessary based on the risk assessment, they should be submitted to the file. If the drug product will be tested for elemental impurities, the method validation should also be submitted to the file. If one of the compendial procedures described in USP <233> is used, the animal drug product spons may simply reference that chapter for the method.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe risk assessment, any calculations, and any method validations for methods for elemental impurities in components, where applicable, should be kept on site to provide to an investigator upon request (see 21 CFR parts 210, 211, and 226). CVM may request additional information on a case-by-case basis.\nQ12. How should updates to the test methods and limits be reported to the file?\n\nFor approved products, this information can be provided in an annual MCSR unless a new testing facility is requested. A new testing facility should be reported in a supplement (please see CVM Guidance for Industry #83, ""Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved NADA or ANADA""4). Footnote 4: https://www.fda.gov/media/70323/download\n\nQ13. Does this guidance apply to Type A medicated articles?\n\nYes. When a specific risk factor has been identified that may lead to introduction of elemental impurities into the Type A medicated article, any calculations of the daily exposure should take into account the ultimate dilution of the Type A to produce a predicated feed.\nQ14. What if the drug product contains elements that are for therapeutic benefit?\n\nThis guidance does not apply to elements that are present in a form that is for therapeutic benefit (e.g., as part of the active pharmaceutical ingredient). However, the sponsor\'s risk assessment should consider the potential for elemental impurities to be present at elevated levels based on the composition of the active pharmaceutical ingredient.\nQ15. When is it necessary to reassess the risk for the drug product?\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #255 Elemental Impurities in Animal Drug Products Questions and Answers'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , For release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n--------------------\nContext: Recommendations for executed (completed) batch records are provided in CVM guidance for industry [42]: Animal Drug Manufacturing Guidelines-Series of Four Guidelines (1994). CVM encourages the submission of executed batch records for lots of drug substance and drug product used in support of the application as they provide valuable detail and insight into the manufacturing process and proposed controls.\n\na.1.1 Pharmaceutical Development Reports\n\nSponsors are encouraged to provide pharmaceutical development reports (PDRs) that describe the scientific rationale for the chosen manufacturing process(es) and controls for fermentation-derived intermediates, drug substances, and related drug products. A sponsor's ability to demonstrate process understanding can be factored into CVM's risk-based decision making (e.g., Pre-Approval Inspection Decision Support System (PAIDSS)). Suggestions for PDRs can be found in ICH Q8: Pharmaceutical Development.\n\na.1.2 Cell Growth (Propagation) and Harvest\n\nA description should be provided that includes a flow diagram illustrating each step in propagation from the original inoculum (e.g., cells from one or more vials of the working cell bank) through the last harvesting operation.\n\nAll steps should be included along with the relevant information, such as the growth conditions and in-process tests performed (e.g., cell concentrations, volumes, pH, cultivation times, temperatures).\n\nCritical steps and intermediates for which specifications are established should be identified, along with sampling plans and testing time points.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe flow diagram can be supplemented with information presented in tabular form, if appropriate.\n\nA narrative describing each manufacturing step in the process should accompany the flow diagram:\n\nIdentify all process controls and the associated numeric ranges, limits, or acceptance criteria\n\nHighlight any process controls that are considered critical\n\nIdentify the intended scale of the process. The amounts indicated should be representative of a maximum-sized production batch.\n\nWe recommend the following be included in the narrative:\n\nA description of the major equipment involved in each step\n\nA description of inoculation and each step in propagation with growth conditions specified\n\nThe composition of the media used at each step, including water quality and additives used\n\nThe sterilization procedures for media (e.g. a batch sterilization process or continuous system)\n\nThe equipment (e.g. fermentation vessel), feeds, and other materials added during the fermentation process\n\nProcess parameters monitored and controls for critical steps and intermediates\n\nProcedures used to transfer material between steps\n\nProcedures used to minimize contamination by adventitious agents\n\nProcess controls to confirm the effectiveness of the specific manufacturing steps used to inactivate and or remove adventitious agents\n\nCriteria for harvesting\n\nCriteria for rejecting/accepting a fermentation batch if contamination occurs\n\nThe determination of yields\n\nCriteria for pooling more than one harvest, if applicable\n\nStorage conditions and time limits if the harvested crude fermentation product is held prior to further processing\n\n3. Purification and Downstream Processing\n\nThe description should include a flow diagram that illustrates and a narrative that describes all the steps involved in isolating and purifying the crude fermentation product to its final form, along with any relevant information (e.g., volumes, pH, temperatures, holding times). Critical steps and intermediates for which specifications are established should be identified, along with testing time points.\n\nThe narrative describing each manufacturing step should accompany the flow diagram and should identify all process controls and the associated numeric ranges, limits, or acceptance criteria and include the following:\n\nMethods used in purification or separation of the crude fermentation product (e.g. precipitation, centrifugation, filtration) including major equipment (e.g. columns, membranes* Process parameters monitored\n\nThe in-process controls and analytical tests used to show identity, purity, and concentration and to evaluate levels of process- and product-related impurities\n\nThe determination of yields\n\nPrecautions taken to prevent or control microbial contamination during purification\n\nConditions for reuse and/or procedures for regeneration of columns, membranes, and adsorbents\n\nStorage conditions and time limits, if the purified fermentation product is held prior to further processing\n\n4. Modification Reactions (If Applicable)\n\nChemical Modifications\n\nWhen a product of fermentation is to be subjected to further molecular change through chemical means, a description of the synthetic steps should be included in the procedural narrative.\n\nAdditionally, a flow diagram of the synthetic process should be provided. For more details, see CVM guidance for industry 169: Drug Substance: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\nEnzymatic Modifications\n\nWhen the fermentation product is further modified using enzyme catalysts, the steps should be included in the flow diagram and detailed in the procedural narrative. Enzymatic reactions are considered chemical reactions since the conversion of substrate product involves breaking and forming chemical bonds. Thus, much of the information submitted in the manufacturing description should be the same as that submitted for chemical processes (drug substance).\n\nHowever, because enzymatic functionality requires carefully controlled conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, osmolarity), the description should contain detailed information on reaction controls and the optimum range of operation. Furthermore, the biological source of the enzyme should be provided along with a description of the enzyme's preparation and information about its purity.\n\n5. Reprocessing, Reworking, Recycling, Regeneration, and Salvaging\n\nWhen appropriate, reprocessing, reworking, recycling, regeneration, and salvaging operations should be described. For more detail, see CVM guidance for industry 169: Drug Substance: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\nAppendix C Control of Materials\n\nA list of materials used in the manufacture of fermentation-derived intermediates, drug substances, and drug products should be provided (i.e., the microorganism, cell bank system, media components, solvents, reagents, auxiliary materials). Information pertaining to the quality and control of these materials should also be provided.\n\n1. _Microorganism_Information about the microorganism used for production (i.e., genus, species, and type strain) and known genotypic and phenotypic characteristics should be provided. Additionally, the origin of the source material (or isolate) should be identified or described.\n\n2. Cell Bank System a. Master Cell Bank\n\nA brief description of the procedures used to generate the master cell bank (MCB) and the criteria used for qualification should be provided. The information should include:\n\nMethod, reagents, and media used in preparation\n\nDate of preparation\n\nProcess controls\n\nStorage conditions\n\nProcedures used in testing for relevant phenotypic and genotypic markers and determining culture purity\n\nProcedures used to ensure the absence of contamination from adventitious agents (e.g., microbial contamination and cross-contamination by other cell types) with tests and acceptance criteria specified\n\nb. Working Cell Bank\n\nPreservation of the microbial purity of the MCB is an important factor in maintaining the production strain. Often a working cell bank (WCB) is created so that the MCB will be less likely to be compromised. Creation of a WCB occurs via the propagation of the MCB through defined culture conditions, and then aliquots of the resultant homogenous culture suspension are partitioned into individual storage containers of appropriate size for routine production purposes.\n\nA brief description of the procedures used to derive a WCB from the MCB and the criteria used for qualification should be provided. Information similar to that submitted for the MCB should also be submitted for the WCB.\n\n3. Media Components\n\nA list of the media components used at each stage of the fermentation process should be included in the submission. Specifications should be provided for each component for verification that the material is of suitable quality for its intended purpose.\n\nIf ruminant-based media components are used in the fermentation process, they should comply with the proposed BSE Medical Products Rule, issued on January 12, 2007 (72 FR 1582).\n\nAll animal-derived components should be identified and appropriate mitigation steps taken to prevent the transmission of adventitious agents.\n\n4. Solvents, Reagents, Auxiliary Materials\n\nA list of solvents, reagents, and other auxiliary materials used in the fermentation process should be provided. Specifications for each material should be included for verification that the material is of suitable quality for its intended purpose. When water is used in the process, it should be of an appropriate quality for its intended use.\n\nControl of Critical Steps and Intermediates\n\nAll critical process controls and their associated numeric ranges, limits, or acceptance criteria should be identified and justified and a brief description of the test provided. Furthermore, any experimental data to support the justification should be included.\n\nGood controls are essential during fermentation to ensure product consistency.\n\nEnd product testing alone is not adequate for demonstrating a fermentation process is under control.\n\nManufacturing processes, including fermentation, should be controlled to ensure that the product meets previously identified quality attributes.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #216 Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) Information - Fermentation-Derived Intermediates, Drug Substances, and Related Drug Products for Veterinary Medicinal Use""]","['For example, does it use an enteric coating or slow release matrix.']",0.0,0.0
68,"Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?","['--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nSponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/sponsor-investigator-irb-interrelationship). Office of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nThe interrelationship and interaction between the research sponsor (e.g., drug, biologic and device manufacturers), the clinical investigator and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) may be very complex. The regulations do not prohibit direct sponsor-IRB contacts, although, the sponsor-IRB interaction customarily occurs through the investigator who conducts the clinical study. The clinical investigator generally provides the communication link between the IRB and the sponsor. Such linkage is agreed to by the sponsors and investigators when they sign forms FDA-1571 and FDA-1572, respectively, for drug and biologic studies or an investigator agreement for device studies. There are occasions when direct communication between the IRB and the sponsor may facilitate resolution of concerns about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The clinical investigator should be kept apprised of the discussion.\n\nSponsor Assurance that IRBs Operate in Compliance with 21 CFR Part 56\n\nFDA regulations [21 CFR 312.23(a)(1)(iv)] require that a sponsor assure the FDA that a study will be conducted in compliance with the informed consent and IRB regulations [21 CFR parts 50 and 56]. This requirement has been misinterpreted to mean that it is a sponsor\'s obligation to determine IRB compliance with the regulations. This is not the case. Sponsors should rely on the clinical investigator, who assures the sponsor on form FDA-1572 for drugs and biologics or the investigator agreement for devices that the study will be reviewed by an IRB. Because clinical investigators work directly with IRBs, it is appropriate that they assure the sponsor that the IRB is functioning in compliance with the regulations.\n\nAn IRB must notify an investigator in writing of its decision to approve, disapprove or request modifications in a proposed research activity [21 CFR 56.109(e)]. This correspondence should be made available to the sponsor by the clinical investigator. In the Agency\'s view, this required documentation provides the sponsor with reasonable assurance that an IRB complies with 21 CFR part 56 and that it will be responsible for initial and continuing review of the study. Also, the sponsor and, in fact, anyone who is interested, mayobtain an Establishment Inspection Report from an FDA inspection of an IRB. These reports summarize the conditions observed during the IRB inspection. FDA, however, does not certify IRBs.\n\nSponsor Access to Medical Records\n\nThe IRB is responsible for ensuring that informed consent documents include the extent to which the confidentiality of medical records will be maintained [21 CFR 50.25(a)(5)]. FDA requires sponsors (or research monitors hired by them) to monitor the accuracy of the data submitted to FDA in accordance with regulatory requirements. These data are generally in the possession of the clinical investigator. Each subject must be advised during the informed consent process of the extent to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained and of the possibility that the FDA may inspect the records. While FDA access to medical records is a regulatory requirement, subject names are not usually requested by FDA unless the records of particular individuals require a more detailed study of the cases, or unless there is reason to believe that the records do not represent actual cases studied or actual results obtained. The consent document should list all other entities (e.g., the sponsor) who will have access to records identifying the subject. The extent to which confidentiality will be maintained may affect a subject\'s decision to participate in a clinical investigation.\n\nConfidentiality of Sponsor Information\n\nThe IRB\'s primary responsibility with respect to protecting confidentiality is to the research subject. IRBs should, however, respect the sponsor\'s need to maintain confidentiality of certain information about products under development. IRB members and staff should be aware that information submitted for review may be confidential, trade secret, and of commercial interest and should recognize the need for maintaining the confidentiality of the review materials and IRB records. It is advisable for IRBs to have policies that address this issue.\n\nNonsignificant Risk Device Studies\n\n""A sponsor\'s preliminary determination that a medical device study presents an NSR is subject to IRB approval."" The effect of the IRB\'s NSR decision is important to research sponsors and investigators because significant risk (SR) studies require sponsors to file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with FDA before they may begin. NSR studies, however, may begin as soon as the IRB approves the study. The sponsor, usually through the clinical investigator, provides the IRB with information necessary to make a judgment on the risk of a device study. While the investigational plan and supporting materials usually contain sufficient information to make a determination, the IRB can request additional information if needed [21 CFR 812.150(b)(10)]. If the IRB believes that additional information is needed, it may contact the sponsor directly, but it should keep the clinical investigator apprised of the request. While making the SR/NSR determination, any of the three parties may ask FDA to provide a risk assessment. See FDA Information Sheet: ""Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies"" for further information.\n\nDisagreements\n\nThe sponsor may choose not to conduct, to terminate, or to discontinue studies that do not conform with the sponsor\'s wishes. For example, the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB may reach an impasse about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The FDA will not mediate such disagreements. The Agency\'s policy of decentralized ethical review of clinical investigations allows such decisions to be made by local IRBs, and any disagreements between a sponsor, IRB, and clinical investigator should be resolved through appropriate communication among those parties.\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) - Specific Electronic Submissions Intended For FDA\'s Dockets Management Staff (i.e., Citizen Pettitions, Draft Proposed Guidance Documents, Variances, and other administrative record submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management Food and Drug Administration 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061 Rockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\n[] Search for FDA Guidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators'

It does not create any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist institutional review boards (IRBs), clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA\'s informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. This guidance supersedes FDA\'s guidance entitled ""A Guide to Informed Consent,"" issued in September 1998, and finalizes FDA\'s draft guidance entitled ""Informed Consent Information Sheet,"" issued in July 2014. This document is structured to first present general guidance on FDA\'s regulatory requirements for informed consent and a discussion of the roles of IRBs, clinical investigators, sponsors, and FDA related to informed consent, followed by a series of frequently asked questions.\n\nIn a final rule published on January 19, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal departments and agencies revised the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects. The final rule became effective in 2018 (codified for HHS at 45 CFR 46, subpart A; ""the 2018 Common Rule"").2,3 The 2018 Common Rule sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by federal departments or agencies that have adopted the Common Rule. The revisions include significant changes to the provisions regarding informed consent. FDA is currently engaged in notice and comment rulemaking to harmonize its human subject protection\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nof the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Summary of the Consent process\n\nTo many, the term informed consent is mistakenly viewed as synonymous with obtaining a subject\'s signature on the consent form;9 however, obtaining documentation of a subject\'s informed consent is only part of the consent process. Informed consent involves providing a prospective subject, or their legally authorized representative (LAR), with adequate information to allow for an informed decision about participation in the clinical investigation prior to enrollment. Informed consent also involves facilitating the prospective subject\'s understanding of the information, providing adequate opportunity for the prospective subject to ask questions and to consider whether to participate, obtaining the prospective subject\'s voluntary agreement to participate prior to enrollment, and continuing to provide information as the clinical investigation progresses or as the enrolled subject or situation requires.10\n\nFootnote 9: In this guidance document, the terms informed consent form and informed consent document are used interchangeably.\n\nExcept as provided in 21 CFR 50.23 and 50.24,11 (see section III.A.1, ""Exceptions to Informed Consent""), no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in FDA-regulated research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s LAR (21CFR 50.20).12 To be legally effective, the informed consent process must satisfy the general requirements under 21 CFR 50.20 and include the relevant elements of informed consent described at 21 CFR 50.25 (see section3), ""FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion"").\n\nFootnote 12: As described in guidance, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances, with respect to its current regulations governing the requirement for informed consent when human specimens are used for FDA-regulated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device investigations. See “Guidance on Informed Consent for in Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable: Guidance for Sponsors, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff”, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-informed- Consent-vitro-diagnostic-device-studies-using-leftover-human-specimens-are-not\n\nFDA considers advertising used to recruit subjects into the clinical trial to be the start of the ongoing consent process, and the information provided in any online or hard copy recruitment materials should be consistent with the informed consent document. Generally, FDA recommends that any advertisement to recruit subjects be limited to the information the prospective subjects need to determine their interest and potential eligibility. The FDA information sheet ""Recruiting Study Subjects"" includes information regarding scripts for those who will interface with subjects to determine basic eligibility.13\n\nFootnote 13: See the FDA Information Sheet “Recruiting Study Subjects,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects, for further information.\n\nOnce a prospective subject is identified, and before research activities requiring prior consent occur, a person knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and capable of answering questions raised by the prospective subject should conduct a consent discussion. The consent discussion and the consent form must contain information to allow prospective subjects to make an informed decision about participation in a clinical investigation and provide an opportunity for prospective subjects to ask questions about the clinical investigation and the information in the consent document (see section3), ""FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion"") (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25).14 The consent form serves several purposes, including helping to ensure that prospective subjects receive the required information, providing a ""take home"" reminder of the elements of the clinical investigation, providing contact information in case additional questions or concerns arise, and documenting prospective subjects\' voluntary agreement to participate as well as the date of their agreement.\n\nFootnote 14: The regulations allow use of a “short form” consent form when the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For a discussion of the short form written consent, see section3.5.4.2, “Short Form.”\n\nThe informed consent process is an ongoing exchange of information throughout a subject\'s participation in a clinical trial and does not end after the consent form is signed. For example, if new safety information or protocol changes occur during the conduct of the study, additional information may need to be given to the subject, and/or the subject may need additional opportunities to ask questions and receive answers throughout the clinical investigation (see sectionIII.3.5, ""Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects,"" and Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nIII FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b ""Short Form"" for more details). If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For ""applicable clinical trials"" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, “Element of Informed Consent for ‘Applicable Clinical Trials.”\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsor\n\nFor studies conducted under an IND, 21 CFR part 312 provides that a sponsor is responsible for obtaining a commitment from each investigator that he or she will ensure that requirements in part 56 relating to IRB review and approval are met with respect to the research conducted by the investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d)). Sponsors can also initiate plans for use of a centralized IRB review process and facilitate agreements and other necessary communications among the parties involved.\n\n3.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.1.2 Investigator\n\nUnder 21 CFR part 312, an investigator is responsible for ensuring that there will be initial and continuing review by a qualified IRB of research conducted by that investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d); 312.66). If the investigator is conducting clinical research as part of a multicenter study at an institution with its own IRB and is subject to the policies of that institution, those policies would dictate how the investigator will ensure IRB review. Those policies may provide that the investigator\'s responsibility can be met by ensuring review through a centralized IRB review, through the institution\'s IRB, or through apportionment of IRB review responsibilities between a centralized IRB and the institution\'s IRB.\n\nCentral IRB\n\nFor multicenter studies, the central IRB is the IRB that conducts reviews on behalf of all study sites that agree to participate in the centralized review process. For sites at institutions that have an IRB that would ordinarily review research conducted at the site, the central IRB should reach agreement with the individual institutions participating in centralized review and those institutions\' IRBs about how to apportion the review responsibilities between local IRBs and the central IRB (21 CFR 56.114).\n\nIV Addressing Local Aspects of IRB Review\n\nThe implementation of a centralized IRB review process involves addressing a number of issues related to the communities where the research will take place. The requirements for IRB membership in 21 CFR 56.107(a) specify that the membership of an IRB must have sufficient experience, expertise, and diversity to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. This requirement was intended to implement a recommendation of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research that IRB members be ""men and women of diverse backgrounds and sufficient maturity, experience, and competence to assure that the Board will be able to discharge its responsibilities and that its determinations will be accorded respect by investigators and the community served by the institution or in which it is located.""1 In addition, IRB members must ""be able to ascertain the acceptability of the proposed research in terms of institutional commitments and regulations, applicable law, and standards or professional conduct and practice"" (21 CFR 56.107(a)). Thus, IRB review, through its membership, is intended to provide meaningful consideration of various local factors in assessing research activities, including the cultural backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, educational level, religious affiliations) of the population from which research subjects will be drawn, community attitudes10 about the nature\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nof the proposed research, and the capacity of the institution to conduct or support the proposed research. Inter-community differences could influence, among other things, assessments of whether mechanisms of subject selection will be equitable, whether adequate provision is made to minimize risks to vulnerable populations, and the adequacy of the informed consent process.\n\nThe preamble to the final rule indicates that where a centralized IRB review process is used (21 CFR 56.114), the review should consider the ethical standards of the local community.11 Therefore, a centralized IRB review process should include mechanisms to ensure meaningful consideration of these relevant local factors. Possible mechanisms include:\n\nFootnote 11: Federal Register, Vol. 46, p. 8966, January 27, 1981\n\nProvision of relevant local information to the central IRB in writing by individuals or organizations familiar with the local community, institution, and/or clinical research\n\nParticipation of consultants with relevant expertise, or IRB members from the institution\'s own IRB, in the deliberations of the central IRB\n\nLimited review of a central IRB-reviewed study by the institution\'s own IRB, with that limited review focusing on issues that are of concern to the local community\n\nOther mechanisms may also be appropriate.12 IRB meeting minutes or other records should document how relevant community issues were considered in the review (21 CFR 56.115(a)) (see section 5).\n\nFootnote 12: Guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) (IRB Knowledge of Local Research Context) discusses mechanisms for ensuring adequate consideration of local factors by IRBs in review of clinical research that is supported by DHHS funding. Although the guidance applies only to DHHS funded research, it may be also helpful to off-site IRBs seeking to provide meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for non-DHHS funded clinical research.\n\n5 IRB Records -- Documenting Agreements and Procedures\n\nIRBs and institutions are required to prepare and maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities (21 CFR 56.115(a)). IRBs are also required to follow written procedures for the conduct of initial and continuing review of clinical research and for reporting their findings and actions to the investigator and the institution (21 CFR section 56.108(a), 56.115(a)(6)). The following recommendations should help IRBs fulfill these requirements.\n\nDocumenting Agreements\n\nIf an institution, its IRB, and a central IRB agree (under 21 CFR 56.114) to participate in a centralized IRB review process, they should document that action in an agreement signed by the parties. IRBs should report this action to the investigator and the institution, for example, by providing copies of the agreement to the investigator, and the institution.13 If the agreement\n\n3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApportions IRB review responsibilities between a central IRB and the institution\'s IRB, the agreement should delineate the specific responsibilities of the central IRB and the institution\'s IRB for the initial and continuing review of the study.\n\nWritten Procedures\n\nWhen an institution and an institution\'s IRB rely on review by a central IRB, both IRBs must have written procedures in place to implement the centralized IRB review process (21 CFR 56.108, 56.114). For example, procedures should address the following:\n\nHow the institution\'s IRB determines that the central IRB is qualified to review research conducted at the institution\n\nHow the central IRB intends to communicate with relevant institutions, the institutions\' IRBs, and investigators regarding its review\n\nHow the central IRB ensures that it provides meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for communities from which research subjects will be drawn (see Section 4)\n\nHow the central IRB assesses the ability of a geographically remote site to participate in a study (e.g., whether the site has medical services appropriate to the complexity of the study)\n\nWhen an institution, an institution\'s IRB, and a central IRB agree to apportion IRB review responsibilities between the two IRBs, each IRB must have written procedures describing how it implements its responsibilities under the agreement (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)).\n\nVI Using a Central IRB at Unaffiliated Sites\n\nAt clinical sites that are not already affiliated with an IRB, investigators and sponsors typically rely on the review and oversight of a central IRB. In this situation, the central IRB should document in meeting minutes or other records how it considered relevant local factors for the various communities from which research subjects are to be drawn (see Section 4). The central IRB must also document its action in agreeing to conduct IRB review for the site (21 CFR 56.115) and must have written procedures in place that describe how it will perform its initial and continuing review responsibilities at remote sites (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)) (see Section 5).\n\nVII Examples of Cooperative IRB Review Models\n\nThere are a variety of mechanisms that have been used to distribute IRB review responsibilities between an institution\'s IRB and a central IRB. This guidance is not intended to endorse any particular mechanism. These examples are provided only to illustrate possible mechanisms.\n\nTrial in Which Multiple Sites Rely on a Central IRB\n\nThe primary model contemplated by this guidance is a centralized IRB review process used for a single multicenter trial performed by a commercial or publicly funded sponsor. Under 21 CFR 56.114, IRBs affiliated with the study sites could enter into agreements with a central IRB to rely on all or some of the review findings of the central IRB, or could decline to participate in a centralized IRB review (i.e., do their own complete review). Study sites not already affiliated with an IRB would rely on a central IRB for all IRB review responsibilities.\n\nCentral IRB Formed to Review Multicenter Trials in a Therapeutic Category\n--------------------\nContext title: Using a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: IRB meeting minutes must be in sufficient detail to show attendance at the meetings, actions taken by the IRB, the vote on these actions, the basis for requiring changes in or disapproving research, and a written summary of the discussion of controverted issues and their resolution (21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)). FDA anticipates that a study in which informed consent is not obtained for all subjects is by its very nature controversial. Therefore IRBs must summarize their discussions and decisions regarding the required elements for these studies (21 CFR 50.24(a)) in the IRB\'s written meeting minutes. For example, the IRB would document its discussion of issues raised during community consultation activities, particularly discussions of community opposition to, or concern about, the emergency research study. If the IRB approves the study despite the objection of some part(s) of the community, the IRB should also document this, and provide its reason(s) for doing so.\n\n4.2.4 What is meant by ""licensed physician concurrence""?\n\nThe IRB must have the concurrence of a licensed physician, both initially and at the time of continuing review, that the criteria of 21 CFR 50.24 are met (21 CFR 50.24(a)). The licensed physician must be ""a member of or consultant to the IRB and...not otherwise participating in the clinical investigation"" (21 CFR 50.24(a)). Where the licensed physician member(s) cannot participate in the deliberation andvoting for any reason, participation in the convened meeting by a licensed physician consultant would be necessary. Because the concurrence of the licensed physician member or licensed physician consultant is required for the IRB to allow these studies to proceed, IRBs should ensure that meeting minutes record the licensed physician member\'s affirmative vote or the licensed physician consultant\'s concurrence (21 CFR 50.24(a) and 56.115(a)(2)).\n\nVI Sponsor\'s responsibilities\n\nWhat are the sponsor\'s responsibilities under 21 CFR 50.24?\n\nIn addition to sponsor responsibilities required for the conduct of all clinical trials set out in 21 CFR Parts 312 and 812, 21 CFR 50.24 creates additional responsibilities for emergency research conducted under this exception from informed consent requirements. Below is a list of the sponsor\'s responsibilities under 21 CFR 50.24 and one possible order in which they might occur.37 (A sample flow chart is provided in Appendix C.)\n\nFootnote 37: Some of the activities under this rule are unique to emergency research studies; the order in which these activities occur is not specified in the regulations and may vary.\n\nAs part of the investigational plan for the study, the sponsor is responsible for defining the length of the potential therapeutic window,38 based on scientific evidence, during which the investigational product is to be administered to the subjects (21 CFR 50.24(a)(5)). Footnote 38: For more information, see Section IV. Therapeutic Window.\n\nThe sponsor is responsible for using an independent data monitoring committee to exercise oversight of the clinical investigation (21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(iv)).39 Footnote 39: For more information on data monitoring committees, refer to FDA’s Guidance on Establishment and Operations of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees; www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126578.pdf.\n\nThe sponsor submits the protocol to FDA in a separate IND or IDE, the cover sheet of which prominently identifies the study as involving an exception from informed consent under 21 CFR 50.24(d), 21 CFR 312.23(f), 21 CFR 812.20(a)(4), 21 CFR 812.35(a)).\n\nThe sponsor must obtain FDA\'s written authorization before the study may proceed (21 CFR 312.20(c); 21 CFR 812.20(a)(4)(i)).\n\nThe sponsor assists the clinical investigator in developing and providing to the IRB:\n\ninformation to document that the criteria for the exception from informed consent provided in 21 CFR 50.24(a)(1) through (4) are met;\n\nthe proposed investigational plan, including informed consent procedures and an informed consent document, procedures and information to be used when providing an opportunity for family members to object to a subject\'s enrollment and/or continued participation in the study (21 CFR 50.24(a)(6) and (7)(v), and 50.24(b));\n\nthe clinical investigator\'s commitment to attempt to contact the subject\'s legally authorized representative (LAR) to obtain consent, or provide the subject\'s family\nmember an opportunity to object, prior to administering the test article during the time allotted for this within the therapeutic window (21 CFR 50.24(a)(5) and (a)(7)(v)); * procedures and information to be used in the event of a subject\'s death to inform a subject\'s LAR or family members about the subject\'s participation in the investigation (21 CFR 50.24(b)); * plans for community consultation and public disclosure prior to the start of the study; and * information about opt-out mechanisms, if any are proposed by the sponsor. (See also Question 68.)\n\nThe sponsor and clinical investigator (or, where appropriate, the IRB, when the IRB has decided at its discretion to carry out community consultation activities) conduct the community consultation activities. FDA recommends that one or more IRB members attend the community consultation activities in person (see also Question 44), but if an IRB member is not able to do so, information gleaned from the community consultation activities should be provided to the IRB. The IRB should determine how information from community consultation activities is to be provided to the IRB (e.g., oral report at IRB meeting, written report by the investigator).\n\nThe sponsor must monitor the progress of all investigations involving an exception from informed consent under 21 CFR 50.24 (21 CFR 312.54(a), 21 CFR 812.47).\n\nThe sponsor must promptly submit to the IND or IDE file (and to Docket Number 95S-0158 in the Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), identified by the IND or IDE number), copies of the information that was publicly disclosed prior to initiation of the clinical investigation (e.g., plans for the investigation and its risks and expected benefits); see 21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(ii), 312.54(a), 812.47(a)). (See also Question 84.)\n\nThe sponsor must promptly provide in writing to FDA, information related to an IRB\'s determination that it cannot approve a research study under 21 CFR 50.24. The sponsor must also provide this information to investigators who are participating or asked to participate in the same or a substantially equivalent investigation, and to other IRBs that have reviewed or are asked to review this or a substantially equivalent investigation (21 CFR 50.24(e), 21 CFR 312.54(b), 21 CFR 812.47(b)).\n\nIf the IRB requires modifications in the plans for community consultation, the sponsor and the clinical investigator are responsible for revising the community consultation plans and resubmitting them for IRB review (21 CFR 56.109(a)).\n\nIf the IRB requires modifications in the plans for public disclosure, the sponsor and the clinical investigator are responsible for revising the public disclosure plans and resubmitting them for IRB review (21 CFR 56.109(a)).\n\nFollowing completion of the study, the sponsor prepares information to apprise researchers and the community(ies) about the study, including demographic characteristics of the research population, and the study\'s results (21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(iii)).\n\nThe sponsor must promptly submit to the IND or IDE file copies of the information that was publicly disclosed. The sponsor must also submit the information to Docket Number 95S-0158 in the Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), identified by the IND or IDE number (21 CFR 312.54(a) and 21 CFR 812.47(a)). (See also Questions 84 and 94.)\n\nVII Clinical Investigator\'s responsibilities\n\nWhat are the clinical investigator\'s responsibilities under 21 CFR 50.24?\n\nIn addition to the clinical investigator responsibilities set forth in 21 CFR 312 and 812, 21 CFR 50.24 creates additional responsibilities for emergency research conducted with an exception from informed consent requirements. Below is a list of the clinical investigator\'s responsibilities under 21 CFR 50.24 and one possible order in which they might occur.[33] (A sample flow chart is provided in Appendix C.)\n\nThe clinical investigator, assisted by the sponsor, provides to the IRB:\n\nmaterials documenting that the criteria for the exception from informed consent given in 21 CFR 50.24(a)(1) through (4) are met;\n\nthe proposed investigational plan, including informed consent procedures and an informed consent document, procedures and information to be used when providing an opportunity for family members to object to a subject\'s enrollment and/or continued participation in the study (21 CFR 50.24(a)(6) and (7)(v), and 50.24(b));\n\nthe clinical investigator\'s commitment to attempt to contact the subject\'s legally authorized representative to obtain consent, or provide the subject\'s family member an opportunity to object, prior to administering the test article during the time allotted for this within the therapeutic window (21 CFR 50.24(a)(5) and (a)7(v));\n\nprocedures and information to be used to inform a subject\'s legally authorized representative or family members about the subject\'s participation in the investigation in the event of a subject\'s death (21 CFR 50.24(b)); and\n\nplans for additional protections of the rights and welfare of subjects, including, at least, plans for community consultation and public disclosure prior to the start of the study.\n\nThe investigator and sponsor (or the IRB, when the IRB has decided at its discretion to carry out community consultation activities itself) conduct the community consultation activities. IRB members should attend the community consultation activities in person, but if that is not possible, information gleaned from the community consultation activities should be provided to the IRB.\n--------------------\nContext title: Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA also recommends that the IRB notify the sponsor of any instance of serious or continuing non-compliance with FDA regulations or IRB requirements or determinations, and any suspension or termination of IRB approval. Among the general responsibilities of sponsors is the assurance of proper monitoring of the investigation (21 CFR 312.50 and 21 CFR 812.40) and the selection of qualified investigators (21 CFR 312.53(a) and 21 CFR 812.43(a)). Informing sponsors of investigator non-compliance or IRB suspension or termination of the study allows the sponsor the opportunity to address these concerns. For example, the sponsor could work with the investigator to transfer subjects to another site in the local area, find a replacement investigator at the current site, or ensure that the study is terminated in an orderly manner.\n\n2.2.2 Suspension or Termination of IRB Approval\n\nThe IRB has the authority to suspend or terminate approval of clinical investigations:\n\nthat are not conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements (21 CFR 56.113); or\n\nthat are associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects (21 CFR 56.113).\n\nSuspension of approval may be appropriate when a significant issue is first identified and while the IRB investigates the matter. For example, if there is an allegation of investigator misconduct or a safety issue that needs further investigation and evaluation, the IRB may decide to suspend the study until the matter is resolved. In addition, the IRB may determine whether it is appropriate to notify subjects, and if so, when, given that complete information may not be available when the IRB first becomes aware of the issue.\n\nFor multi-site studies in which a local IRB is responsible for review of research at a given site, the local IRB's decision to suspend or terminate its approval of the research only applies to the conduct of the research project at the site under its review. On the other hand, if many or all sites engaged in a multi-site study rely upon a central IRB for review of the research, the central IRB could suspend or terminate its approval of the research either at one site because of a problem regarding the conduct of the research at that site, or at all sites under its review because of a study-wide problem. If an IRB (whose authority is only over a single site) believes the problem it found may be present at other sites, the IRB should inform FDA of its concern in the suspension or termination notification.\n\nAny suspension or termination of IRB approval must include the reasons for the IRB's actions and be promptly reported to the clinical investigator, institutional officials, and the FDA (21 CFR 56.113). IRBs must follow written procedures for ensuring such reporting (21 CFR 56.108(b)(3)).\n\nWhen reporting suspensions or terminations of IRB approval to FDA, IRBs should include:\n\nthe name of the drug, biologic, or device;the IND number; or the IDE number/non-significant risk (NSR) status of the device;\n\nthe full name of the research protocol;\n\nthe name(s) and address(es) of the clinical investigator(s);\n\nthe reason(s) for the suspension or termination; and\n\ninformation about the IRB's investigation and action plan to prevent/address future non-compliance.\n\nIRBs that have concerns about suspension or termination of approval of studies may contact FDA at any time to discuss these issues.27\n\nFootnote 27: See http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/ucm134493.htm\n\nWhen a study is suspended or terminated by the IRB, the IRB should consider the need to inform current or previously enrolled study subjects, as appropriate, about the action. In addition, an IRB should have established procedures to ensure that the rights and welfare of currently enrolled subjects are protected, subjects are not put at risk, and subjects receive appropriate care, if indicated, should the IRB (a) suspend or terminate its approval during the period for which IRB approval had already been given, or (b) disapprove a study at the time of continuing review. For example, the IRB, in consultation with the investigator and the subjects' treating physicians (if different from the investigator), may need to determine whether it is in the best interests of currently enrolled subjects to (a) continue receiving the interventions that were being administered to subjects under the study at the present site, (b) be transferred to another study-site so that participation of the subjects in the study may continue, or (c) be transitioned to medical management outside of the research context. Continuation of subjects on the test article may be appropriate, for example, when the test article holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the study subjects or when withholding the test article poses increased risk to study subjects. If the IRB decides that enrolled subjects should continue to receive the test article, it should also ensure that data collection (especially safety information) continues for such subjects. If follow-up of currently enrolled subjects is necessary to ensure their rights, safety or welfare, the IRB should ensure that the investigators inform the subjects, and report any unanticipated problems to the IRB, the sponsor, and the FDA (see 21 CFR 56.108(b)).\n\nAppendix\n\nCATEGORIES OF RESEARCH THAT MAY BE REVIEWED BY THE INSTITITUDINAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB) THROUGH AN EXPEDITION REVIEW PROCEDURE({}^{\\lx@sectionsign})1\n\nFootnote 1: An expedited review procedure consists of a review of research involving human subjects by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of the IRB in accordance with the requirements set forth in 45 CFR 46.110.\n\n[Federal Register: November 9, 1998 (Volume 63, Number 216)] [Notices] [Page 60353-60356]*\n\nFootnote *: The list may be viewed online via GPO Access at http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dhname=1998 register&docid=98-29748-filed.pdf\n\nThe list that is referenced in Sec. 56.110(a) was originally published in the Federal Register of January 27, 1981 (46 FR 8980), as a notice of a list of research activities that could be reviewed by the IRB through the expedited review procedures set forth in the FDA's regulations. OPRR has a separate codification that references the Expedited Review List for matters under the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) jurisdiction (45 CFR part 46). The HHS list was published in the Federal Register on January 26, 1981 (46 FR 8392). The FDA and HHS lists published in 1981 differ slightly, in that item nine on the HHS list, concerning research on individual or group behavior, pertains only to 45 CFR 46.110. Because behavioral research is not specifically regulated by FDA, that category was not included in the list published by FDA.\n\nApplicability\n\n(A) Research activities that (1) present no more than minimal risk to human subjects, and (2) involve only procedures listed in one or more of the following categories, may be reviewed by the IRB through the expedited review procedure authorized by 45 CFR 46.110 and 21 CFR 56.110. The activities listed should not be deemed to be of minimal risk simply because they are included on this list. Inclusion on this list merely means that the activity is eligible for review through the expedited review procedure when the specific circumstances of the proposed research involve no more than minimal risk to human subjects. (B) The categories in this list apply regardless of the age of subjects, except as noted. (C) The expedited review procedure may not be used where identification of the subjects and/or their responses would reasonably place them at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, insurability, reputation, or be stigmatizing, unless reasonable and appropriate protections will be implemented so that risks related to invasion of privacy and breach of confidentiality are no greater than minimal. (D) The expedited review procedure may not be used for classified research involving human subjects. (E) IRBs are reminded that the standard requirements for informed consent (or its waiver, alteration, or exception) apply regardless of the type of review--expedited or convened-utilized by the IRB. (F) Categories one (1) through seven (7) pertain to both initial and continuing IRB review.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nResearch Categories\n\n(1) Clinical studies of drugs and medical devices only when condition (a) or (b) is met. (a) Research on drugs for which an investigational new drug application (21 CFR Part 312) is not required;\n\n(Note: Research on marketed drugs that significantly increases the risks or decreases the acceptability of the risks associated with the use of the product is not eligible for expedited review.)\n\n(b) Research on medical devices for which (i) an investigational device exemption application (21 CFR Part 812) is not required; or (ii) the medical device is cleared/approved for marketing and the medical device is being used in accordance with its cleared/approved labeling.\n\n(2) Collection of blood samples by finger stick, heel stick, ear stick, or venipuncture as follows: (a) From healthy, nonpregnant adults who weigh at least 110 pounds. For these subjects, the amounts drawn may not exceed 550 ml in an 8 week period and collection may not occur more frequently than 2 times per week; or (b) from other adults and children,1 considering the age, weight, and health of the subjects, the collection procedure, the amount of blood to be collected, the frequency with which it will be collected.

This document has been endorsed by the ICH Steering Committee at Step 4 of the ICH process, June 2009. At Step 4 of the process, the final draft is recommended for adoption to the regulatory bodies of the European Union, Japan, and the United States.\n\nM3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration\'s (FDA\'s) current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction (1)2\n\nFootnote 2: Arabic numbers reflect the organizational breakdown in the document endorsed by the ICH Steering Committee at Step 4 of the ICH process, [date].\n\nObjectives of the Guidance (1.1)\n\nThe purpose of this document is to recommend international standards for, and promote harmonization of, the nonclinical safety studies recommended to support human clinical trials of a given scope and duration as well as marketing authorization for pharmaceuticals. Harmonization of the guidance for nonclinical safety studies will help to define the current recommendations and reduce the likelihood that substantial differences will exist among regions.\n\nThis is a revision of the ICH guidance ""M3 Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials for Pharmaceuticals"" that published in 1997. The revisions further harmonize recommendations in a number of areas and include a new section on exploratory clinical studies. This revised guidance discusses other nonclinical studies that should be conducted on a case-by-case basis as appropriate, including phototoxicity studies, immunotoxicity studies, juvenile animal toxicity studies, and abuse potential studies.\n\nThis guidance should facilitate the timely conduct of clinical trials, reduce the use of animals in accordance with the 3R (reduce/refine/replace) principles, and reduce the use of other drugdevelopment resources. Although not discussed in this guidance, consideration should be given to use of new in vitro alternative methods for safety evaluation. These methods, if validated and accepted by all ICH regulatory authorities, can be used to replace current standard methods. This guidance promotes safe, ethical development and availability of new pharmaceuticals.\n\n2 Background (1.2)\n\nThe recommendations of this revised guidance further harmonize the nonclinical safety studies to support the various stages of clinical development among the regions of the European Union (EU), Japan, and the United States. The present guidance represents the consensus that exists regarding the type and duration of nonclinical safety studies and their timing to support the conduct of human clinical trials and marketing authorization for pharmaceuticals.\n\n2 Scope of the Guidance (1.3)\n\nThe nonclinical safety assessment for marketing approval of a pharmaceutical usually includes pharmacology studies, general toxicity studies, toxicokinetic and nonclinical pharmacokinetic studies, reproduction toxicity studies, genotoxicity studies and, for drugs that have special cause for concern or are intended for a long duration of use, an assessment of carcinogenic potential. Other nonclinical studies to assess phototoxicity, immunotoxicity, juvenile animal toxicity and abuse liability should be conducted on a case-by-case basis. The types of nonclinical safety studies and their relation to the conduct of human clinical trials is delineated in this guidance.\n\nThis document applies to the situations usually encountered during the development of pharmaceuticals and should be viewed as general guidance for drug development. Nonclinical safety studies and human clinical trials should be planned and designed to represent an approach that is scientifically and ethically appropriate.\n\nFor biotechnology-derived products (as defined in Ref. 1), appropriate nonclinical safety studies should be determined in accordance with ICH S6.3 For these products, ICH M3(R2) only provides guidance with regard to timing of nonclinical studies relative to clinical development.\n\nFootnote 3: The ICH guidances referenced in this document are available on the CDER guidance page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the CDER guidance page.\n\nPharmaceuticals under development for indications in life-threatening or serious diseases (e.g., advanced cancer, resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and congenital enzyme deficiency diseases) without current effective therapy also warrant a case-by-case approach to both the toxicological evaluation and clinical development in order to optimize and expedite drug development. In these cases and for therapeutic modalities (e.g., small interfering RNA (siRNA)), as well as vaccine adjuvants, particular studies can be abbreviated, deferred, omitted, or added. Where ICH guidances for specific product areas exist, they should be consulted.\n\nGeneral Principles (1.4)\n\nThe development of a pharmaceutical is a stepwise process involving an evaluation of both animal and human efficacy and safety information. The goals of the nonclinical safety evaluation generally include a characterization of toxic effects with respect to target organs, dose dependence, relationship to exposure, and, when appropriate, potential reversibility. This information is used to estimate an initial safe starting dose and dose range for the human trials and to identify parameters for clinical monitoring for potential adverse effects. The nonclinical safety studies, although usually limited at the beginning of clinical development, should be adequate to characterize potential adverse effects that might occur under the conditions of the clinical trial to be supported.\n\nHuman clinical trials are conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of a pharmaceutical, starting with a relatively low systemic exposure in a small number of subjects. This is followed by clinical trials in which exposure to the pharmaceutical usually increases by duration and/or size of the exposed patient population. Clinical trials should be extended based on the demonstration of adequate safety in the previous clinical trial(s), as well as on additional nonclinical safety information that becomes available as clinical development proceeds.\n\nSerious adverse clinical or nonclinical findings can influence the continuation of clinical trials. Within the overall clinical context, these findings should be evaluated to determine the appropriateness and design of additional nonclinical and/or clinical studies.\n--------------------\nContext title: M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: This guidance does not apply to pharmaceuticals intended for cancer prevention, treatment of symptoms or side effects of chemotherapeutics, studies in healthy volunteers, vaccines, or cellular or gene therapy. If healthy volunteers are included in clinical trials, the ICH M3 guidance should be followed. Radiopharmaceuticals are not covered in this guidance, but some of the principles could be adapted.\n\nGeneral Principles (4)\n\nThe development of each new pharmaceutical calls for studies designed to characterize its pharmacological and toxicological properties according to its intended use in humans.\n\nModification of ""standard"" nonclinical testing protocols generally is warranted to address novel characteristics associated with the pharmaceutical or with the manner in which it is to be used in humans.\n\nThe manufacturing process can change during the course of development. However, the active pharmaceutical substance used in nonclinical studies should be well characterized and should adequately represent the active substance to be used in the clinical trials.\n\nIn general, nonclinical safety studies that are used to support the development of a pharmaceutical should be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices.\n\nII Studies to Support Nonclinical Evaluation (2)\n\nPharmacology (1)\n\nPrior to Phase 1 studies, preliminary characterization of the mechanism(s) of action and schedule dependencies, as well as anti-tumor activity of the pharmaceutical, should have been made. Appropriate models should be selected based on the target and mechanism of action, but the pharmaceutical need not be studied using the same tumor types intended for clinical evaluation.\n\nThese studies can:\n\nprovide nonclinical proof of principle;\n\nguide schedules and dose-escalation schemes;\n\nprovide information for selection of test species;\n\naid in start dose selection and selection of investigational biomarkers, where appropriate; and,\n\nif relevant, justify pharmaceutical combinations.\n\nUnderstanding the secondary pharmacodynamic properties of a pharmaceutical could contribute to the assessment of safety for humans, and those properties might be investigated as appropriate.\n\nSafety Pharmacology (2)\n\nAn assessment of the pharmaceutical\'s effect on vital organ functions (including cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems) should be available before the initiation of clinical studies; such parameters could be included in general toxicology studies. Detailed clinical observations following dosing and appropriate electrocardiographic measurements in nonrodents are generally considered sufficient. Conducting stand-alone safety pharmacology studies to support studies in patients with advanced cancer is not called for. In cases where specific concerns have been identified that could put patients at significant additional risks in clinical trials, appropriate safety pharmacology studies described in ICH S7A and/or S7B should be considered. In the absence of a specific risk, such studies will not be called for to support clinical trials or for marketing.\n\nPharmacokinetics (2.3)\n\nThe evaluation of limited pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., peak plasma/serum levels, area under the curve (AUC), and half-life) in the animal species used for nonclinical studies can facilitate dose selection, schedule, and escalation during Phase 1 studies. Further information on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the pharmaceutical in animals should normally be generated in parallel with clinical development.\n\nGeneral Toxicology (2.4)\n\nThe primary objective of Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer is to assess the safety of the pharmaceutical. Phase 1 assessments can include dosing to a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Toxicology studies to determine a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) or no effect level (NOEL) are not considered essential to support clinical use of an anticancer pharmaceutical. As the toxicity of the pharmaceutical can be greatly influenced by its schedule of administration, an approximation of its clinical schedule should be evaluated in toxicology studies. This is further discussed in sections III.C and III.D (3.3 and 3.4).\n\nAssessment of the potential to recover from toxicity should be provided to understand whether serious adverse effects are reversible or irreversible. A study that includes a terminal nondosing period is called for if there is severe toxicity at approximate clinical exposure and recovery cannot be predicted by scientific assessment. This scientific assessment can include the extent and severity of the pathologic lesion and the regenerative capacity of the organ system showing the effect. If a study of recovery is called for, it should be available to support clinical development. The demonstration of complete recovery is not considered essential.\n\nFor small molecules, the general toxicology testing usually includes rodents and nonrodents. In certain circumstances, determined case-by-case, alternative approaches can be appropriate (e.g., for genotoxic drugs targeting rapidly dividing cells, a repeat-dose toxicity study in one rodent species might be considered sufficient, provided the rodent is a relevant species). For biopharmaceuticals, see ICH S6 for the number of species to be studied.\n\nToxicokinetic evaluation should be conducted as appropriate.\n\nReproduction Toxicology (2.5)\n\nAn embryofetal toxicology assessment is conducted to communicate potential risk for the developing embryo or fetus to patients who are or might become pregnant. Embryofetal toxicity studies of anticancer pharmaceuticals should be available when the marketing application is submitted, but these studies are not considered essential to support clinical trials intended for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. These studies are also not considered essential for the purpose of marketing applications for pharmaceuticals that are genotoxic and target rapidly dividing cells (e.g., crypt cells, bone marrow) in general toxicity studies or belong to a class that has been well characterized as causing developmental toxicity.\n\nFor small molecules, embryofetal toxicology studies are typically conducted in two species as described by ICH S5(R2). In cases where an embryofetal developmental toxicity study is positive for embryofetal lethality or teratogenicity, a confirmatory study in a second species is usually not warranted.\n\nFor biopharmaceuticales, an assessment in one pharmacologically relevant species should usually be sufficient. This assessment might be done by evaluating the toxicity during the period of organogenesis or study designs as described by ICH S6. Alternative approaches might be considered appropriate if scientifically justified. The alternative approaches might include a literature assessment, assessment of placental transfer, the direct or indirect effects of the biopharmaceutical, or other factors.\n\nA study of fertility and early embryonic development is not warranted to support clinical trials or for marketing of pharmaceuticals intended for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. Information available from general toxicology studies on the pharmaceutical\'s effect on reproductive organs should be used as the basis of the assessment of impairment of fertility.\n\nA pre- and postnatal toxicology study is generally not warranted to support clinical trials or for marketing of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer.\n\nF. Genotoxicity (2.6)\n\nGenotoxicity studies are not considered essential to support clinical trials for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer. Genotoxicity studies should be performed to support marketing (see ICH S2). The principles outlined in ICH S6 should be followed for biopharmaceuticales. If the in vitro assays are positive, an in vivo assay might not be warranted.\n\nG. Carcinogenicity (2.7)\n\nThe appropriateness of a carcinogenicity assessment for anticancer pharmaceuticals is described in ICH S1A. Carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer.\n\nH. Immunotoxicity (2.8)\n\nFor most anticancer pharmaceuticals, the design components of the general toxicology studies are considered sufficient to evaluate immunotoxic potential and support marketing. For immunomodulatory pharmacokinetics, additional endpoints (such as immunophenotyping by flow cytometry) might be included in the study design.\n\nI. Photosafety testing (2.9)\n\nAn initial assessment of phototoxic potential should be conducted prior to Phase 1, based on photochemical properties of the drug and information on other members in the class. If assessment of these data indicates a potential risk, appropriate protective measures should be taken during outpatient trials. If the photosafety risk cannot be adequately evaluated based on nonclinical data or clinical experience, a photosafety assessment consistent with the principles described in ICH M3 should be provided prior to marketing.\n\n3 Nonclinical data to support clinical trial design and Marketing (3)\n\nStart Dose for First Administration in Humans (3.1)\n\nThe goal of selecting the start dose is to identify a dose that is expected to have pharmacologic effects and is reasonably safe to use. The start dose should be scientifically justified using all available nonclinical data (e.g., pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicity), and its selection based on various approaches (see Note 2). For most systemically administered small molecules, interspecies scaling of the animal doses to an equivalent human dose is usually based on normalization to body surface area. For both small molecules and biopharmaceuticals, interspecies scaling based on body weight, AUC, or other exposure parameters might be appropriate.\n--------------------\nContext title: S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 14: See, for example, the ICH guidances for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals and S7B Nonclinical Evaluation of the Potential for Delayed Ventricular Repolarization (QT Interval Prolongation) by Human Pharmaceuticals, and the guidances for industry Content and Format of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-derived Products and INDs for Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\nFor streamlined drug development programs addressing unmet medical needs for serious bacterial infections, sponsors should provide the following important nonclinical information about the investigational drug:\n\nIn vitro activity of the investigational drug, including the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) from a representative sample of target bacterial pathogens\n\nActivity in appropriate animal models of infection\n\nEvidence for the antibacterial drug's ability to achieve appropriate levels in relevant tissue sites from nonclinical studies (e.g., from appropriate animal models of infection)\n\nThe mechanism of action and whether mechanisms of resistance to other drugs affect its antibacterial activity\n\nThe evaluation of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships from animal models of infection, such as the PK/PD index that is associated with efficacy in a relevant animal model and/or in vitro model(s) based on: (1) the area under the unbound plasma concentration time curve over the MIC; (2) maximum unbound plasma concentration over the MIC; (3) time above the MIC; or (4) other appropriate metrics\n\nThe target value of the PK/PD index that is associated with efficacy in the animal model\n\nDose and frequency of administration that was evaluated in in vitro models of infection based on PK parameters obtained from human PK studies\n\n4 What are clinical trial design considerations in a streamlined development program?\n\nDifferent approaches can be used to evaluate an antibacterial drug for the treatment of a serious bacterial disease in patients with an unmet medical need. The approaches outlined below are provided as examples that sponsors may consider using. These approaches are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive; in some cases combining elements from different approaches may be appropriate. Sponsors are encouraged to discuss their specific proposed development programs with the FDA before commencing clinical trials. The following are examples of trial design considerations.\n\nNoninferiority clinical trials\n\nThe efficacy of an investigational drug intended to treat serious bacterial diseases in patients with an unmet medical need can be established on the basis of a noninferiority trial in a population of patients who have treatment options for their serious bacterial disease. The trial population should include patients with severity of illness and/or comorbid conditions that are similar to those of patients who have an unmet medical need to have a finding of safety and efficacy that can be relevant to the patient population with unmet medical need (i.e., patients with infections caused by bacteria resistant to other available antibacterial drugs).15({}^{,})16({}^{,})17\n\nFootnote 15: Patients with unmet need may have greater comorbidities, altered pharmacokinetics, or disease severity that affect treatment effect and patient outcomes. Enrolling patients with these characteristics in the noninferiority trial should increase the generalizability to similar populations of patients who have unmet need.\n\nGiven that the antibacterial drug would be indicated for use only for patients who have limited or no treatment options, the characterization of efficacy in a noninferiority trial could be based on a larger noninferiority margin than is typically recommended in infectious disease-specific guidances but still establishes effectiveness.18 The labeled indication would specifically state that the drug should be reserved for patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options (see the response to Question 17).\n\nFootnote 16: A hierarchical nested noninferiority/superiority analysis can be considered if a sufficient number of patients with infection caused by bacteria resistant to the control drug are expected to be enrolled in the trial. See the response in Question 4.c., Nested noninferiority/superiority clinical trials.\n\nBecause there usually will be few patients, if any, who have an unmet medical need in the noninferiority trial, sponsors may want to consider an additional clinical trial in patients with an unmet medical need.19 The additional clinical trial can be conducted in patients with the specific type of infection studied in the noninferiority trial as well as other types of infections of comparable or greater disease severity. Ideally, a randomized active-controlled trial is the best option, if active control therapy is feasible and ethical, because then comparative safety and efficacy evaluations can be performed. Experience has shown that having a randomized comparator group can be particularly important for interpreting safety data from the trial (in small trials that enroll acutely ill patients, having a comparator group can help in evaluating adverse events that may represent background adverse events in this ill population). This trial does not have to be powered for inference testing. If demonstrating statistical superiority is planned, refer to the response in Question 4.b., Superiority clinical trials.\n\nThe additional clinical trial should collect information on patient comorbidities, disease severity, and pharmacokinetics, with comparisons to the patient population in the noninferiority trial (see the response to Question 7 regarding PK/PD considerations).\n\n4 Superiority clinical trials\n\nAn investigational drug can be compared to best-available active control therapy in a single randomized controlled superiority trial. Sponsors should discuss with the FDA the type of trial design (e.g., a trial enrolling patients who have a particular type of infection (e.g., ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia) or who have different types of infection (e.g., ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia and complicated intra-abdominal infection)) and inferential statistical evaluations for a finding of superiority.\n\nThere may not be sufficient historical experience to clearly establish a reliable and reproducible treatment effect of the best available active control antibacterial drug therapy against placebo or no treatment. However, it is likely that it has a treatment effect greater than placebo or no treatment. Given this likelihood, it may be difficult to show unequivocal superiority for the investigational drug and it may be appropriate to use a less stringent statistical finding for superiority. In this case, an efficacy finding less robust than usual would be accepted as evidence of efficacy to enable the drug to be marketed because of the identified unmet medical need.\n\nA superiority trial design can be used to evaluate an antibacterial drug with activity against a single species (or a few species) of bacteria. A sufficient number of patients for enrollment into a trial of a particular type of infection (e.g., ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia) may not be available. Patients with infections at more than one body site caused by the bacterial species of interest can be enrolled in the trial, with inferential statistical testing for superiority.\n\nA superiority clinical trial design that relies on an external control population may be appropriate to evaluate efficacy when the untreated morbidity and/or mortality is high and does not vary widely in the patient population with unmet medical need, and the effect of the investigational drug in an unmet medical need population is expected to be large.20 For an externally controlled trial, the control patients should be as similar as possible to the population expected to receive the investigational drug. Patients should have been treated in a similar setting and in a similar time frame, except with respect to the investigational drug therapy. For sponsors considering an externally controlled trial, we recommend randomizing at least a small number of patients to the active control (e.g., through disproportionate randomization of 4:1), if feasible and ethical based on an active control considered to be best-available therapy. This will allow for an assessment of the comparability of the external control to the trial population. Frequentist and Bayesian statistical methods can then be used to combine external control data with data from the patients randomized to the active control in assessing differences between treatment groups for the primary comparison.\n\nNested noninferiority/superiority clinical trials\n\nPatients with and without unmet medical need can be included in a nested, active-controlled noninferiority/superiority trial design. Patients should be randomized to the investigational drug or the control drug before the availability of the results of antibacterial drug susceptibility testing of the bacteria causing the patient's infection because of the time required for results from susceptibility testing to become available using current technologies. The trial should include provisions for adjusting the control regimen to provide standard-of-care treatment for patients who are found to have resistant bacterial isolates at baseline. It is essential that adequate procedures be in place to protect patients enrolled in this trial from avoidable exposure to less effective therapy.\n--------------------\nContext title: Antibacterial Therapies for Patients With an Unmet Medical Need for the Treatment of Serious Bacterial Diseases""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: It is important to ensure that the experiences, perspectives, needs, and priorities of relevant stakeholders relating to the development and evaluation of the drug throughout its lifecycle are captured and meaningfully incorporated into drug development planning.\n\nClinical development may also feature requirements for co-development of validated biomarkers, diagnostic testing, or devices that facilitate the safe and effective use of a drug.\n\nThe types of studies that can contribute to drug development are described in subsections IV.2 (4.2) and IV.3 (4.3) and summarized in the Annex.\n\nQuality of Investigational Medicinal Product (4.1)\n\nEnsuring adequate quality and characterization of physicochemical properties of investigational medicinal product is an important element in planning a drug development program and is addressed in ICH and regional quality guidances. More extensive characterization may be required for complex or biological products. Formulations should be well characterized in the drug development plan, including information on bioavailability, wherever feasible, and should be appropriate for the stage of drug development and the targeted patient population. Age-appropriate formulation development may be a consideration when clinical studies are planned in pediatric populations (ICH guidances for industry E11 Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population (December 2000) and E11(R1) Addendum: Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population (April 2018)).\n\nEvaluation of the quality of a drug may extend to devices required for its administration or a companion diagnostic to identify the targeted population.\n\nChanges in a product during development should be supported by comparability data to ensure the ability to interpret study results across the development program. This includes establishing links between formulations through bioequivalence studies or other means.\n\nNonclinical Studies (4.2)\n\nGuidance on nonclinical safety studies is provided in the ICH guidance for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals (January 2010), in ICH Safety (S) Guidances and related question-and-answer documents, as well as in regional guidance. The nonclinical assessment usually includes toxicology, carcinogenicity, immunogenicity, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and other evaluations to support clinical studies (and may encompass evidence generated in in vivo and in vitro models, and by modelling and simulation). The scope of nonclinical studies, and their timing with respect to clinical studies, depend on a variety of factors that inform further development, such as the drug's chemical or molecular properties; pharmacological basis of principal effects (mechanism of action); route(s) of administration; absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; physiological effects on organ systems; dose/concentration-response relationships; metabolites; and duration of action and use. Use of the drug in special populations (e.g., pregnant or breast-feeding people, children) may require additional nonclinical assessments. Guidance for nonclinical safety studies to support human clinical studies in special populations should be reviewed (see, e.g., the ICH guidances for industry S5(R3) Detection of Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity for Human Pharmaceuticals (May 2021), S11 Nonclinical Safety Testing in Support of Development of Pediatric Pharmaceuticals (May 2021), and M3(R2).\n\nAssessment of the preclinical characteristics, including physiological and toxicological effects of the drug, serves to inform clinical study design and planned use in humans. Before proceeding to studies in humans, there should be sufficient nonclinical information to support initial human doses and duration of exposure.\n\nClinical Studies (4.3)\n\nClinical drug development, defined as studying the drug in humans, is conducted in a sequence that builds on knowledge accumulated from nonclinical and previous clinical studies. The structure of the drug development program is shaped by many considerations and comprised of studies with different objectives, designs, and dependencies. The Annex provides an illustrative list of example studies and their objectives. Although clinical drug development is often described as consisting of four temporal phases (phases 1 through 4), it is important to appreciate that the phase concept is a description and not a requirement, and that the phases of drug development may overlap or be combined.\n\nTo develop new drugs efficiently, it is essential to identify their characteristics in the early stages of development and to plan an appropriate development program based on this profile. Initial clinical studies may be more limited in size and duration to provide an early evaluation of short-term safety and tolerability, as well as proof of concept of efficacy. These studies may provide pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and other information needed to choose a suitable dosage range and/or administration schedule to inform further clinical studies. As more information is known about the drug, clinical studies may expand in size and duration, may include more diverse study populations, and may include more secondary endpoints in addition to the primary measures of efficacy. Throughout development, new data may suggest the need for additional studies.\n\nThe use of biomarkers has the potential to facilitate the availability of safer and more effective drugs, to guide dose selection, and to enhance a drug's benefit-risk profile (see the ICH guidance for industry E16 Biomarkers Related to Drug or Biotechnology Product Development: Context, Structure, and Format of Qualification Submissions (August 2011)) and can be considered throughout drug development. Clinical studies may evaluate the use of biomarkers to better target patients more likely to benefit and less likely to experience adverse reactions, or as intermediate endpoints that could predict clinical response.\n\nThe following subsections describe the types of studies that typically span clinical development from the first studies in humans through late development and post-approval.\n\n1.1.1 Human Pharmacology (4.3.1)\n\nThe protection of study participants should always be the first priority when designing early clinical studies, especially for the initial administration of an investigational product to humans (usually referred to as phase 1). These studies may be conducted in healthy volunteer participants or in a selected population of patients who have the condition or the disease, depending on drug properties and the objectives of the development program.\n\nThese studies typically address one or a combination of the following aspects:\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nEstimation of Initial Safety and Tolerability (4.3.1.1)\n\nThe initial and subsequent administration of a drug to humans is usually intended to determine the tolerability of the dose range expected to be evaluated in later clinical studies and to determine the nature of adverse reactions that can be expected. These studies typically include both single- and multiple-dose administration.\n\nPharmacokinetics (4.3.1.2)\n\nCharacterization of a drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion continues throughout the development program, but the preliminary characterization is an essential early goal. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies are particularly important to assess the clearance of the drug and to anticipate possible accumulation of parent drug or metabolites, interactions with metabolic enzymes and transporters, and potential drug-drug interactions. Some PK studies are commonly conducted in later phases to answer more specialized questions. For orally administered drugs, the study of food effects on bioavailability is important to inform the dosing instructions in relation to food. Obtaining PK information in subpopulations with potentially different metabolism or excretion, such as patients with renal or hepatic impairment, geriatric patients, children, and ethnic subgroups, should be considered (ICH guidances for industry E4 Dose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration (November 1994), E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations: Geriatrics (August 1994), E11 and E11(R1) Addendum, and E5, respectively).\n\nPharmacodynamics and Early Measurement of Drug Activity (4.3.1.3)\n\nDepending on the drug and the endpoint of interest, pharmacodynamic (PD) studies and studies relating drug levels to response (PK/PD studies) may be conducted in healthy volunteer participants or in patients with the condition or disease. If there is an appropriate measure, PD data can provide early estimates of activity and efficacy and may guide the dosage and dose regimen in later studies.\n\nExploratory and Confirmatory Safety and Efficacy Studies (4.3.2)\n\nAfter initial clinical studies provide sufficient information on safety, clinical pharmacology, and dose, exploratory and confirmatory studies (usually referred to as phases 2 and 3, respectively) are conducted to further evaluate both the safety and efficacy of the drug. Depending on the nature of the drug and the patient population, this objective may be combined in a single or small number of studies. Exploratory and confirmatory studies may use a variety of study designs depending on the objective of the study.\n--------------------\nContext title: E8(R1) General Considerations for Clinical Studies""

70,"Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?","['--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.3 Step 1 - Determine That There is Sufficient Justification to Enroll the Subject Without Using a Translated Long Form to Document the Subject\'s Informed Consent\n\nThe investigator, in consultation with the IRB chairperson (or another IRB member designated by the chairperson, hereafter referred to as designee) whenever feasible, determines that there is sufficient justification (e.g., due to a limited therapeutic window) for obtaining the subject\'s consent without waiting for a translated long form to be reviewed and approved by the IRB prior to enrollment of the subject. In making a decision to allow enrollment of a subject who does not understand English into a research protocol without waiting for a written translation of the long form, the investigator (and whenever feasible the IRB chairperson or designee) should consider whether the consent process, under this circumstance, will provide the subject with sufficient opportunity to understand the information being presented. If consent is sought and the investigator believes that the prospective subject has not understood the information presented, then the individual should not be enrolled in the research.\n\n2.4 Step 2 - Obtain and Document the Subject\'s Informed Consent in Accordance with FDA Regulations at 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 50.25 and 21 CFR 50.27 Using a Translated Short Form and the English Language Version of the Long Form as the Written Summary\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of 21 CFR 50.27(b)(2), informed consent is documented using a short form that has been translated into a language understandable to the prospective subject and approved by the IRB. As a prerequisite to using this procedure, the investigator must have available a short form written in a language understandable to the prospective subject or LAR and previously approved by the IRB (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.27(a)). To meet this prerequisite, the IRB mustrequire that the sponsor or investigator arrange for translation of a generic short form into a language understandable by the prospective subject or LAR, and the IRB must have approved the prospective use of such short forms for enrollment of subjects who do not understand English, as needed. Additionally, the IRB must approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The IRB-approved English long form often serves as this written summary. The translator should be fluent in both English and in the subject\'s language. It may be appropriate to have a translator available for all subsequent study visits to relay information between the subject and study personnel.\n\nThe procedure for obtaining and documenting the subject\'s informed consent with a translated short form and an English version of the long form includes the following:\n\nThe investigator (or their designee) obtaining informed consent, with the assistance of an interpreter if needed (e.g., if the investigator is not bilingual), provides orally to the subject the elements of informed consent required by FDA regulations at 21 CFR 50.25 and any additional pertinent information included in the IRB-approved English version of the long form. This presentation may be an oral translation of the IRB-approved English version of the long form. The oral presentation must be in language understandable to the subject (21 CFR 50.20). The investigator, with the assistance of an interpreter if needed, answers any questions from the prospective subject. There must be a witness to the oral presentation who must not be the person obtaining informed consent (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). Furthermore, FDA strongly recommends the witness be fluent in the language of the oral presentation. The witness must, at a minimum, have sufficient proficiency in the language of the oral presentation to be able to attest to the information that was to the presented orally to the prospective participant (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2).) In addition, if possible, the witness should not be related to the subject.\n\nAt the time informed consent is sought, the subject is given the IRB-approved translated short form and a copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form, which serves as the written summary.\n\nThe short form is signed and dated by the subject or LAR.\n\nThe witness signs both the short form and the copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form. (Note that when an interpreter assists the person obtaining consent, the interpreter may serve as the witness, but is not required to do so.)\n\nThe person actually obtaining consent signs the copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form.\n\nStep 3 - Take Additional Actions Following Subject Enrollment\n\nAfter the subject has been enrolled in the research, the investigator takes the following additional actions:1. If a subject was enrolled in the research using an untranslated long form to serve as the written summary, and if the investigator did not consult with the IRB chairperson (or designee) prior to enrollment of the subject who does not understand English, the investigator should promptly notify the IRB chairperson (or designee) that such a subject was enrolled.\n2. The investigator must obtain a translated copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form that served as the written summary, which should be done promptly. The investigator promptly submits it to the IRB for review and approval. Once the translated long form/written summary is approved by the IRB, the investigator must provide it to the subject or LAR and should do so as soon as possible. FDA considers this step essential to the requirement that informed consent be documented by the use of a written consent document and that the subject be provided a copy (21 CFR 50.27). Many of the clinical investigations regulated by FDA involve ongoing interventions and may involve long-term follow-up. For this reason, translation of the long form is critically important as a means of providing subjects or their LAR an ongoing source of information understandable to them.\n\nAdditionally, as noted above in Frequently Asked Question#3, FDA recommends that whenever subjects who do not understand English are involved in research, appropriate interpreter services be made available throughout the course of the research.\n\nix.1.6 What should be considered when enrolling subjects with low literacy and numeracy?\n\nAlthough a competent person who does not read and write well can give informed consent and enroll in a clinical investigation, the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB should consider whether any modifications to the informed consent process are necessary to ensure that the informed consent process is understandable.\n\nFor subjects with apparent low literacy and/or low numeracy, oral presentation of the information contained in the consent document is especially important. When the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject or the subject\'s LAR, the IRB may want to consider approving the use of a short form and written summary (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)), which includes a witness to the oral presentation of the informed consent elements who also signs the consent document (see _section_III.E.4.b, ""Short Form""). It should be noted that, even if the information is presented orally, the subject or the subject\'s LAR is required to sign the consent form (whether the long form or short form is used) unless the IRB has waived documentation of informed consent under 21 CFR 56.109(c).\n\nSubjects who cannot write can indicate their consent by ""making their mark"" on the consent document, in lieu of signing and dating the consent form when consistent with applicable law. In these situations, a note should be included in subject case histories required to be maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21CFR 812.140(a)(3) indicating the reason for the lack of a signature and date as required by 21 CFR 50.27(a). The date consent was obtained should be recorded in this note.\n\nvi.2.7 What should be considered when enrolling subjects with physical or sensory disabilities?\n\nA person with physical or sensory disabilities (for example, physically unable to talk or write or has hearing or visual loss) can enroll in a clinical investigation if competent and able to signal consent consistent with applicable law. Enrolling such subjects into a clinical investigation does not require a LAR to be involved with the informed consent process or to sign the consent document unless required by State or local law. The records relating to the clinical investigation must include documentation of the informed consent process (21 CFR 50.27) unless excepted under 21 CFR 56.109(c). FDA recommends including in subject case histories required under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3) a description of the specific means by which the prospective subject communicated agreement to take part in the clinical investigation and how questions were answered. FDA recommends that investigators provide reasonable modifications and auxiliary aids and services when necessary to meet the specific needs of the study population.80 For example, for subjects with vision disabilities, the investigator could use an audio recording of the contents of the consent form or a consent form with enlarged font, depending on the degree of impairment.\n\nFootnote 80: FDA strongly encourages stakeholders to ensure that informed consent documents are accessible to individuals with disabilities. To the extent an organization receives Federal financial assistance from HHS, the organization must comply with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This guidance provides information to assist IRBs, clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA’s informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. It does not provide guidance on how to comply with any regulatory obligations stemming from a source outside of the statutes FDA administers and FDA’s regulations.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: As noted in the previous answer, on April 24, 2001, FDA issued an interim final rule, Additional Protections for Children, as subpart D to 21 CFR Part 50. Informed consent of children who participate in clinical trials is addressed in subpart D. This interim final rule and its preamble are available at Additional Protections for Children (/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/additional-protections-children).\n\n49 Who should be listed on the consent as the contact to answer questions?\n\n21 CFR 50.25(a)(7) requires contacts for questions about the research, the research subject\'s rights and in case of a research-related injury. It does not specify whom to contact. The same person may be listed for all three. However, FDA and most IRBs believe it is better to name a knowledgeable person other than the clinical investigator as the contact for study subject rights. Having the clinical investigator as the only contact may inhibit subjects from reporting concerns and/or possible abuses.\n\nMay the ""compensation"" for participation in a trial offered by a sponsor include a coupon good for a discount on the purchase price of the product once it has been approved for marketing?No. This presumes, and inappropriately conveys to the subjects, a certainty of favorable outcome of the study and prompt approval for marketing. Also, if the product is approved, the coupon may financially coerce the subject to insist on that product, even though it may not be the most appropriate medically.\n\n51. Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n\nThe signed informed consent document is the written record of the consent interview. Study subjects are given a copy of the consent to be used as a reference document to reinforce their understanding of the study and, if desired, to consult with their physician or family members about the study.\n\nIn order to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, the consent document must be in language understandable to the subject. When the prospective subject is fluent in English, and the consent interview is conducted in English, the consent document should be in English. However, when the study subject population includes non-English speaking people so that the clinical investigator or the IRB anticipates that the consent interviews are likely to be conducted in a language other than English, the IRB should assure that a translated consent form is prepared and that the translation is accurate.\n\nA consultant may be utilized to assure that the translation is correct. A copy of the translated consent document must be given to each appropriate subject. While a translator may be used to facilitate conversation with the subject, routine ad hoc translation of the consent document may not be substituted for a written translation.\n\nAlso see FDA Information Sheets: ""A Guide to Informed Consent Documents"" and ""Informed Consent and the Clinical Investigator""\n\n52. Is it acceptable for the consent document to say specimens are ""donated""?\n\nWhat about a separate donation statement? It would be acceptable for the consent to say that specimens are to be used for research purposes. However, the word ""donation"" implies abandonment of rights to the ""property"". 21 CFR 50.20 prohibits requiring subjects to waive or appear to waive any rights as a condition for participation in the study. Whether or not the wording is contained in ""the actual consent form"" is immaterial. All study-related documents must be submitted to the IRB for review. Any separate ""donation"" agreement is regarded to be part of the informed consent documentation, and must be in compliance with 21 CFR 50.\n\n53. Do informed consent forms have to justify fees charged to study subjects?\n\nFDA does not require the consent to contain justification of charges.\n\nVII. Clinical Investigations\n\n54. Does a physician, in private practice, conducting research with an FDA regulated product, need to obtain IRB approval?Yes. The FDA regulations require IRB review and approval of regulated clinical investigations, whether or not the study involves institutionalized subjects. FDA has included non-institutionalized subjects because it is inappropriate to apply a double standard for the protection of research subjects based on whether or not they are institutionalized. An investigator should be able to obtain IRB review by submitting the research proposal to a community hospital, a university/medical school, an independent IRB, a local or state government health agency or other organizations.\n\n55. Does a clinical investigation involving a marketed product require IRB review and approval?\n\nYes, if the investigation is governed by FDA regulations [see 21 CFR 56.101, 56.102(c), 312.2(b)(1), 361.1, 601.2, and 812.2]. Also, see the information sheet entitled ""Off-label\' and Investigational Use of Marketed Drugs and Biologics"" for more information.\n\nVIII. General Questions\n\nWhich FDA office may an IRB contact to determine whether an investigational new drug application (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE) is required for a study of a test article?\n\nFor drugs, the IRB may contact the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Office of Communications, Division of Drug Information at (301) 796-3400.\n\nFor biological products, contact the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Office of Communication, Outreach and Development, at (800)-835-4709 or (301) 827-1800.\n\nFor medical devices, contact the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) Staff, Office of Device Evaluation, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), at (301) 796-5640.\n\n57. What happens during an FDA inspection of an IRB?\n\nFDA field investigators interview institutional officials and examine the IRB records to determine compliance with FDA regulations. Also, see the information sheet entitled ""FDA Institutional Review Board Inspections"" for a complete description of the inspection process.\n\n58. Does a treatment IND/IDE [21 CFR 312.34/812.36 ] require prior IRB approval?\n\nTest articles given to human subjects under a treatment IND/IDE require prior IRB approval, with two exceptions. If a life-threatening emergency exists, as defined by 21 CFR 56.102(d), the procedures described in 56.104(c) (""Exemptions from IRB Requirement"") may be followed. In addition, FDA may grant the sponsor or sponsor/investigator a waiver of the IRB requirement in accord with 21 CFR 56.105. An IRB may still choose to review a study even if FDA has granted a waiver. For further information see the information sheets entitled""Emergency Use of an Investigational Drug or Biologic,"" ""Emergency Use of Unapproved Medical Devices,"" ""Waiver of IRB Requirements"" and ""Treatment use of Investigational Drugs and Biologics.""\n\n59. How have the FDA policies on enrollment of special populations changed?\n\nOn July 22, 1993, the FDA published the Guideline for the Study and Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Drugs, in the Federal Register [58 FR 39406]. The guideline was developed to ensure that the drug development process provides adequate information about the effects of drugs and biological products in women. For further information, see the information sheet entitled ""Evaluation of Gender Differences in Clinical Investigations.""\n\nOn December 13, 1994, FDA published a final rule on the labeling of prescription drugs for pediatric populations [59 FR 64240]. The rule [21 CFR 201.57] encourages sponsors to include pediatric subjects in clinical trials so that more complete information about the use of drugs and biological products in the pediatric population can be developed.\n\n6o. What is a medical device?\n\nA medical device is any instrument, apparatus, or other similar or related article, including component, part, or accessory, which is: (a) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopeia, or any supplement to them; (b) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in humans or other animals; or (c) intended to affect the structure or any function of the human body or in animals; and does not achieve any of its principal intended purposes through chemical action within or on the human body or in animals and is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its principal intended purposes.\n\nApproximately 1,700 types of medical devices are regulated by FDA. The range of devices is broad and diverse, including bandages, thermometers, ECG electrodes, IUDs, cardiac pacemakers, and hemodialysis machines. For further information, see the information sheets entitled ""Medical Devices,"" ""Frequently Asked Questions about IRB Review of Medical Devices"" and ""Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies.""\n\n61. Are in vitro diagnostic products medical devices?\n\nYes. The definition of a ""device"" includes in vitro diagnostic products - devices that aid in the diagnosis of disease or medical/physiological conditions (e.g., pregnancy) by using human or animal components to cause chemical reactions, fermentation, and the like. A few diagnostic products are intended for use in controlling other regulated products (such as those used to screen the blood supply for transfusion-transmitted diseases) and are regulated as biological products.\n\n62. What are the IRB\'s general obligations towards intraocular lens (IOL) clinical investigations?An IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of all IOL clinical investigations. Each individual IOL style is subject to a separate review by the IRB. This does not, however, preclude the IRB from using prior experience with other IOL investigations in considering the comparative merits of a new lens style. All IOL studies are also subject to FDA approval.\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: How do you obtain informed consent from someone who speaks and understands English but cannot read? Illiterate persons who understand English may have the consent read to them and ""make their mark,"" if appropriate under applicable state law. The 21 CFR 50.27(b)(2) requirements for signature of a witness to the consent process and signature of the person conducting consent interview must be followed, if a ""short form"" is used. Clinical investigators should be cautious when enrolling subjects who may not truly understand what they have agreed to do.\n\nThe IRB should consider illiterate persons as likely to be vulnerable to coercion and undue influence and should determine that appropriate additional safeguards are in place when enrollment of such persons is anticipated, see 21 CFR 56.111(b).\n\n41. Must a witness observe the entire consent interview or only the signature of the subject?\n\nFDA does not require the signature of a witness when the subject reads and is capable of understanding the consent document, as outlined in 21 CFR 50.27(b)(1). The intended purpose is to have the witness present during the entire consent interview and to attest to the accuracy of the presentation and the apparent understanding of the subject. If the intent of the regulation were only to attest to the validity of the subject\'s signature, witnessing would also be required when the subject reads the consent.\n\n42. Should the sponsor prepare a model informed consent document?\n\nAlthough not required by the IND regulations, the sponsor provides a service to the clinical investigator and the IRB when it prepares suggested study-specific wording for the scientific and technical content of the consent document. However, the IRB has the responsibility and authority to determine the adequacy and appropriateness of all of the wording in the consent, see 21 CFR 56.109(a), 111(a)(4) and 111(a)(5). If an IRB insists on wording the sponsor cannot accept, the sponsor may decide not to conduct the study at that site. For medical device studies that are conducted under an IDE, copies of all forms and informational materials to be provided to subjects to obtain informed consent must be submitted to FDA as part of the IDE, see 21 CFR 812.25(g).\n\n43. Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n\nFor investigational devices, the informed consent is a required part of the IDE submission. It is, therefore, approved by FDA as part of the IDE application. When an IRB makes substantive changes in the document, FDA reapproval is required and the sponsor is necessarily involved in this process.\n\nFDA regulations for other products do not specifically require the sponsor to review IRB approved consent documents. However, most sponsors do conduct such reviews to assure the wording is acceptable to the sponsor.\n\n44. Are there alternatives to obtaining informed consent from a subject?\n\nThe regulations generally require that the investigator obtain informed consent from subjects. Investigators also may obtain informed consent from a legally authorized representative of the subject. FDA recognizes that a durable power of attorney might suffice as identifying a legally authorized representative under some state and local laws. For example, a subject might have designated an individual to provide consent with regard to health care decisions through a durable power of attorney and have specified that the individual also has the power to make decisions on entry into research. FDA defers to state and local laws regarding who is a legally authorized representative. Therefore, the IRB should assure that the consent procedures comply with state and local laws, including assurance that the law applies to obtaining informed consent for subjects participating in research as well as for patients who require health care decisions.""\n\nAlternatives 1 and 2 are provided for in the regulations and are appropriate. Alternative 3 allows a designated individual to provide consent for a patient with regard to health care decisions and is appropriate when it specifically includes entry into research. FDA defers to state and local laws regarding substituted consent. Therefore, the IRB must assure itself that the substituted consent procedures comply with state and local law, including assurance the law applies to obtaining informed consent for subjects participating in research as well as for patients who require health care decisions.\n\n45 When should study subjects be informed of changes in the study?\n\nProtocol amendments must receive IRB review and approval before they are implemented, unless an immediate change is necessary to eliminate an apparent hazard to the subjects (21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)). Those subjects who are presently enrolled and actively participating in the study should be informed of the change if it might relate to the subjects\' willingness to continue their participation in the study (21 CFR 50.25(b)(5)). FDA does not require reconsenting of subjects that have completed their active participation in the study, or of subjects who are still actively participating when the change will not affect their participation, for example when the change will be implemented only for subsequently enrolled subjects.\n\n61 Informed Consent Document Content\n\nMay an IRB require that the sponsor of the study and/or the clinical investigator be identified on the study\'s consent document?\n\nYes. The FDA requirements for informed consent are the minimum basic elements of informed consent that must be presented to a research subject [21 CFR 50.25]. An IRB may require inclusion of any additional information which it considers important to a subject\'s decision to participate in a research study [21 CFR 56.109(b)].\n\n63 Does FDA require the informed consent document to contain a space for assent by children?\n\nNo, however, many investigators and IRBs consider it standard practice to obtain the agreement of older children who can understand the circumstances before enrolling them in research. While the FDA regulations do not specifically address enrollment of children (other than to include them as a class of vulnerable subjects), the basic requirement of 21 CFR 50.20 applies, i.e., the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative must be obtained before enrollment. Parents, legal guardians and/or others may have the ability to give permission to enroll children in research, depending on applicable state and local law of the jurisdiction in which the research is conducted. (Note: permission to enroll in research is not the same as permission to provide medical treatment.) IRBs generally require investigators to obtain the permission of one or both of the parents or guardian (as appropriate) and the assent of children who possess the intellectual and emotional ability to comprehend the concepts involved. Some IRBs require two documents, a fully detailed explanation for parents and older children to read and sign, and a shorter, simpler one for younger children. [For research supported by DHHS, the additional protections at 45 CFR 46 Subpart D are also required. The Subpart D regulations provide appropriate guidance for all other pediatric studies.] On April 24, 2001, FDA issued an interim final rule, Additional Protections for Children, as subpart D to 21 CFR Part 50. Assent by children is addressed in subpart D. This interim final rule and its preamble are available at Additional Protections for Children (/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/additional-protections-children).\n\n48 Does FDA require the signature of children on informed consent documents?\n\nAs indicated above, researchers may seek assent of children of various ages. Older children may be well acquainted with signing documents through prior experience with testing, licensing and/or other procedures normally encountered in their lives. Signing a form to give their assent for research would not be perceived as unusual and would be reasonable. Younger children, however, may never have had the experience of signing a document. For these children requiring a signature may not be appropriate, and some other technique to verify assent could be used. For example, a third party may verify, by signature, that the assent of the child was obtained.\n\nAs noted in the previous answer, on April 24, 2001, FDA issued an interim final rule, Additional Protections for Children, as subpart D to 21 CFR Part 50. Informed consent of children who participate in clinical trials is addressed in subpart D. This interim final rule and its preamble are available at Additional Protections for Children (/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/additional-protections-children).\n\n49 Who should be listed on the consent as the contact to answer questions?\n\n21 CFR 50.25(a)(7) requires contacts for questions about the research, the research subject\'s rights and in case of a research-related injury. It does not specify whom to contact. The same person may be listed for all three. However, FDA and most IRBs believe it is better to name a knowledgeable person other than the clinical investigator as the contact for study subject rights. Having the clinical investigator as the only contact may inhibit subjects from reporting concerns and/or possible abuses.\n\nMay the ""compensation"" for participation in a trial offered by a sponsor include a coupon good for a discount on the purchase price of the product once it has been approved for marketing?No. This presumes, and inappropriately conveys to the subjects, a certainty of favorable outcome of the study and prompt approval for marketing. Also, if the product is approved, the coupon may financially coerce the subject to insist on that product, even though it may not be the most appropriate medically.\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 64: See section IV.A.4 for guidance regarding identification of the most up-to-date version of the informed consent form.\n\niv.2.4 Identification of Revised Consent Forms\n\nThe IRB should ensure that there is a way to identify a revised consent form so that continued use of a previously approved version does not occur. While not required by FDA regulations, the use of date stamps is one possible mechanism for ensuring use of the most recently approved version of the consent form.\n\nThe Clinical Investigator\n\nThe clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects during a clinical investigation, and for ensuring that, unless an exception applies, legally effective informed consent is obtained from each subject or the subject\'s LAR before that subject takes part in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.20(a), 312.60, and 812.100). Legally effective informed consent includes meeting all applicable Federal, State, and local laws that require additional information in the informed consent form beyond what FDA regulations require. Sponsors and investigators may wish to seek legal guidance regarding specific local consent requirements applicable to their research.\n\nThe clinical investigator should notify the IRB regarding the consent process, including who (e.g., the investigator or another study team member) will conduct the consent discussion. Any information that will be given to subjects to review and discuss as part of informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)). An investigator may not begin the informed consent process with prospective subjects until the IRB reviews and approves the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process (21 CFR 50.20, 50.27, and 56.109).\n\nThe clinical investigator\'s institution may have standard language or a standard format for consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation). FDA recognizes that investigators may also need to identify and meet institutional requirements and incorporate them into the consent form for the IRB\'s initial review of the clinical investigation.\n\nDuring the clinical investigation, the investigator may need to revise the consent form to address new information that might arise during the conduct of the trial, such as a change to the protocol or new safety information. The investigator will need to obtain IRB review and approval of the revised consent form (21 CFR 50.27 and 56.109). In addition, because the consent form is being modified to reflect new information that might affect the willingness of already enrolled and actively participating subjects to continue in the clinical investigation, the IRB should determine the need to inform the previously enrolled subjects of the new information and determine their willingness to continue in the research (see\n\nFrequently Asked Questions #16).\n\nAny new information that is part of the consent process must be reviewed and approved by the IRB as a change in approved research before it is initiated, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject (see 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)). In the rare event that urgent safety information is provided to the subject prior to IRB approval, the IRB should promptly be notified of both the safety issue and the notification of subjects.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the clinical investigator:\n\niv.2.1 Delegation of Consent Discussion\n\nFDA regulations require that the investigator obtain the legally effective informed consent of subjects (21 CFR 50.20, 312.60 and 812.100). If the investigator delegates this responsibility, FDA expects that the individual to whom the responsibility is delegated be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform this activity. The individual obtaining informed consent should be knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and have the appropriate training and credentials to be able to address any questions or concerns the subject may have about the study and/or alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject. The investigator should have a detailed plan for the supervision and training of staff, and oversight of the clinical investigation, including the informed consent process.65 Even when a task is delegated to another individual, the investigator remains responsible for ensuring that legally effective informed consent is obtained for all subjects in accordance with 21 CFR part 50.\n\niv.2.2 Financial Relationships and Interests\n\nThe clinical investigator should consider whether information related to financial relationships or interests should be provided to subjects.66 Clinical investigators should consider the potential effects that a financial relationship might have on the clinical investigation or on interactions with subjects. When there are financial relationships or interests, clinical investigators should consider the following actions:\n\nFootnote 66: See the HHS guidance document, “Financial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidance for Human Subject Protection,” available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/financial-conflict-of-interest/index.html#.\n\nIncluding information in the informed consent form, such as:\n\nThe source of funding and funding arrangements for the conduct and review of the clinical investigation, or\n\nInformation about a financial arrangement or interest (e.g., stock in the study sponsor, patent on the investigational product) of an institution or an investigator and how it is being managed.\n\nUsing special measures to modify the informed consent process when a potential or actual financial conflict exists, such as:\n\nHaving another individual who does not have a potential or actual conflict of interest involved in the consent process, especially when a potential or actual conflict of interest could influence the tone, presentation, or type of information presented during the consent process.\n\nUsing independent monitoring of the consent process.\n\nAlthough the clinical investigator should consider these issues regarding financial relationships and interests, IRBs have the final responsibility of determining whether subjects should be provided with information regarding the source of funding, funding arrangements, or financial interests of parties involved in the clinical investigation as part of the informed consent process (see 21 CFR 56.109 and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).\n\nThe Sponsor\n\nSponsors often provide clinical investigators with a model consent form that may be adapted by the clinical investigator to meet local needs. When the consent form for studies that require an IND or IDE application is submitted to FDA for review, FDA\'s comments are generally directed to the sponsor (see sectionIV.4.1, ""Investigational New Drugs and Biologics,"" and sectionIV.4.2, ""Investigational Medical Devices""). The sponsor should promptly provide the clinical investigator with any necessary modifications required to satisfy the regulations at 21 CFR 50.25 so that changes can be made to the consent forms. A modified model consent form reflecting the changes may be used to convey the necessary edits. Because the clinical investigator must receive IRB approval before starting the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 312.66 and 21 CFR 812.110(a)), the sponsor should work closely with the clinical investigator to make certain the modified consent form is reviewed and approved by the IRB. The clinical investigator should provide the sponsor with a copy of the consent form approved by the IRB.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the sponsor:\n\niv.3.1 Considerations for Multicenter Clinical Investigations\n\nFor multicenter clinical investigations, changes may need to be made to the consent form to address local and institutional requirements. For multicenter clinical investigations reviewed by more than one IRB, when local IRB review results in substantive modifications to the consent form, i.e., changes that affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects, FDA expects the sponsor to share the revisions with all investigators and their IRBs. In this situation it may be more efficient to share the changes with the sites using a modified model consent form, when appropriate. If the multicenter clinical investigation has a central IRB cooperating with local IRBs or human research protection offices, the revisions should be forwarded to the central IRB.67 Alternatively, local issues may be addressed by the central IRB depending on the review agreement between the local IRB(s) and central IRB. Note that for medicaldevice studies that require submission of an IDE application, such changes must be submitted to FDA.68\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 812.35(a).\n\nFootnote 69: The 2018 Common Rule requires that any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States, unless the research is not subject to the provision (45 CFR 46.114(b)). The compliance date for research subject to this provision was January 20, 2020. On September 28, 2022, FDA issued a proposed rule to harmonize with this requirement to the extent practicable and consistent with statutory provisions (see https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/28/2022-21089/institutional-review-boards-cooperative-research). The January 19, 2017, final rule revising the Common Rule is available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/finalized-revisions-common-rule/index.html.\n\n.4.2 Sponsor Personnel\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'

It does not create any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist institutional review boards (IRBs), clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA\'s informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. This guidance supersedes FDA\'s guidance entitled ""A Guide to Informed Consent,"" issued in September 1998, and finalizes FDA\'s draft guidance entitled ""Informed Consent Information Sheet,"" issued in July 2014. This document is structured to first present general guidance on FDA\'s regulatory requirements for informed consent and a discussion of the roles of IRBs, clinical investigators, sponsors, and FDA related to informed consent, followed by a series of frequently asked questions.\n\nIn a final rule published on January 19, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal departments and agencies revised the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects. The final rule became effective in 2018 (codified for HHS at 45 CFR 46, subpart A; ""the 2018 Common Rule"").2,3 The 2018 Common Rule sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by federal departments or agencies that have adopted the Common Rule. The revisions include significant changes to the provisions regarding informed consent. FDA is currently engaged in notice and comment rulemaking to harmonize its human subject protection\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nof the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Summary of the Consent process\n\nTo many, the term informed consent is mistakenly viewed as synonymous with obtaining a subject\'s signature on the consent form;9 however, obtaining documentation of a subject\'s informed consent is only part of the consent process. Informed consent involves providing a prospective subject, or their legally authorized representative (LAR), with adequate information to allow for an informed decision about participation in the clinical investigation prior to enrollment. Informed consent also involves facilitating the prospective subject\'s understanding of the information, providing adequate opportunity for the prospective subject to ask questions and to consider whether to participate, obtaining the prospective subject\'s voluntary agreement to participate prior to enrollment, and continuing to provide information as the clinical investigation progresses or as the enrolled subject or situation requires.10\n\nFootnote 9: In this guidance document, the terms informed consent form and informed consent document are used interchangeably.\n\nExcept as provided in 21 CFR 50.23 and 50.24,11 (see section III.A.1, ""Exceptions to Informed Consent""), no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in FDA-regulated research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s LAR (21CFR 50.20).12 To be legally effective, the informed consent process must satisfy the general requirements under 21 CFR 50.20 and include the relevant elements of informed consent described at 21 CFR 50.25 (see section3), ""FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion"").\n\nFootnote 12: As described in guidance, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances, with respect to its current regulations governing the requirement for informed consent when human specimens are used for FDA-regulated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device investigations. See “Guidance on Informed Consent for in Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable: Guidance for Sponsors, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff”, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-informed- Consent-vitro-diagnostic-device-studies-using-leftover-human-specimens-are-not\n\nFDA considers advertising used to recruit subjects into the clinical trial to be the start of the ongoing consent process, and the information provided in any online or hard copy recruitment materials should be consistent with the informed consent document. Generally, FDA recommends that any advertisement to recruit subjects be limited to the information the prospective subjects need to determine their interest and potential eligibility. The FDA information sheet ""Recruiting Study Subjects"" includes information regarding scripts for those who will interface with subjects to determine basic eligibility.13\n\nFootnote 13: See the FDA Information Sheet “Recruiting Study Subjects,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects, for further information.\n\nOnce a prospective subject is identified, and before research activities requiring prior consent occur, a person knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and capable of answering questions raised by the prospective subject should conduct a consent discussion. The consent discussion and the consent form must contain information to allow prospective subjects to make an informed decision about participation in a clinical investigation and provide an opportunity for prospective subjects to ask questions about the clinical investigation and the information in the consent document (see section3), ""FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion"") (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25).14 The consent form serves several purposes, including helping to ensure that prospective subjects receive the required information, providing a ""take home"" reminder of the elements of the clinical investigation, providing contact information in case additional questions or concerns arise, and documenting prospective subjects\' voluntary agreement to participate as well as the date of their agreement.\n\nFootnote 14: The regulations allow use of a “short form” consent form when the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For a discussion of the short form written consent, see section3.5.4.2, “Short Form.”\n\nThe informed consent process is an ongoing exchange of information throughout a subject\'s participation in a clinical trial and does not end after the consent form is signed. For example, if new safety information or protocol changes occur during the conduct of the study, additional information may need to be given to the subject, and/or the subject may need additional opportunities to ask questions and receive answers throughout the clinical investigation (see sectionIII.3.5, ""Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects,"" and Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nIII FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b ""Short Form"" for more details). If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For ""applicable clinical trials"" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, “Element of Informed Consent for ‘Applicable Clinical Trials.”\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'

Please discuss the most appropriate metric to assess a drug\'s effect on QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study (i.e., when there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient). (4.1)\n--------------------\nContext: In contrast, in a crossover study, a time-matched baseline is usually not necessary because adjustments for subject- and study-specific diurnal variation are implicit by design in the assessment of time-matched drug-placebo differences in QT/QTc effect. The predose baseline, therefore, is usually adequate for crossover studies.\n\nObtaining replicate ECG measurements (for example, the average of the parameters from about 3 ECGs) within several minutes of each nominal time point at baseline and at subsequent times will increase the precision of the estimated changes in QT/QTc effect.\n\nV Use of Concentration Response Modeling of QTc Data (5)\n\nQ12. The ICH E14 guidance states (in section III (3), page 12) that analysis of the relationship between drug concentration and QT/QTc interval changes is under active investigation. Has this investigation yielded a reasonable approach to concentration-response modeling during drug development? How can assessment of the concentration-response relationship guide the interpretation of QTc data? (5.1)\n\nConcentration-response analysis, in which all available data across all doses are used to characterize the potential for a drug to influence QTc, can serve as an alternative to the by-time-point analysis or intersection-union test as the primary basis for decisions to classify the risk of a drug. In either case, this result is an important component of the totality of evidence assessment of the risk of QT prolongation. The overall assessment of risk of QT prolongation includes nonclinical data, the time course of QT prolongation, the magnitude of QT prolongation, categorical analyses of outliers, and certain adverse events in patients that can signal potential proarrhythmic effects.\n\nThere are many different types of models for the analysis of concentration-response data, including descriptive pharmacodynamic (PD) models (e.g., linear or E({}_{\\text{max}}) models), or empirical models that link pharmacokinetic (PK) models (dose-concentration-response) with PD models. Itis recognized that concentration-response analyses of the same data using models with different underlying assumptions can generate discordant results. Therefore, it is important that the modeling methods and assumptions, criteria for model selection, rationale for model components, and potential for pooling of data across studies be specified prior to analysis to limit bias. Prospective specification of model characteristics (e.g., structural model, objective criteria, goodness of fit) based on knowledge of the pharmacology is recommended whenever possible. On occasion, the QT effect is not a direct function of plasma concentration. For example, drugs that cause QT prolongation as a result of changes in protein synthesis or trafficking or drugs with accumulation into myocardial tissues might demonstrate hysteresis. Testing for model assumptions, hysteresis (a plot of data by-time point and a hysteresis loop plot), and goodness of fit should be documented.\n\nConcentration-response analysis can be challenging when more than one molecular entity--multiple drugs or parent plus metabolites--contributes to the QTc effect.\n\nImportant considerations\n\nConcentration-response data would not necessarily come from a dedicated QT study, nor would it necessarily come from a single study. However, there are several new and important considerations that are described below.\n\nData can be acquired from first-in human studies, multiple-ascending dose studies, or other studies. Additional data would be useful to ensure information on exposure well above the exposure at the maximum therapeutic dose, to cover the impact of accumulation with repeated dosing, drug-drug and drug-food interactions, organ dysfunction, or genetically impaired metabolism. It is anticipated that one would collect new data to add to previous data, if appropriate, rather than use new data for independent analyses.\n\nEfficient concentration-response analysis using data acquired in studies with other purposes requires as much quality control as is needed for a dedicated study. This includes robust, high-quality ECG recording and analysis sufficient to support a valid assay for ECG intervals (see the E14 guidance and Question Q1 (1.1)).\n\nIf there is an intention to pool data from multiple studies, it is important to test for heterogeneity.\n\nIf there are data characterizing the response at a sufficiently high multiple of the clinically relevant exposure (see the E14 guidance, section II.B.2 (2.2.2)), a separate positive control would not be necessary.\n\nDecision-making\n\nBoth the intersection-union test and the concentration-response analysis can estimate the maximum effect of a drug treatment on the QTc interval, but they are not used to test the same hypothesis. As mentioned above, inspection of the time course of QT prolongation is important.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nHowever, hypothesis testing based on a by-time point analysis (intersection-union test or point estimate and confidence intervals) is inappropriate in studies designed for a concentration-response analysis, if not powered to assess the magnitude of QT prolongation for each time point.\n\nWhen using a concentration-response analysis as the primary basis for decisions to classify the risk of a drug, the upper bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval for the QTc effect of a drug treatment as estimated by exposure-response analysis should be (<10) ms at the highest clinically relevant exposure to conclude that an expanded ECG safety evaluation during later stages of drug development is not needed (see the E14 guidance, section II.B.4 (2.2.4), and Question Q16 (7.1)).\n\n4.2.3 Other uses\n\nIn addition to serving as the basis for regulatory decision-making, concentration-response analysis has established its utility in several settings enumerated below.\n\n4.2.4 Providing insight into regimens not studied directly\n\nAn understanding of the concentration-response relationship can help predict the QT effects of doses, dosing regimens, routes of administration, or formulations that were not studied directly. Interpolation within the range of concentrations studied is more reliable than extrapolation above the range.\n\n4.2.5 Predicting OTc effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that affect pharmacokinetics\n\nUnderstanding the concentration-response relationship can help predict the effects of intrinsic (e.g., cytochrome P450 isoenzyme status) or extrinsic (e.g., drug-drug PK interactions) factors, possibly affecting inclusion criteria or dosing adjustments in later phase studies.\n\n5 Special Cases (6)\n\nThe ICH E14 guidance states that in certain cases, a conventional thorough QT study might not be feasible. In such cases, what other methods should be used for evaluation of QT/QTc and proarrhythmic potential? (6.1)\n\nIn certain cases, the conventional ""thorough QT/QTc"" study design (a crossover study in healthy volunteers with short-term administration of the usual maximum dose and one higher dose with placebo and positive control) might need to be modified for a drug or active metabolite with a long half-life or delayed QT effect, or because of safety, tolerability, or practical issues that preclude use in healthy subjects. In most cases, alternative designs can be used that may affect power considerations, but do not compromise study interpretation. For example, multiple doses can be studied in a parallel design trial or can use patients with the disease for which the drug is intended rather than healthy volunteers.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhere a placebo-controlled comparison using appropriate doses is not possible, alternative study designs should incorporate as many of the usual ""thorough QT/QTc"" design features as possible, and the quality and extent of the preclinical evaluation (ICH S7B guidance) is particularly critical. Other useful supplementary data might include intensive ECG data acquisition in early phase single or multiple ascending dose studies, utilization of concentration-response analysis, and evaluation of exposures that are greater than those anticipated with the intended marketed dose.\n\nA single dose of a positive control is generally sufficient, even if it precedes the investigational drug treatment. In the absence of a positive control, there is reluctance to draw conclusions on the lack of an effect; however, if the upper bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval around the estimated maximal effect on QTc is less than 10 ms, it is unlikely to have an actual mean effect as large as 20 ms.\n\nWhen a thorough QTc study of usual or modified design is not feasible, the intensity of late phase ECG monitoring will be dependent upon the quality and extent of the nonclinical and clinical evaluation. In situations where it is not possible to study higher exposures than are anticipated with the intended marketed dose, more intensive ECG monitoring might be necessary during phase 3 trials. When the nonclinical and early clinical data do not suggest clinically relevant QTc prolongation, intensive late stage monitoring might not be necessary. Otherwise, monitoring could be conducted as if a thorough QT study had been positive to protect patients in later trials and to obtain information on the frequency of marked QTc prolongation in the patient population (see Question Q16 (7.1)).\n\n2.3 The ICH E14 guidance does not address the approach to QT measurement during drug development in the case of combination drug products. Is it recommended that measurement of QT prolongation be performed on drug combinations? (6.2)\n\nIn general, combinations of two or more drugs are unlikely to need a thorough QT/QTc study or intensive late stage monitoring, if the component drugs have been demonstrated to lack relevant effects in thorough QT/QTc studies as described in the ICH E14 guidance.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs - Questions and Answers (R1)'

The ICH E14 guidance states (in section III (3), page 12) that analysis of the relationship between drug concentration and QT/QTc interval changes is under active investigation. Has this investigation yielded a reasonable approach to concentration-response modeling during drug development? How can assessment of the concentration-response relationship guide the interpretation of QTc data? (5.1)\n\nConcentration-response analysis, in which all available data across all doses are used to characterize the potential for a drug to influence QTc, can serve as an alternative to the by-time-point analysis or intersection-union test as the primary basis for decisions to classify the risk of a drug. In either case, this result is an important component of the totality of evidence assessment of the risk of QT prolongation. The overall assessment of risk of QT prolongation includes nonclinical data, the time course of QT prolongation, the magnitude of QT prolongation, categorical analyses of outliers, and certain adverse events in patients that can signal potential proarrhythmic effects.\n\nThere are many different types of models for the analysis of concentration-response data, including descriptive pharmacodynamic (PD) models (e.g., linear or E({}_{\\text{max}}) models), or empirical models that link pharmacokinetic (PK) models (dose-concentration-response) with PD models. Itis recognized that concentration-response analyses of the same data using models with different underlying assumptions can generate discordant results. Therefore, it is important that the modeling methods and assumptions, criteria for model selection, rationale for model components, and potential for pooling of data across studies be specified prior to analysis to limit bias. Prospective specification of model characteristics (e.g., structural model, objective criteria, goodness of fit) based on knowledge of the pharmacology is recommended whenever possible. On occasion, the QT effect is not a direct function of plasma concentration. For example, drugs that cause QT prolongation as a result of changes in protein synthesis or trafficking or drugs with accumulation into myocardial tissues might demonstrate hysteresis. Testing for model assumptions, hysteresis (a plot of data by-time point and a hysteresis loop plot), and goodness of fit should be documented.\n\nConcentration-response analysis can be challenging when more than one molecular entity--multiple drugs or parent plus metabolites--contributes to the QTc effect.\n\nImportant considerations\n\nConcentration-response data would not necessarily come from a dedicated QT study, nor would it necessarily come from a single study. However, there are several new and important considerations that are described below.\n\nData can be acquired from first-in human studies, multiple-ascending dose studies, or other studies. Additional data would be useful to ensure information on exposure well above the exposure at the maximum therapeutic dose, to cover the impact of accumulation with repeated dosing, drug-drug and drug-food interactions, organ dysfunction, or genetically impaired metabolism. It is anticipated that one would collect new data to add to previous data, if appropriate, rather than use new data for independent analyses.\n\nEfficient concentration-response analysis using data acquired in studies with other purposes requires as much quality control as is needed for a dedicated study. This includes robust, high-quality ECG recording and analysis sufficient to support a valid assay for ECG intervals (see the E14 guidance and Question Q1 (1.1)).\n\nIf there is an intention to pool data from multiple studies, it is important to test for heterogeneity.\n\nIf there are data characterizing the response at a sufficiently high multiple of the clinically relevant exposure (see the E14 guidance, section II.B.2 (2.2.2)), a separate positive control would not be necessary.\n\nDecision-making\n\nBoth the intersection-union test and the concentration-response analysis can estimate the maximum effect of a drug treatment on the QTc interval, but they are not used to test the same hypothesis. As mentioned above, inspection of the time course of QT prolongation is important.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nHowever, hypothesis testing based on a by-time point analysis (intersection-union test or point estimate and confidence intervals) is inappropriate in studies designed for a concentration-response analysis, if not powered to assess the magnitude of QT prolongation for each time point.\n\nWhen using a concentration-response analysis as the primary basis for decisions to classify the risk of a drug, the upper bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval for the QTc effect of a drug treatment as estimated by exposure-response analysis should be (<10) ms at the highest clinically relevant exposure to conclude that an expanded ECG safety evaluation during later stages of drug development is not needed (see the E14 guidance, section II.B.4 (2.2.4), and Question Q16 (7.1)).\n\n4.2.3 Other uses\n\nIn addition to serving as the basis for regulatory decision-making, concentration-response analysis has established its utility in several settings enumerated below.\n\n4.2.4 Providing insight into regimens not studied directly\n\nAn understanding of the concentration-response relationship can help predict the QT effects of doses, dosing regimens, routes of administration, or formulations that were not studied directly. Interpolation within the range of concentrations studied is more reliable than extrapolation above the range.\n\n4.2.5 Predicting OTc effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that affect pharmacokinetics\n\nUnderstanding the concentration-response relationship can help predict the effects of intrinsic (e.g., cytochrome P450 isoenzyme status) or extrinsic (e.g., drug-drug PK interactions) factors, possibly affecting inclusion criteria or dosing adjustments in later phase studies.\n\n5 Special Cases (6)\n\nThe ICH E14 guidance states that in certain cases, a conventional thorough QT study might not be feasible. In such cases, what other methods should be used for evaluation of QT/QTc and proarrhythmic potential? (6.1)\n\nIn certain cases, the conventional ""thorough QT/QTc"" study design (a crossover study in healthy volunteers with short-term administration of the usual maximum dose and one higher dose with placebo and positive control) might need to be modified for a drug or active metabolite with a long half-life or delayed QT effect, or because of safety, tolerability, or practical issues that preclude use in healthy subjects. In most cases, alternative designs can be used that may affect power considerations, but do not compromise study interpretation. For example, multiple doses can be studied in a parallel design trial or can use patients with the disease for which the drug is intended rather than healthy volunteers.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhere a placebo-controlled comparison using appropriate doses is not possible, alternative study designs should incorporate as many of the usual ""thorough QT/QTc"" design features as possible, and the quality and extent of the preclinical evaluation (ICH S7B guidance) is particularly critical.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , In the ICH E14 guidance, the recommended metric to analyze for a crossover study is the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period. Please discuss the most appropriate metric to assess a drug\'s effect on QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study (i.e., when there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient). (4.1)\n--------------------\nContext: The ICH E14 guidance currently recommends either fully manual or manual adjudication approaches for clinical trials in which the assessment of ECG safety is an important objective, such as the thorough QT/QTc study. When the thorough QT study is positive, fully manual or manual adjudication methods are currently recommended for an adequate sample of patients in late phase studies (see section II.C (2.3) in the E14 guidance). When the thorough QT/QTc study is negative, routine ECG safety assessments in late phase clinical trials using fully automated reading methods will be adequate.\n\nQ3.: The ICH E14 guidance contains the following statement: ""If well-characterized data validating the use of fully automated technologies become available, the recommendations in the guidance for the measurement of ECG intervals could be modified."" What would be expected of a sponsor that wished to validate and apply an automated reading method for regulatory submissions? (1.3)\n\nEfforts to develop more sophisticated and reliable methods for automated ECG readings for both QT interval and T wave morphology assessment are encouraged. There are at present no large-scale studies to validate the use of fully automated reading methods in patients; however, there are examples of thorough QT/QTc studies in healthy volunteers in which automated methods have been used and validated for QT interval measurements against manual methods.\n\nQT Interval measurement\n\nThere are at present no clear and widely accepted criteria for validation of new semi-automated or automated methods, but it is expected that each would be validated independently for its ability to detect the QT/QTc prolongation effects of drugs that are near the threshold of regulatory concern. Data supporting the validation of a new method should be submitted and could include descriptive statistics, Bland-Altman plots of agreement, superimposed plots of the baseline- and placebo-adjusted QTc and the RR as a function of time, together with data from any trials that have employed the method.\n\nT wave morphology assessment\n\nThe suitability of automated ECG reading techniques for the assessment of morphological abnormalities has not yet been demonstrated. If a sponsor intends to develop a fully automated approach, without visual assessment for morphological changes, validation studies should include a demonstration that the automated method is capable of reading and interpreting a test set of abnormal ECGs correctly (e.g., abnormalities of T wave morphology, overlapping U waves). As with methods for QT interval determination, there are at present no clear and widely accepted criteria for validation of novel methods.\n\nBecause changes in morphology can affect interval measurement, fully manual or manual adjudication (as defined in Question Q2 (1.2)) techniques should be performed if treatment-emergent changes in morphology are observed. If, on the other hand, no morphology changes are observed, this would support the use of automated methodologies, provided they have been validated.\n\nHow does a sponsor incorporate new technology or validate new methodology into the measurement and/or analysis of the QT interval? (1.4)\n\nThe ICH process is better suited to the determination of regulatory policy once the science in a particular area has become more or less clear. In general, it is not well-suited to the qualification or validation of new technology.\n\nSections II.E.1 (2.5.1) and II.E.2 (2.5.2) of the ICH E14 guidance are rather discouraging about methodology outside conventional carts and human-determined measurements. Since ICH E14 was issued, 12-lead continuous recording devices have largely supplanted cart recorders in thorough QT studies without a formal validation process because of their performance in the context of a positive control. The impact of other innovative technologies can be assessed in studies incorporating a positive control. Although some technologies could be assessed using other techniques in the absence of a positive control, this topic is more complex and beyond the scope of this question and answer.\n\nTwelve-lead continuous recording devices and other new technologies can be used in late phase clinical trials. Even though a positive control is not used in late stage studies, the new technology could be validated in other studies (such as the thorough QT study). In cases where a thorough QT study is not done, a sponsor can provide alternative methods for validating the technology.\n\nThe ICH E14 guidance states that QT interval corrected by Fridericia\'s and Bazett\'s correction should be submitted in all applications; is this still necessary? Is there a recommended approach to QT correction that is different from that specified in ICH E14? (1.5)\n\nChanges in heart rate could variably influence a drug\'s effect on repolarization (i.e., QT interval), and correction methods with different characteristics are often applied. The principles set below would be applicable in all clinical studies (thorough QT or other studies).\n\nIn adults, Bazett\'s correction has been clearly shown to be an inferior method of correcting for differences in heart rate among and within subjects. Therefore, QT interval data corrected using Bazett\'s corrections is no longer warranted in all applications unless there is a compelling reason for a comparison to historical Bazett\'s corrected QT data. Presentation of data with a Fridericia\'s correction is likely to be appropriate in most situations, but other methods could be more appropriate. There is no single recommended alternative (see Question Q4 (1.4) on Incorporating New Technologies), but the following are some considerations:\n\nAnalyses of the same data using different models for correcting QT can generate discordant results. Therefore, it is important that the method(s) of correction, criteria for the selection of the method of correction, and rationale for the components of the method of correction be specified prior to analysis to limit bias. Model selection should be based on objective criteria and should consider the uncertainty in parameter estimates. Alternative methods of correction should be used only if the primary method fails the pre-specified criteria for selection of the method of correction.\n\nCorrections that are individualized to a subject\'s unique heart rate QT dynamic are not likely to work well when the data are sparse or when the baseline data upon which the correction is based do not cover at least the heart rate range observed in patients on the study drug.\n\nII Gender (2)\n\nQ6. There are recognized differences in the baseline QTc between men and women. These were noted in early versions of the guidance. In the E14 guidance, however, it is recommended that outliers be categorized as (>450), (>480), and (>500) milliseconds (ms), regardless of gender. Can you say why there is no gender difference in the recommendation? (2.1)\n\nThe 450, 480, and 500 ms categories refer to the values the E14 guidance suggests sponsors might use in characterizing outliers. The numbers that were specified previously for males and females referred to ""normal"" QTc values, which may differ for men and women. This section was not included in the final guidance, however, and such considerations would be largely irrelevant to larger durations (e.g., 480 and 500 ms). As the thorough QT/QTc study is designed to examine the propensity of a drug to prolong the QTc interval, it is appropriate to perform the study in healthy male or female volunteers.\n\nShould we enroll both sexes in a thorough QT study, and does the study need to be powered for independent conclusions about each sex? (2.2)\n\nPost-pubertal males have lower heart-rate corrected QT intervals than do pre-pubertal males or females generally. Women are generally smaller than men, so their exposure to a given fixed dose of a drug will generally be higher, and if a drug prolongs QT, it can be expected to prolong it more in women because of the higher exposure. It is not settled whether and how often there are sex differences in response to QT-prolonging drugs that are not explained by exposure alone.\n\nThe thorough QT study is primarily intended to act as a clinical pharmacology study in a healthy population using a conservative primary objective defining the drug\'s effect on QT. It is unlikely that any of a variety of baseline demographic parameters would introduce a large difference in QT response to a drug in subpopulations defined by factors such as age, co-morbidity, and gender that is not explained by exposure.\n\nIt is encouraged, but not mandatory, to include both men and women in the thorough QT study. Analyses of Concentration-Response Relationship by sex can be helpful for studying the effect of the drug on QT/QTc interval in cases where there is evidence or mechanistic theory for a gender difference. However, the primary analysis of a thorough QT study should be powered and conducted on the pooled population. If the primary analysis is negative and if there is no other evidence suggesting gender differences, subgroup analysis by sex is not expected.\n\nIII Positive control (3)\n\nThe ICH E14 guidance emphasizes the importance of assay sensitivity and recommends the use of a positive control. In order to accept a negative thorough QT/QTc study, assay sensitivity should be established in the study by use of a positive control with a known QT-prolonging effect. Please clarify how to assess the adequacy of the positive control in the thorough QT study.

Please discuss the most appropriate metric to assess a drug's effect on QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study (i.e., when there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient). (4.1)\n--------------------\nContext: If an investigational drug belongs to a chemical or pharmacological class that has been associated with QT/QTc prolongation, a positive control selected from other members of the same class should be considered to permit a comparison of effect sizes, preferably at equipotent therapeutic doses.\n\nCrossover or parallel group study designs can be suitable for trials assessing the potential of a drug to cause QT/QTc interval prolongation. Crossover studies at least have two potential advantages:\n\nThey usually call for smaller numbers of subjects than parallel group studies, as the subjects serve as their own controls and hence reduce variability of differences related to inter-subject variability;\n\nThey might facilitate heart rate correction approaches based on individual subject data.\n\nParallel group studies might be preferred under certain circumstances:\n\nFor drugs with long elimination half-lives for which lengthy time intervals would be required to achieve steady-state or complete washout;\n\nIf carryover effects are prominent for other reasons, such as irreversible receptor binding or long-lived active metabolites;\n\nIf multiple doses or treatment groups are to be compared.\n\nAn important problem in the measurement of the QT/QTc interval is its intrinsic variability. This variability results from many factors, including activity level, postural changes, circadian patterns, and food ingestion. It is critical to address intrinsic variability in the conduct of the 'thorough QT/QTc study'. This can be accomplished in several ways, including the collection of multiple ECGs at baseline and during the study.\n\n2.2.2 Dose-Effect and Time Course Relationships in the 'Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nAn adequate drug development programme should ensure that the dose-response and generally the concentration-response relationship for QT/QTc prolongation have been characterized, including exploration of concentrations that are higher than those achieved following the anticipated therapeutic doses. Data on the drug concentrations around the time of ECG assessment would aid this assessment. If not precluded by considerations of safety or tolerability due to adverse effects, the drug should be tested at substantial multiples of the anticipated maximum therapeutic exposure. Alternatively, if the concentrations of a drug can be increased by drug-drug or drug-food interactions involving metabolizing enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4, CYP2D6) or transporters (e.g., P-glycoprotein), these effects could be studied under conditions of maximum inhibition. This approach calls for an understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the parent and significant human metabolites. In general, the duration of dosing or dosing regimen should be sufficient to characterize the effects of the drug and its active metabolites at relevant concentrations.\n\n2.2.3 Timing of ECGs in the 'Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline""

(4.1)\n--------------------\nContext: Differences in baseline assessment between crossover and parallel design studies are discussed in E14 Q&A Q11 (4.2).\n\nPlease discuss the need for baseline measurements, and when needed, how they should be collected, for crossover and parallel design thorough QT studies. (4.2)\n\nAdjustment for baseline measurements is potentially useful for several purposes, including detection of carry-over effects, reducing the influence of inter-subject differences, and accounting for diurnal effects such as those due to food. There is no single best approach for baseline adjustment, but all planned baseline computations should be prospectively defined in the clinical trial protocol. Two kinds of baseline are commonly used: time-matched baseline (taken at exactly the same time-points on the day prior to the beginning of treatment as on the treatment day) and predose baseline (taken shortly prior to dosing). The predose baseline is usedfor adjustment for inter-subject differences but not for diurnal effects. The choice of baseline is influenced by whether the study is parallel or crossover.\n\nFor a parallel-group study, a time-matched baseline allows the detection of differences in diurnal patterns between subjects that would not be detected by a predose baseline. In a parallel study, a time-matched baseline day, if performed, would ideally occur on the day before the start of the study.\n\nIn contrast, in a crossover study, a time-matched baseline is usually not necessary because adjustments for subject- and study-specific diurnal variation are implicit by design in the assessment of time-matched drug-placebo differences in QT/QTc effect. The predose baseline, therefore, is usually adequate for crossover studies.\n\nObtaining replicate ECG measurements (for example, the average of the parameters from about 3 ECGs) within several minutes of each nominal time point at baseline and at subsequent times will increase the precision of the estimated changes in QT/QTc effect.\n\nV Use of concentration response modeling of QTc data (5)\n\nQ12.

However, there are several new and important considerations that are described below.\n\nData can be acquired from first-in human studies, multiple-ascending dose studies, or other studies, provided that the concentrations that can be safely achieved are well above the exposure at the maximum therapeutic dose at steady-state and reflect high clinical exposure scenario situations such as drug-drug and drug-food interactions, organ dysfunction, and/or genetically impaired metabolism. Whenever possible, sponsors are encouraged to explore a wide dose range in early-phase studies to enable characterization of effects at high concentrations.\n\nEfficient concentration-response analysis using data acquired in studies with other purposes should have as much quality control as is needed for a dedicated study.

In such cases, what other methods should be used for evaluation of QT/QTc and proarrhythmic potential? (6.1)\n\nAn integrated nonclinical and clinical QT/QTc risk assessment can be particularly valuable when a thorough QT study or concentration-QTc analysis meeting similar quality control as needed for a dedicated study as described in E14 Q&A Q12 (5.1) is not feasible. This situation can arise under scenarios where a placebo-controlled comparison is not possible; safety considerations preclude administering supratherapeutic doses to obtain high clinical exposures and/or safety or tolerability prohibit the use of the product in healthy participants. The design elements that include placebo and healthy participant dosing assist in decreasing variability, but their absence does not preclude interpretation.\n\nThe integrated nonclinical and clinical QT/QTc risk assessment should include:\n\nThe hERG assay, an in vivo QT assay, and any follow-up nonclinical studies, especially those selected to overcome the challenges encountered in the clinical studies (see ICH S7B Q&As Q17 (1.1) and Q18 (1.2)\n\nAlternative QT clinical study designs incorporating ECG assessments with as many of the usual ""thorough QT/QTc"" design features as possible (see ICH E14 guidance, section II.B (2.2), and E14 Q&A Q12 (5.1))\n\nIn situations where it is not possible to evaluate the QT/QTc effects at high clinical exposure, it is particularly important that the nonclinical in vivo studies are conducted at exposures covering the high clinical exposure (see ICH E14 Q&A Q12 (5.1) for definition of high clinical exposure).\n\n_An integrated QT/QTc risk assessment can also be particularly valuable for drugs with confounding heart rate effects that could impact accurate determination of the QTc. Advanced methodologies for controlling (e.g., pacing) or correcting for heart rate changes in the nonclinical in vivo studies and/or conducting QTc assessments in the intended patient population might be informative in this situation. If tolerance to the chronotropic effect develops with repeat dosing, upward titration regimens can sometimes be employed to avoid or minimize the confounding effects of drug-induced heart rate changes on the QTc assessment.\n\nDecision-Making\n\nA totality of evidence argument based on the results of an integrated nonclinical and clinical QT/QTc assessment could be made at the time of marketing application.\n\nA drug that meets the following criteria would be considered to have a low likelihood of proarrhythmic effects due to delayed repolarization:\n--------------------\nContext title: E14 and S7B Clinical and Nonclinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential--Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'

The QT interval represents the duration of ventricular depolarization and subsequent repolarization, and is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. A delay in cardiac repolarization creates an electrophysiological environment that favors the development of cardiac arrhythmias, most clearly torsade de pointes (TdP), but possibly other ventricular tachyarrhythmias as well. TdP is a polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia that appears on the ECG as continuous twisting of the vector of the QRS complex around the isoelectric baseline. A feature of TdP is pronounced prolongation of the QT interval in the supraventricular beat preceding the arrhythmia. TdP can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, leading to sudden death.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline""]","['Regardless of the study design, ""the largest time-matched mean difference between drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted)"" is determined as follows: The mean QTc for the drug (i.e., averaged across the study population) is compared to the mean QTc for placebo (averaged across the study population) at each time point.

As of that date, drug products compounded using any of the four bulk drug substances that are identified as not being included on the list do not qualify for the exemptions under 503A of the FD&C Act. Drug products compounded using one of the six bulk drug substances that are on the list will qualify for the exemptions under section 503A of the FD&C Act provided the drug products are compounded in compliance with the other conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ5. Going forward, how will FDA decide whether to place a bulk drug substance on the 503A Bulks List?\n\nAs described in the final rule, FDA is evaluating nominated bulk drug substances using four criteria: the physical and chemical characteristics of the substance, the safety of the substance in compounded drug products, evidence of effectiveness, and historical use of the substance in compounded drug products. As required by section 503A of the FD&C Act, FDA is consulting with the Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee (PCAC) and USP regarding the 503A Bulks List and is developing the list through notice and comment rulemaking.\n\nQ6. Why did FDA find the four substances it is not placing on the 503A Bulks List to be inappropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act?\n\nFor reasons described at length in the proposed rule that published on December 16, 2016 (81 FR 91071), entitled ""List of Bulk Drug Substances That Can Be Used To Compound Drug Products in Accordance With Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,"" and in the briefing materials presented to the PCAC, applying the four criteria identified in Question 5 above, FDA determined that these four substances are not appropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ7. What information did FDA rely on to make its determinations for the bulk drug substances that are addressed in the final rule?\n\nAs stated in the December 16, 2016 proposed rule, FDA considered information obtained from publicly available sources, including peer-reviewed medical literature. Some of this information was referenced in the nominations, and the remainder FDA gathered through independent searches of medical and pharmaceutical databases. FDA did not review raw data. The nature, quantity, and quality of the information FDA assessed varied considerably from substance to substance. In some cases, there were very little data. For other substances, reports in the literature were more plentiful and sometimes comprised hundreds or thousands of articles. In those cases, generally, the Agency limited its review to a sample of the best literature sources available (e.g., review articles in widely known, peer-reviewed journals; meta-analyses; reports of randomized controlled trials).\n\nQ8. What should I do if I want to use one of the four bulk drug substances that has been identified in the final rule as not being placed on the list to compound a route of administration or dosage form different than what the bulk drug substance was nominated and considered for when it was determined that it would not be placed on the list (e.g., the bulk drug substance was considered in the context of compounding an injectable drug product, but I want to use it to compound a tablet)?\n\nIf you would like to compound a drug product using a bulk drug substance identified as not placed on the list, you may submit a citizen petition under 21 CFR 10.30. The petition should ask FDA to consider revising the rule to include the bulk drug substance. The petition should explain any differences in how you propose to use the bulk drug substance as compared with how it was previously nominated and evaluated for inclusion on the list.\n\nQ9. Does FDA plan to add additional substances to the 503A Bulks List going forward?\n\nMany substances have been nominated for the 503A Bulks List, and FDA has been evaluating them on a rolling basis. FDA intends to publish additional notice and comment rulemaking to address whether these substances should be included on the list.\n\nQ10. Where can I get more information, if needed?\n\nQuestions regarding compliance with the 503A Bulks List Final Rule should be directed to Compounding@fda.hhs.gov.\n--------------------\nContext title: Section 503A Bulks List Final Rule Questions and Answers; Small Entity Compliance Guide; Guidance for Industry'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 7: See section 503A(c)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nBulk drug substances used in compounding under section 503A must also meet certain other requirements, including: (1) the bulk drug substance must be manufactured by an establishment registered under section 510 of the FD&C Act and (2) the bulk drug substance must be accompanied by a valid certificate of analysis (COA).9\n\nFootnote 8: See section 503A(c)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn July 2014, FDA issued a guidance, Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that states:\n\nUntil a bulk drug substances list is published in the Federal Register as a final rule, human drug products should be compounded using only bulk drug substances that are components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, or are the subject of USP or NF monographs.10\n\nFootnote 9: See section 503A(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFDA has received comments that this policy could be causing unnecessary and inappropriate disruptions in patient care because there are patients receiving drugs compounded with bulk drug substances that are not components of FDA-approved drugs, or the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph, but that may ultimately be included on the 503A bulks list, and those patients' care should not be disrupted while the list is under development. After considering this issue, FDA has decided to use this guidance to describe its interim policy concerning compounding with bulk drug substances while the 503A bulks list is being developed. FDA has revised the July 2014 guidance to state:\n\nFDA's interim policy concerning bulk drug substances that are not components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or that are not the subject of applicable USP or NF monographs can be found in the guidance, Interim Policy on _Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCompounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n\nFDA seeks to avoid unnecessary disruption to patient treatment while the Agency considers the bulk drug substances that were nominated with sufficient support to permit FDA to evaluate them and promulgates the regulations required under section 503A. Therefore, as described further below, FDA is issuing this interim guidance stating that it does not intend to take regulatory action for compounding drug products under section 503A using a bulk drug substance when an applicable USP or NF monograph for the substance does not exist and the substance is not a component of an FDA-approved product if, among other conditions, FDA has determined that the nomination for the bulk drug substance included adequate information for FDA to evaluate the substance and at this time, the substance does not appear to present significant safety risks.\n\nB. Efforts to Develop the List of Bulk Drug Substances under Section 503A\n\n1. Section 503A Bulks List -- Early History\n\nSection 503A was enacted in 1997 as part of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act. In the Federal Register of April 7, 1998 (63 FR 17011), FDA invited all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on the list of bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding under section 503A and received nominations for 41 different drug substances. In November 1998, FDA published a guidance for industry, Enforcement Policy During Implementation of Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In this guidance, FDA announced that it would not normally take regulatory action relating to a drug product that had been compounded with a bulk drug substance that had been nominated for inclusion on the bulk drug substances list on or before November 21, 1999, while the substance was being evaluated, as long as the compounding complied with the other effective requirements in section 503A and did not appear to present a significant safety risk.11\n\nFootnote 11: The 1998 guidance was withdrawn in the Federal Register notice announcing the availability of the draft guidance Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. See 78 FR 72901 (Dec. 4, 2013). The final guidance was published in July 2014.\n\nIn January 1999, after evaluating the nominated drug substances and consulting with the Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee (PCAC) as required by section 503A, FDA published a proposed rule listing 20 drug substances on the section 503A bulks list (64 FR 996, January 7, 1999). The preamble to the proposed rule indicated that 10 of the 41 nominated substances were the subject of a USP or NF monograph, or components of FDA approved drugs and did not need to be considered for inclusion on the list.12 The proposed rule also described 10 nominated substances that were still under consideration for the bulk drug substances list and stated that one of the substances was withdrawn by its nominator at the first meeting of the PCAC. The PCAC reconvened in May 1999 to discuss bulk drug substances included in the proposed rule, in addition to other bulk drug substances (64 FR 19791; April 22, 1999).\n\nHowever, after a 2002 U.S. Supreme Court decision holding that certain provisions of section 503A were unconstitutional,13 FDA suspended its efforts to develop the bulk drugs list under section 503A.\n\nFootnote 13: For additional legal history of section 503A, see the guidance Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and cosmetic Act.\n\nBecause of the amount of time that had passed between the publication of the proposed rule and the enactment of the 2013 Drug Quality and Security Act, which removed the provisions of the FD&C Act that the U.S. Supreme Court held to be unconstitutional in 2002, FDA felt it was necessary to begin again to develop the section 503A bulk drug substance list. In the December 4, 2013, Federal Register (78 FR 72841), FDA published a notice withdrawing the 1999 proposed rule and inviting all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on a list of bulk drug substances that can be used for compounding under section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nii.2.2 Current Nominations for the 503A Bulks List\n\nIn response to the December 2013, Federal Register notice, over 2,000 substances were nominated for the 503A bulks list. However, many of the substances nominated for the 503A list were for substances that can be compounded without being on the list because they are the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph or are a component of an FDA-approved drug. In addition, many of the nominations were not for substances used in compounding as active ingredients, or did not include sufficient information for FDA to evaluate the nominated substances for inclusion on the list. To improve the efficiency of the process for developing the 503A bulks list, FDA reopened the nomination process in July 2014 (79 FR 37742) and provided more detailed information on what it needs to evaluate nominations for the 503A bulks list. FDA stated that bulk drug substances that were previously nominated would not be considered further unless they were re-nominated with adequate support to permit a meaningful evaluation. Substances that were already eligible for use in compounding or that were not adequately supported would not be evaluated for placement on the 503A bulks list.\n\nIn response to this request for nominations, approximately 740 unique substances were nominated. Of the nominated substances:\n\nApproximately 315 substances are already eligible for use in compounding under section 503A.\n\nThese are the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph or components of an FDA-approved drug product, which can be used in compounding pursuant to sections 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(I) and (II) and, therefore, can be compounded without being included on the 503A bulks list. To determine if a bulk drug substance is the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph, see the USP-NF available at www.USPNF.com. To determine if a bulk drug substance is a component of an FDA approved drug, see the FDA's Orange Book:_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, available at\n\nhttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/default.cfm.\n\nAt least one14 of the nominated substances is not a bulk drug substance.\n\nFootnote 14: The over-the-counter finished drug product Maalox was nominated. Maalox is not a bulk drug substance.\n\nThis is a finished drug product that was nominated by its brand name. Finished drug products are not eligible for the 503A bulks list because they do not meet the definition of a bulk drug substance in 21 CFR 207.3.\n\nAt least one of the substances is considered a biological product subject to approval in a biologics license application (BLA) under section 351 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act when used for the indication proposed in the nomination.\n\nThis substance is not eligible for the 503A bulks list because biological products subject to approval in a BLA under section 351 of the PHS Act are not eligible for the exemptions in section 503A of the FD&C Act.15 No biological products subject to approval in a BLA will be considered for the 503A bulks list.\n\nFootnote 15: The nominated substance is sodium hexachloroplatinate (IV) hexahydrate. See the revised draft guidance, Mixing, Diluting, or Repackaging Biological Products Outside the Scope of an Approved Biologics License Application for FDA’s proposed policies regarding State-licensed pharmacies, Federal facilities, and outsourcing facilities that mix, dilute, or repackage biological products outside the scope of an approved BLA.\n--------------------\nContext title: Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: 2 Provisions of Section 503A That Require Regulations or Other FDA Actions\n\nSpecific provisions of section 503A of the FD&C Act require rulemaking or other action by FDA. FDA\'s policy related to these specific provisions is described below.\n\n2.1.1 Withdrawn or Removed List\n\nFDA promulgated a final rule, codified at 21 CFR 216.24, which lists drug products that cannot be compounded because they have been withdrawn or removed from the market because the drug products or components of the drug products have been found to be unsafe or not effective. FDA intends to update this list periodically, and expects compounds to comply with the list as it currently exists and with any final updates.\n\n2.2.2 Bulk Drug Substances List\n\nSection 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(III) of the FD&C Act provides that a drug product can be compounded using bulk drug substances that do not have an applicable USP or NF monograph (section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(I) of the FD&C Act) and are not components of FDA-approved drugs (section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act) if the bulk drug substances appear on a list developed by FDA and issued through regulation.\n\nIn the Federal Register of April 7, 1998 (63 FR 17,011), FDA invited all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on the list. In the Federal Register of January 7, 1999 (64 FR 996), FDA published a proposed rule listing bulk drug substances that can be used in pharmacy compounding. In the Federal Register of December 4, 2013 (78 FR 72,841), FDA published a notice withdrawing the 1999 proposed rule and inviting all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on a list of bulk drug substances that can be used for compounding under section 503A of the FD&C Act. FDA\'s interim policy concerning bulk drug substances that are not components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or that are not the subject of applicable USP or NF monographs can be found in the guidance, Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n\n2.3.3 ""Demonstrable Difficulties"" for Compounding\n\nUnder section 503A(b)(3)(A) of the FD&C Act, a compounded drug product would not qualify for the exemptions provided in subsection (a) if it is identified by FDA through regulation as a drug product that presents demonstrable difficulties for compounding that reasonably demonstrate an adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. In the Federal Register of December 4, 2013 (78 FR 72,840), FDA published a notice inviting all interested persons to nominate drug products or categories of drug products for inclusion on a list of drug products that present demonstrable difficulties for compounding (difficult-to-compound list). This provision is not enforceable until FDA promulgates an implementing regulation.\n\niii.1.4 Memorandum of Understanding Between FDA and the States\n\nSection 503A(b)(3) of the FD&C Act states that FDA, in consultation with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) will develop a standard MOU for use between FDA and the states that will address the interstate distribution of inordinate amounts of compounded drug products and provide for appropriate investigation by a state agency of complaints relating to compounded drug products distributed outside that state. On January 21, 1999, FDA published a notice in the Federal Register announcing the availability of a draft standard MOU, developed in consultation with the NABP. This draft MOU was not finalized. FDA intends to publish a new draft MOU for comment that will replace the January 1999 draft.\n\nUnder section 503A(b)(3)(B)(ii), an individual or firm in a state that does not enter into an MOU with FDA that distributes, or causes to be distributed, compounded drug products out of the state in which they are compounded, can compound for interstate distribution outside the state only 5% of the total prescription orders dispensed or distributed by the individual or firm. FDA does not intend to enforce the 5% limit on interstate distribution until after FDA has finalized an MOU and made it available to the states for their consideration and signature. The Federal Register notice that will announce the availability of the draft MOU will specify a time period during which the MOU will be made available to the states to sign. After this time period expires, FDA intends to begin enforcing the 5% limit in states that have not signed the MOU.\n\nIV Guidance on Regulatory Action\n\nRequirements Applicable to Drug Products that Meet the Conditions of Section 503a\n\nAs stated above, a compounded drug product intended for use in humans that meets the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act and its associated regulations is exempt from the requirements under sections 501(a)(2)(B), 502(f)(1), and 505 of the FD&C Act.\n\nHowever, individuals and firms may be subject to a warning letter, seizure of product, injunction, and/or criminal prosecution for violations of other requirements of the FD&C Act. Such violations may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nThe drug product must not consist in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance, or be prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have been contaminated with filth or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health. (Sections 501(a)(1) and (a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act)\n\nIf the drug product purports to be a drug that is recognized in an official compendium, its strength must not differ from, and its quality or purity must not fall below, the standards set forth in the compendium, unless the difference is plainly stated on its label. (Section 501(b) of the FD&C Act)3. For a drug product not subject to section 501(b) of the FD&C Act, the drug\'s strength must not differ from, and its quality or purity must not fall below, that which it purports to have. (Section 501(c) of the FD&C Act)\n\nIf the drug product purports to be a drug that is recognized in an official compendium, it must be packaged and labeled as prescribed in the compendium. (Section 502(g) of the FD&C Act)\n\nThe drug product\'s labeling, advertising, and promotion must not be false or misleading. (Sections 502(a), 502(bb),10 and 201(n) of the FD&C Act)\n\nFootnote 10: Section 502(bb) was added to the FD&C Act by section 103(b) of the DQSA.\n\n2 Enforcement Action When a Drug Does Not Meet the Conditions of Section 503A\n\nIf FDA determines that an individual or firm compounds a drug product that does not meet the conditions of section 503A, then in addition to the violations listed above in section IV.A., the individual or firm that compounds the drug product may also be subject to a warning letter, seizure of product, injunction, and/or criminal prosecution for violations of sections 501(a)(2)(B), 502(f)(1), and 505 of the FD&C Act.11 Such violations may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nFootnote 11: See Medical Ctr. Pharm. v. Mukasey, 536 F.3d 383, 405 (5th Cir. 2008) (“compounded drugs are in fact ‘new drugs’ as defined by [21 U.S.C.] § 321(p) but are exempt from the requirements of [21 U.S.C.] § 351(a)(2)(B), 352(f)(1), and 355 if and only if they comply with the conditions set forth in [21 U.S.C.] § 353a.”).\n\n2.2.1 Producing Adulterated Drugs\n\nIn accordance with section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR parts 210 and 211, the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, and holding of a drug must conform with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements. If an individual or firm compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act, those drug products would be subject to CGMP requirements.\n\n2.2 Producing Unapproved New Drugs\n\nIn accordance with section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, an individual or firm must not introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any new drug unless an approved NDA or ANDA is in effect for that drug product. If an individual or firm compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act, those drug products would be subject to the new drug approval requirements.\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn accordance with section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 201.5, drug products that are not labeled with adequate directions for use are misbranded. If an individual or firm compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act, those drug products would be subject to the requirements for adequate directions for use.\n\nIn addition to sections 501(a)(2)(B), 502(f)(1), and 505 of the FD&C Act, an individual or firm that compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act would be subject to the requirements listed in section IV.A, above, as well as other requirements of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations.\n\nEnforcement Approach\n\nGenerally, FDA expects to employ a risk-based enforcement approach with respect to violative compounded drugs, giving the highest enforcement priority to compounded drugs and violations of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations that pose the greatest public health risks. However, FDA emphasizes that it need not identify a particular safety problem before pursuing enforcement action.\n--------------------\nContext title: Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance'

On February 19, 2019 (84 FR 4696), FDA published a final rule that establishes FDA\'s criteria for evaluating bulk drug substances for inclusion on the list of bulk drug substances that may be used to compound drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act (the 503A Bulks List or the list) and that places six substances on the list. The final rule, entitled ""List of Bulk Drug Substances That Can Be Used To Compound Drug Products in Accordance With Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,"" also identifies four substances that were considered for and not included on the list.\n\nFootnote 2: FDA is evaluating bulk drug substances nominated for the 503A Bulks List on a rolling basis and intends to address additional substances in future rulemaking.\n\nThe 503A Bulks List Final Rule is effective March 21, 2019. FDA has prepared this guidance in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28)3 to assist small businesses in complying with the 503A Bulks List Final Rule.\n\nFootnote 3: 5 U.S.C. 601.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.\n\nInstead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nSection 503A of the FD&C Act describes the conditions under which a compounded drug product qualifies for exemptions from certain requirements of the FD&C Act related to FDA approval prior to marketing, current good manufacturing practice requirements, and labeling with adequate directions for use. One of the conditions that must be met for a compounded drug product to qualify for these exemptions is that a licensed pharmacist in a State-licensed pharmacy or Federal facility or a licensed physician compounds the drug product using bulk drug substances that (1) comply with the standards of an applicable United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or National Formulary monograph, if a monograph exists, and the USP chapter on pharmacy compounding; (2) if such a monograph does not exist, are drug substances that are components of drugs approved by FDA; or (3) if such a monograph does not exist and the drug substance is not a component of a drug approved by FDA, appear on a list of bulk drug substances developed by FDA through regulation.4\n\nFootnote 4: See section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353a(b)(1)(A)(i)).\n\nAs noted above, the 503A Bulks List Final Rule establishes criteria for evaluating bulk drug substances for inclusion on the 503A Bulks List, identifies six bulk drug substances FDA is placing on the list, and identifies four other bulk drug substances that were considered and are not being included on the 503A Bulks List.\n\nIII Questions and Answers\n\nWhat active ingredients are subject to this final rule?\n\nThe 503A Bulks List Final Rule addresses only 10 of the substances nominated for the 503A Bulks List. The final rule identifies six bulk drug substances FDA is placing on the list: Brilliant Blue G, also known as Coomassiee Brilliant Blue G-250; cantharidin (for topical use only); diphenylcyclopropone (for topical use only); N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG) (for topical use only); squaric acid dibutyl ester (for topical use only); and thymol iodide (for topical use only). The final rule also identifies four other bulk drug substances that are not being included on the list: oxitriptan, piracetam, silver protein mild, and tranilast.\n\nAlthough only the 10 substances listed above are specifically addressed in the final rule, the criteria for evaluation identified in the final rule will be applied to all bulk drug substances that are considered for the 503A Bulks List.\n\nCan substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n\nNo. As stated above, section 503A provides compounded drug products with exemptions from certain requirements of the FD&C Act, including premarket approval, but only when those compounded drug products meet the conditions of section 503A. A compounded drug product that includes one of the four bulk drug substances that are not being placed on the list would not meet those conditions and therefore would not qualify for the exemptions from the FD&C Act.\n\nIn addition, as described in the Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry,5 substances that have been evaluated and not placed on the 503A Bulks List no longer qualify for the interim policy concerning compounding with bulk drug substances.\n\nFootnote 5: We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, be sure to check the Agency’s guidance website at http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/FDABasicsforIndustry/ucm234622.htm.\n\nQ3. What should I do if I am a pharmacist and I receive a prescription for a compounded drug product that includes one of the four bulk drug substances that is not being placed on the 503A Bulks List as part of this final rule?\n\nA drug product compounded using a bulk drug substance that is identified in a final rule as not being placed on the 503A Bulks List does not qualify for the exemptions under section 503A of the FD&C Act. Compounding with any of the four substances identified in the 503A Bulks List Final Rule, or with substances identified in any other final rule as not being placed on the 503A Bulks List, may subject the compounder to regulatory action.\n\nQ4. When and how do compounders have to comply with this final rule?\n\nThe 503A Bulks List Final Rule is effective March 21, 2019. As of that date, drug products compounded using any of the four bulk drug substances that are identified as not being included on the list do not qualify for the exemptions under 503A of the FD&C Act. Drug products compounded using one of the six bulk drug substances that are on the list will qualify for the exemptions under section 503A of the FD&C Act provided the drug products are compounded in compliance with the other conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ5. Going forward, how will FDA decide whether to place a bulk drug substance on the 503A Bulks List?\n\nAs described in the final rule, FDA is evaluating nominated bulk drug substances using four criteria: the physical and chemical characteristics of the substance, the safety of the substance in compounded drug products, evidence of effectiveness, and historical use of the substance in compounded drug products. As required by section 503A of the FD&C Act, FDA is consulting with the Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee (PCAC) and USP regarding the 503A Bulks List and is developing the list through notice and comment rulemaking.\n\nQ6. Why did FDA find the four substances it is not placing on the 503A Bulks List to be inappropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act?\n\nFor reasons described at length in the proposed rule that published on December 16, 2016 (81 FR 91071), entitled ""List of Bulk Drug Substances That Can Be Used To Compound Drug Products in Accordance With Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,"" and in the briefing materials presented to the PCAC, applying the four criteria identified in Question 5 above, FDA determined that these four substances are not appropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ7. What information did FDA rely on to make its determinations for the bulk drug substances that are addressed in the final rule?\n--------------------\nContext title: Section 503A Bulks List Final Rule Questions and Answers; Small Entity Compliance Guide; Guidance for Industry'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: Nominations for the 503B Bulks List\n\nIn response to the December 2013 Federal Register notice, over 2,000 substances were nominated for the 503B bulks list. However, many of the nominations for the 503B bulks list were not for substances used in compounding as active ingredients, or they did not include sufficient information to allow FDA to evaluate the nominated substances for placement on the list. To improve the efficiency of the process for developing the 503B bulks list, FDA reopened the nomination process in July 2014 (79 FR 37747), and provided more detailed information on what it needs to evaluate nominations for the list. FDA stated that bulk drug substances that were previously nominated would not be further considered unless they were re-nominated and those nominations were adequately supported. Substances that were not adequately supported would not be evaluated by FDA to be placed on the 503B bulks list. The notice stated that the following information about clinical need is necessary to provide adequate support for nominations to the 503B bulks list:\n\nA statement describing the medical condition(s) that the drug product to be compounded with the nominated bulk drug substances is intended to treat;\n\nA list of FDA-approved drug products, if any, that address the same medical condition;\n\nIf there are any FDA-approved drug products that address the same medical condition, an explanation of why a compounded drug product is necessary;\n\nIf the approved drug product is not suitable for a particular patient population, an estimate of the size of the population that would need a compounded drug product;\n\nA bibliography of safety and efficacy data for the drug product compounded using the nominated substance, if available, including any relevant peer-reviewed medical literature; and\n\nIf there is an FDA-approved drug product that includes the bulk drug substance nominated, an explanation of why the drug product proposed to be compounded must be compounded from bulk rather than with the FDA-approved drug product.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn response to this request for nominations, approximately 2,590 unique substances were nominated. Of the nominated substances:\n\nApproximately 1,740 are biological products (all but one of these7 are individual allergenic extracts) subject to approval in a biologics license application (BLA) under section 351 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. Footnote 7: The product is sodium hexachloroplatinate (IV) hexahydrate. These products are not eligible for the 503B bulks list because biological products subject to approval in a BLA under section 351 of the PHS Act are not eligible for the exemptions in section 503B.8 No biological products subject to approval in a BLA will be considered for the 503B bulks list. Footnote 8: See the draft guidance, Mixing, Diluting, or Repackaging Biological Products Outside the Scope of an Approved Biologics License Application for FDA’s proposed policies regarding State-licensed pharmacies, Federal facilities, and outsourcing facilities that mix, dilute, or repackage biological products outside the scope of an approved BLA.\n\nAt least one9 of the nominated substances is not a bulk drug substance. Footnote 9: The over-the-counter finished drug product Maalox was nominated. Maalox is not a bulk drug substance. Footnote 10: The substance is sodium iodide I-131. This is a finished drug product that was nominated by its brand name. Finished drug products are not eligible for the 503B bulks list because they do not meet the definition of a bulk drug substance in 21 CFR 207.3.\n\nAt least one of the nominated substances is a radiopharmaceutical.10 Footnote 10: The substance is sodium iodide I-131.\n\nCompounding of radiopharmaceutical products will be addressed in a separate guidance document.11 Footnote 11: FDA has published a draft guidance, “Compounding and Repackaging of Radiopharmaceuticals by Outsourcing Facilities,” for public comment. That draft guidance proposes the Agency’s policy regarding the use of bulk drug substances to compound radiopharmaceuticals under section 503B of the FD&C Act. Once that guidance is final, FDA intends to update this guidance to reflect the policies set forth therein.\n* At least five of the nominated substances appear on the list of drugs that have been withdrawn or removed from the market because such drug products or components of such drug products have been found to be unsafe or not effective (withdrawn or removed list)\n\nSuch substances cannot be used in compounding under section 503B of the FD&C Act, and therefore are not eligible for inclusion on the 503B bulks list.12 Footnote 12: See section 503B(a)(4) of the FD&C Act. See also 21 CFR 216.24. The five substances are: chloroform reagent, cobalt chloride hexahydrate, cobalt gluconate, methapyrilene fumarate, and phenacetin.\n* One of the nominated substances has no currently accepted medical use and is included on Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. SS 812(c)).13 Footnote 13: FDA has published a draft guidance, “Compounding and Repackaging of Radiopharmaceuticals by Outsourcing Facilities,” for public comment. That draft guidance proposes the Agency’s policy regarding the use of bulk drug substances to compound radiopharmaceuticals under section 503B of the FD&C Act. Once that guidance is final, FDA intends to update this guidance to reflect the policies set forth therein.\n* The product is sodium hexachloroplatinate (IV) hexahydrate.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]\n\nthe communication on FDA's human drug compounding website15 advising that the substance has been added to Category 2 and is no longer eligible for the policies that apply to substances in Category 1.\n\nFootnote 15: http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/PharmacyCompounding/default.htm. FDA also encourages compounding facilities to subscribe to FDA’s list serve to receive updates at:\n\nhttp://service.govdelivery.com/service/subscribe.html?code=USFDA_429.\n\n503B Category 3 -Substances Nominated for the Bulks List Without Adequate Support: These substances may be eligible for inclusion on the 503B bulks list, but were nominated with insufficient supporting information for FDA to evaluate them. These substances can be re-nominated with sufficient supporting information through a docket that FDA has established, as discussed below in section III.B.\n\niii.2.3 Process for Developing the 503B Bulks List\n\nFDA is currently evaluating the bulk drug substances nominated for the 503B bulks list with sufficient supporting information for evaluation. FDA is considering a number of factors in prioritizing the order in which it reviews these nominated bulk drug substances, including but not limited to the following:\n\nSafety concerns about use of the bulk drug substance in compounding\n\nWhether the bulk drug substance was nominated by multiple parties or identified as necessary by medical professional organizations\n\nThe efficiency with which the evaluation can be completed, based on ease of acquiring the necessary information to conduct the review, available resources, and other logistical issues\n\nFDA may also group some nominated drug substances to facilitate efficient review and discussion. These include drug substances that raise similar issues (e.g., vitamins or botanicals) or that are nominated for the treatment of the same condition (e.g., warts).\n\nFDA intends to publish a notice in the Federal Register that describes its proposed position on each substance it has evaluated along with the rationale for that proposal, for public comment. We note that there is no requirement in section 503B to consult the Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee (PCAC) before developing a 503B bulks list, as is required by section 503A(c)(1) for the 503A bulks list. However, after considering public comment on the nominated substances, FDA will determine whether PCAC input on any of the substances would be helpful to the Agency in making its determination, and if so, it will seek PCAC input. Once FDA makes a determination, it will publish in the Federal Register a list identifying the bulk drug substances for which it has determined there is a clinical need and FDA's rationale in making that determination. FDA will also publish in the Federal Register a list of those substances it considered but found that there is no clinical need to use in compounding and FDA's rationale in making this determination.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nOnce FDA publishes a 503B bulks list in the Federal Register that reflects its determination regarding particular bulk drug substances, drug products compounded with substances on the 503B bulks list will be eligible for the 503B exemptions, provided the drug products are compounded in compliance with the other conditions of section 503B.16 Once FDA has published in the Federal Register its decision not to place a particular substance on the 503B bulks list, the policy described in section III of this guidance no longer applies.\n\nFootnote 16: See section 503B(a)(11) of the FD&C Act.\n--------------------\nContext title: Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act""]","['No. As stated above, section 503A provides compounded drug products with exemptions from certain requirements of the FD&C Act, including premarket approval, but only when those compounded drug products meet the conditions of section 503A.

To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nContents Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe purpose of this guidance is to provide recommendations to sponsors regarding the submission of an initial pediatric study plan (iPSP) and any amendments to the iPSP. Specifically, this guidance provides the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding implementation of the requirement for sponsors to submit an iPSP, described in section 505B(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).\n\nThis guidance addresses the following:\n\nApplications for which an iPSP is required\n\nTiming of an iPSP submission\n\nContent of an iPSP\n\nContent and timing of a requested amendment to an agreed iPSP\n\nA template that is recommend to be used for an iPSP submission2\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\ngiven by the FDA at the end-of-phase 1 meeting, for drugs for life-threatening diseases,7 and at the end-of-phase 2 meeting, for other drugs.8\n\nFootnote 7: See 21 CFR 312.81(a).\n\nFootnote 8: For additional information on end-of-phase 1 meetings and end-of-phase 2 meetings, see 21 CFR 312.47(b) and 312.82(b).\n\nThe pediatric rule also stated that sponsors should submit, at least 1 month in advance of the end-of-phase 2 meeting, certain background information, including a proposed timeline for protocol finalization, enrollment, completion, and data analysis, or, in the alternative, information to support a planned request for waiver or deferral. However, on October 17, 2002, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia held that the FDA had exceeded its statutory authority when issuing the pediatric rule and the court enjoined the rule's enforcement.9\n\nFootnote 9: Association of Am. Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. v. FDA, 226 F. Supp. 2d 204, 222 (D.D.C. 2002).\n\nCongress subsequently passed PREA, which was signed into law on December 3, 2003.10 Many of the provisions described under the pediatric rule were adopted under PREA. Under PREA as originally enacted and under its reauthorization under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007,11 a sponsor was not required to submit a proposed timeline and plan for the submission of pediatric studies during the investigational new drug application (IND) phase of drug development. Under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), signed into law on July 9, 2012, for the first time PREA12 includes a provision that requires a sponsor planning to submit an application for a drug subject to PREA to submit an iPSP early in the development process.13 The intent of the iPSP is for a sponsor to identify needed pediatric studies early in development and begin planning for these studies. Early dialogue with the FDA on a comprehensive pediatric development plan, including both required pediatric studies under PREA and potential pediatric uses under the BPCA, is intended to result in a more efficient pediatric drug development program. The timing and content of the submission of an iPSP are described below. The FD&C Act, as amended by FDASIA, requires the FDA to issue regulations and guidance to implement these and other provisions.14\n\nFootnote 10: Public Law 108-155, 117 Stat. 1936 (Dec. 3, 2003).\n\nFootnote 11: Public Law 110-85, 121 Stat. 823 (Sept. 27, 2007).\n\nFootnote 12: By convention, section 505B is often referred to as PREA, after the act that added that section to the FD&C Act. We follow that naming convention in this guidance.\n\nThe FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA), further updated PREA with respect to certain drugs intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target determined to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer, and for which an original marketing application is submitted on or after August 18, 2020.15\n\nFootnote 15: Public Law 115-52, 131 Stat. 1005 (Aug. 18, 2017). For additional information on FDA’s implementation of these amendments to PREA and on the submission of iPSPs for oncology drugs in light of the amendments, see the draft guidances for industry FD4RA Implementation Guidance for Pediatric Studies of Molecularly Targeted Oncology Drugs: Amendments to Sec. 505B of the FD&C Act (December 2019) and Pediatric Study Plans for Oncology Drugs: Transitional Information Until Full Implementation of FD4RA Section 504: Questions and Answers (January 2020). When finalized, these guidances will represent FDA’s current thinking on these topics. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIII Applications that require submission of an initial PSP\n\nA sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application (or supplement to an application) for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration is required to submit an iPSP16 unless the drug is for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.17 In addition, a sponsor who is planning to submit, on or after August 18, 2020, an original application for a new active ingredient that is subject to the molecularly targeted cancer drug provision of PREA (i.e., the drug that is the subject of the application is intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer) is also required to submit an iPSP,18 regardless of whether the drug is for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.19 By statute, a biosimilar product that has not been determined to be interchangeable with the reference product is considered to have a new active ingredient for purposes of PREA.20\n\nFootnote 17: See section 505B(e)(1) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(k)(1).\n\nFootnote 18: See section 505B(e)(1) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(1); and section 505B(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(a)(1)(B).\n\nFootnote 19: See section 505B(k)(2) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(k)(2).\n\nFootnote 20: See section 505B(l) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(l).\n\nFootnote 21: See section 505B(e)(1) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(1).\n\nThe sponsor must submit an iPSP for any new application or supplement that is subject to PREA, regardless of whether the FDA has previously granted waivers or deferrals under PREA for the same drug.21 Additionally, for drugs that are being developed specifically for use in pediatric populations, the sponsor should submit an iPSP.\n\nFootnote 21: See section 505B(e)(1) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(1).\n\nFootnote 21: See section 505B(e)(1) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(1).\n\nFootnote 21: See section 505B(e)(1) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(1).\n\nFootnote 22: See section 505B(e)(1) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(1).\n\nFootnote 23: See section 505B(l) of the FD\n\nIV Timelines for an Initial Psp Submission\n\nA sponsor must submit an iPSP, if required under PREA, before the date on which the sponsor submits the required assessments or investigation and no later than either 60 calendar days after the date of the end-of-phase 2 meeting or such other time as agreed upon between FDA and the sponsor.22 The FDA expects to agree to time frames other than those described in this guidance only if there are exceptional circumstances. In the absence of an end-of-phase 2 meeting, the sponsor should submit the iPSP as early as practicable but before the initiation of any phase 3 studies, or any combined phase 2 and phase 3 studies, of the drug that is the subject of the iPSP. If a phase 3 study, or a combined phase 2 and phase 3 study, will not be conducted or will be conducted but not under IND, the sponsor should submit the iPSP no later than 210 calendar days before it submits a marketing application or supplement. Sponsors should contact the appropriate component of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research if they believe exceptional circumstances exist.\n\nFootnote 22: See section 505B(e)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(2)(A).\n\nThe sponsor should submit the iPSP to the relevant drug's IND for review by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research as appropriate. In cases where the sponsor has no active IND for the drug but the sponsor expects to open the IND with an initial phase 3 study, the sponsor should submit the iPSP as a pre-IND submission. In this situation, the FDA encourages the sponsor to schedule a pre-IND meeting before submission of the iPSP, and such submission should precede initiation of any phase 3 studies or combined phase 2 and phase 3 studies. In cases where the drug development program includes the possibility of using expedited programs,23 the FDA encourages the sponsor to have discussions about the pediatric development plans with the review division as early as possible.\n\nFootnote 23: For further information on expedited programs, see the guidance for industry Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions—Drugs and Biologics (May 2014).\n--------------------\nContext title: Pediatric Study Plans- Content of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsors are encouraged to submit an initial pediatric study plan as soon as practicable.17 Footnote 16: For the purposes of this guidance, adolescents are defined as age 12 to younger than 18 years of age.\n\nUnder the Pediatric Research Equity Act, all applications for new active ingredients (which includes new salts and new fixed combinations), new indications, new dosage forms, new dosing regimens, or new routes ofadministration, are required to contain an assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indication or indications in pediatric populations unless this requirement is waived, deferred, or inapplicable.18 FDA intends to work with sponsors to reach agreement on the initial pediatric study plan and any pediatric trial protocols as quickly as possible to avoid any unnecessary delays in the initiation of trials or submission of any marketing application. Footnote 18: See 21 U.S.C 355c.\n\n2.2.2 Trial Design and Conduct\n\nSponsors of drugs to treat COVID-19 should consider the following:\n\nFDA strongly recommends that drugs to treat COVID-19 be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials using a superiority design. In some situations, use of an active control with a superiority or noninferiority design19 may be appropriate.20 Footnote 19: The noninferiority margin must be sufficiently supported to conduct a noninferiority trial and the justification should be discussed with FDA. See the guidance for industry Non-Inferiority Clinical Trials to Establish Effectiveness (November 2016).\n\nBackground standard of care should be maintained in all treatment arms.\n\nThe standard of care is expected to change as additional information, such as from randomized controlled trials, emerges. Where treatments become standard of care for specific COVID-19 populations (e.g., severely ill hospitalized patients), trials in these populations should generally be designed as placebo-controlled superiority studies with an add-on design (i.e., the investigational agent or placebo added on to the standard of care agent). For agents with a similar mechanism of action as the standard of care (e.g., direct antiviral agent as the investigational agent when the new standard of care is also a direct antiviral agent), an active-comparator controlled study design may be considered if there is sufficient preclinical and initial clinical evidence of activity of the investigational agent. Sponsors should plan early discussion with the appropriate clinical division.\n\nSponsors should address the possibility of drug and COVID-19 vaccine interactions for drugs that may interfere with vaccine effectiveness (i.e., monoclonal antibodies targeting the vaccine antigen). Sponsors should consult with the Agency early in the development program for such drugs.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is evolving as it spreads through the human population, and emergent\nSARS-CoV-2 genetic changes may impact the effectiveness of antiviral drugs. In addition, using an antiviral drug to treat COVID-19 may contribute to the emergence of viruses with reduced susceptibility to the drug or to other approved or investigational drugs. Sponsors should characterize drug resistance pathways and the potential for cross-resistance to other drugs using both nonclinical and clinical studies. Details regarding drug resistance analysis are provided in Appendix B. Sponsors should also refer to the guidance for industry Development of Monoclonal Antibody Products Targeting SARS-CoV-2, Including Addressing the Impact of Emerging Variants, During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (February 2021) and the guidance for industry Antiviral Product Development--Conducting and Submitting Virology Studies to the Agency (June 2006).\n\nClinical trial protocols should include plans to characterize the impact of drugs on viral shedding and immune responses as described in Appendix C.\n\nGiven infection control concerns associated with COVID-19, sponsors should consider remote collection of data when possible and limit in-person data collection to important assessments that cannot be obtained without face-to-face interaction. FDA recognizes the important role of decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) in COVID-19 drug development, as they provide options for data collection particularly suited to the pandemic setting.\n\nDCTs may involve different levels of decentralization. In trials that are fully decentralized, all activities take place at locations remote from investigators (e.g., patients' homes).21 In partially decentralized trials, some activities involve in-person visits at the investigator's traditional trial site while other visits are conducted elsewhere.\n\nSponsors should consider several factors when determining if conducting a DCT is appropriate, selecting the location of a trial visit, and/or selecting personnel performing an assessment. These factors include the following: Footnote 21: See the guidance for industry, investigators, and institutional review boards Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products During the COVID-19 Health Emergency (March 2020).\n\nThe severity of COVID-19\n\nThe nature of the investigational product (e.g., ease of administration, safety profile, stability profile, storage conditions)\n\nThe type of trial procedure or assessment (e.g., administration of investigational product, clinical laboratory assessment, clinical outcome assessment, or adverse event assessment/follow-up).\n\nSponsors considering a DCT should plan early discussions with the appropriate review division, as a DCT may introduce additional complexities related to feasibility, design, implementation, and analysis of the data.\n\n2.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nGiven the expected fluctuation in the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection across regions, sponsors should address the need to open new sites and potentially suspend existing sites.\n\nThe trial should be of sufficient duration to reliably evaluate safety and effectiveness. The duration should be adequate to capture the efficacy outcomes relevant for the population under study. Additionally, longer follow-up for safety may be warranted.\n\nWhen there is compelling preclinical or preliminary clinical evidence, it may be appropriate to move directly to conduct a trial of sufficient size and appropriate design to contribute to substantial evidence of effectiveness and adequate characterization of safety. Sponsors should discuss their intended approach early with the appropriate review division.\n\nIn instances of limited information supporting the potential for efficacy,22 approaches where an initial assessment of potential benefit can be made before enrolling a large number of subjects are appropriate. These approaches may include the following:\n\nConducting an initial small, controlled trial to assess for drug activity (proof-of-concept) that suggests the potential for clinical benefit. Footnote 22: See the guidance for industry and investigators COVID-19 Public Health Emergency: General Considerations for Pre-IND Meeting Requests for COVID-19 Related Drugs and Biological Products, which describes the information and data recommended to support FDA’s review for the initiation of clinical trials during the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nConducting a phase 2 or phase 3 trial that incorporates prospectively planned criteria to stop the trial for futility (i.e., with the prospect of expanding from a proof-of-concept phase to a larger confirmatory trial). Such a trial might also incorporate additional prospectively planned adaptations (see additional comments on adaptive design proposals below).\n\nFDA encourages sponsors to use an independent, external data monitoring committee (DMC) to ensure subject safety and trial integrity.\n\nSponsors should submit the DMC charter to FDA before enrolling patients.\n\nSponsors should ensure there will be appropriate DMC monitoring to safeguard the welfare of subjects, accounting for important factors such as the expected enrollment rate, the expected lag time to analyze interim data for DMC meetings, and the frequency of DMC meetings.23 Footnote 23: See the guidance for industry Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees (March 2006). FDA has also proposed relevant recommendations in the draft guidance for industry Safety Assessment for IND Safety Reporting (December 2015). When final, this guidance will represent the FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nIf enrollment is anticipated to be rapid, but additional safety data are needed before dosing a large number of subjects, an enrollment pause should be built into the trial.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: COVID-19- Developing Drugs and Biological Products for Treatment or Prevention Guidance for Industry""

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to help applicants develop draft labeling for proposed biosimilar products for submission in an application under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262(k)). The recommendations for prescription drug labeling in this guidance pertain only to the prescribing information (commonly referred to as the package insert), except for certain recommendations in section V pertaining to FDA-approved patient labeling (e.g., Patient Information, Medication Guide, and Instructions for Use).2 This guidance does not provide specific labeling recommendations for interchangeable products (see section VIII of this guidance).\n\nFootnote 2: Unless otherwise specified, the terms biosimilar product labeling and labeling as used in this guidance address only the prescribing information as described in 21 CFR 201.56 and 201.57.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) (Public Law 111-148) on March 23, 2010. The BPCI Act amends the PHS Act and other statutes to create an abbreviated license pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference product3 (see sections 7001 through 7003 of the Affordable Care Act). Section 351(k) of the PHS Act, added by the BPCI Act, sets forth the requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product and an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product.\n\nFootnote 3: Reference product means the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in a 351(k) application (section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nSection 351(i) of the PHS Act defines biosimilarity to mean ""that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components"" and that ""there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product.""\n\nTo meet the standard for interchangeability, an applicant must provide sufficient information to demonstrate biosimilarity and also to demonstrate that the biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, if the biological product is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch (see section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act). Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nAn application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based upon data derived from:\n\nAnalytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;\n\nAnimal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and\n\nA clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.\n\nUnder the PHS Act, FDA has the discretion to determine that an element described above is unnecessary in a 351(k) application.\n\nUnder FDA regulations, prescription drug labeling must provide adequate information to enable health care providers to ""use the drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended""; and to this end, the approved prescribing information summarizes the essential scientific information needed by health care providers for the safe and effective use of a drug.4 Prescription drug labeling reflects FDA\'s finding of safety and effectiveness5({}^{,})6 for the drug under the labeled conditions of use and facilitates prescribing decisions, thereby enabling the safe and effective use of drugs, including biological products, and reducing the likelihood of medication errors.\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 CFR 201.100 and 201.56(a)(1).\n\nFootnote 5: The standard for licensure of a biological product as potent under section 351(a) of the PHS Act has long been interpreted to include effectiveness (see 21 CFR 600.3(s) and the guidance for industry Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nFootnote 6: In this guidance, we use the terms safety and effectiveness and safety, purity, and potency interchangeably in the discussions pertaining to biosimilar products.\n\nIII General principles for draft labeling of proposed biosimilar products (biosimilar product labeling)\n\nThe goal of a biosimilar product development program is to demonstrate biosimilarity between the proposed product and the reference product -- not to independently establish safety and effectiveness of the proposed product. A demonstration of biosimilarity means, among other things, that FDA has determined that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.7 Thus, FDA\'s finding of safety and effectiveness for the reference product, as reflected in its FDA-approved prescribing information, may be relied upon to provide health care providers with the essential scientific information needed to facilitate prescribing decisions for the proposed biosimilar product\'s labeled conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)). Accordingly, FDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, such as those described in sections V and VI of this guidance.8\n\nFootnote 7: Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act.\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: VI Relationship of Agreed Initial Psp to the Requirement to Submit a Pediatric Study Plan with an Application\n\nFor NDAs, BLAs, or supplemental applications subject to PREA, sponsors must include an agreed iPSP in the application when a deferral of pediatric studies is requested.54 In such cases, submission of the iPSP (specifically, the agreed iPSP) fulfills the requirement of the sponsor to submit a pediatric study plan, which must be included in the appropriate section of the application.55 Failure to fulfill the requirement to submit a pediatric study plan with the application may be grounds for refusal to file an application.56 Any planned requests for waivers and/or deferrals included in the iPSP serve as the official request with the application submission.57 The PeRC will review any requests for waivers and/or deferrals and make recommendations as needed to the review division.58 A final decision about granting or denying such requests is made by the review division at the time of approval of the marketing application.\n\nFootnote 54: See sections 505B(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II), 505B(a)(1) and 505B(e) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II), 355c(a)(1), and 355c(e).\n\nFootnote 55: See sections 505B(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and 505B(e)(3) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and 355c(e)(3).\n\nVII Content and Timing of Requested Amendment to an Initial Psp\n\nSponsors can request an amendment to an agreed iPSP at any time. Requests can include, for example, changing a date listed in section 11 of the iPSP that would significantly delay the initiation and/or completion of pediatric studies (e.g., by more than 12 months), changing planned requests for a deferral to planned requests for a waiver or partial waiver, or changing a planned request for a waiver or partial waiver to a planned request for a deferral. For example, emerging safety data from nonclinical juvenile animal studies and/or adult human clinical trials may support converting a planned request for a deferral to a planned request for a waiver for reasons of safety. Alternatively, the need for additional safety data from adult human clinical trials may support a delay in the initiation of pediatric clinical trials. In addition, formulation data could necessitate a change in a development program. The PeRC will be consulted on the review of significant amendments to an agreed iPSP.59\n\nFootnote 59: See section 505B(e)(6) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(6).\n\nA request for an amendment to an agreed iPSP should include the following:\n\nThe requested change(s) supported with a justification\n\nA copy of the agreed iPSP with the requested change(s) tracked and clearly identified\n\nA clean copy of the proposed amended iPSP\n\nAmendments should not be considered agreed upon until the FDA issues a letter stating that the amendments are acceptable.\n\nOnce the FDA accepts for filing an application or supplemental application, it is not necessary to submit amendments to the iPSP because changes to the plan for pediatric development can be negotiated during the review cycle as appropriate. For example, a sponsor submits a marketing application with an agreed iPSP, and the review division files the application. The sponsor proposes to modify the timeline for studies after filing the application; in this case, it is not necessary to submit an amended iPSP, but instead the newly proposed timeline can be negotiated with the review division during the review cycle of the application.\n\nThe timeline for submission, review, and agreement on an amended iPSP is the same as on an iPSP.60 (See Section IV., Timing of an Initial PSP Submission). If the FDA does not agree to the amended iPSP, the original agreed iPSP remains in force. If the sponsor submits an amendment to an agreed iPSP within 210 days of the planned submission of an NDA, BLA, or supplement, the amendment may not be considered agreed absent sufficient time for the FDA review. However, the sponsor may submit the NDA, BLA, or supplement with the previously agreed iPSP. FDA intends to, as appropriate, consider changes to the plan for pediatric development during the application review cycle (see section VIII., Non-Agreed Initial PSPs).\n\nFootnote 60: See section 505B(e)(5) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(5).\n\nHowever, if, under certain situations, the agreed iPSP included nonclinical and/or pediatric clinical studies that were expected to have been completed before submission of the NDA, BLA, or supplement, failure of the sponsor to complete these agreed studies in a timely manner may result in a refusal to file.61 In this situation, a sponsor should submit a request for an amendment to the agreed iPSP that includes an updated timeline for the studies and justification for the delay in completing one or more of the agreed pediatric studies. If the FDA considers the justification for the delay to be inadequate and does not agree with the proposed iPSP amendment, the agreed iPSP would remain in force until the FDA and sponsor agree on an amended iPSP (See Section VIII., Non-Agreed Initial PSPs), and the failure of the sponsor to complete the agreed nonclinical and/or pediatric clinical studies in a timely manner still may result in a refusal to file.\n\nFootnote 61: See section 505B(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 355c(a)(1)), which requires that the assessments or reports on the molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation be submitted with the application or supplement to which PREA applies. See also 21 CFR 314.101(d).\n\nVIII Non-Agreed Initial PSPs\n\nIf the FDA and the sponsor are unable to reach agreement on an iPSP at the end of the 210-day review period, the FDA intends to issue a letter stating that the iPSP is considered a non-agreed iPSP. As discussed in section IX., Reaching Agreement on the Non-Agreed Initial PSP, there is no established timeline for the review and agreement of a non-agreed iPSP. Therefore, sponsors are encouraged to work with FDA to reach agreement during the initial 210-day review period.\n\nIf the FDA and the sponsor are unable to reach agreement on the proposed amendments to an agreed iPSP, the FDA intends to issue a letter stating that the amended iPSP is considered a non-agreed amended iPSP. Under this circumstance, the agreed iPSP would be considered to be in force until the FDA and sponsor agree on an amended iPSP.\n\nAs stated above, for NDAs, BLAs, or supplemental applications subject to PREA, sponsors must include an agreed iPSP in the application when a deferral of pediatric studies is requested, and the failure to submit an agreed iPSP when a deferral is requested may be grounds for refusal to file the application.62 All correspondence with the FDA regarding any non-agreed amendments should be included in the appropriate section of the application.\n\nFootnote 62: See sections 505B(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II), 505B(a)(1), and 505B(e) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II), 355c(a)(1), and 355c(e). See also 21 CFR 314.101(d).\n\nIX Reaching Agreement on the Non-Agreed Initial Psp\n\nWhen a sponsor receives a letter of nonagreement, the FDA makes every effort to work with the sponsor and resolve the area(s) of disagreement as quickly as possible; however, no statutory timeline is attached to this process. If the sponsor disagrees with the FDA\'s recommendations, the sponsor can request a meeting with the FDA. After the sponsor and the FDA have resolved any disagreements, the sponsor should submit the proposed agreed iPSP for FDA review.\n\nAppendix: Initial pediatrictic study plan template1\n\nFootnote 1: This template is also available at https://www.fda.gov/media/84944/download.\n\nWhen submitting an initial pediatrictic study plan (iPSP), sponsors should mark the submission ""INITIAL pediatrictic STUDY PLAN"" in large, bolded type at the beginning of the title page. For an agreed iPSP or amended iPSP, sponsors should mark the submission ""PROPOSED AGREED PEDIATRIC STUDY PLAN"" or ""AMENDED PEDIATRIC STUDY PLAN,"" respectively, in large, bolded type at the beginning of the title page.\n\nINITIAL pediatrictic STUDY PLAN TITLE PAGE\n\nThe proprietary name and the established name of the drug, if any, or, for biological products, the proper name including any appropriate descriptors\n\nDosage form:\n\nNDA/BLA/IND (#):\n\nDrug class:\n\nApproved indication (if applicable):\n\nProposed indication (if applicable):\n\nProposed General Plan: (i.e., full or partial waiver, deferral, and inclusion of a pediatric assessment or molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation in the future application)\n\nCross-reference to other investigational new drug applications for which an iPSP is submitted for this drug development program\n\nOVERVIEW OF THE DISEASE/CONDITION IN THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION (1-3 pages)\n\nOVERVIEW OF THE DRUG OR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT (1-3 pages)\n\nOVERVIEW OF PLANNED EXTRAPOLATION TO SPECIFIC PEDIATRIC POPULATIONS (1-3 pages)\n\nPLANNED REQUEST FOR DRUG-SPECIFIC WAIVER(S) (1-3 pages)\n\nPLANNED REQUEST FOR DEEFRAL(S) OF PEDIATRIC STUDIES (1-2 pages)Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTABULAR SUMMARY OF PLANNED NONCLINICAL AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nAGE-APPROPRIATE FORMULATION DEVELOPMENT (1-3 pages)\n\nNONCLINICAL STUDIES (1-3 pages)\n\nCLINICAL DATA TO SUPPORT DESIGN AND/OR INITITATION OF STUDIES IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS (1-5 pages)\n\nPLANNED PEDIATRIC CLINICAL STUDIES\n\n1 Pediatric Pharmacokinetic or Pharmacokine/Pharmacodynamic Studies (1-10 pages)\n\n2 Clinical Effectiveness and Safety Studies (1-10 pages)\n\nTIMELINE OF THE PEDIATRIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN (1 page)\n\nAGREEMENTS FOR PEDIATRIC STUDIES WITH OTHER REGULATORY AuthorITIES (1-3 pages)\n\nIf there is a pending or agreed pediatric investigational plan with EMA (European Medicines Agency), sponsors should provide the corresponding application number (e.g., EMEA-000206-PIP01-08).\n--------------------\nContext title: Pediatric Study Plans- Content of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: An application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that ""the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product"" based upon data derived from:11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(3) of the PHS Act.\n\nAnalytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;\n\nAnimal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and\n\nA clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.\n\nThe Agency has the discretion to determine that an element described above is unnecessary in a 351(k) application.12 FDA advises sponsors intending to develop biosimilar products to meet with FDA to present their product development plans and establish a schedule of milestones that will serve as landmarks for future discussions with the Agency. FDA anticipates that early discussions with FDA about product development plans and about approaches to providing adequate scientific justifications will facilitate biosimilar development.13\n\nFootnote 12: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See the draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants for a detailed discussion. When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\n4 Complexities of Protein Products\n\nA sponsor should consider the complexities of protein products and related scientific issues when designing a development program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.\n\nNature of Protein Products and Related Scientific Considerations\n\nUnlike small molecule drugs, whose structure can usually be completely defined and entirely reproduced, proteins are typically more complex and are unlikely to be shown to be structurally identical to a reference product. Many potential differences in protein structure can arise. Because even minor structural differences (including certain changes in glycosylation patterns) can significantly affect a protein\'s safety and/or effectiveness, it is important to evaluate these differences.\n\nIn general, proteins can differ in at least three ways: (1) primary amino acid sequence; (2) modification to amino acids, such as sugar moieties (glycosylation) or other side chains; and (3) higher order structure (protein folding and protein-protein interactions). Modifications to amino acids may lead to heterogeneity and can be difficult to control. Protein modifications and higher order structure can be affected by formulation and environmental conditions, including light, temperature, moisture, packaging materials, container closure systems, and delivery device materials. Additionally, process- as well as product-related impurities may increase the likelihood and/or the severity of an immune response to a protein product, and certain excipients may limit the ability to characterize the protein product.\n\nAdvances in analytical sciences enable some protein products to be extensively characterized with respect to their physicochemical and biological properties, such as higher order structures and functional characteristics. These analytical methodologies have increasingly improved the ability to identify and characterize not only the drug substance of a protein product but also excipients and product- and process-related impurities.\n\nDespite such significant improvements in analytical techniques, however, current analytical methodology may not be able to detect all relevant structural and functional differences between two protein products. In addition, there may be incomplete understanding of the relationship between a product\'s structural attributes and its clinical performance. Thus, as set forth in the PHS Act, data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies are required to demonstrate biosimilarity unless FDA determines an element unnecessary.14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nManufacturing Process Considerations\n\nDifferent manufacturing processes may alter a protein product in a way that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the product. For example, differences in biological systems used to manufacture a protein product may cause different posttranslational modifications, which in turn may affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the product. Thus, when the manufacturing process for a marketed protein product is changed, the application holder must assess the effects of the change and demonstrate--through appropriate analytical testing, functional assays, and/or in some cases animal and/or clinical studies--that the change does not have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they relate to the safety oreffectiveness of the product.15 The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process (ICH Q5E) describes scientific principles in the comparability assessment for manufacturing changes.\n\nFootnote 15: See 21 CFR 601.12 and 21 CFR 314.70 for regulatory requirements for changes (including manufacturing changes) made to a licensed biologics license application (BLA) and an approved NDA, respectively.\n\nDemonstrating that a proposed product is biosimilar to a reference product typically will be more complex than assessing the comparability of a product before and after manufacturing changes made by the same manufacturer. This is because a manufacturer that modifies its own manufacturing process has extensive knowledge and information about the product and the existing process, including established controls and acceptance parameters. By contrast, the manufacturer of a proposed product is likely to have a different manufacturing process (e.g., different cell line, raw materials, equipment, processes, process controls, and acceptance criteria) from that of the reference product and no direct knowledge of the manufacturing process for the reference product. Therefore, even though some of the scientific principles described in ICH Q5E may also apply in the demonstration of biosimilarity, in general, FDA anticipates that more data and information will be needed to establish biosimilarity than would be needed to establish that a manufacturer\'s post-manufacturing change product is comparable to the pre-manufacturing change product.\n\nV U.S.-LICENSED Reference Product and Other Comparators\n\nTo obtain licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act, a sponsor must demonstrate that the proposed product is biosimilar to a single reference product that previously has been licensed by FDA.16 In general, a sponsor needs to provide information to demonstrate biosimilarity based on data directly comparing the proposed product with the reference product. As a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical PK study and, if appropriate, at least one PD study, intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity for purposes of section 351(k) of the PHS Act must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed. However, a sponsor may seek to use data derived from animal or clinical studies comparing a proposed product with a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act. In such a case, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.17 Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program their plans to provide an adequate scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist applicants in determining the appropriate placement and content of pediatric information in human prescription drug and biological product2 labeling as described in the regulations for the content and format of labeling for human prescription drug and biological products.3({}^{,})4({}^{,})5\n\nFootnote 2: For the purposes of this guidance, references to drugs and drug and biological products include drugs approved under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 355) and biological products licensed under section 351 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 262) that are regulated as drugs.\n\nFootnote 3: 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 21 CFR 201.57.\n\nThe goal of this guidance is to provide recommendations to help ensure that information on the use of prescription drugs in pediatric populations (whether positive, negative, or inconclusive) is consistently placed in the proper sections and subsections within labeling so that the information is clear and accessible to health care providers.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nFDA Pediatric Labeling Initiatives\n\nUntil the early 1990s, the majority of drug labeling contained minimal or no pediatric use information to guide safe and effective use in the pediatric population. In 1994, the FDA began the first of several initiatives to improve pediatric use information in drug labeling by issuing a final rule revising the requirements for the Pediatric Use subsection of labeling. This regulation was intended to promote the inclusion of pediatric information from new clinical studies, previously published pediatric studies, and case reports in an effort to provide pediatric dosing and monitoring information in labeling. It also required drug manufacturers to examine existing data and determine whether those data were sufficient to support additional pediatric use information in a drug\'s labeling.6 Subsequent pediatric legislation included the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA)7 and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA).8 The BPCA contains economic incentives for conducting pediatric studies of drugs and biological products, and PREA establishes requirements for studies of certain drugs and biological products that may be used in pediatric patients. The BPCA and PREA were made permanent in 2012 with the passage of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (Public Law 112-144).\n\nFootnote 6: 59 FR 64240 (December 13, 1994).\n\nFootnote 7: Pub. L. 107-109 (2002), codified at section 505A of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 355a). Although section 505A has been amended since the passage of the BPCA, by convention, that section of the FD&C Act is often referred to by the acronym for the Act that created it, the BPCA. We adopt that convention in this guidance.\n\nFootnote 8: Pub. L. 108-155 (2003), codified at section 505B of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 355c). Although section 505B has been amended since the passage of PREA, by convention, that section of the FD&C Act is often referred to by the acronym for the Act that created it, PREA. We adopt that convention in this guidance.\n\nData submitted in response to a written request9 under the BPCA and assessments10 submitted in response to a PREA study requirement must be described in labeling whether findings are positive, negative, or inconclusive.11 Pediatric information in the labeling must not be false or misleading in any particular.12\n\nFootnote 9: A written request (WR) is a specific document issued by FDA requesting submission of a certain study or studies to determine whether the use of a drug could provide a meaningful health benefit in the pediatric population. The WR specifies the elements of the study or studies that a sponsor or application holder must fulfill to obtain pediatric exclusivity. The FDA can issue a WR at the request of an interested person or on its own initiative. Issuance of a WR to a sponsor or application holder does not require the recipient to conduct the pediatric study or studies described in the WR. It is the recipient’s decision whether to conduct the study or studies and possibly obtain pediatric exclusivity.\n\nFootnote 10: Pediatric assessments “shall contain data, gathered using appropriate formulations for each age group for which the assessment is required, that are adequate (i) to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations; and (ii) to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug or the biological product is safe and effective” (section 505B(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act).\n\nFootnote 11: Sections 505A(j) and 505B(g)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 12: See, e.g., section 505(d), 505(e) of the FD&C Act.\n\nPediatric Age Groups\n\nFor prescription drug labeling, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research generally define pediatric population(s) and pediatric patient(s) as ages birth to 16 years (i.e., younger than 17 years old), and these phrases include the subpopulation age groups of neonates, infants, children, and adolescents.13 The FDA generally recommends using the phrases ""pediatric patients X to Y years old,"" ""pediatric patients aged X to Y years,"" or ""pediatric patients aged X years and older"" (or similar phrases)14 when describing a specific age group(s) or pediatric subpopulation in labeling. However, the use of another description to define the pediatric population in labeling will be considered on a case-by-case basis if there is a valid scientific rationale for an alternative approach (e.g., post-menarche).\n\nFootnote 13: 21 CFR 201.57(c)(9)(iv)(A).\n\nFootnote 14: In labeling and in this guidance, the term pediatric population(s) (e.g., drugs approved to reduce the risk of disease in healthy children) can be used instead of pediatric patients.\n\nIII Placement of pediatric information in human prescription drug and biological product labeling\n\nIn general, pediatric use information should be discussed in the Pediatric Use subsection and included in other sections of labeling as appropriate. When studies are waived under PREA because evidence strongly suggests that a drug would be ineffective or unsafe in a specific pediatric age group(s), the safety concern or lack of efficacy must be described in labeling15 (i.e., Pediatric Use subsection and summarized in other sections as appropriate).\n\nFootnote 15: Section 505B(a)(5)(D) and 505B(b)(2)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe content of the pediatric use information should be based on the type of information being conveyed, which can be characterized as follows:\n\nScenario 1: The evidence supports the safety and effectiveness of a drug for an indication in pediatric patients (either all pediatric patients or in a specific pediatric age group(s))\n\nScenario 2: The evidence does not support the safety and effectiveness of a drug for an indication in pediatric patients (either all pediatric patients or in a specific pediatric age group(s)) because results of studies conducted in that population were either negative (i.e., data from studies strongly suggest that the drug would be ineffective or unsafe) or inconclusive\n--------------------\nContext title: Pediatric Information Incorporated Into Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products Labeling Good Review Practice']","['Section 505B(e) of the FD&C Act requires applicants subject to PREA to submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP) before the date on which the applicant\n\nsubmits the required assessments or investigation, and no later than 60 calendar days after the date of an end-of-phase 2 (EOP2) meeting or at such other time as agreed upon by FDA and the applicant.

This Guideline has been developed, therefore, such that corresponding sections of the PBRER, Development Safety Update Report (DSUR, ICH E2F), and safety specification of a risk management plan (ICH E2E) can be identical in content. (See also Section 1.4, Relation of the PBRER to Other ICH Documents)\n\nObjectives\n\nThe main objective of a PBRER is to present a comprehensive, concise, and critical analysis of new or emerging information on the risks of the medicinal product, and on its benefit in approved indications, to enable an appraisal of the product's overall benefit-risk profile. The PBRER should contain an evaluation of new information relevant to the medicinal product that became available to the MAH during the reporting interval, in the context of cumulative information by:\n\nSummarising relevant new safety information that could have an impact on the benefit-risk profile of the medicinal product;\n\nSummarising any important new efficacy/effectiveness information that has become available during the reporting interval;* Examining whether the information obtained by the MAH during the reporting interval is in accord with previous knowledge of the medicinal product's benefit and risk profile; and\n\nWhere important new safety information has emerged, conducting an integrated benefit-risk evaluation for approved indications.\n\nWhen appropriate, the PBRER should include proposed action(s) to optimise the benefit-risk profile.\n\nUrgent safety information should be reported through the appropriate mechanism; the PBRER is not intended to be used to provide initial notification of significant new safety information or to provide the means by which new safety concerns* are detected.\n\nScope of the PBRER\n\nThe main focus of each PBRER is the evaluation of relevant new safety information from the available data sources,2placed within the context of any pertinent efficacy/effectiveness information that may have become available since the International Birth Date* (IBD), the date of the first marketing approval in any country in the world, or the Development International Birth Date (DIBD), the date of first authorisation for the conduct of an interventional clinical trial in any country.3 All pertinent new safety and efficacy/effectiveness information discovered during the reporting interval3 should be discussed in the appropriate sections of the PBRER.\n\nFootnote 2: For the purpose of this document, the terms “authorisation” and “authorised” refer to clinical trials and the terms “approval” and “approved” refer to marketing applications.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline""

Often, higher risk subgroups and patients with concomitant illnesses that require use of other drugs are excluded from clinical trials, and long-term treatment data are limited. Moreover, patients in trials are closely monitored for evidence of adverse events. In clinical practice, monitoring is less intensive, a broader range of patients are treated (age, co-morbidities, drugs, genetic abnormalities), and events too rare to occur in clinical trials may be observed (e.g., severe liver injury). These factors underlie the need for continuing analysis of relevant safety, efficacy,1 and effectiveness1 information throughout the lifecycle of a medicinal product - promptly, as important findings occur - and periodically - to allow an overall assessment of the accumulating data. Although the majority of new information will be safety-related, new information about effectiveness, limitations of use, alternative treatments, and many other aspects of the drug's place in therapy may be pertinent to its benefit-risk assessment.\n\nFootnote 1: The terms efficacy and effectiveness are not standardised, and have different meanings across some regions. See Section 2.6\n\nThe ICH Guideline E2C, Clinical Safety Data Management: Periodic Safety Update Reports for Marketed Drugs, achieved Step 4 in 1996, and was intended to harmonise the periodic reporting requirements to regulatory authorities and to provide, in a common format, the worldwide interval safety experience of a medicinal product at defined times post-approval. At that time, the focus of the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) was on relevant new safety information in the context of patient exposure, to determine if changes were needed to the Reference Safety Information* (RSI) in order to optimise the continued safe use of the product. The Guideline was revised in 2003, to provide needed clarification, guidance and flexibility.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline""

The Q&As in this document have been endorsed by the ICH Steering Committee at Step 4 of the ICH process, March 2014. At Step 4 of the process, the final draft is recommended for adoption to the regulatory bodies of the European Union, Japan, and North America.\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction (1)2\n\nFootnote 2: Arabic numbers reflect the organizational breakdown of the document endorsed by the ICH Steering Committee at Step 4 of the ICH process, March 2014.\n\nThe ICH guidance E2C(R2) Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER) is intended to be a common standard for periodic benefit-risk evaluation reporting on marketed products among the ICH regions. The ICH E2C(R2) guidance3 introduced new concepts linked to an evolution of the traditional Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) from an interval safety report to a cumulative benefit-risk report. It changed the focus from individual case safety reports to aggregate data evaluation. In addition, the broadened scope increased the need for integrating information within the report.\n\nFootnote 3: The ICH E2C(R2) guidance is available on the FDA Drugs guidance Web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nThe benefits of harmonizing technical requirements can only be achieved if the guidance is implemented and interpreted in a consistent way across the ICH regions. In November 2012, the ICH Steering Committee endorsed the establishment of an Implementation Working Group (IWG) on E2C(R2) to assist with the implementation of the guidance. The ICH E2C(R2) IWG has prepared this question and answer (Q&A) document to support implementation of the guidance in practice. The Q&A document is intended to facilitate practical implementation of the PBRER, including points to consider in addressing some of the more novel aspects of the new periodic safety report.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 General Guidance (2)\n\nHow can a Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) manage the submission of PBRERs when the reporting interval is different across multiple countries or regions?\n\nIn situations where the MAH is preparing PBRERs on both a 6-month and an annual basis for different regulatory authorities, it is possible that a PBRER on a 6-month cycle could be submitted as an up-to-date PBRER containing 12-month interval data (to fulfill the second 6-month interval of an annual cycle) (see Figure 2 below from the E2C(R2) guidance). The same may be true if a product is on a 6-month cycle in one region and a 3-year cycle in another region. However, the MAH should always discuss the acceptability of this approach with the relevant regulatory authority or authorities, noting that this approach is not an attempt to amend local reporting periodicity, but rather an opportunity to use the 12-month document to fulfill the shorter reporting period requirement.\n\nCan Summary Bridging Reports and Addendum Reports still be submitted?\n\nSummary Bridging Reports and Addendum Reports should no longer be submitted when following ICH E2C(R2). Independent of the time interval covered by the report, each PBRER should stand alone and reflect new and cumulative information currently available to the MAH.\n\nWhere in the PBRER can we present information on off-label use of the product?\n\nThe PBRER should report the evaluation of safety information based on all uses of the medicinal product, including uses outside the terms of the reference product information (more commonly known as off-label use). Although the benefit-risk evaluation should be conducted across approved indications, it is critical that the risk\n\nFigure 1: Submission of 6-Month and Annual PBRERsassessment take into account all uses of the product.\n\nSection I.C (1.3) of the E2C(R2) guidance (Scope of the PBRER) indicates that knowledge of a medicinal product's safety that is derived from data associated with uses other than the approved indication(s) should be reflected in the discussion of risk evaluation when it is available, relevant, and appropriate. Examples of potential sources of information on use outside the approved indication include, but are not limited to, spontaneous adverse event reports, investigator-initiated clinical trials, drug utilization data/studies, and published literature.\n\nSpecific information relating to off-label use can be included in the following sections of the PBRER:\n\nSection III.E.2 (3.5.2) (Cumulative and Interval Patient Exposure from Marketing Experience), paragraph c (Other post-approval use) The MAH should provide a brief description of patterns of use considered relevant for interpretation of safety data. This can include information on off-label use, including whether or not such use is supported by clinical guidelines, clinical trial evidence, or an absence of approved alternative treatments. For purposes of identifying patterns of use outside the terms of the reference product information, the MAH should use the appropriate sections (e.g., approved indication(s), contraindication(s)) of the reference product information that was in effect at the Data Lock Point (DLP) of the PBRER. See question 6.1of this Q&A document for points to consider in selecting the reference product information document.\n\nSections III.O (3.15) (Overview of Signals: New, Ongoing, or Closed) and III.P (3.16) (Signal and Risk Evaluation) The MAH should include in these sections the signals and risks arising from all uses of the product.\n\nSection III.R.2 (3.18.2) (Benefit-Risk Analysis Evaluation) Although the evaluation of benefit should be limited to approved use (see section III.Q (3.17) of the E2C(R2) guidance), the overall benefit-risk evaluation should take into account the risks associated with all uses of the product.\n\nWhat information sources could be used in preparing a PBRER?\n\nThe MAH should prepare the PBRER on the active substance(s) using data that the MAH might reasonably have access to and that are relevant to the evaluation of the safety or benefit-risk profile. Compared to the product for which the MAH is the innovator, there may be less information available to the MAH on a generic product. For example, only a published report may be accessible for a clinical trial not sponsored by the MAH. The MAH can consider providing as an appendix to the report a list of the information sources used to prepare the PBRER (see Appendix E of the E2C(R2) guidance).\n\nIII Modular Format (3)\n\nThe modular format of the PBRER facilitates using information from other regulatory documents. How can information be reused when the other documents do not share the same DLP?\n\nIf the regulatory documents are written at different times, it may not always be possible to reuse sections, because the information may change from one period to another. For example, this can occur when the PBRER is on a 6-month cycle and the Development Safety Update Report (DSUR) is on an annual cycle. Some of the information from the 6-month PBRER could be used as a basis for populating some of the sections covering interval information in the annual DSUR. Appendix D of the E2C(R2) guidance lists the PBRER sections that can be shared with other regulatory documents.\n\nWhat practical points should the MAH consider to coordinate preparing DSURs and PBRERs?\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C(R2) Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report – Questions and Answers""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , What efficacy/effectiveness information should be presented in section 17.1 (Important Baseline Efficacy/Effectiveness Information) of the PBRER?\n--------------------\nContext: Relation of the PBRER to Other ICH Documents\n\nAt present, some ICH countries and regions accept submission of separate types of periodic reports to fulfil national and regional requirements within the post-approval period: the PSUR (ICH Guideline E2C(R1)) for periodic reporting of the safety of approved medicinal products, the DSUR (ICH Guideline E2F) for periodic reporting on the safety of medicinal products that remain in clinical development, and the safety specification component of ICH Guideline E2E that might be submitted at the time of marketing application and/or PSUR submission to aid in the planning of pharmacovigilance activities. As these documents have different regulatory purposes, different periodicities, and can be reviewed by different divisions within a single regulatory authority, each document needs to be complete in its own right - a comprehensive document that can stand alone.\n\nNevertheless, overlap and inconsistencies between the content of the DSUR, PSUR, and safety specification can lead to inefficiencies in the production of the documents by the MAH.\n\nModular Approach\n\nThis Guideline aims to facilitate flexibility by encouraging the use of individual sections that are common to more than one report - ""modules"" that can be used for different regulatory authorities and for different purposes. Therefore, the PBRER has been developed in such a way that the content of several sections may be used for sections of other documents as a basis for a modular approach. For example, if the DIBD of a DSUR for a medicinal product is aligned to the IBD of the PBRER for the same product as suggested in ICH E2F, the content of a number of sections of the DSUR can also be used in the PBRER when the Data Lock Points (DLPs) are the same, i.e., when each report covers an interval of one year based on the IBD.\n\nAppendix D of this Guideline lists the PBRER sections that can be shared with either the DSUR (ICH E2F) or safety specification of a risk management plan (ICH E2E), if appropriate.\n\nThe use of common sections across the PBRER, DSUR and safety specification as a modular approach has a number of advantages:\n\nMaximizes the utility of the modules across multiple regulatory documents;\n\nPromotes consistency across the PBRER, DSUR and safety specification;\n\nAvoids unnecessary duplication of effort;\n\nIs expected to improve efficiency for MAHs in the preparation of these documents;\n\nFacilitates flexible utilisation of existing sections (modules) when, for example, the PBRER covers different time intervals or needs to be submitted at different times to multiple different authorities. In these circumstances, only modules that include new information or new evaluation would need to be updated when submitting the PBRER.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline']","['In addition to the guidance provided in section III.Q.1 (3.17.1) of the E2C(R2) guidance, the MAH may wish to consider the following points when presenting efficacy/effectiveness information in section 17.1 of the PBRER.\n\n_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nThe MAH should present any efficacy/effectiveness information on approved indications that is relevant and supports the characterization of benefit presented in section 17.3 of the PBRER.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance outlines FDA\'s regulatory approach for approval of Class III in vitro diagnostic devices, as well as certain licensed1 or certain cleared2 in vitro diagnostic devices in cases, when a previously approved, licensed, or cleared assay is migrating (i.e., transitioning) to another system for which assay performance has not been evaluated by FDA.2 In this guidance the term ""new system"" refers to the system (assay, instrument, and software) to which the assay is migrating from a previously approved/licensed/cleared system. The term ""old system"" refers to the system (assay, instrument and software) which was approved/licensed/cleared from which the assay is migrating to a currently unapproved/unlicensed/uncleared system.\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance does not apply to immunohematology tests licensed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance can be used for 510(k) devices where the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy (http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm) does not apply (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests) and devices for which transitioning to a new system presents specific concerns, either because of the nature of the analyte and indications, or because of the specific technology used.\n\nThis guidance is focused on the study designs and performance criteria that should be fulfilled in order for a sponsor to utilize the migration study approach in support of the change. FDA will review information from the sponsor, including results of analytical and comparison studies outlined in this guidance, as well as device descriptions and risk analyses, to determine whether the use of the approved/licensed/cleared assay with the new system may compromise safety and effectiveness of the assay. The guidance document describes information that we recommend you include in a PMA (premarket approval application) supplement, a BLA (Biologicals License Application) supplement, or a 510(k) (premarket notification). For devices regulated by OIR (Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health, within CDRH), sponsors may contact OIR, and for those regulated by CBER, sponsors may contact CBER to obtain feedback concerning study plans.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe FDA believes that the assay migration study paradigm discussed in this guidance provides a least burdensome scientific and regulatory pathway for manufacturers to transfer a previously approved or licensed assay with full clinical data from an old system to a new system (not approved. licensed, or cleared). The paradigm is suitable in cases when sufficient knowledge can be derived from the documentation of design controls, risk analyses, and prior performance studies on an old system.\n\nIf you make further modifications or iterations of the old or new system you should compare back to the original old system that has full clinical data when performing new migration studies. However, if the old system with full clinical data is no longer available please contact the appropriate FDA CDRH or CBER Division for further discussion.\n\nThe migration studies approach is related to the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy that FDA uses for many Class I and Class II diagnostic devices.3 Similar to that policy, migration studies rest on the premise that as platform changes are made throughout the lifetime of an approved, licensed, or cleared assay, smaller and more focused analytical and clinical data sets, along with prior knowledge of device design and performance, could allow for a determination that the safety and effectiveness profile of the modified system has not been compromised.\n\nFootnote 3: http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm.\n\nThe assay migration study paradigm is practical, risk based, and consistent with FDA\'s Critical Path Initiative, which is intended to help bring new medical products to market successfully and efficiently4. FDA believes that with proper control and review, migration studies will meet regulatory thresholds for premarket review in a manner that will be least burdensome for both companies and FDA while protecting public health.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThis guidance is intended to be applied, where appropriate, to licensed donor screening tests5 and approved (Class III) in vitro diagnostic assays, as well as 510(k) cleared assays for which migration to a new system presents concerns. Possible scenarios for assay migration are when the assay is being transferred from a manual system to an automated or semi-automated instrument system or from a semi-automated instrument system to a fully automated instrument system, or from one automated instrument system to another (and vice versa for all scenarios). A broad variety of methodologies may use the migration studies paradigm depending on what is known about the two Systems involved. Assay transfer may be from one approved, licensed, or cleared old system to a new system that has the same technical characteristics. However, if scientific evidence suggests migration studies may not be adequate to predict actual clinical testing performance on the new system, the assay migration paradigm should not apply and FDA will recommend that traditional evaluation studies be performed.\n\nFootnote 5: FDA does not believe that this guidance is suitable for use in its entirety when immunohematology tests (e.g., blood grouping, blood group antibody detection and/or identification, crossmatching) are being migrated because of the differences in assay methodology and results reading and interpretation as compared to the other assays and systems described in this guidance. If you believe that your immunohematology reagents and system can be evaluated using the criteria outlined in this guidance, contact the responsible review division in CBER. Immunohematology products are reviewed in the Devices Review Branch, Division of Blood Applications, Office of Blood Research and Review, CBER.\n\nAssay migration studies are ideally suited for test systems for which the assay output (raw signal) is a numeric result or is expressed as a signal to cutoff (S/CO). Devices for which a numeric output is not available might be more difficult to analyze and may not be suitable candidates for use of this approach.\n\nMigration studies would not be applicable to the following devices or to system changes that are generally considered significant, such as:\n\nsystems intended for over-the-counter use,\n\nsystems intended for prescription home use, or\n\ndevices that do not meet the Critical Considerations criteria stated below.\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'

The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. Introduction\n\n1. What is the purpose of this guidance document and how does it differ from other guidance documents related to IVD products?\n\nFDA prepared this comprehensive document as a resource for you and for its own staff to address issues concerning IVD studies. This guidance document contains information relevant to studies conducted during the development of a new IVD product, as well as other general considerations about applicable requirements and marketing of the new device. It addresses particularly those investigational studies that are exempt from the majority of requirements under 21 CFR Part 812. IVD study investigators and members of IRBs who review and approve such studiesmay also find it helpful. There are also device-specific guidance documents available for specific IVD products that can be found at\n\nhttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfggp/search.cfm. The use of\n\ninvestigational IVD devices in clinical studies designed to evaluate new drug products falls outside the scope of this guidance.\n\n2 Why are in vitro diagnostics considered devices?\n\nIn vitro diagnostics (IVDs) meet the definition of a device under the Act. Section 201(h) of the Act defines a device as:\n\n""an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or accessory, which is--\n\n(1) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United\n\nStates Pharmacopeia, or any supplement to them,\n\n(2) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions,\n\nor in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in\n\nman or other animals, or\n\n(3) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of\n\nman or other animals, and\n\nwhich does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical\n\naction within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not\n\ndependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary\n\nintended purposes."" 21 U.S.C. 321(h) (emphasis added).\n\n3 How do IVD devices differ from other devices?\n\nMost other devices function on or in a patient. In contrast, IVDs include products\n\nused to collect specimens, or to prepare or examine specimens (e.g., blood, serum, urine, spinal fluid, tissue samples) after they are removed from the human body.\n\n4 Which Divisions at FDA are responsible for review of IVD products?\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)\n\n({}^{\\star}) Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety (OIVD)\n\n({}^{\\star}) Division of Chemistry and Toxicology Devices - Phone: (301) 796-5470\n\n({}^{\\star}) Division of Immunology and Hematology Devices - Phone: (301) 796-5481\n\n({}^{\\star}) Division of Microbiology Devices - Phone: (301) 796-5461\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\n({}^{\\star}) Office of Cell, Tissues, and Gene Therapy (OCTGT) - Phone: (301) 827-5102\n\n({}^{\\star}) Office of Blood Research and Review (OBRR)\n\n({}^{\\star}) Division of Blood Applications (DBA) - Phone: (301) 827-3524DBA schedules all review-related meetings for OBRR\n\n(\\bullet)Division of Emerging and Transfusion Transmitted Diseases\n\n(DETTD) - Phone: (301) 827-3008\n\n(\\bullet)Division of Hematology (DH) - Phone: (301) 496-4396\n\n5.

General Regulatory Issues\n\n1. Which regulations contain provisions relevant to the IVD industry?\n\nListed below are some of the regulations that implement the Act and that are relevant to IVDs covered by this guidance. See Table 1 (Appendix 1) for additional information. This is not an all-inclusive list.\n\nTitle 21, Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR)\n\nPart 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures\n\nPart 50, Protection of Human SubjectsPart 54, Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators\n\nPart 56, Institutional Review Boards\n\nPart 801, Labeling\n\nPart 803, Medical Device Reporting\n\nPart 807, Establishment Registration and Device Listing for\n\nManufacturers and Initial Importers of Devices\n\nPart 809, In Vitro Diagnostic Products for Human Use\n\nPart 810, Medical Device Recall Authority\n\nPart 812, Investigational Device Exemptions\n\nPart 814, Premarket Approval of Medical Devices\n\nPart 820, Quality System Regulation\n\nPart 860, Medical Device Classification Procedures\n\nPart 862, Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices\n\nPart 864, Hematology and Pathology Devices\n\nPart 866, Immunology and Microbiology Devices\n\nIn addition, certain sections of Part 610 apply to devices that employ\n\nhuman blood components.

How do I determine the applicability of the IDE regulation to my IVD study?\n\nWe recommend that you begin with the exemptions in 21 CFR 812.2(c). Your\n\nproposed IVD study is exempt from most provisions of the IDE regulation if it fits any one of the following three categories:\n\na. The IVD is a pre-amendments device (i.e., a device that was in\n\ncommercial distribution prior to the enactment of the 1976 Medical\n\nDevice Amendments to the Act), other than a transitional device (see the\n\nGlossary for definition), and is used or investigated according to the\n\nindications in the labeling at that time.\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the ""Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies"" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: 1. Which regulations contain provisions relevant to the IVD industry?\n\nListed below are some of the regulations that implement the Act and that are relevant to IVDs covered by this guidance. See Table 1 (Appendix 1) for additional information. This is not an all-inclusive list.\n\nTitle 21, Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR)\n\nPart 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures\n\nPart 50, Protection of Human SubjectsPart 54, Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators\n\nPart 56, Institutional Review Boards\n\nPart 801, Labeling\n\nPart 803, Medical Device Reporting\n\nPart 807, Establishment Registration and Device Listing for\n\nManufacturers and Initial Importers of Devices\n\nPart 809, In Vitro Diagnostic Products for Human Use\n\nPart 810, Medical Device Recall Authority\n\nPart 812, Investigational Device Exemptions\n\nPart 814, Premarket Approval of Medical Devices\n\nPart 820, Quality System Regulation\n\nPart 860, Medical Device Classification Procedures\n\nPart 862, Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices\n\nPart 864, Hematology and Pathology Devices\n\nPart 866, Immunology and Microbiology Devices\n\nIn addition, certain sections of Part 610 apply to devices that employ\n\nhuman blood components. For example:\n\n610.40, Test Requirements (Testing Requirements for Communicable\n\nDisease Agents)\n\n610.42, Restrictions on Use for Further Manufacture of Medical Devices\n\n2. How do I determine the applicability of the IDE regulation to my IVD study?\n\nWe recommend that you begin with the exemptions in 21 CFR 812.2(c). Your\n\nproposed IVD study is exempt from most provisions of the IDE regulation if it fits any one of the following three categories:\n\na. The IVD is a pre-amendments device (i.e., a device that was in\n\ncommercial distribution prior to the enactment of the 1976 Medical\n\nDevice Amendments to the Act), other than a transitional device (see the\n\nGlossary for definition), and is used or investigated according to the\n\nindications in the labeling at that time.\n\nb. The IVD is a device, other than a transitional device, that has been\n\nfound to be substantially equivalent to a pre-amendments device and is\n\nused or investigated according to the indications in the labeling reviewed\n\nby FDA in determining substantial equivalence.\n\nc. The IVD\n\n({}^{\\star}) is properly labeled in accordance with 21 CFR 809.10(c);\n\n({}^{\\star}) is noninvasive (see question #5 below);\n\n({}^{\\star}) does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents\n\nsignificant risk (see question #4 below);\n\n({}^{\\star}) does not by design or intention introduce energy into a subject;\n\nand(\\bullet) is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure (see question # 6 below).\n\nFor your study to be exempt from most of the requirements of the IDE regulation under this third category, it must meet all of the conditions listed in ""c"" above. (See also the decision tree in Appendix 1.) You should refer to 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 for applicable requirements relating to IRBs and informed consent, including for device studies that meet the criteria described in 21 CFR 812.2(c). Additionally, investigators for those studies are still subject to 21 CFR 812.119 (the provision entitled ""Disqualification of a clinical investigator."")\n\nIf your proposed study does not fit into one of the three categories listed above, you, the sponsor, must have an approved IDE (21 CFR 812.2) before you may begin your investigation, including any shipment of your investigational IVD. (Note: A device that is approved under a premarket approval application (PMA) or cleared under a 510(k) and then used in a study in accordance with the approved or cleared labeling is not investigational and, therefore, is not subject to the IDE regulation.)\n\nThe requirements for an IDE depend on the level of risk that the study presents to subjects.\n\nFor a significant risk device (see the Glossary for definition), the sponsor must apply to FDA for an IDE approval (see 21 CFR 812.1, 812.20). For a non-significant risk device (see the Glossary for definition), the sponsor must meet the abbreviated requirements of 21 CFR 812.2(b), including review and approval of the investigation by an institutional review board (IRB) and compliance with informed consent requirements. A non-significant risk study is considered to have an approved IDE when the abbreviated requirements are met.\n\nNote: The requirements of the ""Protection of Human Subjects"" and ""Institutional Review Boards"" regulations (21 CFR Parts 50 and 56) apply to all clinical investigations regulated by FDA under section 520(g) of the Act, as well as other clinical investigations that support applications for research or marketing permits. (21 CFR 50.1, 56.101; see also Section V, Human Subject Protection, of this guidance.) Therefore, all studies of investigational IVDs that will support applications to FDA are subject to 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, even if they are not subject to most requirements of 21 CFR Part 812.\n\n3. How do I determine if the study is a significant or non-significant risk study under 21 CFR 812.2(b)?A significant risk IVD device is generally one that is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to health, safety, or welfare of a subject. 21 CFR 812.3(m).\n\nFor IVDs, we interpret ""potential for serious risk"" in relation to the nature of the harm that may result to the subject. Misdiagnosis and/or error in treatment caused by inaccurate test results would be considered a significant risk if the potential harm to the subject could be life-threatening, or could result in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to the body structure.\n\nFalse positive results can lead to unnecessary confirmatory testing, unnecessary treatment that can be invasive or have harmful side effects, and/or unnecessary psychological trauma when serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions are involved. False negative results can lead to a delay in establishing the correct diagnosis, failure to start or continue needed treatment, false security that may prevent timely follow-up and retesting, and contribute to the potential spread of infectious agents to others. If the potential risk does not rise to the level described above, the study is not considered to pose a significant risk. FDA recommends the sponsor consider all these factors when determining the risk associated with your investigational IVD. (See 21 CFR 812.3(m) and also ""Information Sheet Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors,"" available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/Guida\n\nncesInformationSheetsandNotices/ucm113709.htm, particularly the one on\n\n""Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Devices"" at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo\n\ncuments/ucm126622.htm.)\n\nHow do I determine if an invasive sampling technique presents a significant risk under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3)?\n\nTo determine whether an invasive sampling technique presents a serious risk, we recommend that you base your risk determination on the nature of the harm that may result from sampling. For example, FDA considers sampling techniques that require biopsy of a major organ, use of general anesthesia, or placement of a blood access line into an artery or large vein (subclavian, femoral, or iliac) to present a significant risk.\n\n5 What does noninvasive mean?\n\nA noninvasive device is one that does not, by design or intention:\n\na. penetrate or pierce the skin or mucous membranes of the body, the ocular cavity, or the urethra; or b. enter the ear beyond the external auditory canal, the nose beyond the nares, the mouth beyond the pharynx, the anal canal beyond the rectum, or the vagina beyond the cervical os.\n\n(21 CFR 812.3(k)).\n\nBlood sampling that involves simple venipuncture is considered noninvasive, and the use of surplus samples of body fluids or tissues that are left over from samples taken for noninvestigational purposes is also considered noninvasive (21 CFR 812.3(k)).\n\n6. What does it mean to have ""confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure?""\n\nFor an investigational study to be exempt under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3), clinical investigators must use a medically established means of diagnosis (e.g., another cleared or approved IVD or culture) of the disease or condition as the basis for decisions regarding treatment of all subjects participating in the study. 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3)(iv). Additionally, test results from the exempt IVD investigation should not influence patient treatment or clinical management decisions before the diagnosis is established by a medically established product or procedure.\n\nIf an investigational test uses a new technology or represents a significant technological advance, established diagnostic products or procedures may not be adequate to confirm the diagnosis provided by the investigational IVD. For example, if an investigational test is designed to identify an infection at the earliest stages of viral infection (before formation of antibodies), established diagnostic products or procedures that rely on the detection of antibodies to the virus would be inadequate to confirm diagnoses. Under these conditions the study would not meet the criteria for exemption under 812.2(c)(3) since the testing could not be confirmed with a medically established diagnostic product or procedure. You may consider whether the device is a non-significant risk device subject to abbreviated IDE requirements (21 CFR 812.2(b)).\n\n7. What if no medically established means for diagnosing the disease or condition exists?\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the ""Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies"" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 16: 21 CFR 812.20(a)(4)(i); 21 CFR 56.103(a); 21 CFR 50.24\n\n(See also Question 10.)\n\nMay studies involving in vitro diagnostic devices be conducted under 21 CFR 50.24?\n\nYes. An in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) study may be conducted provided that it meets the requirements of 21 CFR 50.24. IVD studies falling within the scope of section 50.24 would include, for example, studies in which diagnosis of a life-threatening condition cannot be confirmed by an approved product or well-established procedure (e.g., research involving an investigational test for a neurotoxin that when inhaled or in contact with skin, can cause patients to become sick within minutes, and at high doses, to lose consciousness, develop seizures and die). The regulation\'s use of language usually associated with therapeutic products does not exclude IVDs because the administration of therapy in a life-threatening situation can depend upon a diagnostic intervention. Sponsors should contact FDA if they have questions as to whether a particular IVD study may be conducted under 21 CFR 50.24.\n\nWill FDA accept data from emergency research studies conducted at non-US sites?\n\nYes, provided appropriate regulatory requirements are satisfied. For drug/biological drug studies, if the non-U.S. sites are under an IND, all 21 CFR 50.24 requirements must be met, as well as other provisions of 21 CFR Part 312.\n\nIf the sites operate as non-IND sites, but the data are included in a marketing application, then 21 CFR 312.120 would apply. 21 CFR 312.120(a)(1)(i) ""does not require informed consent in life-threatening situations when the [International Ethics Committee] reviewing the study finds, before initiation of the study, that informed consent is not feasible and either that the conditions present are consistent with those described in SS50.23 or SS50.24(a)...or that the measures described in the study protocol or elsewhere will protect the rights, safety, and well-being of subjects..."" FDA will accept data from non-IND emergency research studies/sites provided the emergency research is conducted in accordance with both internationally accepted standards for good clinical practice (e.g., ICH E6) and applicable national laws.\n\nFor devices, under 21 CFR 814.15(b), FDA will accept foreign studies submitted in support of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application if the data are valid and the investigator has conducted the studies in conformance with the ""Declaration of Helsinki"" or the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever accords greater protection to the human subjects.\n\nNote that some countries\' laws may allow expedited appointment of legally acceptable representatives17 (e.g., judge, independent physician), who can provide consent, removing the need to waive informed consent. (See 21 CFR 312.120 and 814.15 for FDA\'s requirements for acceptance of data from non-US studies that are not conducted under an IND or IDE, respectively.)\n\nFootnote 17: FDA’s regulations define the term, “legally authorized representative” as “an individual or judicial or other body authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject to the subject’s participation in the procedure(s) involved in the research.” ICH E6 defines the term “legally acceptable representative” in almost identical language. See ICH E6, 1.37\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm073122.pdf).\n\n19. Must studies conducted under 21 CFR 50.24 be registered?\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA)18, Title VIII, Section 801 mandates that a ""responsible party"" (i.e., the sponsor or designated principal investigator) register an applicable clinical trial in the registry database, Clinicaltrials.gov,19 and defines an ""applicable clinical trial.""20 In addition, the statute describes the responsible party\'s obligation to report results of certain ""applicable clinical trials.""21 Results must be reported if the trial conducted under 21 CFR 50.24 meets the criteria for an ""applicable clinical trial"" as described at ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\nFootnote 18: U.S. Public Law 110-85\n\nFootnote 19: http://clinicaltrials.gov\n\nFootnote 20: http://grants.nih.gov/ClinicalTrials fdaaa/definitions.htm\n\nII. Qualifications for a study to be conducted under 21 CFR 50.24\n\n20. What conditions must be present for a study to be eligible to be conducted under 21 CFR 50.24?\n\nAll of the following conditions must be present:\n\nThe human subjects are in a life-threatening situation that necessitates urgent intervention;\n\nAvailable treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory (See also Questions 23, 24, and 25);\n\nCollection of valid scientific evidence is necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of the intervention;\n\nObtaining informed consent is not feasible because the subjects are not able to give their informed consent as a result of their medical condition;\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe intervention must be administered before consent can be obtained from the subject\'s legally authorized representative;\n\nThere is no reasonable way to identify prospectively individuals likely to become eligible for participation;\n\nParticipation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects (See also Question 21); and\n\nThe clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver (See also Question 29).\n\n(See Appendix A for the complete text of 21 CFR 50.24.)\n\n2.2.2 What is meant by ""prospect of direct benefit""?\n\nThe information from animal and preclinical studies, other clinical data (e.g., use of the product in another setting or for another diagnosis or in a different study population) or other evidence should support the potential for the investigational product to provide a direct benefit to the individual subjects.\n\nUnder 21 CFR 50.24(a)(3), the IRB must find and document that participation in an emergency research study holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects because\n\n(1) the subjects are in a life-threatening situation that necessitates intervention;\n\n(2) information from appropriate animal and other preclinical studies support the potential for the intervention to provide a direct benefit to the individual subjects; and\n\n(3) the risks associated with the investigation are reasonable in relation to what is known about the medical condition of the potential class of subjects, the risks and benefits of standard therapy, if any, and what is known about the risks and benefits of the proposed intervention or activity.\n\n2.2.3 Are trials with morbidity endpoints allowed under this regulation?\n\nTrials that have morbidity endpoints (e.g., multiple organ failure free days), rather than mortality endpoints, can meet the requirements of 21 CFR 50.24(a)(3) if the study is evaluating severe morbidity that is closely associated with mortality, and therefore clinically relevant. For example, patients with stroke or head injury are at risk of both death and severe disability. A study of an intervention to improve stroke outcome would always consider survival, but could also examine functional status, which might be the primary endpoint of the trial.22 Similarly, a study intended to improve treatment of status epilepticus, a life-threatening condition, might focus on reduced time to seizure control, a benefit likely to affect survival, even if the study itself is not large enough to show improved survival.\n\nFootnote 22: 61 Fed. Reg. 51508 (Comment #38)\n\nFDA recognizes that it may be important to obtain preliminary information on dose tolerability or effect on a critical biomarker (e.g., measurement of brain infarcted area, degree and extent of acidosis) before proceeding to a study that evaluates effectiveness. Considered from the point of view of the individual study subject, the study intervention could hold out the prospect of direct benefit even if the overall study were not large enough to prove this. Such a study would be acceptable only if it could not be done in subjects capable of consenting, and all the other requirements of 21 CFR 50.24 are satisfied. In suchcases, FDA would expect sponsors to provide a clear rationale for conducting these studies in non-consenting subjects.\n\nFDA will consider all proposed morbidity endpoints on a case-by-case basis. Early discussions with the appropriate FDA review divisions are encouraged.\n\nWhat is meant by ""available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory""?\n\n21 CFR 50.24(a)(1) requires IRBs to document that ""available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory..."" For studies involving drugs, FDA has interpreted the term ""available therapy"" to mean therapy that is specified in the approved labeling of regulated products, with only rare exceptions. For example, a treatment that is not FDA-regulated (e.g., surgery) or a drug that is not labeled for a specific use but which is nevertheless supported by compelling evidence in the medical literature23 may be considered an ""available treatment.""\n\nFootnote 23: See Guidance for Industry, “Available Therapy”\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126637.pdf ) issued July 2004, by CBER and CDER.\n\nFor studies conducted under 21 CFR 50.24, sponsors, investigators, and IRBs should consider the following:\n\nWhat is the current ""standard of care""?\n\nWhat treatments are available?\n\nAre available treatments (including standard of care treatments) ""unproven""? (See also Question 24)\n\nIf a product is not approved, but widely used, could a study be done to support approval?\n\nAre available treatments unsatisfactory, and if so, how? (See also Question 25)\n\nWhat is meant by ""unproven""?\n\nIn general, ""unproven"" means that there is not substantial evidence that a treatment is effective for the condition of interest. This may reflect the absence of any data or the absence of studies of acceptable quality. The term ""unproven therapy"" includes:\n--------------------\nContext title: Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'

Securing compliance of all investigators in accordance with the signed investigator\'s agreement, the investigational plan, the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812 or other applicable FDA regulations, or any condition of approval imposed by the reviewing IRB or FDA. If compliance cannot be secured, use of the device by the investigator and the investigator\'s participation in the investigation must be discontinued.\n\nb. Evaluating all unanticipated adverse device effects and terminating the investigation, or portions of it, as soon as possible if that effect presents an unreasonable risk to subjects (Reporting requirements are listed below.)\n\nc. Resuming terminated investigations only after IRB and/or FDA approvals are obtained, as required by this regulation.\n\n4 Controlling Distribution and Disposition of Devices that are Shipped\n\nAlthough investigators are responsible for ensuring that investigational devices are made available only to persons who are legally authorized to receive them (see 21 CFR 812.110(c)), sponsors also bear responsibility for taking proper measures to ensure that devices are not diverted outside of legally authorized channels. Sponsors may ship investigational devices only to qualified investigators participating in the clinical investigation (21 CFR 812.43(b)). Sponsors must also maintain complete, current, and accurate records pertaining to the shipment and disposition of the investigational device (21 CFR 812.140(b)(2)). Records of shipment shall include the name and address of the consignee, type and quantity of device, date of shipment, and batch number or code mark. Records of disposition shall describe the batch number or code marks of any devices returned to the sponsor, repaired, or disposed of in other ways by the investigator or another person, and the reasons for and method of disposal.\n\nTo further ensure compliance with these requirements, sponsors should take appropriate measures to instruct investigators regarding their responsibilities with respect to recordkeeping and device disposition. The specific recordkeeping requirements for investigators are set forth at 21 CFR 812.140(a). Upon completion or termination of a clinical investigation (or the investigator\'s part of an investigation), or at the sponsor\'s request, an investigator is required to return to the sponsor any remaining supply of the device or otherwise to dispose of the device as the sponsor directs (21 CFR 812.110(e)).\n\n5. Prohibition of Promotion and Other Practices (21 CFR 812.7)\n\nThe IDE regulation prohibits the promotion and commercialization of a device that has not been first cleared or approved for marketing by FDA. This prohibition is applicable to sponsors and investigators (or any person acting on behalf of a sponsor or investigator), and encompasses the following activities:\n\na. Promotion or test marketing of the investigational device\n\nb. Charging subjects or investigators for the device a price larger than is necessary to recover the costs of manufacture, research, development, and handling\n\nc. Unduly prolonging an investigation beyond the point needed to collect data required to determine whether the device is safe and effective, and\n\nd. Representing that the device is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is being investigated.\n\n6. Supplemental Applications (21 CFR 812.35(a) and (b))\n\nSupplemental applications are required to be submitted to, and approved by, FDA in the following situations:\n\na. Changes in the investigational plan: FDA approval is required for any change that may affect the scientific soundness of the investigation or the rights, safety or welfare of the subjects. IRB approval is also required for changes that may affect the rights, safety or welfare of the subjects. The change in the investigational plan may not be implemented until FDA approval (and IRB approval, if required) is obtained.\n\nb. Addition of new institutions: IRB approval is also required for new institutions.\n\nThe investigation at the new institution(s) may not begin until both FDA and IRB approval(s) are obtained, and certification of IRB approval is submitted to FDA.\n\n7. Maintaining Records (21 CFR 812.140(b))\n\nA sponsor shall maintain the following accurate, complete, and current records relating to an investigation (also See Table I, next page):\n\na. Correspondence (including reports) with another sponsor, monitor, investigators, an IRB or FDA\n\nb. Records of any shipment, including:\n\n(1) name and address of consignee\n\n(2) type and quantity of device(3) date of shipment\n\n(4) batch numbers or code marks\n\n(5) Records of disposition, describing:\n\n(1) Batch number or code mark of devices returned, repaired, or disposed of by the investigator or other persons,\n\n(2) Reasons for and method of disposal\n\n(6) Ad.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the ""Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies"" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. Scope\n\nThis document applies only to IVD device investigations regulated by FDA in accordance with section 520(g) of Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 USC 360j(g), that are exempt from most requirements of the IDE regulation (21 CFR 812) under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3), and that use leftover specimens that are not individually identifiable. A leftover specimen is the remnant of a human specimen collected for routine clinical care or analysis that would otherwise have been discarded. A specimen is not individually identifiable when the identity of the subject is not known to or may not readily be ascertained by the investigator or any other individuals associated with the investigation, including the sponsor. (See Section 4, below.) This guidance also applies to specimens that were previously collected for other unrelated research and that are not individually identifiable.\n\nThis guidance will be implemented on the date it is issued. It applies to investigations using leftover specimens that are already existing on the date the guidance is issued and investigations using specimens that will be collected after the issuance of this guidance, so long as both the specimens and the investigations meet the circumstances outlined below (see section 4).\n\nIII. Background\n\nFDA\'s investigational device regulations are intended to encourage the development of new, useful devices in a manner that is consistent with public health and safety and with ethical standards. (See 21 U.S.C. 360j(g)). Investigators should have freedom to pursue the least burdensome means of accomplishing this goal. However, to ensure that the balance is maintained between product development and the protection of public health and safety and ethical standards, FDA has established human subject protection regulations addressing requirements for informed consent and IRB review that apply to all FDA-regulated clinical investigations involving human subjects. In particular, informed consent requirements further both safety and ethical considerations by allowing potential subjects to consider both the physical and privacy risks they face if they agree to participate in a trial.\n\nUnder FDA regulations, clinical investigations using human specimens conducted in support of premarket submissions to FDA are considered human subject investigations [see 21 CFR 812.3(p)]. Many IVD studies are exempt from most provisions of 21 CFR part 812, Investigational Device Exemptions, under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3), but FDA\'s regulations for the protection of human subjects (21 CFR parts 50 and 56) apply to all clinical investigations that are regulated by FDA [see 21 CFR 50.1; 21 CFR 56.1; 21 U.S.C. 360j(g)(3)(A) & (D)].\n\nFDA does have narrow exceptions from the general requirements of informed consent for certain emergency and military research,5 but FDA regulations do not contain exceptions from the requirements of informed consent on the grounds that the specimens are not identifiable and or that they are remnants of human specimens collected for routine clinical care or analysis thatwould otherwise have been discarded. Nor do FDA regulations allow IRBs to decide whether or not to waive informed consent for research involving leftover or unidentifiable specimens.\n\nLeftover specimens are frequently used in feasibility studies and studies to characterize the performance of new in vitro diagnostic devices for several reasons. The evaluation of new devices often requires the use of specimens with specific laboratory characteristics, e.g., positive or negative for a particular disease marker, in order to meet the study inclusion criteria. Routine clinical care testing can provide information about the laboratory characteristics of the specimen that permit investigators to quickly ascertain whether the specimen will meet the study inclusion criteria. The remnants of these specimens thus become valuable to research at a point when they are of no value to the patient and are ready to be discarded. The lower cost of these specimens, compared to the cost of specimens collected prospectively for research, makes studies using leftover specimens more affordable, permitting manufacturers to conduct studies that otherwise may not be done. In addition, banked leftover specimens are a source for unique and possibly rare specimens in sufficient quantity to permit the rapid completion of investigations that would be difficult if not impossible to conduct in a reasonable timeframe without these specimens.\n\nFDA believes that it is possible in certain circumstances for IVD device investigations to be conducted using leftover specimens obtained without informed consent while protecting the human subjects who are the source of such specimens. When IVD study sponsors use leftover specimens for which the subject cannot be identified and where results of the investigational test are not communicated to or otherwise associated with the identified subject, concerns associated with privacy are minimized. In addition, these studies do not pose new medical risks to subjects from whom the specimens were originally collected: Any risks from specimen collection were incurred prior to the involvement of the patient as a subject in an investigation, when the specimen was obtained for the patient\'s own clinical needs, and no risks from erroneous test results are presented because the results of the testing are not used for clinical management of the subject. Like leftover specimens that have been collected for routine clinical care, the investigational use of leftover specimens previously collected for other research purposes involves no additional medical risk, and privacy risks are mitigated by limiting the applicability of this guidance to specimens that are not identifiable.\n\nIV In what circumstances does FDA intend to exercise enforcement discretion as to the requirements for informed consent for use of specimens in FDAregulated IVD studies?\n\nFDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion as to the informed consent requirements for clinical investigators, sponsors, and IRBs if an in vitro diagnostic device investigation is performed and all of the following are true:\n\nThe investigation meets the IDE exemption criteria at 21 CFR 812.2(c) [(3)].\n\nThe study uses leftover specimens, that is, remnants of specimens collected for routine clinical care or analysis that would have been discarded. The study may also use specimens obtained from specimen repositories or leftover specimens that were previously collected for other research purposes.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe specimens are not individually identifiable, i.e., the identity of the subject is not known to and may not readily be ascertained by the investigator or any other individuals associated with the investigation, including the sponsor. If the specimen is coded,6 it will be considered to be not individually identifiable if neither the investigator(s) nor any other individuals associated with the investigation or the sponsor can link the specimen to the subject from whom the specimen was collected, either directly or indirectly through coding systems. Footnote 6: For the purposes of this document, coded means that: 1) a number, letter, symbol, or combination thereof (i.e., the code) has replaced identifying information (such as name or social security number) that would enable the investigator or any other individuals associated with the investigation, including the sponsor to readily ascertain the identity of the individual to whom the specimen pertains; and 2) a key to decipher the code exists, enabling linkage of the identifying information to the specimen. * The specimens may be accompanied by clinical information as long as this information does not make the specimen source identifiable to the investigator or any other individual associated with the investigation, including the sponsor. * The individuals caring for the patients are different from and do not share information about the patient with those conducting the investigation. * The specimens are provided to the investigator(s) without identifiers and the supplier of the specimens has established policies and procedures to prevent the release of personal information. * The study has been reviewed by an IRB in accordance with 21 CFR Part 56, except as described in section 7 of this guidance document.\n\nStudies that do not fall within the intended enforcement discretion expressed in this guidance include (but are not limited to) studies where any of the following is true:\n\nThe study does not meet the IDE exemption criteria at 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3);\n\nthe specimens are individually identifiable, i.e., the identity of the subject is known to or may be readily ascertained by the investigator or any other individuals associated with the investigation, including the sponsor.\n\nthe specimens were collected specifically for the proposed investigation. That is, the specimens are not leftover from routine clinical care or analysis or leftover from other research.\n\nthe amount of specimen needed for the study is more than would be leftover from what is usually collected for routine clinical analysis\n\nor,\n\nthe test results will be reported to the subject\'s health care provider. For example, in the course of comparative studies involving B. anthracis detection devices, it would be inappropriate not to report positive results if they occur in the course of an investigation.\n\nV What type of records should be kept for these types of studies?\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable Guidance for Sponsors, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff']","['Part 58 applies only to **nonclinical** laboratory studies, which are defined as in vivo or in vitro experiments in which test articles are studied prospectively in test systems under laboratory conditions to determine their safety. The term does not include studies utilizing human subjects or clinical studies or field trials in animals. The term does not include basic exploratory studies carried out to determine whether a test article has any potential utility or to determine physical or chemical characteristics of a test article (21 CFR 58.3(d)).\n\nMoreover, because the safety of IVDs is related to the accuracy of the result, most IVD studies that are intended to establish safety would necessarily use human specimens. As noted above, an IVD study using human specimens involves human subjects and thus is excluded from the definition of nonclinical laboratory studies. Such studies to establish safety are subject to 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 and 21 CFR Part 812 as applicable, dealing with human subject research, rather than to 21 CFR Part 58.']",0.0,0.3333333333333333

Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nSponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/sponsor-investigator-irb-interrelationship). Office of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nThe interrelationship and interaction between the research sponsor (e.g., drug, biologic and device manufacturers), the clinical investigator and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) may be very complex. The regulations do not prohibit direct sponsor-IRB contacts, although, the sponsor-IRB interaction customarily occurs through the investigator who conducts the clinical study. The clinical investigator generally provides the communication link between the IRB and the sponsor. Such linkage is agreed to by the sponsors and investigators when they sign forms FDA-1571 and FDA-1572, respectively, for drug and biologic studies or an investigator agreement for device studies. There are occasions when direct communication between the IRB and the sponsor may facilitate resolution of concerns about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The clinical investigator should be kept apprised of the discussion.\n\nSponsor Assurance that IRBs Operate in Compliance with 21 CFR Part 56\n\nFDA regulations [21 CFR 312.23(a)(1)(iv)] require that a sponsor assure the FDA that a study will be conducted in compliance with the informed consent and IRB regulations [21 CFR parts 50 and 56]. This requirement has been misinterpreted to mean that it is a sponsor\'s obligation to determine IRB compliance with the regulations. This is not the case. Sponsors should rely on the clinical investigator, who assures the sponsor on form FDA-1572 for drugs and biologics or the investigator agreement for devices that the study will be reviewed by an IRB. Because clinical investigators work directly with IRBs, it is appropriate that they assure the sponsor that the IRB is functioning in compliance with the regulations.\n\nAn IRB must notify an investigator in writing of its decision to approve, disapprove or request modifications in a proposed research activity [21 CFR 56.109(e)]. This correspondence should be made available to the sponsor by the clinical investigator. In the Agency\'s view, this required documentation provides the sponsor with reasonable assurance that an IRB complies with 21 CFR part 56 and that it will be responsible for initial and continuing review of the study. Also, the sponsor and, in fact, anyone who is interested, mayobtain an Establishment Inspection Report from an FDA inspection of an IRB. These reports summarize the conditions observed during the IRB inspection. FDA, however, does not certify IRBs.\n\nSponsor Access to Medical Records\n\nThe IRB is responsible for ensuring that informed consent documents include the extent to which the confidentiality of medical records will be maintained [21 CFR 50.25(a)(5)]. FDA requires sponsors (or research monitors hired by them) to monitor the accuracy of the data submitted to FDA in accordance with regulatory requirements. These data are generally in the possession of the clinical investigator. Each subject must be advised during the informed consent process of the extent to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained and of the possibility that the FDA may inspect the records. While FDA access to medical records is a regulatory requirement, subject names are not usually requested by FDA unless the records of particular individuals require a more detailed study of the cases, or unless there is reason to believe that the records do not represent actual cases studied or actual results obtained. The consent document should list all other entities (e.g., the sponsor) who will have access to records identifying the subject. The extent to which confidentiality will be maintained may affect a subject\'s decision to participate in a clinical investigation.\n\nConfidentiality of Sponsor Information\n\nThe IRB\'s primary responsibility with respect to protecting confidentiality is to the research subject. IRBs should, however, respect the sponsor\'s need to maintain confidentiality of certain information about products under development. IRB members and staff should be aware that information submitted for review may be confidential, trade secret, and of commercial interest and should recognize the need for maintaining the confidentiality of the review materials and IRB records. It is advisable for IRBs to have policies that address this issue.\n\nNonsignificant Risk Device Studies\n\n""A sponsor\'s preliminary determination that a medical device study presents an NSR is subject to IRB approval."" The effect of the IRB\'s NSR decision is important to research sponsors and investigators because significant risk (SR) studies require sponsors to file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with FDA before they may begin. NSR studies, however, may begin as soon as the IRB approves the study. The sponsor, usually through the clinical investigator, provides the IRB with information necessary to make a judgment on the risk of a device study. While the investigational plan and supporting materials usually contain sufficient information to make a determination, the IRB can request additional information if needed [21 CFR 812.150(b)(10)]. If the IRB believes that additional information is needed, it may contact the sponsor directly, but it should keep the clinical investigator apprised of the request. While making the SR/NSR determination, any of the three parties may ask FDA to provide a risk assessment. See FDA Information Sheet: ""Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies"" for further information.\n\nDisagreements\n\nThe sponsor may choose not to conduct, to terminate, or to discontinue studies that do not conform with the sponsor\'s wishes. For example, the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB may reach an impasse about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The FDA will not mediate such disagreements. The Agency\'s policy of decentralized ethical review of clinical investigations allows such decisions to be made by local IRBs, and any disagreements between a sponsor, IRB, and clinical investigator should be resolved through appropriate communication among those parties.\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) - Specific Electronic Submissions Intended For FDA\'s Dockets Management Staff (i.e., Citizen Pettitions, Draft Proposed Guidance Documents, Variances, and other administrative record submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management Food and Drug Administration 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061 Rockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\n[] Search for FDA Guidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators'

Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nCooperative Research\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/cooperative-research).\n\nOffice of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nCooperative research studies involve more than one institution. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regulations permit institutions involved in multi-institutional studies to use reasonable methods of joint or cooperative review [21 CFR 56.114 and 45 CFR 46.114, respectively]. While the IRB assumes responsibility for oversight and continuing review, the clinical investigator and the research site retain the responsibility for the conduct of the study.\n\nScope of Cooperative Research Activities\n\nThe regulatory provision for cooperative review arrangements may be applied to different types of cooperative clinical investigations. Examples include research coordinated by cooperative oncology groups and participation by investigators and subjects in a clinical study primarily conducted at or administered by another institution. Often, one institution has the primary responsibility for the conduct of the study and the responsibility for administrative or coordinating functions. At other times, multi center trials may be coordinated by an office or organization that does not actually conduct the clinical study or have an IRB.\n\nWritten Cooperative Review Agreements\n\nThe cooperative research arrangements between institutions may apply to the review of one study, to certain specific categories of studies or to all studies. A single cooperative IRB may provide review for several participating institutions, but the respective responsibilities of the IRB and each institution should be agreed to in writing.\n\nAn institution may agree to delegate the responsibility for initial and continuing review to another institution\'s IRB. In turn, the IRB agrees to assume responsibility for initial and continuing review. The institution delegating the responsibility for review should understandthat it is agreeing to abide by the reviewing IRB\'s decisions. The delegating institution remains responsible for ensuring that the research conducted within its own institution is in full accordance with the determinations of the IRB providing the review and oversight.\n\nThe IRB which agrees to review studies conducted at another institution has responsibility for initial and continuing review of the research. Such an IRB, in initially reviewing the study, should take into account the required criteria for approval, the facilities and capabilities of the other institution, and the measures taken by the other institution to ensure compliance with the IRB\'s determinations. The reviewing IRB needs to be sensitive to factors such as community attitudes.\n\nThe agreement for IRB review of cooperative research should be documented. Depending upon the scope of the agreement, documentation may be simple, in the form of a letter, or more complex such as a formal memorandum of understanding. In the case of studies supported or conducted by HHS, arrangements or agreements may be subject to approval by HHS through the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) and should be executed in accordance with OHRP\'s instructions. Whatever form of documentation is used, copies should be furnished to all parties to the agreement, and to those responsible for ensuring compliance with the regulations and the IRB\'s determinations. The IRB\'s records should include documentation of such agreements.\n\nWhen an IRB approves a study, it notifies (in writing) the clinical investigator and the institution at each location for which the IRB has assumed responsibility [21 CFR 56.109(d)]. All required reports from the clinical investigators should be sent directly to the responsible IRB with copies to the investigator\'s institution, as appropriate.\n\nMulti-institutional IRB\n\nAnother form of cooperative research activity is a multi-institutional IRB, that oversees the research activities of more than one institution in a defined area, such as a city or county. Such an IRB is formed by separate but cooperating institutions and eliminates the need for each facility to organize and staff its own IRB. A variation of this is an IRB that is established by a corporate entity to oversee research at its operating components, for example, a hospital system with facilities at several locations.\n\nAlso see FDA Information Sheet: ""Non-Local IRB Review"" (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/non-local-irb-review).\n23.8.20.20.5.501 501\n\nrecord submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\nSearch for FDA\n\nGuidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Cooperative Research Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n--------------------\nContext: For multicenter clinical investigations, changes may need to be made to the consent form to address local and institutional requirements. For multicenter clinical investigations reviewed by more than one IRB, when local IRB review results in substantive modifications to the consent form, i.e., changes that affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects, FDA expects the sponsor to share the revisions with all investigators and their IRBs. In this situation it may be more efficient to share the changes with the sites using a modified model consent form, when appropriate. If the multicenter clinical investigation has a central IRB cooperating with local IRBs or human research protection offices, the revisions should be forwarded to the central IRB.67 Alternatively, local issues may be addressed by the central IRB depending on the review agreement between the local IRB(s) and central IRB. Note that for medicaldevice studies that require submission of an IDE application, such changes must be submitted to FDA.68\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 812.35(a).\n\nFootnote 69: The 2018 Common Rule requires that any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States, unless the research is not subject to the provision (45 CFR 46.114(b)). The compliance date for research subject to this provision was January 20, 2020. On September 28, 2022, FDA issued a proposed rule to harmonize with this requirement to the extent practicable and consistent with statutory provisions (see https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/28/2022-21089/institutional-review-boards-cooperative-research). The January 19, 2017, final rule revising the Common Rule is available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/finalized-revisions-common-rule/index.html.\n\n.4.2 Sponsor Personnel\n\nSponsor personnel (usually a field engineer) may be present during the procedure and/or follow-up visits for some medical device studies. These individuals may provide technical support and/or record study-related information for the test article. If sponsor personnel will be present during the procedure or follow-up, or if the activities of the sponsor personnel directly affect the subject, those activities should also be described in the informed consent form.70\n\nFootnote 70: See “Guidance for Industry: Investigator Responsibilities – Protecting the Rights, Safety, and Welfare of Study Subjects,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/investigator-responsibilities-protecting-rights-safety-and-welfare-study-subjects.\n\nThe FDA\n\nFDA\'s regulations for drug (including biologic) and device investigations have different requirements for the submission of informed consent materials (see sections IV.D.1, ""Investigational New Drugs and Biologics,"" and IV.D.2, ""Investigational Medical Devices,"" for additional information). Sponsors are not required to submit informed consent materials to FDA for all clinical investigations (see, for example, 21 CFR 312.2(b) and 21 CFR 812.2(b) and (c)); however, FDA may require that they be submitted in some cases as discussed below.\n\nGenerally, when informed consent materials are submitted, FDA reviewers assess the adequacy of the consent form by considering its communication of reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject and other elements required by 21 CFR 50.25. In some situations, FDA may find a consent form to be misleading, inaccurate, or incomplete in a way that would make informed consent inadequate and noncompliant with 21 CFR part 50. In these cases, FDA may require that specific revisions be made to address the concern(s) before the clinical investigation can proceed (21 CFR 312.42 and 812.30).\n\nFDA\'s review of the consent form as part of an IND or IDE application submission does not substitute for the responsibility or authority of the IRB to review and approve the consent form and consent process as a condition for the clinical investigation to begin (21 CFR 56.103(a)). IRBs are responsible for ensuring the adequacy of the information in the consent form and may require modification as appropriate (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b)).\n\nBelow are specific areas FDA considers in its review of the consent form:\n\nvi.2.1 Investigational New Drugs and Biologics71\n\nFootnote 71: For the purposes of this document, unless otherwise specified, all references to “drugs” or “drug products” include human drug products and biological products that are also drugs.\n\nThe IND regulations (21 CFR part 312) do not specifically require submission to FDA of the consent form with the IND. However, if FDA determines that review of the consent form is necessary to make the determination of whether the clinical investigation may safely proceed, the Agency will request that the sponsor submit the consent form for review under 21 CFR 312.23(a)(11).\n\nAs a general matter, FDA will review the informed consent form for treatment INDs and treatment protocols (21 CFR part 312, subpart I) and INDs for studies conducted under the Exception From Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research (21 CFR 50.24) for consistency with 21 CFR 50.25 (see 21 CFR 50.24(a)(6)).\n\nFor other clinical investigations of drugs, FDA often considers the following factors in determining whether to require submission and review of the consent form:\n\nNonclinical studies submitted in support of the first administration of a drug in humans have identified an unusual toxicity.\n\nUnusual known toxicity is associated with the investigational drug, the drug class to which the drug belongs, or with a different drug with characteristics similar to those of the study drug.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:46]\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nThis section of the guidance document is intended to provide answers to frequently asked questions about FDA\'s regulations for the protection of human subjects. The numbers assigned to the questions are intended for ease of reference and do not represent the frequency with which these questions are asked.\n\niv.4.1 What are some considerations for enrolling a child?2 into a clinical investigation?\n\nFDA regulations provide additional safeguards for children enrolled in clinical investigations, as described in 21 CFR part 50, subpart D.73 If a child is to be enrolled in a clinical investigation, parental or guardian permission must be obtained in accordance with the requirements for informed consent in 21 CFR part 50 (21 CFR 50.55(e))74 and be documented in accordance with 21 CFR 50.27 (21 CFR 50.55(f)). When appropriate, the assent of the child also must be obtained (see 21 CFR 50.55(a)-(d)). As with informed consent for adult subjects, the exceptions to informed consent requirements described in section III.A.1, ""Exceptions to Informed Consent"", apply to research involving children.\n\nFootnote 72: For purposes of 21 CFR part 50, the term children means “persons who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures involved in clinical investigations, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the clinical investigation will be conducted.” See 21 CFR 50.3(o).\n\nFootnote 73: FDA promulgated 21 CFR part 50, subpart D, “Additional Safeguards for Children in Clinical Investigations,” as an interim rule in April 2001 (see 66 FR 20589, April 24, 2001; https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2001-04-24/pdf/01-10008.pdf), and issued a final rule in February 2013 (see 78 FR 12937, February 26, 2013; https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2013-02-26/pdf/2013-04387.pdf).\n\nThe IRB may determine that the permission of one parent is sufficient for clinical investigations involving no greater than minimal risk to children to be conducted under 21 CFR 50.51, or clinical investigations involving greater than minimal risk to children but presenting the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects in accordance with 21 CFR 50.52 (21 CFR 50.55(e)(1)).\n\nFor clinical investigations to be conducted in accordance with either 21 CFR 50.53 or 21 CFR 50.54,75 where permission is to be obtained from parents, the permission of both parents is required unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child (21 CFR 50.55(e)(2)).76\n\nFootnote 76: For additional discussion on what is meant by “not reasonably available,” see the Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections (SACHRP) recommendations at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/sachrp-committee/recommendations/attachment-d-november-13-2018/indes.html.\n\nThe general requirements for informed consent, found in 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 50.25 and 21 CFR 50.27, apply to parental permission (21 CFR 50.55(e)-(f)). When obtaining parental permission, in the event the parents of a child do not understand English, the parental permission must be obtained and documented in language that is understandable to the parents (21 CFR 50.20). The child who will be participating in the research should not be used as an interpreter for the parent, even if the child is fluent in English and may be able to assent. Similarly, if child assent is required, the information given to the child should be in language that is understandable to the child.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'

It does not create any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist institutional review boards (IRBs), clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA\'s informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. This guidance supersedes FDA\'s guidance entitled ""A Guide to Informed Consent,"" issued in September 1998, and finalizes FDA\'s draft guidance entitled ""Informed Consent Information Sheet,"" issued in July 2014. This document is structured to first present general guidance on FDA\'s regulatory requirements for informed consent and a discussion of the roles of IRBs, clinical investigators, sponsors, and FDA related to informed consent, followed by a series of frequently asked questions.\n\nIn a final rule published on January 19, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal departments and agencies revised the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects. The final rule became effective in 2018 (codified for HHS at 45 CFR 46, subpart A; ""the 2018 Common Rule"").2,3 The 2018 Common Rule sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by federal departments or agencies that have adopted the Common Rule. The revisions include significant changes to the provisions regarding informed consent. FDA is currently engaged in notice and comment rulemaking to harmonize its human subject protection\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nof the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Summary of the Consent process\n\nTo many, the term informed consent is mistakenly viewed as synonymous with obtaining a subject\'s signature on the consent form;9 however, obtaining documentation of a subject\'s informed consent is only part of the consent process. Informed consent involves providing a prospective subject, or their legally authorized representative (LAR), with adequate information to allow for an informed decision about participation in the clinical investigation prior to enrollment. Informed consent also involves facilitating the prospective subject\'s understanding of the information, providing adequate opportunity for the prospective subject to ask questions and to consider whether to participate, obtaining the prospective subject\'s voluntary agreement to participate prior to enrollment, and continuing to provide information as the clinical investigation progresses or as the enrolled subject or situation requires.10\n\nFootnote 9: In this guidance document, the terms informed consent form and informed consent document are used interchangeably.\n\nExcept as provided in 21 CFR 50.23 and 50.24,11 (see section III.A.1, ""Exceptions to Informed Consent""), no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in FDA-regulated research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s LAR (21CFR 50.20).12 To be legally effective, the informed consent process must satisfy the general requirements under 21 CFR 50.20 and include the relevant elements of informed consent described at 21 CFR 50.25 (see section3), ""FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion"").\n\nFootnote 12: As described in guidance, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances, with respect to its current regulations governing the requirement for informed consent when human specimens are used for FDA-regulated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device investigations. See “Guidance on Informed Consent for in Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable: Guidance for Sponsors, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff”, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-informed- Consent-vitro-diagnostic-device-studies-using-leftover-human-specimens-are-not\n\nFDA considers advertising used to recruit subjects into the clinical trial to be the start of the ongoing consent process, and the information provided in any online or hard copy recruitment materials should be consistent with the informed consent document. Generally, FDA recommends that any advertisement to recruit subjects be limited to the information the prospective subjects need to determine their interest and potential eligibility. The FDA information sheet ""Recruiting Study Subjects"" includes information regarding scripts for those who will interface with subjects to determine basic eligibility.13\n\nFootnote 13: See the FDA Information Sheet “Recruiting Study Subjects,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects, for further information.\n\nOnce a prospective subject is identified, and before research activities requiring prior consent occur, a person knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and capable of answering questions raised by the prospective subject should conduct a consent discussion. The consent discussion and the consent form must contain information to allow prospective subjects to make an informed decision about participation in a clinical investigation and provide an opportunity for prospective subjects to ask questions about the clinical investigation and the information in the consent document (see section3), ""FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion"") (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25).14 The consent form serves several purposes, including helping to ensure that prospective subjects receive the required information, providing a ""take home"" reminder of the elements of the clinical investigation, providing contact information in case additional questions or concerns arise, and documenting prospective subjects\' voluntary agreement to participate as well as the date of their agreement.\n\nFootnote 14: The regulations allow use of a “short form” consent form when the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For a discussion of the short form written consent, see section3.5.4.2, “Short Form.”\n\nThe informed consent process is an ongoing exchange of information throughout a subject\'s participation in a clinical trial and does not end after the consent form is signed. For example, if new safety information or protocol changes occur during the conduct of the study, additional information may need to be given to the subject, and/or the subject may need additional opportunities to ask questions and receive answers throughout the clinical investigation (see sectionIII.3.5, ""Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects,"" and Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nIII FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b ""Short Form"" for more details). If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For ""applicable clinical trials"" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, “Element of Informed Consent for ‘Applicable Clinical Trials.”\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n--------------------\nContext: This formal review of the research effort, as required under 21 CFR 56.109(f), is the subject of this guidance. An IRB must review previously approved research at least once a year (21 CFR 56.109(f)). Review must be conducted at convened meetings at which a majority of the IRB members are present, including at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas, unless the research qualifies for review through an expedited process (21 CFR 56.108(c) and 56.110). See Section III.D. of this guidance for more information on the application of expedited review procedures to continuing review.\n\nIRBs involved in multi-site studies may find it difficult to conduct a thorough review with data solely from the site(s) under their purview and may need to obtain study-wide information. Sponsors are in the unique position of having information for the entire study6 and may provide it to investigators, who in turn provide it to the IRBs. FDA's regulations do not prohibit sponsors from providing study-wide information directly to IRBs.7 FDA encourages efforts by investigators and sponsors to ensure that IRBs receive meaningful study-wide information, particularly when doing so may assist IRBs in reviewing the studies and protecting subjects.\n\nFootnote 6: See FDA’s Guidance for Industry, “Adverse Event Reporting to IRBs – Improving Human Subject Protection,” http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126572.pdf.\n\nFootnote 7: Note that FDA’s regulations for device studies specifically assign general responsibility to sponsors “...for ensuring IRB review and approval are obtained and ensuring that any reviewing IRB and FDA are promptly informed of significant new information about an investigation...” 21 CFR 812.40.\n\nOne way to enable a useful continuing review of multi-site studies while reducing or eliminating duplication of effort is through the use of cooperative review agreements or other mechanisms (e.g., using a centralized IRB review process), in accordance with 21 CFR 56.114. Cooperative agreements may vary with respect to how continuing review will be carried out. For example, some agreements may designate a specific IRB as having primary responsibility for continuing review of an investigation.8 Other agreements may assign responsibility for local issues to the institution's IRB, but assign the remaining aspects of continuing review to a central IRB.\n\nFootnote 8: See FDA’s Guidance for Industry, “Using a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials,” http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm080606.pdf.\n\nWhatever the arrangement, the IRB(s) responsible for continuing review of multi-site studies may find it helpful to obtain and review information across the entire study. For additional discussion, see Section III.B. of this guidance.\n\nAppendix A Criteria for Approving Research During Continuing Review\n\nFDA regulations set forth the criteria for IRB approval of research (21 CFR 56.111). These criteria apply to both initial review and continuing review. In order to approve research, the IRB must determine that all of following requirements are satisfied:\n\nRisks to subjects are minimized;\n\nRisks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may be expected to result;\n\nSelection of subjects is equitable;\n\nInformed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and appropriately documented;\n\nWhere appropriate, the research plan adequately provides for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects;\n\nWhere appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data;\n\nAppropriate additional safeguards are included to protect vulnerable subjects; and\n\nWhere the study involves children, the research complies with 21 CFR part 50, Subpart D.\n\nThe IRB makes its continuing review determination by considering whether any new information is available that would affect the IRB's prior finding that the research meets the criteria in 21 CFR 56.111. IRBs have authority to disapprove or require modifications in (to secure re- approval of) a research activity that does not meet any of the above criteria (e.g., the full study or any part thereof, such as changes to the protocol, advertisements; 21 CFR 56.109(a))\n\nAppendix B Process for Conducting Continuing Review\n\nContinuing review takes place at a convened meeting of the IRB, unless it meets the criteria for expedited review under 21 CFR 56.110. (See 21 CFR 56.108(c) and Section III.D. of this guidance.) The IRB is required to review the research (21 CFR 56.109(f)) and must maintain records of its continuing review activities, including minutes of meetings at which such activities are undertaken (21 CFR 56.115(a)(2) and (3)). The minutes must be in sufficient detail to show actions taken by the IRB, and the vote on these actions, and to summarize the discussion of controverted issues and their resolution (21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)). For research to be approved, a majority of IRB members present at a meeting must approve it (21 CFR 56.108(c)).\n\nThe IRB must ensure that a member does not participate in the IRB's continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB (21 CFR 56.107(e)). Meeting minutes must reflect meeting attendance, the votes taken, and a summary of the discussion and resolution of controverted issues, and should provide confirmation that conflicted members did not participate in the IRB's continuing review of their studies (21 CFR 56.115((a)(2)). FDA recommends that IRB members with a conflicting interest in a project recuse themselves by leaving the meeting room when the IRB conducts continuing review of that project, except when requested by the IRB to be present to provide information.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThis IRB member recusal should be noted in the minutes of the IRB meeting when recording votes on IRB actions.\n\nAn IRB must maintain and follow written procedures for the continuing review of research (21 CFR 56.108(a)(1) and 56.115(a)(6)). In developing procedures for continuing review, the IRB should consider the use of templates, checklists, or other tools to standardize the request for information or list of materials to be provided to the IRB at the time of continuing review.\n\nInvestigators are responsible for ensuring that studies they conduct comply with applicable regulatory requirements.9 To ensure that the reviewing IRB can carry out its review prior to the expiration date of the current IRB approval, investigators should follow the IRB's policies and procedures for continuing IRB review of research (procedures required by 21 CFR 56.108(a)(1)), in particular by submitting materials and information required by the IRB. FDA encourages IRBs to make investigators aware of the IRB's procedures, for example, by enclosing a copy in correspondence informing the investigator of the IRB's decisions, or posting the information on a website.\n\nFootnote 9: See 21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vii), 312.60, 312.66, 812.36(c)(viii), 812.100, 812.110(b), 812.40, and 812.43(c)(4)(i).\n\nFDA recommends that the IRB's written procedures call for submission of the following information for consideration by the IRB in continuing review, if not already available to the IRB as part of the existing IRB records for the research10:\n\nFootnote 10: Some of this information may come from the sponsor, who would have access to data across all study sites. Sponsors may provide information directly to IRBs or to the clinical investigators who in turn would share it with the IRBs.\n\nA written progress report/brief project summary that includes the following or references other documents made available to the IRB:\n\nThe number of subjects accrued; (For multi-site studies, the number of subjects accrued at the local site and the number accrued study-wide, if available, should be provided.)\n\nA brief summary of any amendments to the research approved by the IRB since the IRB's initial review or the last continuing review;\n\nAny new and relevant information, published or unpublished, since the last IRB review, especially information about risks associated with the research; (Note that FDA does not expect the IRB to perform an independent review of the relevant scientific literature related to a particular research project undergoing continuing review.)\n\nA summary of any unanticipated problems.11 In many cases, such a summary could be a brief statement that there have been no unanticipated problems (i.e., adverse events have occurred at the expected frequency and level of severity as documented in the research protocol, the informed consent document, and Investigator's Brochure (if applicable)); *\n(\\circ) A summary of any subject withdrawals from the research since the last IRB review, and the reasons for withdrawal, if known; and (\\circ) A summary of any complaints about the research from subjects enrolled at the local site since the last IRB review;\n\nThe latest version of the protocol and sample informed consent document(s) in use at the site;\n\nAny proposed modifications to the informed consent document or protocol;\n\nThe current Investigator's Brochure, if any, including any modifications;\n--------------------\nContext title: IRB Continuing Review After Clinical Investigation Approval Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsor\n\nFor studies conducted under an IND, 21 CFR part 312 provides that a sponsor is responsible for obtaining a commitment from each investigator that he or she will ensure that requirements in part 56 relating to IRB review and approval are met with respect to the research conducted by the investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d)). Sponsors can also initiate plans for use of a centralized IRB review process and facilitate agreements and other necessary communications among the parties involved.\n\n3.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.1.2 Investigator\n\nUnder 21 CFR part 312, an investigator is responsible for ensuring that there will be initial and continuing review by a qualified IRB of research conducted by that investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d); 312.66). If the investigator is conducting clinical research as part of a multicenter study at an institution with its own IRB and is subject to the policies of that institution, those policies would dictate how the investigator will ensure IRB review. Those policies may provide that the investigator\'s responsibility can be met by ensuring review through a centralized IRB review, through the institution\'s IRB, or through apportionment of IRB review responsibilities between a centralized IRB and the institution\'s IRB.\n\nCentral IRB\n\nFor multicenter studies, the central IRB is the IRB that conducts reviews on behalf of all study sites that agree to participate in the centralized review process. For sites at institutions that have an IRB that would ordinarily review research conducted at the site, the central IRB should reach agreement with the individual institutions participating in centralized review and those institutions\' IRBs about how to apportion the review responsibilities between local IRBs and the central IRB (21 CFR 56.114).\n\nIV Addressing Local Aspects of IRB Review\n\nThe implementation of a centralized IRB review process involves addressing a number of issues related to the communities where the research will take place. The requirements for IRB membership in 21 CFR 56.107(a) specify that the membership of an IRB must have sufficient experience, expertise, and diversity to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. This requirement was intended to implement a recommendation of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research that IRB members be ""men and women of diverse backgrounds and sufficient maturity, experience, and competence to assure that the Board will be able to discharge its responsibilities and that its determinations will be accorded respect by investigators and the community served by the institution or in which it is located.""1 In addition, IRB members must ""be able to ascertain the acceptability of the proposed research in terms of institutional commitments and regulations, applicable law, and standards or professional conduct and practice"" (21 CFR 56.107(a)). Thus, IRB review, through its membership, is intended to provide meaningful consideration of various local factors in assessing research activities, including the cultural backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, educational level, religious affiliations) of the population from which research subjects will be drawn, community attitudes10 about the nature\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nof the proposed research, and the capacity of the institution to conduct or support the proposed research. Inter-community differences could influence, among other things, assessments of whether mechanisms of subject selection will be equitable, whether adequate provision is made to minimize risks to vulnerable populations, and the adequacy of the informed consent process.\n\nThe preamble to the final rule indicates that where a centralized IRB review process is used (21 CFR 56.114), the review should consider the ethical standards of the local community.11 Therefore, a centralized IRB review process should include mechanisms to ensure meaningful consideration of these relevant local factors. Possible mechanisms include:\n\nFootnote 11: Federal Register, Vol. 46, p. 8966, January 27, 1981\n\nProvision of relevant local information to the central IRB in writing by individuals or organizations familiar with the local community, institution, and/or clinical research\n\nParticipation of consultants with relevant expertise, or IRB members from the institution\'s own IRB, in the deliberations of the central IRB\n\nLimited review of a central IRB-reviewed study by the institution\'s own IRB, with that limited review focusing on issues that are of concern to the local community\n\nOther mechanisms may also be appropriate.12 IRB meeting minutes or other records should document how relevant community issues were considered in the review (21 CFR 56.115(a)) (see section 5).\n\nFootnote 12: Guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) (IRB Knowledge of Local Research Context) discusses mechanisms for ensuring adequate consideration of local factors by IRBs in review of clinical research that is supported by DHHS funding. Although the guidance applies only to DHHS funded research, it may be also helpful to off-site IRBs seeking to provide meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for non-DHHS funded clinical research.\n\n5 IRB Records -- Documenting Agreements and Procedures\n\nIRBs and institutions are required to prepare and maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities (21 CFR 56.115(a)). IRBs are also required to follow written procedures for the conduct of initial and continuing review of clinical research and for reporting their findings and actions to the investigator and the institution (21 CFR section 56.108(a), 56.115(a)(6)). The following recommendations should help IRBs fulfill these requirements.\n\nDocumenting Agreements\n\nIf an institution, its IRB, and a central IRB agree (under 21 CFR 56.114) to participate in a centralized IRB review process, they should document that action in an agreement signed by the parties. IRBs should report this action to the investigator and the institution, for example, by providing copies of the agreement to the investigator, and the institution.13 If the agreement\n\n3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApportions IRB review responsibilities between a central IRB and the institution\'s IRB, the agreement should delineate the specific responsibilities of the central IRB and the institution\'s IRB for the initial and continuing review of the study.\n\nWritten Procedures\n\nWhen an institution and an institution\'s IRB rely on review by a central IRB, both IRBs must have written procedures in place to implement the centralized IRB review process (21 CFR 56.108, 56.114). For example, procedures should address the following:\n\nHow the institution\'s IRB determines that the central IRB is qualified to review research conducted at the institution\n\nHow the central IRB intends to communicate with relevant institutions, the institutions\' IRBs, and investigators regarding its review\n\nHow the central IRB ensures that it provides meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for communities from which research subjects will be drawn (see Section 4)\n\nHow the central IRB assesses the ability of a geographically remote site to participate in a study (e.g., whether the site has medical services appropriate to the complexity of the study)\n\nWhen an institution, an institution\'s IRB, and a central IRB agree to apportion IRB review responsibilities between the two IRBs, each IRB must have written procedures describing how it implements its responsibilities under the agreement (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)).\n\nVI Using a Central IRB at Unaffiliated Sites\n\nAt clinical sites that are not already affiliated with an IRB, investigators and sponsors typically rely on the review and oversight of a central IRB. In this situation, the central IRB should document in meeting minutes or other records how it considered relevant local factors for the various communities from which research subjects are to be drawn (see Section 4). The central IRB must also document its action in agreeing to conduct IRB review for the site (21 CFR 56.115) and must have written procedures in place that describe how it will perform its initial and continuing review responsibilities at remote sites (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)) (see Section 5).\n\nVII Examples of Cooperative IRB Review Models\n\nThere are a variety of mechanisms that have been used to distribute IRB review responsibilities between an institution\'s IRB and a central IRB. This guidance is not intended to endorse any particular mechanism. These examples are provided only to illustrate possible mechanisms.\n\nTrial in Which Multiple Sites Rely on a Central IRB\n\nThe primary model contemplated by this guidance is a centralized IRB review process used for a single multicenter trial performed by a commercial or publicly funded sponsor. Under 21 CFR 56.114, IRBs affiliated with the study sites could enter into agreements with a central IRB to rely on all or some of the review findings of the central IRB, or could decline to participate in a centralized IRB review (i.e., do their own complete review). Study sites not already affiliated with an IRB would rely on a central IRB for all IRB review responsibilities.\n\nCentral IRB Formed to Review Multicenter Trials in a Therapeutic Category\n--------------------\nContext title: Using a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials Guidance for Industry']","['The term co-investigator is not defined in FDA regulations. As commonly used, the term is meant to indicate that each co-investigator is fully responsible for fulfilling all of the obligations of an investigator as identified in 21 CFR 312.60. Thus under 21 CFR 312.3(b), each co-investigator is an investigator, and as such must sign a separate 1572.\n\nIn some situations, it is preferable to have more than one investigator responsible for a clinical investigation. For example, when a study is conducted at multiple research facilities that are not in close proximity, FDA expects an investigator who has signed a 1572 to be available at each location to either personally conduct or supervise the study. This responsibility cannot be delegated to a subinvestigator.\n\nAlthough not necessary, it is acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site. For example, the conduct and supervision of a large investigation with many subjects or complicated procedures might be shared among several investigators, each of whom has signed a 1572 when the investigation is conducted under an IND. This is distinct from a subinvestigator (see #31) whose role in the clinical investigation is more limited.']",0.0,0.2727272727272727

If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate telephone number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to inform new drug application (NDA) and abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) holders of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) plan to use enforcement discretion with regard to section 314.70(c)(2)(iii) of the final rule entitled\n\nSupplements and Other Changes to an Approved Application (21 CFR 314.70(c)(2)(iii)).2 This subsection describes the filing requirement that a relaxation of acceptance criteria or deletion of a test to comply with an official compendium must be reported in a changes-being-effected-in-30-days supplement (CBE-30). In the exercise of its enforcement discretion, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action if manufacturers continue to submit such changes in their annual reports. The use of enforcement discretion will give the Agency time to clarify that some of these types of postapproval changes can be submitted in an annual report, rather than in a CBE-30. The Agency intends to clarify this issue in an upcoming revision to the guidance for industry\n\nChanges to an Approved NDA or ANDA; Questions and Answers.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nBackground\n\nOn April 8, 2004, FDA published in the Federal Register (69 FR 18728) the final rule entitled Supplements and Other Changes to an Approved Application. In the same issue of the Federal Register (69 FR 18768), FDA announced the availability of the guidance for industry entitled Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA (the Changes guidance). The final rule sets forth requirements for postapproval changes.\n\nUnder section 314.70(c)(2)(iii) of the final rule, the relaxation of acceptance criteria or deletion of a test to comply with an official compendium that is consistent with FDA statutory and regulatory requirements must be submitted as a supplement - changes-being-effected-in-30 days (CBE-30) (see section VIII.C.1.e of the Changes guidance). Under 314.70(d)(2)(i) of the final rule, any change in a specification made to comply with an official compendium, except the relaxation of acceptance criteria or deletion of a test that is consistent with FDA statutory and regulatory requirements, is to be submitted as an Annual Report (see section VIII.D.1 of the Changes guidance).\n\nSince publication of the final rule, the Agency has received communications from NDA and ANDA holders requesting clarification of the regulation as it applies to changes such as excipient monographs and general chapters. As written now, the regulations could be interpreted to require a CBE for any compendial change to relax or delete a test, resulting in an increase in the number of supplements, something that was not intended. The Agency plans to revise the Guidance for Industry: Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA; Questions and Answers to provide more specific recommendations as to what types of changes can be submitted in an annual report instead of a CBE-30 supplement.\n\nIn addition, the Agency is aware that stakeholders have expressed concern that the final rule (i.e., 21 CFR 314.70), which published on April 8, 2004, and the accompanying Changes guidance do not take into consideration the recent FDA Pharmaceutical CGMP Initiative for the 21({}^{\\rm st}) Century. Accordingly, the Agency plans to align this guidance with the initiative in order to facilitate manufacturing changes to enhance product quality.\n\nIII Exercise of enforcement discretion\n\nFDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion and does not intend to take action to enforce compliance with the compendial changes requirement as stated in 21 CFR 314.70(c)(2)(iii) if manufacturers submit such changes in their annual reports. FDA intends to develop further guidance to clarify the requirere nts of 21 CFR 314.70(c)(2)(iii).\n--------------------\nContext title: Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA; Specifications – Use of Enforcement Discretion for Compendial Changes Guidance for Industry""

If you have any questions about the effect of any portion of this guidance, contact the Office of Pharmaceutical Science, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD-003), Food and Drug Association, 5600 Fisher's Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.\n\n1 Introduction and Background\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to holders of new drug applications (NDAs) and abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) who intend to make postapproval changes in accordance with section 506A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and $ 314.70 (21 CFR 314.70). The guidance covers recommended reporting categories for postapproval changes for drugs other than specified biotechnology and specified synthetic biological products. It supersedes the guidance of the same title published November 1999. Recommendations are provided for postapproval changes in (1) components and composition, (2) manufacturing sites, (3) manufacturing process, (4) specifications, (5) container closure system, and (6) labeling, as well as (7) miscellaneous changes and (8) multiple related changes.\n\nRecommendations on reporting categories for changes relating to specified biotechnology and specified synthetic biological products regulated by CDER are found in the guidance for industryentitled Changes to an Approved Application for Specified Biotechnology and Specified Synthetic Biological Products (July 1997).2\n\nFootnote 2: FDA is currently revising the 1997 guidance and intends to issue it in draft for public comment.\n\nOn November 21, 1997, the President signed the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (the Modernization Act).3 Section 116 of the Modernization Act amended the the Act by adding section 506A, which provides requirements for making and reporting manufacturing changes to an approved application and for distributing a drug product made with such changes. The FDA has revised its regulations on supplements and other changes to an approved application (21 CFR 314.70) to conform to section 506A of the Act.\n\nFootnote 3: Public Law 105-115.\n\nThis guidance does not provide recommendations on the specific information that should be developed by an applicant to assess the effect of the change on the identity, strength (e.g., assay, content uniformity), quality (e.g., physical, chemical, and biological properties), purity (e.g., impurities and degradation products), or potency (e.g., biological activity, bioavailability, bioequivalence) of a drug product as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. An applicant should consider all relevant CDER guidance documents for recommendations on the information that should be submitted to support a given change.4\n\nFootnote 4: A list of CDER guidances is available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm.\n\nCDER has published guidances, including the SUPAC (scale-up and postapproval changes) guidances, that provide recommendations on reporting categories. To the extent that the recommendations on reporting categories in this guidance are found to be inconsistent with guidances published before this guidance was finalized, the recommended reporting categories in such previously published guidances are superseded by this guidance. This guidance does not provide extensive recommendations on reporting categories for components and composition changes (see section V). Therefore, recommended reporting categories for components and composition changes provided in previously published guidances, such as the SUPAC guidances, still apply. Section 506A of the Act and SS 314.70(c) provide for two types of changes-being-effected supplements (see section II), while previously there was only one type. It is important for applicants to use this guidance to determine which type of changes-being-effected supplement is recommended. CDER intends to update the previously published guidances to make them consistent with this guidance.\n\nIf guidance for either recommended reporting categories or information that should be submitted to support a particular change is not available, the appropriate CDER chemistry or microbiology review staff can be consulted for advice.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, in general, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required. Insofar as this guidance adjusts reporting categories pursuant to section 506A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and 21 CFR 314.70, it does have binding effect. If you have any questions about the effect of any portion of this guidance, contact the Office of Pharmaceutical Science, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD-003), Food and Drug Association, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.\n\nII Reporting Categories\n\nSection 506A of the Act and $ 314.70 provide for four reporting categories that are distinguished in the following paragraphs.\n\nA major change is a change that has a substantial potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a drug product as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. A major change requires the submission of a supplement and approval by FDA prior to distribution of the drug product made using the change. This type of supplement is called, and should be clearly labeled, a Prior Approval Supplement ($ 314.70(b)). An applicant may ask FDA to expedite its review of a prior approval supplement for public health reasons (e.g., drug shortage) or if a delay in making the change described in it would impose an extraordinary hardship on the applicant. This type of supplement is called, and should be clearly labeled, a Prior Approval Supplement - Expedited Review Requested ($ 314.70(b)(4)).5 FDA is most likely to grant requests for expedited review based on extraordinary hardship for manufacturing changes made necessary by catastrophic events (e.g., fire) or by events that could not be reasonably foreseen and for which the applicant could not plan.\n\nFootnote 5: Internal Agency policies and procedures relating to processing requests for expedited review of supplements to approved ANDAs and NDAs are documented in CDER’s Manual of Policies and Procedures (MAPP) at 5240.1 and 5310.3, respectively.

There are two types of moderate change. One type of moderate change requires the submission of a supplement to FDA at least 30 days before the distribution of the drug product made using the change. This type of supplement is called, and should be clearly labeled, a Supplement - Changes Being Effected in 30 Days ($ 314.70(c)(3)). The drug product made using a moderate change cannot be distributed if FDA informs the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the supplement that a prior approval supplement is required ($ 314.70(c)(5)(i)). For each change, the supplement must contain information determined by FDA to be appropriate and must include the information developed by the applicant in assessing the effects of the change ($ 314.70(a)(2) and (c)(4)). If FDA informs the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the supplement that information is missing, distribution must be delayed until the supplement has been amended to provide the missing information ($ 314.70(c)(5)(ii)).\n--------------------\nContext title: Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry""

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: Appendix 3: Processing Prior to Filling and Sealing Operations\n\nThe purpose of this appendix is to supplement the guidance provided in this document with information on products regulated by CBER or CDER that are subject to aseptic processing at points early in the manufacturing process, or that require aseptic processing through the entire manufacturing process because it is impossible to sterile filter the final drug product. The scope of this appendix includes aseptic processing activities that take place prior to the filling and sealing of the finished drug product. Special considerations include those for:\n\nAseptic processing from early manufacturing steps\n\nSome products undergo aseptic processing at some or all manufacturing steps preceding the final product closing step. With other products, there is a point in the process after which they can no longer be rendered sterile by filtration. In such cases, the product would be handled aseptically at all steps subsequent to sterile filtration. In other instances, the final drug product cannot be sterile-filtered and, therefore, each component in the formulation would be rendered sterile and mixed aseptically. For example, products containing aluminum adjuvant are formulated aseptically because once they are alum adsorbed, they cannot be sterile-filtered.\n\nWhen a product is processed aseptically from the early stages, the product and all components or other additions are rendered sterile prior to entering the manufacturing process. It is critical that all transfers, transports, and storage stages be carefully controlled at each step of the process to maintain sterility of the product. In some cases, bulk drug substances or products should be tested for sterility.24\n\nFootnote 24: See 21 CFR 610.12 for general biological product standards for sterility.\n\nProcedures (e.g., aseptic connection) that expose a product or product contact surfaces should be performed under unidirectional airflow in a Class 100 (ISO 5) environment. The environment of the room surrounding the Class 100 (ISO 5) environment should be Class 10,000 (ISO 7) or better. Microbiological and airborne particle monitoring should be performed during operations. Microbial surface monitoring should be performed at the end of operations, but prior to cleaning. Personnel monitoring should be performed in association with operations.\n\nProcess simulation studies covering the steps preceding filling and sealing should be designed to incorporate all conditions, product manipulations, and interventions that could impact on the sterility of the product. The process simulation, from the early process steps, should demonstrate that process controls are adequate to protect the product during manufacturing. These studies should incorporate all product manipulations, additions, and procedures involving exposure of product contact surfaces to the environment. The studies should include worst-case conditions such as maximum duration of open operations and maximum number of participating operators. However, the process simulations do not need to mimic total manufacturing time if the manipulations that occur during manufacturing are adequately represented.\n\nIt is also important that process simulations incorporate storage of sterile bulk drug substances or product and transport to other manufacturing areas. For instance, there should be assurance of bulk vessel integrity for specified holding times. The transport of sterile bulk tanks or other containers should be simulated as part of the media fill. Please refer to Section IX.A for moreguidance on media simulation studies. Process simulation studies for the formulation stage should be performed at least twice per year.\n\nAseptic processing of cellular therapy products and cell-derived products\n\nCellular therapy and some cell-derived products (e.g., lysates, semi-purified extracts) represent a subset of the products that cannot be filter-sterilized and therefore undergo aseptic manipulations throughout the manufacturing process. Where possible, closed systems should be used during manufacturing. Cellular therapy products often have short processing times at each manufacturing stage, particularly between the harvest, formulation of the final product, and product release. These products are frequently released from the manufacturing facility and administered to patients before final product sterility testing results are available. In situations where results of final sterility testing are not available before the product is administered, additional controls and testing should be considered. For example, additional sterility tests can be performed at intermediate stages of manufacture, such as after the last manipulation of the product prior to harvest. Other tests that may indicate microbial contamination, such as microscopic examination, Gram stain (or other bacterial and fungal stain), and endotoxin testing should be performed and meet acceptance criteria prior to product release.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] ISO 14644-1: Cleanrooms and Associated Controlled Environments, Classification of Air Cleanliness.\n\n[2] NASA Standard for Cleanroom and Work Stations for Microbially Controlled Environment, Publication NHB 5340.2 (August 1967).\n\n[3] Technical Order 00-25-203, Contamination Control of Aerospace Facilities, U.S. Air Force, December l, 1972.\n\n[4] Ljungqvist, B., and Reinmuller, B., Cleanroom Design: Minimizing Contamination Through Proper Design; Interpharm Press, 1997.\n\n[5] Lord, A. and J.

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: iv.2.2 Frequency and Number of Runs\n\nWhen a processing line is initially qualified, individual media fills should be repeated enough times to ensure that results are consistent and meaningful. This approach is important because a single run can be inconclusive, while multiple runs with divergent results signal a process that is not in control. We recommend that at least three consecutive separate successful runs be performed during initial line qualification. Subsequently, routine semi-annual qualification conducted for each processing line will evaluate the state of control of the aseptic process. Activities and interventions representative of each shift, and shift changeover, should be incorporated into the design of the semi-annual qualification program. For example, the evaluation of a production shift should address its unique time-related and operational features.13 All personnel who are authorized to enter the aseptic processing room during manufacturing, including technicians and maintenance personnel, should participate in a media fill at least once a year. Participation should be consistent with the nature of each operator's duties during routine production.\n\nFootnote 13: One example might be the movement of personnel into and out of the aseptic processing and gowning change rooms during a shift change.\n\nEach change to a product or line change should be evaluated using a written change control system. Any changes or events that have the potential to affect the ability of the aseptic process to exclude contamination from the sterilized product should be assessed through additional media fills. For example, facility and equipment modifications, line configuration changes, significant changes in personnel, anomalies in environmental testing results, container closure system changes, extended shutdowns, or end product sterility testing showing contaminated products may be cause for revalidation of the system.\n\nWhen data from a media fill indicate the process may not be in control, an investigation should be conducted to determine the origin of the contamination and the scope of the problem. Once corrections are instituted, process simulation run(s) should be performed to confirm that deficiencies have been corrected and the process has returned to a state of control. When an investigation fails to reach well-supported, substantive conclusions as to the cause of the media fill failure, three consecutive successful runs in tandem with increased scrutiny of the production process may be warranted.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:27]\n\nmanual manipulation. Use of slow line speed is generally appropriate for evaluating manufacturing processes with prolonged exposure of the sterile drug product and containers/closures in the aseptic area.\n\n6.2.6 Environmental Conditions\n\nMedia fills should be adequately representative of the conditions under which actual manufacturing operations are conducted. An inaccurate assessment (making the process appear cleaner than it actually is) can result from conducting a media fill under extraordinary air particulate and microbial quality, or under production controls and precautions taken in preparation for the media fill. To the extent standard operating procedures permit stressful conditions (e.g., maximum number of personnel present and elevated activity level), it is important that media fills include analogous challenges to support the validity of these studies. Stressful conditions do not include artificially created environmental extremes, such as reconfiguration of HVAC systems to operate at worst-case limits.\n\n6.2.7 Media\n\nIn general, a microbiological growth medium, such as soybean casein digest medium, should be used. Use of anaerobic growth media (e.g., fluid thioglycollate medium) should be considered in special circumstances. The media selected should be demonstrated to promote growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and yeast and mold (e.g., USP indicator organisms). The QC laboratory should determine if USP indicator organisms sufficiently represent production-related isolates. Environmental monitoring and sterility test isolates can be substituted (as appropriate) or added to the growth promotion challenge. Growth promotion units should be inoculated with a (<)100 CFU challenge. If the growth promotion testing fails, the origin of any contamination found during the simulation should nonetheless be investigated and the media fill promptly repeated.14\n\nFootnote 14: The cause of the growth promotion failure should also be investigated.\n\nThe production process should be accurately simulated using media and conditions that optimize detection of any microbiological contamination. Each unit should be filled with an appropriate quantity and type of microbial growth medium to contact the inner container closure surfaces (when the unit is inverted or thoroughly swirled) and permit visual detection of microbial growth.\n\nSome drug manufacturers have expressed concern over the possible contamination of the facility and equipment with nutrient media during media fill runs. However, if the medium is handled properly and is promptly followed by the cleaning, sanitizing, and, where necessary, sterilization of equipment, subsequently processed products are not likely to be compromised.\n\n6.2.8 Incubation and Examination of Media-Filled Units\n\nMedia units should be incubated under conditions adequate to detect microorganisms that might otherwise be difficult to culture. Incubation conditions should be established in accord with the following general guidelines:* Incubation temperature should be suitable for recovery of bioburden and environmental isolates and should at no time be outside the range of 20-35({}^{\\circ})C. Incubation temperature should be maintained within (\\pm 2.5^{\\circ})C of the target temperature.\n* Incubation time should not be less than 14 days. If two temperatures are used for the incubation of the media filled units, the units should be incubated for at least 7 days at each temperature (starting with the lower temperature).\n\nEach media-filled unit should be examined for contamination by personnel with appropriate education, training, and experience in inspecting media fill units for microbiological contamination. If QC personnel do not perform the inspection, there should be QC unit oversight throughout any such examination. All suspect units identified during the examination should be brought to the immediate attention of the QC microbiologist. To allow for visual detection of microbial growth, we recommend substituting clear containers (with otherwise identical physical properties) for amber or other opaque containers. If appropriate, other methods can also be considered to ensure visual detection.\n\nWhen a firm performs a final product inspection of units immediately following the media fill run, all integral units should proceed to incubation. Units found to have defects not related to integrity (e.g., cosmetic defect) should be incubated; units that lack integrity should be rejected. Erroneously rejected units should be returned promptly for incubation with the media fill lot.\n\nAfter incubation is underway, any unit found to be damaged should be included in the data for the media fill run, because the units can be representative of drug product released to the market. Any decision to exclude such incubated units (i.e., non-integral) from the final run tally should be fully justified and the deviation explained in the media fill report. If a correlation emerges between difficult to detect damage and microbial contamination, a thorough investigation should be conducted to determine its cause (see Section VI.B).\n\nWritten procedures regarding aseptic interventions should be clear and specific (e.g., intervention type; quantity of units removed), providing for consistent production practices and assessment of these practices during media fills. If written procedures and batch documentation are adequate to describe an associated clearance, the intervention units removed during media fills do not need to be incubated.15 Where procedures lack specificity, there would be insufficient justification for exclusion of units removed during an intervention from incubation. For example, if a production procedure requires removal of 10 units after an intervention at the stopping station infeed, batch records (i.e., for production and media fills) should clearly document conformance with this procedure. In no case should more units be removed during a media fill intervention than would be cleared during a production run.\n\nFootnote 15: To assess contamination risks during initial aseptic setup (before fill), valuable information can be obtained by incubating all such units that may be normally removed. These units are typically incubated separately, and would not necessarily be included in the acceptance criteria for the media fill.\n\nThe ability of a media fill run to detect potential contamination from a given simulated activity should not be compromised by a large-scale line clearance. We recommend incorporatingappropriate study provisions to avoid and address a large line clearance that results in the removal of a unit possibly contaminated during an unrelated event or intervention.\n\nAppropriate criteria should be established for yield16 and accountability (reconciliation of filled units). Media fill record reconciliation documentation should include a full accounting and description of units rejected from a batch.\n\nFootnote 16: Total units incubated/total number of units filled.\n\n9.1.9 Interpretation of Test Results\n\nThe process simulation run should be observed by the QC Unit, and contaminated units should be reconcilable with the approximate time and the activity being simulated during the media fill. Video recording of a media fill may serve as a useful aide in identifying personnel practices that could negatively affect the aseptic process.\n--------------------\nContext title: Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing — Current Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Industry""

Similarly, if Manufacturer A uses an outside facility for terminal sterilization of the prefilled syringe, Manufacturer A must also have appropriate controls over that sterilization service provider.125\n\nFootnote 124: In addition, because the device constituent part (syringe) is also a container/closure for the drug, Manufacturer A must perform acceptance testing of the syringe components in accordance with 21 CFR 211.84.\n\n3.3.4 21 CFR 820.100, Corrective and Preventive Actions\n\nManufacturer A is required to establish and maintain CAPA procedures for the combination product. Following are two examples of issues that might arise and exemplary steps for addressing them:\n\nExample 1: Manufacturer A has implemented in-process manufacturing verification procedures to confirm that the syringe is being filled with the correct amount of the drug, and the data from this verification are analyzed for potential nonconformities. Manufacturer A notes an increase in nonconformities relating to the volume of drug being put in the syringe and in turn opens a CAPA to investigate the problem. Upon investigation of the cause of the improper fill volume, Manufacturer A determines that maintenance procedures on the filling equipment are the cause of the incorrect fill volume. Manufacturer A updates the maintenance procedures and performs verification/validation testing to confirm that the changes correct the problem and do not cause new ones.\n\nExample 2: Manufacturer A begins receiving an increased number of customer complaints related to holes or other damage to the syringe's sterile package and opens a CAPA to investigate the issue. The CAPA reveals that Manufacturer B has made changes to a syringe component such that there are sharp edges that can damage the sterile pouch during shipping.\n\nManufacturer A works with Manufacturer B to eliminate the sharp edge or finds a new supplier. Manufacturer A also augments purchasing specifications and acceptance test steps to perform visual inspection of the syringe components. Manufacturer A repeats related design verification testing to ensure that the new syringe meets all design requirements and does not result in pouch damage during shipping.\n\n21 CFR 820.170, Installation and 820.200, Servicing Installation and servicing requirements would not apply to the prefilled syringe because the product does not require installation or servicing activities.\n\nAppendix B Drug-coated mesh\n\nb.1 Scenario Description\n\nManufacturer A plans to sell a synthetic surgical mesh coated with a drug. Manufacturer A has a marketing authorization to sell the uncoated mesh. Manufacturer A wants to coat the mesh with a drug to treat infection at the site of the product's implantation. Manufacturer B has an approval to market a drug for local administration to treat infection at the site of implantation of this class of device, but not in a formulation suitable for coating onto the mesh. Manufacturer A has established a business relationship with Manufacturer B to use the drug and develop the data needed to support Manufacturer A's marketing authorization for the coated mesh. Manufacturer B will manufacture the drug formulation for spraying onto the mesh, and Manufacturer A will manufacture the finished drug-coated mesh combination product.\n\nb.2 Compliance with QS regulation requirements\n\nThe coated mesh product is a single-entity combination product under 21 CFR 3.2(e)(1). Therefore, Manufacturer A is subject both to the drug CGMPs and the device QS regulation for this combination product. Accordingly, Manufacturer A must ensure that its CGMP operating system complies with both the device QS regulation and drug CGMPs, in accordance with one of the approaches permitted under 21 CFR 4.4. Because Manufacturer A is already marketing the uncoated mesh, it has an existing device QS regulation-based operating system, and chooses to operate under a device QS regulation-based streamlined approach for the combination product. This discussion focuses on design control and purchasing control considerations arising from inclusion of the drug constituent part in the combination product.\n\n21 CFR 820.30, Design Controls\n\nA focus of the design control process for the drug constituent part of the combination product is to ensure that the drug-coated mesh will be safe and effective for treating infection at the site of implantation. Accordingly, if the necessary dose of the drug for effective treatment of infection, for example, is already known, it would be an input (if the precise dose is not yet known, then an input would be that the product elute a safe and effective dose); design outputs\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:47]\n\nand the coating thickness (specified in process controls over the application of the coating by Manufacturer A). * A user need is that a physician be able to use the mesh product as labeled without damaging the drug coating or the mesh material. Manufacturer A would have to verify that the mechanical properties of the coated mesh are such that the product can withstand the stresses anticipated during the surgical procedure and still perform as intended.130 The results would be used to define and develop design outputs for the combination product, including in-process acceptance testing criteria during manufacturing, appropriate product specifications for the drug coated mesh, and instructions for use. * Another input to the design process is that the product have a shelf-life consistent with the stability of the drug formulation and the mesh. Manufacturer A would perform design verification testing such as bench testing after aging to confirm that the critical performance properties of the mesh material are not degraded during storage or as a result of contact with the drug coating, as well as stability studies131 to ensure that the properties of the drug are not degraded over the expected shelf life. The design outputs arising from this process would include the labeled expiration date and storage conditions for the combination product and packaging design specifications. * Risk analysis and mitigation The table below lists some potential risks associated with a surgical mesh coated with a drug, and potential mitigations for these risks.\n\nAll of the design control activities required by 21 CFR 820.30 (summarized in IV.A.2 above) must be addressed in the DHF for the drug-coated mesh. The information developed as a result of design control activities will be assessed as part of premarket review of this combination product (e.g., the suitability of the drug formulation and the compatibility of the mesh with the drug). Accordingly, much of the information included in the DHF would be submitted as part of the premarket review process. Manufacturer A may opt to incorporate such information into the DHF by cross-reference to such premarket documentation. Whatever approach Manufacturer A selects must ensure that all required design history information is readily available to FDA for review.\n\nThe DHF for the surgical mesh must include design input, output, verification and validation data, and the results of design reviews for the combination product. In developing the design controls related to the drug constituent part, Manufacturer A may rely on the safety, efficacy, quality and in situ dose data for the drug as independently marketed. These existing data that supported approval of the drug would be available as a reference for the combination product DHF to enable development of design inputs for the drug constituent part and the combination product as a whole, and thus facilitate its development process.\n\n5.2.2 21 Cfr 820.50, Purchasing Controls\n\nManufacturer A already has established procedures for controlling purchasing/supplier activities pursuant to 21 CFR 820.50. Under this provision, Manufacturer A must ensure that appropriate purchasing controls for Manufacturer B are established and maintained. In particular, based on risk associated with the drug and supplier, Manufacturer A must evaluate Manufacturer B as a potential supplier of the drug and establish the type and extent of control to be exercised over Manufacturer B as a selected supplier.132\n\nFootnote 132: See 21 CFR 820.50(a)(2).\n\nPurchasing controls (and acceptance activities under 21 CFR 211.84) with respect to the drug constituent part should focus on ensuring that Manufacturer B can supply the drug that meets the specifications that Manufacturer A has established during the design control process. Manufacturer A should establish purchasing agreements with Manufacturer B to ensure that Manufacturer A is notified of any changes that may affect the performance of the combination product prior to Manufacturer B's implementation of the changes. The notifications should address issues including changes in the drug specification, its components, composition of drug coating materials, or the drug manufacturing process or facility. Such proposed changes may require that Manufacturer A complete additional design verification and/or validation. For example, verification testing may be necessary to confirm that the purity and stability of the drug is maintained, pursuant to the requirements of 21 CFR 820.30(i).\n\n5.3 C.

We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n\nThe determination of the amount of added sugars contributed by a powdered fruit or vegetable juice that is added as an ingredient to a product and that is not reconstituted to single strength juice during processing (e.g., that is added to a pureed fruit or to a yogurt) would be the same as the determination of the sugars contributed by a liquid or frozen fruit or vegetable juice concentrate. In our response to question 11, we have suggested that when calculating the added sugars declaration for a product containing concentrated fruit or vegetable juice, the total moisture content of the finished product can be considered to go towards reconstitution of the fruit juice concentrate in the formulation. Thus, the total moisture content of a finished product formulated with powdered fruit or vegetable juice concentrates can be considered to contribute towards the dilution of the powdered fruit or vegetable juice. Further, the sugars contributed by the powdered fruit or vegetable juice that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type must be declared as added sugars on the label, as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule.\n8. Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates? We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12). We require that, when a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)). If you use Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 to calculate the amount of added sugars in a product containing juice concentrate, you must document this information in the records regarding the amount of added sugars added to the food during processing (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). If you use the amount of sugars present in a single strength juice and/or a juice concentrate, that is determined through chemical analysis or other available information, when calculating the amount of added sugars in a product containing fruit juice concentrate, you must document the source of the information and/or the amount of sugars determined through chemical analysis in the records that you make and keep (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). If a diluted juice concentrate slightly exceeds the amount of sugar that would be found in the same volume of the same type of 100 percent fruit juice, manufacturers should document the average and consistency with cGMPs in the records that they make and keep.\n9. Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis? The amount of added sugars declared on the label must be in grams (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The added sugars definition includes sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. For juice, the serving size is based on volume (e.g., 8 oz. or 240 ml) while the amount of added sugars per serving is based on weight. Therefore, when calculating the weight of added sugars per serving, you may need to consider the densities of both the finished juice product and the single strength juice of the same type. You may choose to arrive at the gram amount of added sugars in different ways. Please see our responses to questions 11 and 12 for examples of how to calculate the amount of added sugars in products containing concentrated fruit juices on both a volume and weight basis.\n10. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit or vegetable juice (juice made from a single type of fruit or vegetable) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength juice where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)? In the hypothetical example below, we provide three general steps to calculate the amount of added sugars (in grams) for an apple juice product (240 ml serving size) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength apple juice. The product in this hypothetical example is reconstituted to have juice soluble solids above the minimum Brixrequirement in 21 CFR 101.30 where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9). Therefore, all sugars in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice must be declared as added sugars. The apple juice example here uses the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration. This example is provided solely to demonstrate one method of calculating the added sugars content of the product. You can use alternate methods.\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals""

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.

It specifically explains how FDA intends to consider exercising enforcement discretion when a conflict occurs between compliance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), section 101.9(c), and compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(g) such that compliance with both sections is not possible.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nFDA\'s regulations in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 describe requirements for nutrition labeling in conventional foods and dietary supplements, respectively. The requirements for declaring the nutrient value in a serving of conventional food are in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8). Certain dietary ingredients in dietary supplements are also required to be declared in accordance with these requirements (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)). These dietary ingredients are listed in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2) and are referred to as ""(b)(2)-dietary ingredients."" Unlike nutrients in conventional food, the (b)(2)-dietary ingredients can only be declared when they are present in dietary supplements in amounts that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling according to 21 CFR 101.9(c) (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nFDA\'s regulations under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and (5) describe compliance requirements for declaring nutrients and dietary ingredients2 in nutrition labeling. A conventional food or dietary supplement declaring the amount of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in its labeling is misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)] if:\n\nFootnote 2: See 21 CFR 101.36(f)(1).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber is below 80 percent of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).3 Footnote 3: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of calories, total sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).4 Footnote 4: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).\n\nFor the remainder of this document, we refer to 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) as ""the compliance requirements.""\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nIn many cases, the amount of a nutrient or (b)(2)-dietary ingredient declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) will not conflict with the compliance requirements. However, certain small amounts of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients cannot be declared in accordance with both 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) and the compliance requirements. In these cases, the amount declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) is below or above the level provided by the compliance requirements.\n\nExample 1 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(iv), monounsaturated fat content must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams. Therefore, if the analyzed value of monounsaturated fat is 0.75 to 1.00 grams, the amount of monounsaturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 1.00 gram (or 1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value is 0.80 gram or greater. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value of monounsaturatedfat is 0.75 to 0.79 gram because values in this range are not at least equal to 80 percent of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 1 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are below 80 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are greater than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable excesses of nutrients, such as monounsaturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nExample 2 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i), saturated fat must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams, unless the amount is less than 0.5 gram. Therefore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.50 to 0.74 gram, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 0.50 gram (0.5g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 0.50 to 0.60 gram. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.61 to 0.74 gram because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 0.50 gram.\n\nFurthermore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 1.00 to 1.24 grams, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i) is 1.00 gram (1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.20 grams or less. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.21 to 1.24 grams because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 2 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are above 20 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are less than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable deficiencies of nutrients, such as saturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nFor certain nutrients, such as total fat and its components (including monounsaturated fat and saturated fat), if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the amount must be expressed as zero in nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(c)). Unlike nutrients in conventional food, (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in dietary supplements must not be declared in nutrition labeling when the amount is zero (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nIV FDA\'s Policy\n\nAs discussed, when the analyzed value of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients present in small amounts is declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8), the declared amount may conflict with the compliance requirements. In such cases, we intend to consider the use of our enforcement discretion with respect to the compliance requirements and recommend that manufacturers declare nutrients and (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: 3. Do I need to take into consideration sugars from ingredients that are used in formulating my product when determining the added sugars declaration for a serving of my product?\n\nIngredients containing free mono- and disaccharides that meet our definition of added sugars need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (e.g. sugars from cane sugar and concentrated fruit juice added to sweeten an apple sauce). Manufacturers may need to work with ingredient suppliers to determine the amount of added sugars provided by ingredients used in formulating food products.\n\n4. Do the sugars in dried fruits meet the definition of added sugars?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we responded to comments on dried fruits (see response to comment 212, 81 FR 33742 at 33837). We said that dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them should not be considered to contain added sugars because they are essentially a dehydrated whole fruit and still retain the nutrients and other components of a whole fruit (e.g. diced dried apples). However, if additional sugar is added to a dried fruit, the sugar added to the dried fruit must be declared on the label as added sugars (81 FR 33742 at 33837).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5. Are the sugars used in the production of vinegar added sugars?\n\nIn the production of vinegar, naturally occurring sugars are first fermented into alcohol and then a secondary fermentation occurs in which alcohol is converted to vinegar. For most vinegar products, no sugars remain in the final product. Vinegars that do not contain any sugars in the finished food would not need an added sugars declaration. However, we are aware of some vinegars (e.g., balsamic vinegar) that are made using ingredients that are often used as sweeteners in foods, and that are similar to concentrated fruit juices (e.g., grape must). According to the definition of added sugars, sugars found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type are added sugars. Therefore, fruit juices that are concentrated before or during processing of some vinegars contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars. To the extent that sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are present in the finished product, the added sugars must be declared on the label and in labeling, as required in our Nutrition Facts label final rule. We understand that the manufacturing of vinegar involves several steps, and manufacturers need to consider the impact of these steps (e.g. potential concentration due to water loss when aged in wooden barrels) on the final added sugars declaration.\n\n6. The definition of added sugars excludes the ""fruit component of fruit spreads."" What constitutes the ""fruit component"" of a non-standardized fruit spread?\n\nPlease see our response to question 1 above. The fruit component of a non-standardized fruit spread would include whole fruits, pieces of fruit, dried fruit, fruit or vegetable pures (single strength or concentrated), fruit pulps, single strength juices, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders that are not made from fruit or vegetable juices.\n\n7. Do sugars found in fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the form of the fruit or vegetable (e.g., concentrated fruit and vegetable pures, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders) need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833), we explained that we excluded from the definition of ""added sugars"" whole fruit, fruit pieces, dried fruit, pulps, and pures because they are nutrient rich and maintain the basic properties of a fruit when added to foods and are not considered to contain added sugars (see response to comment 208, 81 FR 33742 at33835). We also explained that sugars from 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, and sugars from certain fruit and vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under certain regulations, fruit juice concentrates used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, and preserves under our standards of identity, and 100 percent juice concentrate sold directly to consumers (e.g. frozen orange juice concentrate) are excluded from the definition of ""added sugars.""\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833 through 33834), we explained that, while foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices can be a part of a healthful diet, the sugars added to the foods by the concentrated fruit or vegetable juice provide additional calories. Over the course of the day, small amounts of calories in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages can add up and make it difficult to balance the amount of calories expended (81 FR 33742 at 33834). For these reasons, we consider foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices to be sugar-sweetened foods (id).\n\nWe also explained that in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report (Ref. 1) (81 FR 33742 at 33835).\n\nWe are applying these same guiding principles when determining when the sugars in an ingredient are added sugars. Concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes, and some fruit and vegetable powders are essentially whole fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the physical form of the fruit or vegetable and to remove moisture. They maintain the basic properties of a whole fruit or vegetable, even if the peel and seeds may be removed. Their composition and use is more consistent with that of whole fruits or vegetables, dried fruits or vegetables, pulps and pureses than that of concentrated fruit juices, which are commonly used by industry in place of sugars. Therefore, the sugars in concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes and some fruit and vegetable powders contribute to the diet the same way that sugars found in whole fruits or vegetables do, and do not have to be declared as added sugars on the label. However, we consider sugars in powders made from fruit and vegetable juices to be the same as those found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices because such powders are essentially concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that have all moisture removed. Therefore, some or all sugars contributed by a powder made from fruit or vegetable juices must be declared as added sugars on the label as required by the Nutrition Facts label final rule, depending on the degree of reconstitution in the finished food.\n\nThe definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals'

Submit electronic comments to\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/dockets/ecomments. All comments should be identified with the Docket\n\nNumber 01D-0493. For questions regarding this document contact Jennifer A. Burnham,\n\n(240-402-2030). This guidance represents the agency\'s current thinking on reducing microbial food safety hazards in juice. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. This guidance document supercedes ""Warning and Notice Statement: Labeling of Juice Products Small Entity Compliance Guide,"" September 18, 1998.\n\nBackground\n\nIn the Federal Register of July 8, 1998 (63 FR 37030), the Food and Drug Administration\n\n(FDA) published a final rule requiring a warning label on any juice that has not been\n\nprocessed to prevent, reduce, or eliminate pathogenic microorganisms that may be present\n\n(the ""juice labeling rule""). In this guidance document, juice means any juice or juice\n\ningredient in a beverage, as defined by 21 CFR 120.1(a). Under 21 CFR 101.17(g), any juice or\n\njuice ingredient that is not processed to reduce pathogens by 100,000-fold (i.e., attain a 5-log\n\nreduction in the pertinent pathogenic microorganism) must bear a warning label. Becauselabeling may have limited effectiveness (i.e., it must be read and be understood), the warning label was intended to provide a measure of public safety until final Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations for juice could be established and implemented.\n\nIn the Federal Register of January 19, 2001 (66 FR 6138), FDA published a final rule requiring the application of HACCP principles to the processing of any juice or juice ingredient in a beverage (the ""juice HACCP rule""). Juice produced in a retail establishment, i.e., a facility that produces juice that is only sold directly to consumers, is exempt from the HACCP requirements. Like the juice labeling rule, the juice HACCP rule utilizes the standard of a 5-log reduction in the pertinent pathogenic microorganism. Specifically, under $120.24(a), juice processors must establish control measures that will produce such a reduction.\n\nAfter the publication of the juice labeling rule, FDA\'s scientific understanding of how to attain effectively a 5-log pathogen reduction evolved, as discussed in the preamble and as reflected in the requirements of the juice HACCP rule.\n\nPurpose of this Guidance\n\nThe purpose of this guidance document is to provide guidance to those juice processors not yet subject to the juice HACCP rule (e.g., small and very small processors who are not subject to the juice HACCP rule until January 21, 2003 and January 20, 2004, respectively) who are performing a 5-log pathogen reduction to attain exemption from the warning label requirement. This guidance document also provides guidance to processors at retail who are not subject to the juice HACCP rule and who are performing a 5-log pathogen reduction to attain exemption from the warning label requirement. FDA encourages those processors to operate consistently with this guidance in terms of 5-log pathogen reduction treatments because this guidance is based upon FDA\'s current scientific knowledge. In part, this guidance supercedes the previous 5-log pathogen reduction guidance in the juice labeling rule and FDA\'s guidance document, ""Warning and Notice Statement: Labeling of Juice Products Small Entity Compliance Guide"" (the ""small entity compliance guide"") (Ref. 1), because these documents no longer reflect FDA\'s current thinking.\n\nFDA Recommendations\n\nFDA\'s current scientific understanding of how to attain effectively a 5-log pathogen reduction is based on information obtained from public meetings, discussions, comments to the juice HACCP proposed rule (63 FR 20450), and recommendations from the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food (NACMCF) (Refs. 2 and 3). To assist juice processors in attaining a 5-log pathogen reduction consistent with current scientific knowledge, Table 1 compares FDA\'s previous and current recommendations for achieving the 5-log pathogen reduction. The following questions and answers provide additional guidance in terms of FDA\'s current recommendations for the 5-log reduction:Question: When in the process should the 5-log pathogen reduction treatment be applied? Answer: Based upon current scientific understanding, FDA recommends that the 5-log pathogen reduction and final product packaging occur under one firm\'s control, in a single production facility that is operating under current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) and immediately before or immediately after packing. This recommendation is for both citrus and non-citrus juices. Although good agricultural practices (GAPs) and CGMPs at the farming and harvesting stages are encouraged, they should not be counted towards the 5-log pathogen reduction. The basis for this recommendation is discussed in more detail in the juice HACCP rule (66 FR 6138 at 6166). Question: What should be treated? Answer: FDA recommends that juice processors use treatments that directly contact all pathogens that may be present in or on the fruit or vegetables being processed. For most products, this means that the treatments should be performed on the juice after it is expressed. For citrus juices only, effective surface treatment of the citrus fruit may constitute direct contact with all pathogens, and thus, processors may consider counting such treatment toward the 5-log pathogen reduction. If surface treatments are used on citrus fruits to achieve the 5-log pathogen reduction, FDA recommends that the treatment be applied to undamaged, tree-picked fruit (i.e., culled fruit that is U.S. Department of Agriculture choice or higher quality), that has been cleaned. (Note: There is no current USDA standard for choice or higher quality. FDA will consider undamaged tree-picked citrus fruit to meet the definition of ""culled"" for purposes of compliance with the juice HACCP regulation). The basis for this recommendation is discussed in more detail in the juice HACCP rule (66 FR 6138 at 6171).\n\nSummary\n\nSmall and very small processors (as defined in 21 CFR 120.1(b)) who do not treat their juice to achieve the 5-log pathogen reduction should continue to comply with the juice labeling rule. All other juice processors are now required by the juice HACCP regulation (21 CFR Part 120) to apply HACCP principles to their processing operations and to have, in any resulting HACCP plan, measures to achieve a 5-log reduction in pathogens. Based upon FDA\'s current knowledge, processing juice in accordance with the recommendations in the small entity compliance guide for the juice labeling rule may not reduce pathogens to an acceptable level. Therefore, juice processors claiming exemption from the warning label requirement on the basis of the 5-log pathogen reduction provision of 21 CFR 101.17(g)(7) should consider the principles in this guidance. On August 31, 2001, FDA published a guidance document, ""The Juice HACCP Regulation: Questions and Answers"" to provide additional information on the juice HACCP rule, including assistance in achieving a 5-log pathogen reduction. As a follow-up to that document, FDA plans to publish additional information in question and answer format that processors may find useful, as well as additional guidance documents including, ""Guidancefor Industry: Juice HACCP Hazards and Control Guide"" and ""Guidance on Bulk Transport of Juice Concentrates and Certain Shelf Stable Juices."" All documents will be available electronically.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] FDA, DHHS, ""Guidance for Industry: Warning and Notice Statement: Labeling of Juice Products Small Entity Compliance Guide,"" September 18, 1998.\n\n[2] FSIS, USDA, ""National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food (http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi2\n\n[3] dhname=1999 register&docid=99-30222-filed),"" 64 FR 63281-63282, November 19, 1999.\n\n[4] NACMCF, ""National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food, Meeting on Fresh Citrus Juice; Transcript of Proceedings,"" December 8 to 9, 1999, public meeting.\n\nThe above guidance document supercedes the previous version dated December 21, 2001.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Exemptions from the Warning Label Requirement for Juice'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: 11.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhile ""Calories from fat"" can no longer be declared, ""Calories from saturated fat"" is still allowed (21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(ii)). When declared, it is to be indented under the statement of calories and must be in a type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(5)).\n\n11.4 Where, and How, Do I Declare ""Added Sugars"" on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe statement ""Includes \'X\' g Added Sugars"" must be used to declare added sugars content (except on packages of single ingredient sugars), and this statement must be indented directly beneath the listing for ""Total Sugars"" on the Nutrition Facts label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The \'X\' will be filled in with the respective added sugar content (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). In Appendix B to 21 CFR 101, we illustrate our recommendation to shorten the length of the hairline requirement between total sugars and added sugars to help denote that ""added sugars"" are a subcomponent of ""total sugars."" As mentioned above, a DRV has been established for added sugars for most population groups, and the % Daily Value declaration is required as well (21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii)). Added sugars must also be declared on the Supplement Facts label (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAdded sugars content must be expressed to the nearest gram, except in the following circumstances:\n\nThe statement ""Contains less than 1 gram"" or, alternatively, ""less than 1 gram"" may be used if a serving contains less than 1 gram added sugars; or\n\nThe added sugars content may be expressed as zero if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram.\n\nSee 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii).\n\nIf a product contains less than 1 gram of added sugars per serving and no claims are made about sweeteners, sugars, or sugar alcohol content, then the declaration of the amount of added sugars is not required. If the added sugars content is therefore not declared, you must place the statement ""Not a significant source of added sugars"" at the bottom of the table of nutrient values (except as provided for in 101.9(f)) (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)).\n\n11.4 How Has the ""% Daily Value*"" Footnote Been Changed?\n\nThe final rule modified the footnote that refers to the ""% Daily Value"" column heading to provide clarity and a better explanation. The modified footnote now states that ""The % Daily Value tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice"" on all Nutrition Facts label formats on foods for the general population (21 CFR 101.9(d)(9)), with the exception of foods having minimal calories and with certain formats (i.e., the simplified display, infants through 12 months of age, children 1-3 years, and the linear and tabular displays for small or intermediate-sized packages), as described below. The footnote table listing DRVs for total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol,sodium, total carbohydrate, and dietary fiber for 2,000 and 2,500 calorie diets is no longer included as part of this footnote (81 FR 33742 at 33950).\n\nThe footnote may be omitted for products that can use the terms ""calorie free,"" ""free of calories,"" ""without calories,"" ""trivial source of calories,"" ""negligible source of calories,"" or ""dietary insignificant source of calories"" on the label or in the labeling of foods. However, the voluntary use of the first part of the footnote (""*The % Daily Value tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet."") is allowed for these foods (21 CFR 101.9(d)(9)).\n\nVIII.A.8 What Changes Need to be Made on Labels for Foods Represented or Purported to be Specifically for Infants Through 12 Months of Age or for Children 1 Through 3 Years of Age?\n\nThe next two figures reflect the Nutrition Facts labels for foods represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months of age (Figure 6) and for children 1 through 3 years of age (Figure 7). The nutrients declared for these subgroups must include calories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium (21 CFR 101.9(j)(5)(i)). Calories from saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and monounsaturated fat can now be voluntarily declared, if desired (see 21 CFR 101.9(c)).\n\nPercent DVs for total fat and potassium on the labeling of foods, other than infant formula, represented or purported to be for infants through 12 months of age are now required (see 21 CFR 101.9(d)(7) and (j)(5)). However, a percent DV declaration for saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, dietary fiber, and added sugars is not allowed on such foods. In addition, as with foods for all other populations, a percent DV declaration for trans fat and total sugars is not allowed, as no DRVs have been established for those nutrients (21 CFR 101.9(j)(5)(ii)(A)). No ""% Daily Value**"" footnote is to be declared either (21 CFR 101.9(j)(5)(ii)(A)).\n\nOn labels of foods, other than infant formula, represented or purported to be for children 1 through 3 years of age, the ""% Daily Value*"" footnote statement must read: ""The % Daily Value tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 1,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice"" (21 CFR 101.9(d)(9)), and a type size no smaller than 6 point must be used for the footnote (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)).\n\nVIII.B When Can I Use the Tabular Format?\n\nThe tabular format can be used when there is not sufficient continuous vertical space to accommodate the required components of the nutrition label, up to and including the mandatory declaration of potassium (21 CFR 101.9(d)(11)(iii)). This is different than the tabular format for\n\nFigure 6: Infants through 12 Months of Age (21 CFR 101.9(j)(5)(ii)(B))\n\nFigure 7: Children 1 through 3 Years (21 CFR 101.9(j)(5)(ii)(B))small or intermediate-sized packages (see Section VIII.C below). Figure 8 reflects the tabular format.\n\n2.1 How Does the Declaration of Calories in the Tabular Format Differ from that of the Standard Vertical Label Version?\n\nIn the tabular format, the word ""Calories"" must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point, instead of 16 point as required for the standard vertical label (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). The 10-point type size for calories is also required for the tabular display for small and intermediate-sized packages (see section VIII.C) and the tabular dual column display (see section VIII.D) (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)).\n\n2.2 How Do the Declarations of Serving Size and Servings Per Container in the Tabular Format Differ from the Standard Vertical Label Version?\n\nThe "" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container"" declaration is the same as required for the standard vertical label version. However, the declaration of ""Serving size,"" which is listed below the "" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container"" declaration, must be highlighted in bold or extra bold and in a type size no smaller than 9 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i)). This format is also the same for the tabular display for small and intermediate-sized packages (see section VIII.C) and the tabular dual column display (see section VIII.D) (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i)).\n\n2.3 VIII.C How Do I Comply with These Requirements if My Food Packaging Only Has a Total Surface Area Available to Bear Labeling of 40 or Less Square Inches?\n\nWe allow modifications of the Nutrition Facts label for foods in packages with a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches. One modification is allowing the use of the tabular display for small packages or intermediate-sized packages if the product has a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches and neither the standard vertical display (see Figures 3-5) nor the tabular display (see Figure 8) can be accommodated (21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)). See Figure 9.\n\nFigure 8: Tabular Display\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:28]\n\n11.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe third modification is the use of abbreviations, as listed in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B). We now allow for the following additional abbreviations on labels for small and intermediate-sized packages: ""vitamin"" may be abbreviated as ""Vit.,"" ""potassium"" may be abbreviated as ""Potas.,"" and ""Includes"" may be abbreviated as ""Incl."" These abbreviations will further conserve label space. In addition, we allow the abbreviations of ""Total carb."" and ""Incl."" to be used on dual-column display labels (see section VIII.D).\n\n3.3 What Type Size Must be Used for the Declaration of Calories on the Tabular or Linear Displays for Small or Intermediate-Sized Packages?\n\nThe numeric value for ""Calories"" must be in a type size no smaller than 14 point, and the word ""Calories"" must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n3.4 How Do the Declarations of Serving Size and Servings Per Container on the Tabular or Linear Displays for Small or Intermediate-Sized Packages Differ from the Standard Label Version?\n\nThe "" -- servings per container"" declaration immediately follows the ""Nutrition Facts"" heading, as in the standard label version; however, it must be in a type size no smaller than 9 point on the tabular or linear display for small packages (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i)). If a linear display is used, then the actual number of servings (i.e., ""Servings"" as shown in Fig 10) may be listed instead of the servings per container declaration.\n\nThe declaration of ""Serving size,"" which follows below the "" -- servings per container"" or ""servings"" declaration, is to be highlighted in bold or extra bold and in a type size no smaller than 9 point on the tabular or linear display for small or intermediate-sized packages. See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n11.3.5 Is the ""% Daily Value*"" Footnote Required on Foods in Small and Intermediate-Sized Packages?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: VIIILG How Do These New Formatting Rules Affect the Percentage Juice Declaration?\n\nFigure 16: Simplified Format Label (101.9(f))\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWith the changes to some type size requirements on the Nutrition Facts label, it is permissible if the percentage juice declaration for foods purporting to be beverages that contain fruit or vegetable juice is smaller in height than the declaration of ""Serving size,"" ""Calories,"" and the numerical value for ""Calories,"" in addition to already being permitted to be smaller in height than the brand name, product name, logo, universal product code, and ""Nutrition Facts"" heading (21 CFR 101.30(e)(2)).\n\n4.2.3 VIII.H Are There Specific Formatting Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels?\n\nInformation other than the title, headings, and footnotes must be in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Column headings (e.g., ""Amount Per Serving"" and ""% Daily Value"") and footnotes (e.g., ""Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet"") must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Because many dietary supplement products may contribute a negligible amount of calories, we do not require information about calories to be displayed in a larger type size or highlighted on Supplement Facts labels (81 FR 33742 at 33939).\n\nFor small packages which have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, all information within the nutrition label must be in type size no smaller than 4.5 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(i)).\n\nIntermediate-sized packages, which have from 12 to 40 square inches of surface area available to bear labeling, have different type size requirements. All information within the nutrition label must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)). However, type size no smaller than 4.5 point may be used on packages that have less than 20 square inches available for labeling and more than eight dietary ingredients to be listed (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)). Similarly, type size no smaller than 4.5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches available for labeling and more than 16 dietary ingredients to be listed (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)).\n\nThe footnote stating that the ""Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet"" is required if the percent DV is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, protein, or added sugars (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D)). On labels of products represented or purported to be for use by children 1 through 3 years of age, the footnote statement must read: ""Percent Daily Values are based on a 1,000 calorie diet"" if the % Daily Value is declared for total fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, protein, or added sugars (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D)).\n\nIf there is inadequate space to list the required information vertically, the list may be split. The list to the right must be set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the dietary ingredients and percent DV information given to the left (21 CFR 101.36(e)(12)). The column headings are also repeated (21 CFR 101.36(e)(12)). Figure 17 reflects this label formatting.\n\nIX When Must I Comply with the Rule?\n\nIf you have $10 million or more in annual food sales, your compliance date is January 1, 2020. If you have less than $10 million in annual food sales, your compliance date is January 1, 2021.\n\nIf you manufacture single-ingredient packages and/or containers of pure honey, pure maple syrup, or other pure sugars and syrups, as well as the cranberry products discussed in the Final Guidance (Ref. 1), we intend to exercise enforcement discretion until July 1, 2021, for compliance with the labeling changes outlined in the Nutrition Facts label rule and the Serving Size rule.\n\nIf you manufacture certain dried cranberry products with added flavorings (Ref. 11), we intend to exercise enforcement discretion until July 1, 2020, for compliance with the labeling changes outlined in the Nutrition Facts label final rule and the Serving Size final rule.\n\nX Why Must I Comply with the Rule?\n\nFailure to comply with the final rule will render the covered food misbranded under section 403(q) of the FD&C Act and potentially other sections as well. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is misbranded constitutes a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act. Among potential consequences, committing a prohibited act can result in injunction and/or seizure (see sections 302 and 304 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 332 and 334)).\n\nFigure 17: Supplement Facts Label – Split List (101.36(e)(12))\n\nXI References\n\nThe following references are on display at the Dockets Management Staff ((HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852) and are available for viewing by interested persons between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday; they are also available electronically at https://www.regulations.gov.
