An ANDA applicant requesting a proprietary name should submit that request when the ANDA is submitted to help ensure that an acceptable name is available at the time of approval. When requesting a proprietary name, a separate electronic submission should be made and identified as a ""REQUEST FOR PROPRIETARY NAME REVIEW.""35\n\nFootnote 35: See the guidance for industry Contents of a Complete Submission for the Evaluation of Proprietary Names (Rev.1).\n\nFootnote 36: Section 314.94(a)(3). See also the draft guidance for industry Referencing Approved Drug Products in ANDA Submissions. When final, this guidance will represent the FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\n1.12.11: Contains the basis for submission.37 The applicant should provide: (1) the name of the RLD, (2) the application number of the RLD, and (3) the holder of the application for the RLD.\n\nIf the generic drug differs from the RLD in strength, route of administration, dosage form, or in that one active ingredient is substituted for one of the active ingredients in a listed combination drug product, applicants must first submit a suitability petition to FDA\'s Division of Dockets Management to obtain permission to file their ANDA.38 FDA will review the suitability petition to determine whether the requested change from the listed drug will impact the safety and effectiveness of the generic product and if any applicable requirements of the Pediatric Research Equity Act may be waived. The suitability petition must be approved by FDA before the ANDA is submitted.39 For an ANDA based on an approved petition under 21 CFR 10.30 or 314.93, the name of the RLD in section 1.12.11 must be the same as the listed drug in the petition, and section 1.12.11 must contain the FDA docket number for the petition and a copy of FDA\'s correspondence approving the suitability petition.40 When an applicant submits a petitioned ANDA, the basis for submission is the RLD and the approved suitability petition. Section 1.12.11 should contain (1) the name of the RLD, which must be the same as the listed drug identified in the approved suitability petition, (2) a reference to the suitability petition\'s FDA-assigned document number, and (3) a copy of FDA\'s correspondence approving the suitability petition.41({}^{,})42 When an ANDA applicant seeks approval of a generic drug that is a duplicate of adrug product in an approved petitioned ANDA (and for which the same drug has not been approved under section 505(c) of the FD&C Act), the basis for submission is the RLD and the approved suitability petition. Section 1.12.11 should contain: (1) the RLD, which must be the same as the listed drug identified in the approved suitability petition, and RLD application number; (2) a reference to the suitability petition\'s FDA-assigned docket number; and (3) a copy of FDA\'s correspondence approving the suitability petition. The first petitioned ANDA approved should be used for and identified in the appropriate sections of a subsequent ANDA as the reference standard. However, the RLD for that subsequent ANDA remains the listed drug referenced in the approved suitability petition.43\n\nFootnote 43: See the draft guidance for industry Referencing Approved Drug Products in ANDA Submissions.\n\n1.12.12 Contains information demonstrating that the generic product is the same as the RLD.44_Same as_ means that the generic product is identical to the RLD in ""active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use, except that conditions of use for which approval cannot be granted because of exclusivity or an existing patent may be omitted.""45 To demonstrate that the proposed generic drug product meets this standard, applicants should provide:\n\nFootnote 44: See section 505(j)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act and § 314.94.\n\nFootnote 45: 21 CFR 314.92(a)(1).\n\nFootnote 46: Section 314.94(a)(4).\n\nFootnote 47: Section 314.94(a)(5).\n\nFootnote 48: Section 314.94(a)(6).\n\nFootnote 49: See the guidance for industry Variations in Drug Products That May Be Included in a Single ANDA for exceptions.\n\nA statement that the conditions of use for the generic product have been previously approved for the RLD46\n\nFootnote 47: See the draft guidance for industry Referencing Approved Drug Products in ANDA Submissions.\n\nInformation to show that the active ingredient(s) in the generic drug product is/are the same as the active ingredient(s) in the RLD47\n\nFootnote 48: See section 505(j)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act and § 314.94.\n\nFootnote 49: 21 CFR 314.92(a)(1).\n\nFootnote 46: Section 314.94(a)(4).\n\nFootnote 47: Section 314.94(a)(5).\n\nFootnote 48: Section 314.94(a)(6).\n\nFootnote 49: See the guidance for industry Variations in Drug Products That May Be Included in a Single ANDA for exceptions.\n\nInformation to show that the route of administration, dosage form, and strength of the generic drug product are the same as those of the RLD48\n\nFootnote 49: See the guidance for industry Variations in Drug Products That May Be Included in a Single ANDA for exceptions.\n\nAs applicable, information to indicate the strength of the generic drug product used in the in vivo bioequivalence (BE) studies (fasting and fed) to demonstrate BE of the generic drug product to the RLD\n\nFDA recommends that applicants submit, within their original application, all strengths that they intend to market.

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 , Do DMF holders need to wait for a new ANDA applicant to request a letter of authorization before the DMF is assessed to be available for reference?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:1]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCompleteness Assessments for Type II API DMFs Under GDUFA Guidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended for holders of Type II active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) drug master files (DMFs) that are or will be referenced in an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), an amendment to an ANDA, a prior approval supplement (PAS) to an ANDA, or an amendment to a PAS (generic drug submissions). The guidance explains that, as of October 1, 2012, under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012, commonly referred to as GDUFA:2\n\nFootnote 2: Public Law 112-144, Title III.\n\nDMF holders are required to pay a DMF fee when first authorizing the reference of their DMF in a generic application3 Footnote 3: For these purposes, such authorization is deemed to have occurred when the DMF “is referenced on or after October 1, 2012, in a generic drug submission by an initial letter of authorization,” Section 744B(a)(2)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 379j-42(a)(2)(A).\n\nType II API DMFs must undergo an FDA completeness assessment (CA)\n\nThe guidance makes recommendations about the information that should be included in the DMF to facilitate a GDUFA CA. The guidance does not apply to Type II API DMFs used to support new drug applications (NDAs), biologics license applications (BLAs),4 other submissions that are not generic drug submissions, or any other types of DMFs.5\n\nFootnote 4: Type II API, API intermediate, and drug product DMFs are not used to support BLAs submitted pursuant to sections 351(a) and 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262).\n\nFootnote 5: See section 744A(7) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 379j-41(7)).\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nUnder GDUFA, beginning October 1, 2012, the holder of a Type II API DMF must pay a one-time DMF fee when the DMF is first referenced in a generic drug submission submitted to FDA on the basis of a letter of authorization (LOA) from the DMF holder.6 Also under GDUFA, holders of Type II API DMFs that were evaluated before October 1, 2012, must pay a one-time fee for the DMF when their DMF is first referenced in a new ANDA, an ANDA or PAS amendment, or an ANDA PAS on or after October 1, 2012.7 Only Type II API DMFs for use in generic drug submissions incur this one-time fee.\n\nFootnote 6: Section 744B(a)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 379j-42(a)(2)). For discussion of LOAs, see 21 CFR 314.420(b) and 314.50(g)(1).\n\nFootnote 7: The fee amount will be announced in the Federal Register not later than 60 days before the start of the fiscal year (generally on or about August 1 of the previous fiscal year).\n\nUnder GDUFA, Type II API DMFs intended for reference in a generic drug submission for which the fee is paid will undergo a CA. Section 744B(a)(2)(D)(iii) of the FD&C Act requires FDA to make publicly available on its Web site a list of DMF numbers that correspond to DMFs that, having successfully undergone a CA in accordance with criteria to be published by FDA, are available for reference.\n\nAlthough the requirement for a CA for Type II API DMFs is new, FDA has previously evaluated DMFs in accordance with the criteria set out in the GDUFA Completeness Assessment Checklist for Type II API DMFs (CA Checklist), attached to this guidance as Appendix 1. In order to ensure adequate time for the CA, FDA strongly encourages the DMF holder to submit a complete DMF and pay the DMF fee at least 6 months prior to the submission of an ANDA or PAS that will rely on the DMF. When submitting a DMF, the DMF holder should also submit Form FDA 3794, the Generic Drug User Fee Cover Sheet, which includes the minimum information necessary for FDA to determine whether a DMF holder has satisfied all relevant user fee obligations.8\n\nFootnote 8: See http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/UCM322676.pdf.\n\nDMF holders are encouraged to submit their DMFs using the Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) format.9 More information is available on the eCTD format on FDA's Web site.10\n\nFootnote 9: Note that 24 months after the guidance for industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format – Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specification is finalized (i.e., May 5, 2017), DMFs will be required to be submitted using the eCTD format pursuant to the implementation timeline identified in the final guidance.\n\nFootnote 10: See information about electronic submissions at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/ucm153574.htm.\nFDA will perform a CA once a DMF holder files a Type II API DMF11 with the Form FDA 3794 and there is an initial verification of the fee payment. The CA does not replace the full scientific review, which determines whether the information contained in the DMF is adequate to support an ANDA regulatory action.\n\nFootnote 11: See FDA’s Web site on Drug Master Files at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/DrugMasterFilesDMFs/default.htm.\n\nIn brief, FDA will undertake a CA to determine the following:\n\nIs the DMF active?\n\nHas the fee been paid?\n\nHas the DMF been previously reviewed?\n\nDoes the DMF pertain to a single API?\n\nDoes the DMF contain certain administrative information?\n\nDoes the DMF contain all the information necessary to enable a scientific review?12\n\nFootnote 12: Id.\n\nIs the DMF written in English?13\n\nFootnote 13: If any part of the application is in a foreign language, an accurate and complete English translation shall be appended to such part. See 21 CFR 314.101(d)(5).\n\nFDA will conduct the CA by determining the answers to a series of questions listed in the CA Checklist, which is included in Appendix 1. DMFs for which the fee has been paid and which have been found complete in accordance with the criteria for a CA set out in the CA Checklist will be identified on FDA's public Web site as available for reference in support of a generic drug submission.\n\nFor complex APIs, in addition to the recommendations in the CA Checklist, DMF holders should ensure the DMF provides the data necessary for the Agency to review the DMF with respect to active ingredient sameness. Information on active ingredient sameness is discussed in the product's specific bioequivalence (BE) guidance when it becomes available on FDA's Web site.14\n\nFootnote 14: For example, for enoxaparin sodium: listed sameness equivalence criteria in the draft guidance include mode of depolymerization, source material, physicochemical properties, disaccharide building blocks, fragment mapping, sequence of oligosaccharide species, and biological and biochemical assays. If the appropriate product-specific data is not in the DMF, the DMF will be deemed incomplete.\n\nIn accordance with the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments Reauthorization Performance Goals and Program Enhancements (GDUFA II Commitment Letter),15 FDA committed to complete the initial CA review for 90% of Type II API DMFs within 60 days of the later of the date of DMF submission or DMF fee payment.\n\nFootnote 15: Available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM370352.pdf.\nFDA will use the CA Checklist to perform the CA. At the top of the cover page of the CA Checklist, FDA will fill in basic information about the DMF, including its name, number, receipt date, and whether the DMF was submitted in electronic or paper format.\n\nThe FDA will also note whether the primary DMF the ANDA references refers to any other DMFs (subject DMFs). A primary DMF can reference subject DMFs, which provide additional information needed to completely describe the manufacture of an API.16 Before submitting its DMF, the primary DMF holder should check with the holders of any referenced subject DMFs to make sure the subject DMFs are filed with FDA and FDA still considers them active.\n\nFootnote 16: For example, a subject DMF may describe the manufacture of a material used in producing the active ingredient. If a subject DMF does not meet the definition of a Type II API DMF, it will not incur a DMF fee.\n\nIs the DMF Active?\n\nBefore assigning a DMF to a reviewer for a CA, FDA will confirm that the DMF is active.17 If the primary DMF or any referenced subject DMFs on file at FDA are inactive, FDA will consider the primary DMF incomplete and send a letter notifying the DMF holder.\n\nFootnote 17: “Active” is defined in the Definitions section of this guidance.\n\n2 Has the DMF fee been paid?\n--------------------\nContext title: Completeness Assessments for Type II API DMFs Under GDUFA Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 , Do DMF holders need to wait for a new ANDA applicant to request a letter of authorization before the DMF is assessed to be available for reference?\n--------------------\nContext: If the DMF holder addresses all the deficiencies and amends the DMF or completely updates the DMF per the CA request, the FDA will complete its CA. If the DMF is then found complete, the DMF number will be made publicly available on FDA\'s Web site.\n\nIf a generic drug submission contains all the necessary API information and does not reference a DMF, the generic drug submission applicant will be required to pay the (a)(3)(F) fee.

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 , Do DMF holders need to wait for a new ANDA applicant to request a letter of authorization before the DMF is assessed to be available for reference?\n--------------------\nContext: 23.8.25.2.11:14 & Drug Master Files: Guidelines I FDA\n\nVI. PROCESSING AND REVIEW POLICIES\n\nVI. A. Policies Related to Processing Drug Master Files\n\nVI. A.1.\n\nPublic availability of the information and data in a DMF is\n\ndetermined under 21 CFR Part 20, 21 CFR 314.420(e), and 21 CFR\n\n314.430.\n\nVI. A.2.\n\nAn original DMF submission will be examined on receipt to\n\ndetermine whether it meets minimum requirements for format and\n\ncontent. If the submission is administratively acceptable, FDA will\n\nacknowledge its receipt and assign it a DMF number.\n\nIf the submission is administratively incomplete or inadequate, it will be returned to the\n\nsubmitter with a letter of explanation from the Drug Master File Staff, and it will not be assigned a DMF number.\n\nVI. B. Drug Master File Review\n\nA DMF IS NEVER APPROY OR DISAPPROVED.\n\nThe agency will review information in a DMF only when an IND sponsor, an applicant for an\n\nNDA, ANDA, or Export Application, or another DMF holder incorporates material in the\n\nDMF by reference. As noted, the incorporation by reference must be accompanied by a copy\n\nof the DMF holder's letter of authorization.\n\nIf FDA reviewers find deficiencies in the information provided in a DMF, a letter describing\n\nthe deficiencies is sent to the DMF holder. At the same time, FDA will notify the person who\n\nrelies on the information in the deficient DMF that additional information is needed in the\n\nsupporting DMF. The general subject of the deficiency is identified, but details of the\n\ndeficiency are disclosed only to the DMF holder. When the holder submits the requested\n\ninformation to the DMF in response to the agency's deficiency letter, the holder should also\n\nsend a copy of the accompanying transmittal letter to the affected persons relying on the\n\nDMF and to the FDA reviewing division that identified the deficiencies. The transmittal letter\n\nwill provide notice that the deficiencies have been addressed.\n\n(\\blacktriangle)\n\nTop 0\n\nVII. HOLder obligations\n\nAny change or addition, including a change in authorization related to specific customers, should be submitted in duplicate and adequately cross referenced to previous submission(s). The reference should include the date(s), volume(s), section(s), and/or page number(s) affected.\n\nVII. A. Notice Required for Changes to a Drug Master File\n\nA holder must notify each affected applicant or sponsor who has referenced its DMF of any pertinent change in the DMF (21 CFR 314. 420(c)). Notice should be provided well before making the change in order to permit the sponsor/applicant to supplement or amend any affected application(s) as needed.\n\nVII. B. Listing of Persons Authorized To Refer to a Drug Master File\n\nVII. B.1.\n\nA DMF is required to contain a complete list of persons authorized to incorporate information in the DMF by reference [21 CFR 314.420(d)]. The holder should update the list in the annual update. The updated list should contain the holder's name, DMF number, and the date of the update. The update should identify by name (or code) the information that each person is authorized to incorporate and give the location of that information by date, volume, and page number.\n\nVII. B.2.\n\nAny person whose authorization has been withdrawn during the previous year should be identified under a suitable caption.\n\nVII. B.3.\n\nIf the list is unchanged on the anniversary date, the DMF holder should also submit a statement that the list is current.\n\nVII. C. Annual Update\n\nThe holder should provide an annual report on the anniversary date of the original submission. This report should contain the required list as described in B.1., and should also identify all changes and additional information incorporated into the DMF since the previousannual report on the subject matter of the DMF. If the subject matter of the DMF is unchanged, the DMF holder should provide a statement that the subject matter of the DMF is current. Failure to update or to assure FDA annually that previously submitted material and lists in the DMF remain current can cause delays in FDA review of a pending IND, NDA, ANDA, Export Application, or any amendment or supplement to such application; and FDA can initiate procedures for closure of the DMF (see Section IX).\n\nVII. D. Appointment of an Agent\n\nWhen an agent is appointed, the holder should submit a signed letter of appointment to the DMF giving the agent's name, address, and scope of responsibility (administrative and/or scientific). Domestic DMF holders do not need to appoint an agent or representative, although foreign DMF holders are encouraged to engage a U.S. agent.\n\nVII. E. Transfer of Ownership\n\nTo transfer ownership of a DMF to another party, the holder should so notify FDA and authorized persons in writing. The letter should include the following:\n\nName of transferee\n\nAddress of transferee\n\nName of responsible official of transferee\n\nEffective date of transfer\n\nSignature of the transferring official\n\nTypewritten name and title of the transferring official.\n\nThe new holder should submit a letter of acceptance of the transfer and an update of the information contained in the DMF, where appropriate. Any change relating to the new ownership (e.g., plant location and methods) should be included.\n\nVIII. Major Reorganization of a Drug Master File\n\nA holder who plans a major reorganization of a DMF is encouraged to submit a detailed plan of the proposed changes and request its review by the Drug Master File Staff. The staff should be given sufficient time to comment and provide suggestions before a major reorganization is undertaken.\n\nIX. Closure of a Drug Master File\n\nA holder who wishes to close a DMF should submit a request to the Drug Master File Staff stating the reason for the closure. See Section IV.D.5.a for the address.\n\nThe request should include a statement that the holder's obligations as detailed in Section VII have been fulfilled.\n\nThe Agency may close a DMF that does not contain an annual update of persons authorized to incorporate information in the DMF by reference and a list of changes made since the previous annual report. The holder will be notified of FDA's intent to close the DMF.\n\nMany of the guidelines referred to in the text and a current list of available guidelines may be obtained from the following:\n\nLegislative, Professional, and Consumer Affairs Branch (HFD-365)\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nCopies of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) may be purchased from the following:\n\nSuperintendent of Documents\n\nU.S. Government Printing Office\n\nWashington, D.C. 20402\n\nDate updated: March 11, 2005\n\nSubmit Comments Online (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2014-D-0397)\n\nYou can submit online or written comments on any guidance at any time (see 21 CFR 10.115(g)(5))\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll written comments should be identified with this document's docket number: FDA-2014-D-0397\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2014-D-0397).\n\nSearch for FDA\n\nGuidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n\nTop (0\n--------------------\nContext title: Drug Master Files- Guidelines""

Confidentiality of Information\n\nAll information contained in a master file (DMF or VMF) is considered confidential. Further, it is Center policy not to make known the existence of specific master files. Rather, it is the responsibility of a sponsor to make sure that a master file (DMF or VMF) is available and request authorization for FDA referral.\n\nVIII. Authorization to Refer to a Master File\n\nLetter of Authorization\n\nBefore FDA can review VMF or DMF information in support of an application, the holder must submit in duplicate to the master file a letter of authorization permitting FDA to reference the master file.\n\nThe letter of authorization should include the following:\n\no Date of letter\n\no Name of Veterinary Master File holder\n\no VMF or DMF number\n\no Name of persons authorized to incorporate\n\ninformation in the MF by reference.\n\no Specific products covered by the master file\n\no Sections, volumes and page numbers to be\n\nreferenced\n\no Statement of commitment that the master file is\n\ncurrent and that the holder will abide with the\n\nstatements made in it.\n\no Signature of the authorizing official/agent\n\no Typed name and title of the official authorizing\n\nreference to the file.\n\nThe holder should also send a copy of the letter of authorization to the\n\naffected applicant, sponsor or other holder who is authorized to incorporate\n\nby reference the specific information contained in the master file.\n\nIX. Ownership Transfer/name Change\n\nTo transfer ownership of a VMF to another party, the holder should notify the\n\nCenter for Veterinary Medicine and authorized persons in writing.\n\nThe letter should include the following information:\n\no Name of Holder/Transferee\n\no Address of Holder/Transferee\n\no Name of responsible official of the transferee\n\no Effective date of transfer\n\no Signature of the responsible transferring official\n\no Typewritten name and title of the transferring official The new holder should submit a letter of acceptance indicating the acceptance of the document and all existing responsibilities. The holder should provide an update of the information in the file, where appropriate, as soon as possible to indicate if any changes (e.g., plant location and methods) have or will take place.\n\nX. Reorganization of the Veterinary Master File\n\nA holder who plans a major reorganization of a VMF is encouraged to submit a detailed plan of the proposed changes and request its review and evaluation by the Division of Chemistry. All authorized users should also be notified when any changes are made in any operation that may affect the applicants products.\n\nXI. Closure of a Veterinary Master File\n\nA holder who wishes to close a master file should submit a request to the Center citing the reason for the closure. The letter should include a statement that the holder's obligations have been fulfilled and all users have been notified.\n\nThe Center may close a VMF that does not contain an annual update and a list of changes made since the previous annual update. The holder will be notified of FDA's intent to close the VMF.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #57 Preparation and Submission of Veterinary Master Files""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 , Do DMF holders need to wait for a new ANDA applicant to request a letter of authorization before the DMF is assessed to be available for reference?\n--------------------\nContext: In accordance with the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments Reauthorization Performance Goals and Program Enhancements (GDUFA II Commitment Letter),15 FDA committed to complete the initial CA review for 90% of Type II API DMFs within 60 days of the later of the date of DMF submission or DMF fee payment.\n\nFootnote 15: Available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM370352.pdf.\nFDA will use the CA Checklist to perform the CA. At the top of the cover page of the CA Checklist, FDA will fill in basic information about the DMF, including its name, number, receipt date, and whether the DMF was submitted in electronic or paper format.\n\nThe FDA will also note whether the primary DMF the ANDA references refers to any other DMFs (subject DMFs). A primary DMF can reference subject DMFs, which provide additional information needed to completely describe the manufacture of an API.16 Before submitting its DMF, the primary DMF holder should check with the holders of any referenced subject DMFs to make sure the subject DMFs are filed with FDA and FDA still considers them active.\n\nFootnote 16: For example, a subject DMF may describe the manufacture of a material used in producing the active ingredient. If a subject DMF does not meet the definition of a Type II API DMF, it will not incur a DMF fee.\n\nIs the DMF Active?\n\nBefore assigning a DMF to a reviewer for a CA, FDA will confirm that the DMF is active.17 If the primary DMF or any referenced subject DMFs on file at FDA are inactive, FDA will consider the primary DMF incomplete and send a letter notifying the DMF holder.\n\nFootnote 17: “Active” is defined in the Definitions section of this guidance.\n\n2 Has the DMF fee been paid?\n\nBefore assigning a DMF to a reviewer for a CA, FDA will confirm that the DMF fee has been paid. If it has not, FDA will not assign the DMF for CA. ANDA applicants that reference a DMF for which a fee is due will be notified that the DMF holder has not paid the fee. If the DMF fee is not paid within 20 days after notification, FDA will refuse to receive the ANDA referencing the DMF.\n\nHas the DMF been previously reviewed for chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) by FDA in the context of a review of a prior application?\n\nIf FDA has reviewed the DMF for CMC after November 30, 2007, the DMF will be considered to have passed the CA without further analysis. If the DMF was reviewed for CMC prior to November 30, 2007, a CA assessment will need to be performed. For all DMFs that have not previously received a full CMC review, a CA assessment will need to be performed. If the DMF has not previously received this full review, it will be assigned to a reviewer for a CA.\n\n3 Check of Completeness Assessment Elements\n\nFDA will complete the administrative part of the CA Checklist (i.e., ""General Information"") during the CA. If the DMF is incomplete, FDA will send the DMF holder a GDUFA DMF Incomplete Letter. With certain exceptions specified in this guidance document, this letter will provide comments about each element that resulted in an incomplete designation for the CA.\n\nIf an item is marked ""n/a"" and does not apply to the DMF, the element is treated the same as if it were marked ""yes.""1. Is the subject of the DMF a single API produced by one manufacturing process?\n\nThe subject of a DMF should be limited to one API and one manufacturing process. If a DMF includes information on more than one API or more than one manufacturing process for an API, the DMF will be deemed incomplete. If the DMF describes multiple APIs, the DMF holder should file separate DMFs for each API. Similarly, if there are multiple manufacturing processes for an API, the DMF holder should file separate DMFs for each manufacturing process.\n\n2 Does the DMF holder need to submit a complete update?\n\nIf the DMF is in paper format and it has been five years or more since the DMF received a complete update,18 or if there have been more than five amendments to the DMF, the DMF holder should provide a complete and comprehensive update to it. If such a DMF has not received an update, FDA will consider the DMF incomplete. The DMF holder must submit a complete update for FDA to determine whether it passes the CA.19\n\nFDA believes that the remainder of the CA Checklist is self-explanatory.\n\nFootnote 18: All changes must be reported as amendments. Annual reports are NOT to be used to report changes in the DMF.\n\nFootnote 19: The requirement for a complete update does not apply to the DMF if the entire DMF is in eCTD format, which always presents the DMF in its current state. The Agency highly encourages DMF holders to convert the entire DMF into an eCTD submission, which does not require reference to any previous paper submission.\n\n4 Completeness Assessment Outcomes\n\nFollowing the CA, FDA will find the DMF either complete or incomplete.\n\nIf the DMF is found complete, FDA will post the DMF number on a publicly available list on FDA\'s Web site to indicate the DMF is available for reference by generic drug submission applicants.20 Footnote 20: For the public list of DMFs available for reference, see http://www.fda.gov/gdufa.\n\nIf the DMF is found incomplete, the CA findings and comments will be compiled in a GDUFA DMF Incomplete Letter to the DMF holder that explains why the DMF was deemed incomplete. Information about the CA status of a DMF, other than the lack of a public listing on the FDA\'s Web site, will not be provided to anyone except the DMF holder and, as necessary, any generic drug submission applicant that the DMF holder has authorized to rely on the DMF.\n\nTo remedy a GDUFA DMF Incomplete Letter and pass the CA, the DMF holder should submit an amendment to its DMF to correct the deficiencies identified in the Incomplete Letter, or, if FDA has determined that the DMF should undergo a complete update, the DMF holder should resubmit the DMF with that update. FDA will then assess the revised DMF\'s completeness. If there are no deficiencies at this time, FDA will declare the DMF to be complete and to have passed the CA.\n\nAlthough a DMF may be deemed incomplete upon its first CA, FDA will work with DMF holders to provide guidance on how to revise the DMF so it may be found complete after resubmission. Once the DMF passes the CA, FDA will make the DMF number publicly available on its Web site.21 Footnote 21: Under GDUFA, a condition for a Type II API DMF to be considered available for reference is that it “has not failed an initial completeness assessment” (Section 744B(a)(2)(D)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act). FDA does not interpret that provision as disqualifying a DMF if it has ever failed a CA. Instead, FDA considers this condition to be satisfied when, after submission of an amendment or resubmission of the DMF to address deficiencies identified by FDA, FDA finds that the DMF has passed the CA.\n\nV API information included in a generic drug submission\n\nIf a generic drug submission contains all the necessary API information and does not rely on information contained in a DMF, no CA will be performed. Instead, this information will be evaluated during the ANDA filing review.22 However, because GDUFA requires collection of a one-time fee for API information included in a generic drug submission (i.e., an (a)(3)(F) fee),23 the applicant submitting the generic drug submission containing the API information must pay this fee.\n\nFootnote 22: See guidance for industry ANDA Submissions – Refuse-to-Receive Standards.\n\nFootnote 23: Section 744B(a)(3)(F) of the FD&C Act.\n\nVI Summary\n\nOnce the DMF fee is received, FDA will evaluate the DMF to make sure it meets the CA criteria.\n\nIf the DMF passes the CA, it will be found complete and the DMF number will be made publicly available on FDA\'s Web site.\n\nIf the DMF fails the CA, FDA will send a GDUFA DMF Incomplete Letter describing to the DMF holder the missing elements in its DMF.\n\nIf the DMF holder addresses all the deficiencies and amends the DMF or completely updates the DMF per the CA request, the FDA will complete its CA. If the DMF is then found complete, the DMF number will be made publicly available on FDA\'s Web site.\n\nIf a generic drug submission contains all the necessary API information and does not reference a DMF, the generic drug submission applicant will be required to pay the (a)(3)(F) fee. No CA will be conducted.\n\nDefinitions\n\nActive pharmaceutical ingredient24 (as defined by GDUFA):**\n\nFootnote 24: Section 744A(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\n(A) A substance, or a mixture when the substance is unstable or cannot be transported on its own, intended\n\n(i) to be used as a component of a drug; and\n\n(ii) to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure,\n\nmitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any\n\nfunction of the human body; or\n\n(B) a substance intended for final crystallization, purification, or salt formation, or any\n\ncombination of those activities, to become a substance or mixture described in\n\nsubparagraph (A).\n\nActive DMF: A drug master file (DMF) for which the FDA has made a determination that the\n\nDMF was acceptable for filing administratively and is up to date.\n\nDMF holder:25 Designated owner of the DMF, which may be different from the U.S. agent\n\nlisted as the contact.\n\nFootnote 25: See 21 CFR 314.420(a).\n\nGeneric drug submission:26 An abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), an amendment to\n\nan ANDA, a prior approval supplement (PAS) to an ANDA, or an amendment to a PAS.\n\nLetter of authorization (LOA):27 A written statement by the holder or designated U.S. agent or\n\nrepresentative permitting FDA to refer to information in the DMF in support of another\n\nperson\'s28 generic drug submission.\n\nFootnote 28: Section 744A(12) of the FD&C Act; also see 21 CFR 314.420(a)(2).\n\nType II Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Drug Master Files:29 The submission of API\n--------------------\nContext title: Completeness Assessments for Type II API DMFs Under GDUFA Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry']","['No. DMF holders can pay the fee before a letter of authorization is requested.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to help small businesses better understand and comply with the final rule establishing that certain active ingredients used in over-the-counter (OTC) consumer antiseptic wash products are not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE), and thus, are ineligible for inclusion in the OTC topical antiseptic monograph. On September 6, 2016, FDA published a final rule that finalizes the nonmonograph status of 19 active ingredients, including triclosan and triclocarban, which are intended for use in OTC consumer antiseptic wash products (81 FR 61106) (Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule). Three active ingredients-- benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and chloroxylenol -- were deferred from the final rule to allow more time for sponsors who proposed to complete the studies necessary to fill the safety and effectiveness data gaps identified for these ingredients. These deferrals are for one year, subject to renewal if adequate progress is made in filling the data gaps.\n\nThe final rule applies to consumer antiseptic wash products that are intended for use with water and are rinsed off after use, including consumer hand washes and consumer body washes. No additional safety or effectiveness data were submitted to support monograph conditions for the 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients. Therefore, with the exception of the three deferred active ingredients, this rule finalizes the nonmonograph status of the remaining 19 active ingredients which are found to be not GRASE for use in consumer antiseptic wash products. Consumer antiseptic wash drug products containing one or more of these non-GRASE active ingredients will be considered new drugs for which approved new drug applications (NDAs) are required for marketing (21 USC 355(a)). The Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule is effective September 6, 2017.\n\nFDA has prepared this guidance in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28)2 to assist small businesses in complying with the Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule.\n\nFootnote 2: 5 U.S.C. 601 (note).\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.\n\nInstead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nThe final rule finalizes the Consumer Antiseptic Wash Proposed Rule published in the Federal Register of December 17, 2013 (78 FR 76444) (2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR) and amends the 1994 tentative final monograph (TFM) for OTC antiseptic drug products that published in the Federal Register of June 17, 1994 (59 FR 31402) (the 1994 TFM). The final rule is part of FDA's ongoing rulemaking to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of OTC drug products marketed in the United States on or before May 1972 (OTC Drug Review). The Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule is one of three OTC topical antiseptic rules involving triclosan required to be published pursuant to a Consent Decree entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on November 21, 2013, in Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. V. United States Food and Drug Administration, et al., 10 Civ. 569 (S.D.N.Y.).\n\nAs explained in the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR, new information on potential risks posed by the use of certain consumer antiseptic washes prompted us to reevaluate the data needed for classifying consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients as generally recognized as effective (GRAE). As a result, we proposed that the risk from the use of a consumer antiseptic wash drug product must be balanced by a demonstration -- through studies that demonstrate a direct clinical benefit (i.e., a reduction of infection) -- that the product is superior to washing with nonantibacterial soap and water in reducing infection. In the final rule, we determined that the data and information submitted for 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients were insufficient to demonstrate that there is any additional benefit from the use of these active ingredients in consumer antiseptic wash products compared to nonantibacterial soap and water. Consequently, we found that the available data do not support a GRAE determination for the 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients.\n\nAs also explained in the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR, several important scientific developments that affect the safety evaluation of consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients have occurred since FDA's 1994 evaluation of the safety of consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients under the OTC Drug Review. New data suggest that the systemic exposure to some of these active ingredients is higher than previously thought, and new information about the potential risks from systemic absorption and long-term exposure is now available. New safety information also suggests that widespread antiseptic use could have an impact on the development of bacterial resistance. Accordingly, to support a classification of generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients, we proposed that additional safety data are needed to demonstrate that these ingredients meet current safety standards. We determined in the final rule that the available information and published data for 19 active ingredients were insufficient to establish the safety of long-term, daily repeated exposure to these active ingredients for use in consumer antiseptic wash products.\n\nConsequently, we found that the available data do not support a GRAS determination for the 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients.\n\nThe final rule finalizes the nonmonograph status of 19 active ingredients, including triclosan and triclocarbon, which are intended for use in consumer antiseptic wash products. As explained, either no additional data were submitted or the data and information that were submitted were not sufficient to support monograph conditions for these 19 consumer antiseptic wash ingredients. Therefore, in the final rule, we found that these 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients are not GRASE. Accordingly, consumer antiseptic wash drug products that contain one or more of these 19 active ingredients are misbranded under section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 352) and are considered new drugs under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(p)) for which approved applications under section 505 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 355) and part 314 (21 CFR part 314) of the Code of Federal Regulations are required for marketing.\n\nIn response to several comments submitted to the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR, FDA has deferred further rulemaking on three specific active ingredients used in OTC consumer antiseptic wash products to allow for the development and submission of new safety and effectiveness data to the record for these ingredients. The deferred active ingredients are benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and chloroxylenol. Accordingly, FDA does not make a GRASE determination for these three active ingredients in the Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n--------------------\nContext: In response to several comments submitted to the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR, FDA has deferred further rulemaking on three specific active ingredients used in OTC consumer antiseptic wash products to allow for the development and submission of new safety and effectiveness data to the record for these ingredients. The deferred active ingredients are benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and chloroxylenol. Accordingly, FDA does not make a GRASE determination for these three active ingredients in the Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule. The monograph or new drug status of these three ingredients will be addressed either after completion and analysis of ongoing studies to address the safety and effectiveness data gaps of these ingredients or at a future date if these studies are not completed.\n\n3 Questions and Answers\n\nWhat active ingredients are subject to this final rule?\n\nIn the final rule, we found that there are 22 active ingredients eligible for the OTC Drug Review for use as a consumer antiseptic wash. An OTC drug is covered by the OTC Drug Review if its conditions of use existed in the OTC drug marketplace on or before May 11, 1972 (37 FR 9464).3 As noted above, three of these active ingredients have been deferred from this rulemaking. The 19 remaining ingredients found eligible for the OTC Drug Review for use in consumer antiseptic wash products and subject to this final rule are:\n\nClofilucarban\n\nFluorosalan\n\nHexachlorophene\n\nHexylresorcinol\n\nIodophors (Iodine-containing ingredients)\n\nIodine complex (ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate)\n\nIodine complex (phosphate ester of alkylaryloxy polyethylene glycol)\n\nNonylphenoxypoly (ethyleneoxy) ethanoliodine\n\nPoloxamer-iodine complex\n\nUndecoylium chloride iodine complex\n\nMethylbenzetmonium chloride\n\nPhenol4 Footnote 4: Although phenol is listed twice in the final rule as “greater than 1.5 percent” and “less than 1.5 percent”, phenol—regardless of concentration—is eligible for the OTC Drug Review but was found to be not GRASE for use in consumer antiseptic wash products.\n\nSecondary amyltricresols\n\nSodium oxychlororesene\n\nTribromsalan\n\nTriclocarban\n\nTricosan\n\nTriple dye Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn the final rule, we also found certain other active ingredients ineligible for evaluation under the OTC Drug Review as a consumer antiseptic wash because insufficient information was submitted to show that their conditions of use existed in the OTC drug marketplace on or before May 11, 1972. FDA considers a drug that is ineligible for inclusion in the OTC monograph system to be a new drug that will require FDA approval through the NDA process (21 CFR Part 314). The ineligible active ingredients are:\n\nAlcohol (ethyl alcohol)\n\nBenzalkonium cetyl phosphate\n\nCetylpyridinium chloride\n\nChlorhexidine gluconate\n\nIsopropyl alcohol\n\nPolyhexamethylene biguanide\n\nSalicylic acid\n\nSodium hypochlorite\n\nTea tree oil\n\nCombination of potassium vegetable oil solution, phosphate sequestering agent, and triethanolamine\n\n1 Q2. What antiseptic products are covered by the final rule?\n\nThe Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule covers the group of products referred to as ""consumer antiseptic washes."" Consumer antiseptic washes include a variety of personal care products that are intended for use with water and are rinsed off after use, such as antibacterial soaps, antibacterial hand washes, and antibacterial body washes. These products may be used by the general population for personal use in the home and public settings on a frequent, daily basis.\n\nThis final rule does not cover or have an impact on the monograph status of other OTC antiseptic products, including: (1) consumer antiseptic rubs, which are products that are not rinsed off after use such as hand rubs (i.e., ""hand sanitizers"") and antibacterial wipes; (2) health care antiseptic, which are antiseptic products that are intended for use by health care professionals in a hospital setting or other health care situations outside the hospital; (3) first aid antisetics; and (4) antisetics used by the food industry. The monograph status of the active ingredients intended for use in these other OTC antiseptic products will be addressed separately.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nQ3. What is the significance of triclosan and triclocarban under this final rule?\n\nBased on available data, triclosan and triclocarban have been two of the most widely used OTC consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients on the market -- with triclosan being used primarily in liquid antiseptic soaps and triclocarban being used primarily in bar antiseptic soaps. Emerging research shows that some antibacterial ingredients could pose health risks. For example, some data suggest that triclosan and triclocarban can cause alterations in thyroid, reproductive growth, and developmental systems of neonatal and adolescent animals. Because consumer antiseptic washes are chronic use products, evaluation of the potential for chronic toxicity and the effects on reproduction and development are essential to the safety assessment of these active ingredients.\n\nAs explained in the final rule, insufficient data were submitted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of triclosan and triclocarban for use as a consumer antiseptic wash product, and thus, we found that triclosan and triclocarban are not GRASE for use in consumer antiseptic wash products. Accordingly, to continue marketing as of the effective date of the final rule, OTC consumer antiseptic wash products containing triclosan or triclocarban will require (1) reformulation to remove triclosan or triclocarban and relabeling of the reformulated products; or (2) approval of a new drug application.\n\nWhen and how do manufacturers have to comply with this final rule?\n\nThe Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule is effective September 6, 2017. In the final rule we found active ingredients to be either ineligible for inclusion in the OTC monograph system or not to be GRASE. On or after September 6, 2017, any OTC consumer antiseptic wash drug products containing such ingredients are misbranded and cannot be initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless it is the subject of an approved NDA. This means that manufacturers will need to obtain an NDA to market consumer antiseptic wash drug products containing any of these 19 active ingredients. Alternatively, manufacturers of consumer antiseptic washes containing nonmonograph antiseptic active ingredients can comply with this final rule by removing the products from the market or reformulating those products to remove the nonmonograph antiseptic active ingredient and marketing the products as soaps or washes without antibacterial claims.\n\nWhat are the effectiveness criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n\nFDA\'s OTC regulations (21 CFR 330.10(a)(4)(ii)) define the standards for establishing an OTC active ingredient as GRAE. These regulations require the effectiveness of active ingredients for OTC drug products be demonstrated by controlled clinical trials (SSSS 330.10(a)(4)(ii) and 314.126(b)), unless this requirement is waived as provided in SS 330.10(a)(4)(ii). These studies must be well controlled and able to distinguish the effect of a drug from other influences, such as a spontaneous change in the course of the disease, placebo effect, or biased observation (SS 314.126(a)).\n\nThe controlled clinical trials required by FDA\'s regulations are intended to demonstrate that the pharmacological effect of the drug when used under adequate directions for use will provide clinically significant relief of the type claimed, i.e., efficacy for the stated indication.\n\nAccordingly, to demonstrate the GRAE status of consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients, the effectiveness criteria include conducting adequate clinical outcome studies that identify the conditions of use on which an antiseptic active ingredient can demonstrate a reduction in the number of infections. Specifically, the risk from the use of a consumer antiseptic wash drug product must be balanced by a demonstration -- through studies that demonstrate a direct clinical benefit (i.e., a reduction of infection) -- that the product is superior to washing with nonantibacterial soap and water in reducing infection. To determine that the active ingredient is GRAE, the clinical outcome studies should include at least two arms: the final formulation of the product and the vehicle. The effectiveness of the active ingredient, and hence its contribution in the reduction of infection, is determined by comparing the infection rate in a consumer population washing with the antiseptic product that contains the active ingredient in question to the infection rate in a consumer population washing with the vehicle alone.\n\nThe requirement for clinical outcome studies is based on the fact that there are insufficient data to demonstrate a direct benefit from the use of consumer antiseptic washes compared to nonantibacterial soap and water. The log reduction standard (a clinical simulation standard) proposed in the 1994 TFM, which was based on a non-validated surrogate endpoint (i.e., number of bacteria removed from the skin), is insufficient for establishing the effectiveness of consumer antiseptic washes. In addition, existing data cannot demonstrate a correlation between log reductions of bacteria achieved by antiseptic hand washing in surrogate testing and the reduction of infection. Thus, in consumer settings where soap and water are readily available, the benefit of using an antiseptic wash product must be supported by these clinical outcome studies.\n--------------------\nContext title: Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'

In addition, existing data cannot demonstrate a correlation between log reductions of bacteria achieved by antiseptic hand washing in surrogate testing and the reduction of infection. Thus, in consumer settings where soap and water are readily available, the benefit of using an antiseptic wash product must be supported by these clinical outcome studies.\n\nIn addition to the clinical outcome studies, the effectiveness criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients include an in vitro study consisting of a modified time-kill assay that must be conducted with selected reference organisms and their respective clinical isolates, which are representative of bacterial strains most commonly encountered in general consumer settings. The purpose of the in vitro study is to characterize the antimicrobial activity of the active ingredients used in consumer antiseptic wash products.\n\nWhat are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n\nAs explained in the rulemaking, the safety data needed to make a GRAS determination for active ingredients used in consumer antiseptic washes are based on several important scientific developments that affect the safety evaluation of these active ingredients. New data suggest that the systemic exposure to these active ingredients is higher than previously thought, and new information about the potential risks from systemic absorption and long-term exposure has become available. Moreover, new safety information also suggests that widespread antiseptic use can have an impact on the development of bacterial resistance. Accordingly, the safety data needed to demonstrate safety for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients fall into three broad categories: (1) safety data studies in current FDA guidance (e.g., preclinical and human pharmacokinetic studies (including maximal use trials, developmental and reproductive toxicity studies, and carcinogenicity studies); (2) data to characterize potential hormonal effects; and (3) data to evaluate the development of resistance. These data requirements are the minimum data necessary to establish the safety of long-term, daily, repeated exposure to antiseptic active ingredients used in consumer wash products (81 FR 61106 at 61107).\n\nWhy did FDA find the 19 active ingredients to be not GRASE?\n\nWith respect to effectiveness, in the final rule we found that the data and information submitted for the 19 active ingredients were insufficient to demonstrate that there was any additional benefit from the use of these active ingredients in consumer antiseptic wash products compared to nonantibacterial soap and water in reducing infection. Consequently, we found that the available data did not support a GRAE determination for these 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients.\n\nWith respect to safety, in the final rule we found that the available information and published data for the 19 active ingredients were insufficient to establish the safety of long-term, daily repeated exposure to these active ingredients used in consumer antiseptic wash products. Consequently, we found that the available data did not support a GRAS determination for these 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients.\n\nWhat information did FDA rely on to make its GRASE Determinations?\n\nFDA issued this final rule based on its evaluation of the available information, including the published literature, the received comments, and all the data that were submitted to the rulemaking on the safety and effectiveness of the 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients. The decisions in the final rule are also based on the recommendations of the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee,5 as well as recommendations from other public meetings held by the Agency on antiseptics.\n\nFootnote 5: See transcript of the January 22, 1997, Meeting of the Joint Nonprescription Drugs and Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committees, OTC.

Available at https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/05/transcripts/2005-4184T1.pdf.\n\nWhy did FDA not address final formulation testing or labeling in this final rule\n\nWe did not address final product formulation testing or labeling requirements in this final rule because none of the 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients that are the subject of this final rule were found to be GRASE for use in consumer antiseptic wash products. Final formulation testing and labeling for the deferred ingredients may be addressed in the future once their GRASE determination is concluded.\n\nWhy were three consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients deferred from this final rule?\n\nAs explained in the final rule, we understood that, in certain circumstances, planning, implementing, and analyzing the data generated from the safety and effectiveness studies can be a time-consuming process that may not be completed within the period granted for submission of additional data in response to the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR (78 FR 76444).\n\nAccordingly, in the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR, we provided a process for seeking an extension of time to submit the required safety and effectiveness data if needed. We stated that we would consider all the data and information submitted to the record in conjunction with all timely and completed requests to extend the timeline to finalize the monograph status for a given ingredient. Consideration for deferral for an ingredient was given to requests with clear statements of intent to conduct the necessary studies required to fill all the data gaps identified in the proposed rule for that ingredient.\n\nAfter analyzing the data and information submitted related to the requests for extensions, we determined that deferral was warranted for three consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients -- benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and chloroxylenol -- to allow more time for interested parties to complete the studies necessary to fill the safety and effectiveness data gaps identified for these ingredients. Thus, these three active ingredients are not included in the final rule and will be addressed either after completion and analysis of ongoing studies to address the safety and effectiveness data gaps of these ingredients or at a later date if these studies are not completed.\n\nWhat is the deferral time period for these three ingredients?\n\nFDA deferred rulemaking on benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and chloroxylenol for 1 year. These deferrals are subject to renewal to permit sponsors to conduct the necessary studies to address the data gaps. On March 24, 2017, we renewed these deferrals for another 1-year period, subject to renewal. If the studies in progress do not appear, in FDA's judgment, to be productive, the Agency expects that it will proceed to rulemaking for these ingredients after this deferral stage.\n\nTo facilitate this process, as laid out in the deferral letters, sponsors submitted clear statements of intent to conduct all necessary studies and submitted full study outcomes reports to the public docket. Further detail on the necessary studies, including FDA's guidance on study objectives and design for certain studies, can be found on the Agency's Antiseptic FDA Letters website available at https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/InformationbyDrugClass/ucm538131.htm.\n\nWhere can I get more information, if needed?\n\nQuestions regarding compliance with the Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule should be directed to CDERCompliance@fda.hhs.gov.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n--------------------\nContext: In response to several requests submitted to the 2016 Consumer Antiseptic - Rub PR, FDA temporarily - deferred a GRAS/GRAE - determination - for three active ingredients--benzalkonium chloride, - ethyl alcohol, and isopropyl alcohol-to allow time for interested parties to complete the studies necessary to fill - the safety and effectiveness data gaps identified - for these ingredients.\n\nAs a result of the deferrals, the Consumer - Antiseptic - Rub FR does not include - a determination - on the GRAS/GRAE status of benzalkonium - chloride, ethyl alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol for use in consumer antiseptic - rubs. FDA intends to address the GRAS/GRAE - status of these three active ingredients - either after completion - and analysis of studies to fill - the identified - safety and effectiveness data gaps for these ingredients - or at another time if these studies are not completed.6\n\nFootnote 6: The CARES Act added section 505G to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C Act). Under 505G(a)(3) of the FD&C Act, drugs that were classified as category III in a tentative final monograph (TFM), including the 1994 TFM for over-the-counter topical antiseptic (59 FR 31402) - as further amended by the 2016 Consumer Antiseptic - Rub proposed rule (81 FR 42912) - are not required to have an approved application under section 505 in order to be marketed, as long as they are in conformity with the relevant conditions of use outlined in the applicable TFM and comply with all other applicable requirements for nonprescription drugs.\n\nThe Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR covers OTC consumer antiseptic - rub products - that are sometimes - referred to as rubs, leave-on products, or hand sanitizers. The Consumer AntisepticRub FR also covers OTC consumer antiseptic - wipes. These products are intended to be used when soap and water are not available - and are left on and not rinsed off with water.\n\nThe Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR does not address the monograph - status of other OTC antiseptic - products, including: (1) consumer antiseptic - washes, which are personal care products - that are intended - for use with water and are rinsed off after use, such as antibacterial - soaps, antibacterial - hand washes, and antibacterial - body - washes; (2) health care antiseptic, which are antiseptic - products that are intended for use by health care professionals - in a hospital setting or other health care situations - outside of the hospital; (3) first aid antiseptic, - which are skin antiseptic, skin-wound - cleansers, and skin-wound - protectants used primarily - by consumers for first aid use; and (4) antiseptic - used by the food industry. - The monograph - status of the active ingredients - intended for use in these other OTC antiseptic - products - has been and/or will be addressed separately.\n\nWhat active ingredients are subject to the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR?\n\nIn the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR, we found that three active ingredients - were eligible - for evaluation under the OTC Drug Review for use in a consumer antiseptic - rub.

On or after the April 13, 2020, effective date of the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR, any OTC consumer antiseptic - rub drug product containing - one or more of the 28 ingredients - that FDA has found ineligible - cannot be introduced or delivered for introduction - into interstate commerce unless the drug product is the subject of an approved NDA or ANDA. This means that manufacturers will need to obtain an NDA or ANDA to market consumer antiseptic - rub drug products containing - any of these 28 active ingredients. Alternatively, manufacturers of consumer antiseptic - rubs containing - antiseptic - active ingredients - can comply with the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR by removing their products from the market, or reformulating - them to remove the ineligible - active ingredients, - and then marketing - them appropriately (e.g., by substituting - one of the three active ingredients - described above or by marketing - the products as antiseptic-free - rubs or wipes without drug claims).\n\nWhat if my OTC antiseptic product uses an active ingredient not mentioned in the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub final rule?\n\nOTC consumer antiseptic - rub or wipe products containing - active ingredients not mentioned in the Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR are considered new drugs, for which an approved NDA or ANDA is required before marketing such products.

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n--------------------\nContext: Postmarketing Safety Data\n\nIn addition to the active ingredient safety data already described, FDA's GRASE evaluation also takes into consideration available information about serious adverse drug experiences and known or expected adverse effects associated with commercially marketed products that contain the active ingredient(s) under consideration. FDA specifically requests that sponsors provide the following information:\n\nA summary of all potentially associated serious adverse drug experiences.\n\nA summary of all available potentially associated nonserious adverse drug experiences.\n\nA summary of expected or frequently reported side effects, whether serious or nonserious.\n\nCopies of all available reports of potentially associated serious adverse drug experiences. Each report submitted should be in the form of an individual case safety report as described in 21 CFR 314.80 and refer only to an individual consumer or to a single attached publication.\n\nAny available safety information from studies of safety and effectiveness in humans.\n\nRelevant medical literature describing associated adverse events.\n\nEnglish translations should be provided for all foreign language materials.\n\nFor products marketed outside the United States, submissions should also state whether each country's system allows for adverse event reporting and, if so, how each country's system identifies and collects the adverse event information.30 If adverse event information is not available from all countries where the active ingredient has been marketed in OTC sunscreen products, the sponsor should provide an explanation for the missing data. It is important to note, however, that even when countries have an adverse event reporting system that includes sunscreen products, underreporting is a significant limitation of any system that depends on spontaneous reports.\n\nFootnote 30: See, e.g., 21 CFR 330.14(c)(2)(v).\n\nMany factors can influence whether an adverse event is reported, including whether a possible relationship between the event and an ingredient or product is recognized by consumers or health care providers. For example, adverse events that occur many years after a causal drug exposure may not be recognized as being related to that exposure, especially if the background rate of those adverse events is high (e.g., a common cancer or a developmental problem). Thus, an absence of reports does not necessarily equate to an absence of adverse events. Despite the limitations of adverse event reporting, FDA considers postmarketing data to be relevant both tothe overall GRASE assessment of OTC sunscreen active ingredients and to labeling considerations because these data may reveal safety signals not otherwise observed in clinical or nonclinical testing.\n\nIV Effectiveness Data\n\nFDA's OTC drug regulations generally identify both the types of effectiveness information that sponsors should submit as evidence that a drug product containing an active ingredient or other OTC drug condition could be GRASE for use as labeled (SS 330.10(a)(2)) and the standard by which effectiveness is to be judged, which requires controlled clinical investigations to support effectiveness (SS 330.10(a)(4)(ii)).\n\nWhen applying these regulations to each potential sunscreen active ingredient, FDA requests that sponsors provide evidence from at least two adequate and well-controlled SPF studies showing that the active ingredient effectively prevents sunburn, because sunburn prevention is the minimum indication for an OTC sunscreen product. Two adequate and well-controlled SPF studies of the active ingredient at a lower concentration than the maximum requested should be conducted according to established standards.31 These SPF studies should demonstrate that the selected concentration provides an SPF value of 2 or higher.\n\nFootnote 31: FDA expects that the upper bound of any concentration of the active ingredient ultimately established would be governed by the safety data, as well as by efficacy.\n\nThe current standard procedure for SPF testing is described in SS 201.327(i) (21 CFR 201.327(i)).32 Any new SPF tests for a particular ingredient should be performed as described in these regulations, using a test formulation containing the ingredient as the only active ingredient to identify its contribution to the overall SPF test results. These tests should also include a vehicle control arm to rule out any contribution the vehicle may have had on the SPF test results. Finally, as described in SS 201.327(i), an SPF standard formulation comparator arm should be another component of the study design.\n\nFootnote 32: Although this SPF testing procedure is used primarily for final formulation testing of finished products marketed without approved NDAs, it is equally applicable for determining whether or not a sunscreen active ingredient is generally recognized as effective as part of the overall GRASE determination.\n\nCurrent sunscreen testing and labeling regulations in SS 201.327(j) also specify a broad spectrum testing procedure, which provides an in vitro measurement of a sunscreen product's ability to protect against both ultraviolet A and ultraviolet B radiation. Broad spectrum protection is often the result of the combined contribution of multiple active ingredients in a final sunscreen formulation; thus, FDA does not expect that a sunscreen active ingredient would undergo broad spectrum effectiveness testing to establish its effectiveness for a GRASE determination for use in OTC sunscreen products.\n\nUnder SS 201.327, the determination of whether an individual sunscreen product subject to that regulation may be labeled as broad spectrum (and therefore bear the additional claims related to that labeling) is made on a product-specific basis, applying the standard testing methods set forth in those regulations.33 If a sunscreen active ingredient evaluated under the SIA is established to be GRASE for use in nonprescription sunscreens, the final sunscreen order can address broad spectrum testing and related labeling conditions for final sunscreen formulations containing that ingredient.\n\nFootnote 33: These standard testing methods are also described in the guidance for industry Labeling and Effectiveness Testing: Sunscreen Drug Products for Over-The-Counter Human Use—Small Entity Compliance Guide.\n\nV Anticipated final formulation testing\n\nThe preceding sections of this guidance have concentrated on recommendations for safety and effectiveness data needed to support FDA's determination that a sunscreen active ingredient is GRASE for use in sunscreens. FDA's determination that an active ingredient is GRASE will be made in the form of a final sunscreen order that will set out the conditions under which any future product incorporating that sunscreen active ingredient will be GRASE and not misbranded (see section I).34 As noted in section III.1.2, variations among individual sunscreen products--and in particular, aspects of the lotion or other vehicle in which active ingredients are delivered -- can affect their absorption and thus their safety and effectiveness.\n\nFootnote 34: See section 586D(e) of the FD&C Act.\n\nTo address the variability among sunscreen formulations, FDA currently requires final formulation testing of nonprescription sunscreen products to ensure their effectiveness--namely, testing for SPF value as well as broad spectrum protection and water resistance where those attributes are claimed in product labels.35 FDA anticipates that final sunscreen orders issued for sunscreen active ingredients determined to be GRASE under the SIA will also include conditions requiring final formulation testing to ensure the safety of all sunscreen formulations permitted by the order.\n\nFootnote 35: See § 201.327 for the current requirements for OTC sunscreens containing the active ingredients already evaluated under the monograph system. OTC sunscreens marketed under NDAs provide similar information in their product-specific applications to substantiate their labeling.\n\nThe discussion that follows provides FDA's current thinking about such final formulation safety testing, to be conducted in the future. Note that FDA has not yet determined what particular final formulation testing, if any, will be specified in future final sunscreen orders for any given sunscreen active ingredient. Such requirements will be established on an ingredient-specific basis, taking into consideration the data recommended to be supplied under other parts of this guidance to support a GRASE determination (e.g., whether any safety signals are detected in well-conducted nonclinical carcinogenicity and DART studies). Interested parties can provide relevant information and comments regarding final formulation testing for an individual sunscreen active ingredient as part of the GRASE determination process for that ingredient.\n\nFDA's current thinking is that final formulation safety testing of nonprescription sunscreens would not generally call for an in vivo study. Instead, FDA expects that the conditions of marketing specified for sunscreen active ingredients in final sunscreen orders would require manufacturers to perform in vitro permeation testing before marketing each new formulation.36 Consistent with the approach for final formulation efficacy testing required by SS 201.327, FDA anticipates that it would not review the results of the in vitro final formulation safety testing before product marketing. Rather, FDA expects that final sunscreen orders would require manufacturers to maintain records of this testing; these records would be available to FDA.\n\nFootnote 36: FDA recommends this approach as an alternative to final in vivo (MUsT) testing of final product formulations, which was recommended by the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee (see the response to Discussion Question 2 in the 2014 NDAC Minutes, supra note 15, at 7).\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonprescription Sunscreen Drug Products – Safety and Effectiveness Data""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA\'s specific recommendations on the data and information needed to support a positive GRASE determination under the SIA are detailed in sections II (pharmaceutical quality/manufacturing information), III (safety data), and IV (effectiveness data). Section V presents FDA\'s current thinking on an approach to safety testing of final sunscreen formulations that it anticipates adopting in the future.\n\nAlthough sunscreen products are typically formulated with two or more active ingredients, the recommendations in sections II through IV generally contemplate that testing will be performed using formulations including one active ingredient FDA anticipates that these data would also generally be sufficient to assess whether, and under what conditions, that active ingredient is GRASE for use as part of a combination of sunscreen active ingredients. In some situations, additional data and testing beyond what is recommended in this guidance may be needed to support a positive GRASE determination and to establish the associated conditions for a particular active ingredient. The following are examples in which additional data may be needed:\n\nData suggest that there may be a safety or efficacy concern with a particular combination of active ingredients or active and inactive ingredients\n\nInformation indicates that an active ingredient is unstable when exposed to sunlight and suggests that the active ingredient may need to be combined with a photostabilizer to be safe or effective\n\nOther situations may occur in which additional data are needed (see, e.g., section III for some additional examples). Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA any questions about whether additional data may be needed for a particular active ingredient.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Pharmaceutical Quality/Manufacturing Information\n\nFDA needs information that sufficiently characterizes the identity of each sunscreen active ingredient for FDA reviewers to determine how, if at all, the safety and efficacy studies submitted for review are relevant to the ingredient for which GRASE determination is sought.10 This information would also be needed to appropriately characterize the active ingredient in the final sunscreen order. Sponsors should provide the compendial status of the ingredient, including reference to a United States Pharmacopeia National Formulary monograph. Sponsors should also provide any known chemical and/or manufacturing characteristics of the active ingredient that may be relevant to FDA\'s GRASE evaluation and to the establishment of the conditions of any resulting final sunscreen order.11 Such information should include known interactions with other sunscreen active ingredient(s) or commonly used sunscreen vehicle component(s) and particle size information for micronized or nanoscale active ingredients. In addition, sponsors should describe any aspects of formulation that are needed to ensure stability, or other characteristics of the active ingredient that are needed to establish conditions under which it is GRASE for use in sunscreens.\n\nFootnote 11: The determination of whether a sunscreen active ingredient is GRASE and not misbranded also requires the Agency to describe the conditions under which any future product incorporating that sunscreen active ingredient will be GRASE and not misbranded (see, e.g., section 586C(e) of the FD&C Act; see also section V of this document).\n\n3 Safety Data\n\nFDA\'s OTC drug regulations identify both the general types of safety information that sponsors should submit as evidence that an OTC drug is GRASE for use as labeled (SS 330.10(a)(2) (21 CFR 330.10(a)(2))) and the standard by which such safety information is to be judged (SS 330.10(a)(4)(i)). When applying these regulations to a given active ingredient, FDA uses its scientific expertise to determine what constitutes ""adequate tests by methods reasonably applicable to show the drug is safe under the prescribed, recommended, or suggested conditions of use.""12\n\nFootnote 12: § 330.10(a)(4)(i).\n\nFDA recognizes the contribution that broad spectrum sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) value of 15 or higher can make to decrease the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging caused by the sun if used as directed with other sun protection measures. To protect the public health, it is also important for FDA to balance the potential benefits of these sunscreen products to consumers against their potential risks. Providing an adequate safety margin13 for OTC sunscreen active ingredients and finished sunscreen products is a key element of FDA\'s risk assessment. When determining the specific testing and other data needed to adequately demonstrate that an OTC sunscreen active ingredient is safe, FDA considers both the circumstances under which OTC sunscreen products are intended to be used by consumers and current scientific knowledge and assessment technology.\n\nFootnote 13: For drugs with a known potential for adverse effects based on animal data, the anticipated level of risk for humans may be quantified using a safety margin calculation. A safety margin calculation takes the highest animal no observed adverse effect level and estimates a maximum safe level of exposure for humans. One caveat to the safety margin calculation is that animal studies do not always predict effects in humans, and the actual threshold for an effect in humans may be different (higher or lower) than in the species tested. The human sensitivity to a drug is often unknown. To account for this, the predicted safe exposure level in humans that is reflected in the safety margin is well below where toxicities were seen in animals.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nHuman dermal safety studies for topical products in which exposure to light after application is anticipated generally consist of two sets of studies--those conducted without specific exposure to light and those conducted to assess reactions after ultraviolet exposure (photosafety studies).17 These study sets usually consist of dermal irritation patch testing, dermal sensitization patch testing, dermal phototoxicity testing, and dermal photoallergenicity testing.\n\nFootnote 17: See the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidance for industry S10 Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance Web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidancCompilanceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nBecause marketed sunscreen products typically contain a combination of active ingredients and because brand name product formulations frequently change, it is difficult for FDA to determine causal links between individual active ingredients and reported irritation and hypersensitivity adverse events associated with a particular product. Therefore, FDA generally expects to use data from human irritation studies, human skin sensitization studies, and human photosafety studies, in conjunction with postmarketing adverse event data, to inform GRASE determinations and labeling. Nonetheless, in some cases, depending on the rigor of available postmarketing safety information, it may be reasonable for sponsors to omit human irritation studies, human skin sensitization studies, and/or human photosafety studies. For example, if FDA concludes that there is a positive risk-benefit for a sunscreen active ingredient but that it is known to be a sensitizer, it may be possible to develop safety labeling to address this risk without data generated in the human dermal safety studies described below. Sponsors who believe there is a scientific rationale that may preclude the need for some or all of the described studies are urged to contact FDA before initiating studies.\n\na. Human irritation and sensitization studies\n\nStudies of skin irritation and sensitization that use the repeat insult patch test or other relevant tests are recommended elements in FDA\'s safety evaluation of topical drug products that, like sunscreens, are applied to the skin repeatedly over long periods of time. These tests, which are designed to detect the potential of topical drug products for local dermatologic events with fewer subjects than might be observed in larger clinical trials, often involve applying product more frequently and/or for longer durations than the proposed clinical dosing of those drug products. In dermal irritation studies, a test substance is applied to a small pad (patch) and affixed to the test subject\'s skin, usually on the back, to determine whether the ingredient causes direct skin toxicity. Dermal sensitization studies are conducted similarly but are designed to detect immunologically mediated reactions, which require prior exposure to the allergen.\n\nNonprescription sunscreen active ingredients, when found to be GRASE, may be used in numerous, as yet unknown, product formulations. Therefore, FDA recommends that cumulative irritation studies evaluate (1) the proposed sunscreen active ingredient at the highest concentration for which a GRASE determination is sought, in an appropriate vehicle; (2) the vehicle alone; (3) a negative control; and (4) a positive control. The evaluation should include scoring of erythema, edema, and a popular response or skin erosion.\n\nSkin sensitization studies, conducted to detect immunologically mediated reactions, should be conducted in the following three phases:\n\nThe induction phase (three weekly applications for 3 weeks)\n\nThe rest phase (no product application for 10 to 14 days)\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonprescription Sunscreen Drug Products – Safety and Effectiveness Data']","['As explained in the rulemaking, the safety data needed to make a GRAS determination for active ingredients used in consumer antiseptic washes are based on several important scientific developments that affect the safety evaluation of these active ingredients. New data suggest that the systemic exposure to these active ingredients is higher than previously thought, and new information about the potential risks from systemic absorption and long-term exposure has become available. Moreover, new safety information also suggests that widespread antiseptic use can have an impact on the development of bacterial resistance. Accordingly, the safety data needed to demonstrate safety for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients fall into three broad categories: (1) safety data studies in current FDA guidance (e.g., preclinical and human pharmacokinetic studies (including maximal use trials, developmental and reproductive toxicity studies, and carcinogenicity studies); (2) data to characterize potential hormonal effects; and (3) data to evaluate the development of resistance. These data requirements are the minimum data necessary to establish the safety of long-term, daily, repeated exposure to antiseptic active ingredients used in consumer wash products (81 FR 61106 at 61107).']",0.94999999997625,0.0
2,"With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?","[""--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?\n--------------------\nContext: To help ensure the accuracy of records retained, we recommend that establishments that make an ACTP available for distribution obtain records directly from the creator of such documents whenever possible (e.g., serology/microbiology results should be obtained directly from the testing laboratory). All records should be in English or, if in another language, should be retained and translated to English and accompanied by a statement of authenticity by the translator that specifically identifies the translated document so that compliance with CGMP can be more easily determined by FDA.\n\nRecords Management System\n\nYou should establish and maintain a records management system relating to CGMP. Under this system, you should maintain records pertaining to a specific ACTP in such a way as to facilitate review of the ACTP's history before making it available for distribution and, if necessary, after the ACTP's release, as part of a follow-up evaluation or investigation. You should also maintain and organize records pertinent to the manufacture of the ACTP (e.g., labeling and packaging procedures, and equipment logs). If you maintain records in more than one location, you should design the records management system to ensure prompt identification, location, and retrieval of all records. You should organize your records in a useful manner in accordance with this section.\n\nExample: A recovery establishment under contract with a processor sends ACTPs to the processor. The recovery establishment should send all relevant records, including donor records and records relating to recovery site suitability, as described in section XII.B.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nProcedures and Records, to the processor. The recovery establishment should maintain copies of all transferred records and organize them in its records management system.\n\nMethods of Retention\n\nYou may maintain records electronically, as original paper records, or as true copies such as photocopies, microfiche, or microfilm. Equipment that is necessary to make the records available and legible, such as computer and reader equipment, should be readily available. You should back up records stored in electronic systems.\n\nExample: You are a processor that receives paper records of the donor's medical history from the recovery establishment. You review the medical history as part of the donor eligibility determination. Later, you scan the paper records and save them as a.pdf file on a computer that is backed up. The electronic records are true copies of the paper records. Therefore, you may destroy the paper records. However, if instead of scanning, you were to re-type (transfer) the information into the computer, you would be creating a new record, not making a true copy. Errors may have been introduced while re-typing the information into the new record. In this scenario, you should keep the original paper (hardcopy) records as proof of concurrent recordkeeping.\n\nLength of Retention\n\nTo ensure the identity, purity, potency, and safety of ACTPs, we recommend that records be kept for 10 years after their creation, unless stated otherwise in this document.20 You should retain the records pertaining to a specific ACTP at least 10 years after the date of its administration, or if the date of administration is not known, then at least 10 years after the date of the ACTP's distribution, disposition, or expiration, whichever is the latest date.\n\nFootnote 20: The regulations in 21 CFR 211.180 require that records be kept for at least 1 year after expiration. However, we recognize that expiration of ACTPs varies from hours to an indefinite period of time for some cryopreserved ACTPs. Additionally, some forms of contamination or safety concerns may not be evident until years after the product is manufactured. For these reasons, we recommend a record retention period of at least 10 years.\n\nLaboratories that perform relevant disease agent testing of donor specimens and/or microbiological testing of ACTPs that do not know the date of administration, distribution, disposition, or expiration, should keep donor testing information for 10 years after the creation of the record.\n\nContracts and Agreements\n\nYou should maintain the name and address and a list of the responsibilities of any establishment that performs a manufacturing step for you. You should have this information available during inspections conducted by the FDA. We recommend that contracts, agreements, or other arrangements describe the responsibilities of all parties.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nExample 1: A contract, agreement, or other arrangement with an individual or establishment who obtains the donor's medical records should describe the information that you want that individual or establishment to obtain.\n\nExample 2: When donor eligibility is determined following a review of records obtained by another establishment, the contract, agreement, or other arrangement might specifically identify what records will be obtained, in what format they will be provided, responsibilities for record retention and access, and if the reviewing firm will convey donor eligibility conclusions back to the establishment that collected the information.\n\n17 Tracking\n\nGeneral\n\nEach ACTP should be tracked throughout manufacturing, from recovery to final disposition, to ensure that the ACTP is free from contamination and to ensure the quality of the ACTP. If you perform any step in the manufacture of an ACTP during which you handle the ACTP, you should track the ACTP. You should perform tracking to facilitate the investigation of an actual or suspected incidence of contamination, or impact on product quality, and take appropriate and timely corrective action. If you do not handle the ACTP (e.g., the testing laboratory that receives a specimen but does not actually handle the ACTP), you would not participate in tracking the ACTP.\n\nSystem of ACTP Tracking\n\nYou should establish and maintain a tracking system that enables the ACTP to be tracked from:\n\nThe donor to the consignee or final disposition; and\n\nThe consignee or final disposition to the donor.\n\nAlternatively, if you perform some, but not all, of the steps in the manufacture of an ACTP during which you handle the ACTP, you may participate in a system of ACTP tracking established and maintained by another establishment responsible for other steps in the manufacture of the same ACTP. You should verify that the tracking system is effective, especially if you participate in a tracking system maintained by another establishment.\n\nDistinct Identification Code\n\nYou should ensure that each ACTP that you manufacture is assigned and labeled with a distinct identification code that relates the ACTP to the donor and to all records pertaining to the ACTP. You should also ensure that labeling includes information needed to facilitate effective tracking from the donor to the recipient and from the recipient to the donor. The distinct identification code should be created specifically for tracking purposes.\n\n4.4.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nYou may adopt the distinct identification code assigned by another establishment engaged in manufacturing or assign a new code. You should verify and/or validate that your tracking system is effective. The distinct identification code should be able to track to the donor but does not necessarily have to be on all records concerning the donor or on the package insert. However, the distinct identification code should be affixed to the ACTP container.\n\nTracking from Conginese to Donor\n\nAs part of your tracking system, you should establish and maintain a method for recording the distinct identification code and type of each ACTP distributed to a consignee to enable tracking from the consignee to the donor.\n\nTracking from Donor to Consignee or Final Disposition\n\nAs part of your tracking system, you should establish and maintain a method for documenting the disposition of each of your ACTPs, to enable tracking from the donor to the consignee or final disposition. This information should permit the prompt identification of the consignee of the ACTP, if any.\n\nConsignees\n\nAs part of the tracking system, you should inform the consignee that the consignee should enter the distinct identification code for the ACTP in the recipient animal's veterinary medical record. This will help to identify affected recipients in the event you become aware of ACTP contamination or a product defect (e.g., contamination with a disease agent or improper storage conditions). Also, you should request that the consignee notify you of the distinct identification code for the ACTP if an ACTP is associated with any adverse drug experiences or product defects.\n\nExample: You distribute an ACTP to a veterinary hospital. As part of your tracking system, the ACTP label contains a distinct identification code that relates the ACTP to the donor, the donation event, and the records pertaining to that ACTP. The ACTP label also includes a sticker with the distinct identification code and directions for the veterinarian to maintain the sticker in the recipient animal's veterinary medical record. After distribution of the ACTP you become aware that the donor of the ACTP was infected with a relevant disease agent at the time of donation. Using your tracking system, you contact the veterinary hospital and inform them of the potential risk of infection. You also provide them with the distinct identification code related to the ACTP derived from the infected donor. Using the sticker placed in the veterinary medical records, the veterinary hospital can identify and treat affected recipients and report any adverse drug experiences back to you.\n\nGeneral\n\nRecording and evaluating complaints is important for monitoring the safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity of the ACTP.\n\nProcedures\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #253 Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Animal Cells, Tissues, and Cell- and Tissue-Based Products""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?\n--------------------\nContext: Under what circumstances may QAU audit reports be inspected by FDA? Is there any requirement to maintain these reports or can they be discarded?\n\nQU audit reports as a matter of administrative policy are exempt from routine FDA inspection. FDA\'s access to QAU audit reports would be through the Courts should the subject matter of those reports be litigated. Since there is no FDA requirement that these reports be maintained, the disposition of these reports is up to the firm\'s management. FDA advises that such records not be destroyed without the firm seeking advice from its legal counsel.\n4. What are the quality assurance unit inspection requirements for acute and short-term studies?\n\nFor studies lasting less than 4 weeks, each final report should be reviewed by the quality assurance unit for accuracy. With regard to the in process phases (dose preparation, dose administration, in vivo observation and measurement, necropsy, etc.), a random sampling approach could be used so that over a series of studies each critical phase has been monitored. The random sampling approach should be statistically designed so that it is adequate for revealing GLP deviations. The approach and its justification should be made a part of the standard operating procedures of the quality assurance unit.\n5. What constitutes proper quality assurance unit inspection of each phase of a nonclinical laboratory study?A variety of procedures are acceptable for performing a quality assurance unit inspection. The GLPs do not mandate specific procedures. The development of an acceptable procedure should not necessarily be limited to but should consider the following:\n\n(a) nonclinical laboratory studies lasting longer than 6 months should be inspected every 3 months; whereas, studies lasting less than 6 months should be inspected at suitable intervals,\n\n(b) each phase of the study should be inspected,\n\n(c) inspection reports are to be submitted to management and to the study director, and\n\n(d) the purpose of the inspections is to identify significant problems, which may affect study integrity, and to determine that no changes from approved protocols or standard operating procedures were made without proper authorization.\n\nThe phases of a particular study will be determined by the nature of the study. For example, the phases of a typical feeding study include the following:\n\nprotocol development and approval\n\ntest article characterization\n\ntest article stability determination\n\ntest article-carrier mixture preparation\n\ntest article-carrier mixture sampling\n\ntest article-carrier mixture homogeneity determination\n\ntest system quarantine\n\ntest system allocation to housing\n\ntest article carrier mixture distribution to test system\n\nperiodic measurements\n\nanimal observations\n\nfood consumption\n\nbody weights\n\nblood sampling -- hematology and clinical chemistry\n\nnecropsy -- histopathology\n\nstatistical analyses and report preparation\n\nThe type of inspection will depend on the nature of the phase. Each phase must be inspected at least once during the study; the times selected for inspection should be those most likely to reveal problems before the quality of the data generated could be adversely affected.\n\nCould you take a typical subacute 14-day study and define the phases?Phases in a short term study (depending on the type) would include protocol preparation, dose preparation, animal allocation, test system dosage, animal observation, necropsy, data recording, data analysis and final report writing.\n\nBy what authority may the Agency examine master schedule sheets for studies, which may never be used in support of an application for a research or marketing permit?\n\nStudies that are not intended to be used to support an application for a research or marketing permit are not covered by the GLPs and need not appear on the master schedule sheet. If however, the studies are intended to be submitted, then they should be listed and can be inspected by the Agency under its authority to evaluate the results of studies designed to demonstrate product safety.\n\nAre acute studies to be included on the master schedule sheet?\n\nYes, if they fall within the scope of the GLPs.\n\nIn regard to the master schedule sheet, can the ""current status of each study"" be satisfied by listing the starting date and completion date of the study? Can the ""status of the final report"" be satisfied by listing the estimated or actual date of issuance of the final report?\n\nAlthough the GLPs do not specify entries for ""current status of each study,"" dates alone would not be adequate. Suggested entries that are possible include ""study proceeding according to protocol,"" ""study proceeding according to protocol as amended on such-and-such date,"" ""study terminated due to such-and-such,"" etc. Likewise, entries for the status of the final report might include ""awaiting final hematology report,"" ""data in statistical analysis,"" ""first draft prepared,"" ""draft under circulation for review and comment,"" etc.\n\nIn our laboratory, critical operations for all studies are carried out by the same individuals using essentially similar procedures. Would it be adequate for the quality assurance unit to inspect a set of representative operations for GLP and standard operating procedure compliance that would incorporate a good cross-section of studies?\n\nNo, but refer to the answer under question 4 above.\n\nIn reference to the quality assurance unit review of the final report, you have indicated that not all numbers have to be traced. Do you have in mind a standard, which describes an acceptable level of accuracy, e.g., 90%, 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%?The quality assurance unit review is to ensure that the final report accurately reflects the raw data. Inasmuch as final reports of certain long-term studies can encompass several hundred thousand observations, it would be a prodigious exercise for the quality assurance unit to verify and trace all raw data. Further, the Agency did not mean to require that the quality assurance unit review would include a check of the accuracy of the calculations used to arrive at the final report. This activity would be redundant since the contributing scientists would have already done so in preparing their reports. Rather, the review was expected to be of sufficient depth to reveal inaccuracies in the final report. Consequently, the Agency envisioned the development of a statistically based system, whereby; a random sample of the results in the final report is traced. The procedure should be made a part of the standard operating procedures. The Agency has not established an acceptable level of accuracy of the trace.\n\nIs the master schedule sheet intended to be prospective or historical? If it is historical, what is the required retention period?\n\nThe master schedule sheet is intended to include a listing of all nonclinical laboratory studies currently in progress as well as those which have been conducted during the terms specified in section 58.195 of the GLPs.\n* Does the master schedule sheet have to list studies on compounds for which no data has yet been submitted to the Agency?\n\nYes. The GLPs cover all nonclinical laboratory studies of Agency regulated products that support or are intended to support applications for research or marketing permits.\n* The GLPs state that the quality assurance unit should assure that the final report reflects the study results. Is it required that every final report be reviewed by the quality assurance unit?\n\nYes. This procedure helps to ensure the accuracy of the final report.\n* Does the quality assurance unit review of each final study report have to be reported to management?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry'

The retention periods for these documents should be specified.\n\nAll production, control, and distribution records should be retained for at least 1 year after the expiry date of the batch. For APIs with retest dates, records should be retained for at least 3 years after the batch is completely distributed.\n\nWhen entries are made in records, these should be made indelibly in spaces provided for such entries, directly after performing the activities, and should identify the person making the entry. Corrections to entries should be dated and signed and leave the original entry still readable.\n\nDuring the retention period, originals or copies of records should be readily available at the establishment where the activities described in such records occurred.

Yes.\n\nSection 58.35 Quality Assurance Unit.\n\nAs a QAU person, I have no expertise in the field of pathology. How do I audit pathology findings?\n\nThe QAU is not expected to perform a scientific evaluation of a study nor to ""second-guess"" the scientific procedures that are used. QAU inspections are made to ensure that the GLPs, SOPs and protocols are being followed and that the data summarized in the final report accurately reflect the results of the study. A variety of procedures can be used to do this but certainly the procedures should include an examination and correlation of the raw data records.\n\nMust the QAU keep copies of all protocols and amendments and SOPs and amendments?\n\nThe QAU must keep copies of all protocols as currently amended. The only SOPs that the QAU are required to keep are those concerned with the operations and procedures of the QAU.\n\nDoes the QAU have to monitor compliance with regulations promulgated by other government agencies?\n\nThe GLPs do not require this.\n\nCan an individual who is involved in a nonclinical laboratory study perform QAU functions for portions of the study that the individual is not involved with?\n\nNo. However, the individual can perform QAU functions for a study that he/she is not involved with.\n\nDoes the QAU review amendments to the final report? Yes.\n\nWhat studies are required to be listed on the master schedule sheet?\n\nThe master schedule sheet should list all nonclinical laboratory studies conducted on FDA regulated products and intended to support an application for a research or marketing permit.\n\nMay the QAU in its periodic reports to management and the study director recommend actions to solve existing problems? Yes.\n\nIf raw data are transcribed and sent to the sponsor for (a) preparing the data in computer format or (b) performing a statistical analysis, what are the responsibilities of the QAU?\n\nFor (a) the QAU should assure that the computer formatted data accurately reflect the raw data. For (b) the statistical analyses would comprise a report from a participating scientist, therefore it should be checked by QAU and appended to the final report.\n9. Can the QAU also be responsible for maintaining the laboratory archives?\n\nYes.\n10. Can a QAU be constituted as\'a single person?\n\nYes, provided that the workload is not excessive and other duties do not prevent the person from doing an adequate job. It would be prudent to designate an alternate in case of disability/vacations/ etc.\n11. Who is responsible for defining study phases and designating critical study phases and can these be covered in the SOP?\n\nThe GLPs do not isolate this responsibility. Logically, the task should be done by the study director and the participating scientists working in concert with the QAU and laboratory management. It can be covered by an SOP.\n\nSUBPART C FACILITIES\n\nSection 58.41 General.\n\nNo questions were asked on the subject.\n\nSection 58.43 Animal Care Facilities.\n\nDo the GLPs require clean/dirty separation for the animal care areas?\n\nNo. They do require adequate separation of species and studies.\n\nDo the GLPs require that separate animal rooms be used to house test systems and conduct different studies? No. The GLPs require separate areas adequate to assure proper separation of test systems, isolation of individual projects, animal quarantine and routine or specialized housing of animals, as necessary to achieve the study objectives.\n\nDo the GLPs require that access to animal rooms be limited only to authorized individuals? No. However, undue stresses and potentially adverse influences on the test system should be minimized. Section 58.45 Animal Supply Facilities. No questions were asked on the subject. Section 58.47 Facilities for Handling Test and Control Articles.\n\nDo test and control articles have to be maintained in locked storage units? No, but accurate records of test and control article accountability must be maintained. Section 58.49 Laboratory operation areas. No questions were asked on the subject. Section 58.51 Specim and data storage facilities. 1. What do the GLPs require with regard to facilities for the archives? Space should be provided for archives limited to access by authorized personnel. Storage conditions should minimize deterioration of documents and specimens. Section 58.53 Administrative and personnel facilities. No questions were asked on the subject.\n\nSUBPART D\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nSection 58.61 Equipment design.\n\nNo questions were asked on the subject.\n\nSection 58.63 Maintenance and calibration of equipment.\n\nHas FDA established guidelines for the frequency of calibration of equipment (balances) used in nonclinical laboratory studies?\n\nThe agency has not established guidelines for the frequency of calibration of balances used in nonclinical laboratory studies. This would be a large undertaking in part due to the wide variety of equipment that is available and to the differing workloads that would be imposed on the equipment. It is suggested that you work with the equipment manufacturers and your study directors to arrive at a suitable calibration schedule. The key point is that the calibration should be frequent enough to assure data validity. The maintenance and calibration schedules should be part of the SOPs for each instrument.\n\nWhen an equipment manufacturer performs the routine equipment maintenance, do the equipment manufacturer\'s maintenance procedures have to be described in the facilities\' SOPs?\n\nNo. The facilities\' SOPs would have to state that maintenance was being performed by the equipment manufacturer according to their own procedures.\n\nSUBPART E\n\nTESTING FACILITIES OPERATION\n\nSection 58.81 Standard Operating Procedures.\n\nWhat amount of detail should be included in the standard operating procedures (SOPs)?\n\nThe GLPs do not specify the amount of detail to be included in the SOPs. The SOPs are intended to minimize the introduction of systematic error into a study by ensuring that all personnel will be familiar with and use the same procedures. The adequacy of the SOPs is a key responsibility of management. A guideline of adequacy that could be used is to determine whether the SOPs are understood and can be followed by trained laboratory personnel.\n\nCan the study director authorize changes in the SOPs? No. Approval of the SOPs and changes thereto is a function of laboratory management.\n\nHow many copies of the complete laboratory SOPs are needed? Each work station should have access to the SOPs applicable to the work performed at the station. A complete set of the SOPs, including authorized amendments, should be maintained in the archives.\n\nWho approves the SOPs of the Quality Assurance Unit? Laboratory Management.\n\nTo what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs? The GLPs do not specify the contents of individual SOPs, but the SOP that deals with computerized data acquisition should include the purpose of the program, the specifications, the procedures, the end products, the language, the interactions with other programs, procedures for assuring authorized data entry and access, procedures for making and authorizing changes to the program, the source listing of the program and perhaps even a flow chart. The laboratory\'s computer specialists should determine what other characteristics need to be described in the SOP.\n\nSection 58.83 Reagents and solutions.\n1. What are the GLP requirements for labeling of reagents purchased directly from manufacturers? All reagents used in a nonclinical laboratory have to be labeled to indicate identity, titer or concentration, storage requirements, and expiration date. Purchased reagents usually carry all these items except for the expiration date, so the laboratory should label the reagent containers with an expiration date. The expiration date selected should be in line with laboratory experience and need not require specific stability testing.\n2. How extensive should the procedures be for confirming the quality of incoming reagents used in nonclinical laboratory studies? Laboratory management should make this decision but the SOPs should document the actual procedures used.\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Questions and Answers'

If a treatment fails to show superiority to placebo, for example, it means either that the treatment was ineffective or that the study as designed and conducted was not capable of distinguishing an effective treatment from placebo.\n\nA useful approach to the assessment of assay sensitivity in active control trials and in placebo-controlled trials is the three-arm trial, including both placebo and a known active treatment, a trial design with several advantages. Such a trial measures effect size (test drug versus placebo) and allows comparison of test drug and active control in a setting where assay sensitivity is established by the active control versus placebo comparison. (See Section 2.1.5.1.1).\n\n2 Detailed consideration of types of control (2.0)\n\nPlacebo Control (2.1)\n\nDescription (See Section 1.3.1) (2.1.1)\n\nIn a placebo-controlled trial, subjects are assigned, almost always by randomization, to either a test treatment or to a placebo. A placebo is a dummy treatment that appears as identical as possible to the test treatment with respect to physical characteristics such as color, weight, taste and smell, but that does not contain the test drug. Some trials may study more than one dose of the test treatment or include both an active control and placebo. In these cases, it may be easier for the investigator to use more than one placebo (double-dummy) than to try to make all treatments look the same. The use of placebo facilitates, and is almost always accompanied by, double-blinding (or double-masking). The difference in outcome between the active treatment and placebo groups is the measure of treatment effect under the conditions of the trial. Within this general description there are a wide variety of designs that can be used successfully: Parallel or crossover designs (see ICH E9), single fixed dose or titration in the active drug group, several fixed doses. Several designs meriting special attention will be described below. Note that not every study that includes a placebo is a placebo-controlled study. For example, an active control study could use a placebo for each drug (double-dummy) to facilitate blinding; this is still an active control trial, not a placebo-controlled trial. A placebo-controlled trial is one in which treatment with a placebo is compared with treatment with a test drug.\n\nIt should also be noted that not all placebos are completely inactive. For example, some vehicle controls used in studies of topical skin preparations may have beneficial activity. This does not impair the ability of the design to measure the specific effect of the test agent. Special problems arise when the chosen vehicle control may have harmful effects. In this case a no treatment arm would allow the measurement of the total effect of the test agent plus its vehicle.\n\nAbility to Minimize Bias (2.1.2)\n\nThe placebo-controlled trial, using randomization and blinding, generally minimizes subject and investigator bias. Such trials, however, are not impervious to blind-breaking through recognition of pharmacologic effects of one treatment; blinded outcome assessment can enhance bias reduction in such cases. This concern may be particularly relevant in crossover studies.\nWhen a new treatment is tested for a condition for which no effective treatment is known, there is usually no ethical problem with a study comparing the new treatment to placebo. Use of a placebo control may raise problems of ethics, acceptability, and feasibility, however, when an effective treatment is available for the condition under study in a proposed trial. In cases where an available treatment is known to prevent serious harm, such as death or irreversible morbidity in the study population, it is generally inappropriate to use a placebo control. There are occasional exceptions, however, such as cases in which standard therapy has toxicity so severe that many patients have refused to receive it.\n\nIn other situations, when there is no serious harm, it is generally considered ethical to ask patients to participate in a placebo-controlled trial, even if they may experience discomfort as a result, provided the setting is noncoercive and patients are fully informed about available therapies and the consequences of delaying treatment. Such trials, however, even if ethical, may pose important practical problems. For example, deferred treatment of pain or other symptoms may be unacceptable to patients or physicians and they may not want to participate in a trial that requires this. Whether a particular placebo controlled trial of a new agent will be acceptable to subjects and investigators when there is known effective therapy is a matter of investigator, patient, and institutional review board (IRB)/ independent ethics committee (IEC) judgment, and acceptability may differ among ICH regions. Acceptability could depend on the specific design of the trial and the patient population chosen, as will be discussed below (see section 2.1.5).\n\nWhether a particular placebo-controlled trial is ethical may in some cases depend on what is believed to have been clinically demonstrated under the particular circumstances of the trial. For example, a short term placebo-controlled trial of a new antihypertensive agent in patients with mild essential hypertension and no end-organ disease might be considered generally acceptable, while a longer trial, or one that included sicker patients, probably would not be.\n\nIt should be emphasized that use of a placebo or no-treatment control does not imply that the patient does not get any treatment at all. For example, in an oncology trial, when no active drug is approved, patients in both the placebo or no-treatment group and the test drug group will receive needed palliative treatment, such as analgesics, and best supportive care. Many placebo-controlled trials are conducted as add-on trials, where all patients receive a specified standard therapy or therapy left to the choice of the treating physician or institution (see section 2.1.5.2.1).\n\n4. Usefulness of Placebo-controlled Trials and Validity of Inference in Particular Situations (_2.1.4)_\n\nWhen used to show effectiveness of a treatment, the placebo-controlled trial is as free of assumptions and reliance on external (extra-study) information as it is possible to be. Most problems in the design or conduct of a trial increase the likelihood of failure to demonstrate a treatment difference (and thereby establish efficacy), so that the trial contains built-in incentives for trial excellence. Even when the primary purpose of a trial is comparison of two active agents or assessment of dose-response, the addition of a placebo provides an internal standard that enhances the inferences that can be drawn from the other comparisons.\n\nPlacebo-controlled trials also provide the maximum ability to distinguish adverse effects caused by a drug from those resulting from underlying disease or intercurrent illness. Note, however, that when used to show similarity of two treatments, for example, to show that a drug does not have a particular adverse effect by showing similar rates of the event in drug-treated and placebo-treated patients, placebo-controlled trials have the same assay sensitivity problem as any equivalence or non-inferiority trial (see section 1.5.1). To interpret the result, one must know that if the study drug had caused an adverse event, the event would have been observed. Ordinarily, such a study should include an active control treatment that does cause the adverse event in question, but in some cases it may be possible to conclude that a study has assay sensitivity to such an effect by documenting historical sensitivity to adverse drug effects for a particular study design.\n\nModifications of Design and Combinations with Other Controls That Can Resolve Ethical, Practical, or Inferential Issues (2.1.5)\n\nIt is often possible to address the ethical or practical limitations of placebo-controlled trials by using modified study designs that still retain the inferential advantages of these trials. In addition, placebo-controlled trials can be made more informative by including additional treatment groups, such as multiple doses of the test agent or a known active control treatment.\n\nAdditional Control Groups (2.1.5.1)\n\n[\\mbox{i.}\\qquad\\mbox{Three-arm Trial; Placebo and Active Control (2.1.5.1.1)}]\n\nAs noted in section 1.5.1, three-arm trials including an active control as well as a placebo-control group can readily assess whether a failure to distinguish test treatment from placebo implies ineffectiveness of the test treatment or is simply the result of a trial that lacked the ability to identify an active drug. The comparison of placebo to standard drug in such a trial provides internal evidence of assay sensitivity. It is possible to make the active groups larger than the placebo group to improve the precision of the active drug comparison, if this is considered important. This may also make the trial more acceptable to patients and investigators, as there is less chance of being randomized to placebo.\n\n[\\mbox{ii.}\\qquad\\mbox{Additional Doses (2.1.5.1.2)}]\n\nRandomization to several fixed doses of the test drug in addition to placebo allows assessment of dose-response and may be particularly useful in a comparative trial to ensure a fair comparison of treatments (see ICH E4: Dose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration).\n\n[\\mbox{iii.}\\qquad\\mbox{Factorial Designs (2.1.5.1.3)}]\n--------------------\nContext title: E10 Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: Analysis aligned to a principal stratum strategy usually requires strong assumptions. For example, some principal stratification methods infer this from baseline characteristics of the subjects, but the correctness of this inference may be difficult to assess. This difficulty cannot be avoided by simplified methods, however. For example, simply comparing subjects who do not have an intercurrent event on the test treatment to those who do not have an event on control, assuming intercurrent events are unrelated to treatment, is very difficult to justify.\n\nEven after defining estimands that address intercurrent events in an appropriate manner and making efforts to collect the data required for estimation (see A.4.), some data may still be missing, including e.g. administrative censoring in trials with survival outcomes. Failure to collect relevant data should not be confused with the choice not to collect, or to collect and not to use, data made irrelevant by an intercurrent event. For example, data that were intended to be collected after discontinuation of trial medication to inform an estimand based on the treatment policy strategy are missing if uncollected; however, the same data points might be irrelevant for another strategy, and thus, for the purpose of that second estimand, are not missing if uncollected. Where those efforts to collect data are not successful it becomes necessary to make assumptions to handle the missing data in the statistical analysis. Handling of missing data should be based on clinically plausible assumptions and, where possible, guidedby the strategies employed in the description of the estimand. The approach taken may be based on observed covariates and post-baseline data from individual subjects and from other similar subjects. Criteria to identify similar subjects might include whether or not the intercurrent event has occurred. For example, for subjects who discontinue treatment without further data being collected, a model may use data from other subjects who discontinued treatment but for whom data collection has continued.\n\na.5.2 Sensitivity Analysis\n\na.5.2.1 Role of Sensitivity Analysis\n\nInferences based on a particular estimand should be robust to limitations in the data and deviations from the assumptions used in the statistical model for the main estimator. This robustness is evaluated through a sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis should be planned for the main estimators of all estimands that will be important for regulatory decision making and labelling in the product information. This can be a topic for discussion and agreement between sponsor and regulator.\n--------------------\nContext title: E9-R1_Step4_Guideline_2019_1203'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: Not collecting any data needed to assess an estimand results in a missing data problem for subsequent statistical inference. The validity of statistical analyses may rest upon untestable assumptions and, depending on the proportion of missing data, this may undermine the robustness of the results (see A.5.). A prospective plan to collect informative reasons for why data intended for collection are missing may help to distinguish the occurrence of intercurrent events from missing data. This in turn may improve the analysis and may also lead to a more appropriate choice of sensitivity analysis. For example, ""loss to follow-up"" may more accurately be recorded as ""treatment discontinuation due to lack of efficacy"". Where that has been defined as an intercurrent event, this can be reflected through the strategy chosen to account for that intercurrent event and not as a missing data problem. To reduce missing data, measures can be implemented to retain subjects in the trial. However, measures to reduce or avoid intercurrent events that would normally occur in clinical practice risk reducing the external validity of the trial. For example, selection of the trial population or use of titration schemes or concomitant medications to mitigate the impact of toxicity might not be suitable if those same measures would not be implemented in clinical practice.\n\nRandomisation and blinding remain cornerstones of controlled clinical trials. Design techniques for avoiding bias are addressed in Section 2.3. Certain estimands may necessitate, or may benefit from, use of trial designs such as run-in or enrichment designs, randomised withdrawal designs, or titration designs. It might be of interest to identify the principal stratum of subjects who can tolerate a treatment using a run-in period, in advance of randomising those subjects between test treatment and control. Dialogue between regulator and sponsor would need to consider whether the proposed run-in period is appropriate to identify the target population, and whether the choices made for the subsequent trial design (e.g. washout period, randomisation) supports the estimation of the target treatment effect and associated inference. These considerations might limit the use of these trial designs, and use of that particular strategy.\n\nA precise description of the treatment effects of interest should inform sample size calculations. Particular care should be taken when making reference to historical studies that might, implicitly or explicitly, have reported estimated treatment effects or variability based on a different estimand. Where all subjects contribute information to the analysis, and where the impact of the strategy to reflect intercurrent events is included in the effect size that is targeted and the expected variance, it is not usually necessary to additionally inflate the calculated sample size by the expected proportion of subject withdrawals from the trial.\n--------------------\nContext title: E9-R1_Step4_Guideline_2019_1203'

The multiplicity issues arising should be addressed.\n\nImpact on trial analysis\n\na.5.1 Main Estimation\n\nAn estimand for the effect of treatment relative to a control will be estimated by comparing the outcomes in a group of subjects on the treatment to those in a similar group of subjects on the control. For a given estimand, an aligned method of analysis, or estimator, should be implemented that is able to provide an estimate on which reliable interpretation can be based. The method of analysis will also support calculation of confidence intervals and tests for statistical significance. An important consideration for whether an interpretable estimate will be available is the extent of assumptions that need to be made in the analysis. Key assumptions should be stated explicitly together with the estimand and accompanying main and sensitivity estimators. Assumptions should be justifiable and implausible assumptions should be avoided. The robustness of the results to potential departures from the underlying assumptions should be assessed through an estimand-aligned sensitivity analysis (see A.5.2.). Estimation that relies on many or strong assumptions requires more extensive sensitivity analysis. Where the impact of deviations from assumptions cannot be comprehensively investigated through sensitivity analysis, that particular combination of estimand and method of analysis might not be acceptable for decision making.\n\nAll methods of analysis rely on assumptions, and different methods may rely on different assumptions even when aligned to the same estimand. Nevertheless, some kinds of assumption are inherent in all methods of analysis aligned to estimands that use each of the different strategies outlined; for example, the methodology for predicting the outcomes that would have been observed in the hypothetical scenario, or for identifying a suitable target population in a principal stratum strategy. Some examples are given below related to the different strategies used to reflect the occurrence of intercurrent events. The issues highlighted will be key components of discussion between sponsor and regulator in advance of an estimand, main analysis and sensitivity analysis being agreed.\n--------------------\nContext title: E9-R1_Step4_Guideline_2019_1203'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: You should provide an estimation of systematic differences between the numeric values generated by the old system and the new system at each site and for all sites combined (CLSI document EP09). You should perform the appropriate regression analysis (Deming regression, see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 3), which accounts for the random errors associated with the old and new system measurements and provide the 95% confidence intervals of the slope and intercept from the regression analysis. The emphasis should be placed on estimating the systematic difference between the numeric values of the old and new systems around the cutoff. You should also calculate the average systematic difference separately for the Negative, High Negative, Low Positive and High Positive samples of the comparison panel.\n\nWe recommend that you present tables (e.g., with old system results defined by the columns and new system results defined by the rows), for data derived from each site and for all data combined (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 4). For the qualitative assays with equivocal (and/or re-test zone), the results of the comparison study should be presented in 3-by-3 tables from data derived from each site and for all data combined (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 5). Based on these tables, you should calculate positive and negative percent agreements at each site along with the corresponding 95% two-sided confidence intervals (for confidence intervals, see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 6). In addition, you should provide the positive and negative percent agreements averaged over three sites with the corresponding 95% two-sided confidence intervals. Because the same samples are used at all three sites, we suggest that a bootstrap approach may be useful for calculating such confidence intervals.\n\nFor qualitative assays with equivocal results (and/or a re-test zone), the comparison study data should be analyzed as having three ordinal categories (e.g., negative, equivocal, positive). Note that the purpose of a migration comparison study is to evaluate the extent of differences between the numeric values obtained from the old system and numeric values obtained from the new system. While re-testing may be indicated in the package insert, this additional testing is unnecessary to fulfill the migration comparison study objective. The initial numeric values should be used in the numeric analysis.\n\nFor qualitative assays with equivocal results (and/or re-test zone), we recommend that you present tables of agreement including positive, negative and equivocal (and/or re-test) as categorical results for data derived for each site and for all sites combined (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 5). Based on the three-by-three tables of agreement, you should calculate positive and negative agreements along with 95% two-sided confidence intervals, and percents of different results by the new system for the equivocal results by the old system for each site separately and for all sites combined. From the three-by-three table, you should calculate the percent of equivocal (and/or re-test) results reported by the new system that are discordant with the equivocal results by the old system. For evaluation of the percents of different results by the new system for the equivocal results by the old system that reflect the natural variability between two measurements by the old system, you should present an allowable total difference zone and perform calculations described in Section VI.B.3.c, below (and in Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 7 and 10).\n\n4 Acceptance Criteria for Qualitative Assay Migration Studies\n\nIn addition to the acceptance criteria for performance of the new system at low levels of analyte and for seroconversion panels (if applicable), we recommend you apply the following criteria to demonstrate that there are no changes to performance characteristics that could affect the safety and effectiveness of the device:\n\nThe systematic difference between numeric values (e.g., signal output, S/CO) of the new and old systems should be either not clinically significant and not statistically significant, or, if statistically significant, should not be clinically significant (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 8).\n\nThe ratio of standard deviations in the precision studies (reproducibility and within-laboratory precision) of the old and new systems should be either not clinically significant and not statistically significant or, if statistically significant, should not be clinically significant (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 2 and 8).\n\nConceptually, the new system measurements can be considered comparable to the old system measurements if the new system measurements of a sample are similar to the repeated evaluations of the same sample when run on the old system. For the old system measurements, one can expect high agreement between repeated measurements for the samples with high concentrations of analyte giving measurement results far from the cutoff, and some degree of discordance for the samples with concentrations measuring close to the cutoff. In the study using comparison panels, the lower limits of the 95% two-sided confidence intervals for the positive and negative percent agreements between the new system and the old system should be higher than 90% (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 9). Discordant results between the Old and new systems can only occur with samples close to the cutoff and not with moderate or high positive samples by the old system (similarly, not with moderate or low negative samples by the old system).\n\nYou should investigate any statistically or clinically significant differences found between the two systems (e.g., in precision testing performance or any systematic difference), and perform risk assessments to determine the percentage of the intended use population that would be affected by such a difference.\n\nMigration Studies for Quantitative Assays\n\nAnalytical Studies for Quantitative Assays\n\nIf you believe that some of the studies described in this section do not apply to your particular device, you should describe your reasoning in detail in your application to FDA. If the design of the analytical studies conducted for the old system were different from those described in this guidance, please contact FDA. We recommend that you use fresh clinical specimens for all analytical studies. If this is impractical in some cases you may substitute or supplement fresh clinical specimens with archived samples. If archived samples are not available, spiked or diluted clinical samples may be used. In some instances, use of otherwise contrived matrix-specific samples may also be appropriate; however these should mimic clinical specimens as much as is feasible. We recommend that you contact FDA if you wish to discuss appropriate sample types for these evaluations. The matrix of any of these alternative specimens should be the same as that specified by the intended use of the old system.\n\na) Performance at Low Analyte Levels\n\nFor assays that were previously approved or licensed with a specified LoB (limit of blank) and LoD (limit of detection), the same evaluations should be repeated with the new system. The study should demonstrate that the LoB and LoD are very similar for both systems (a protocol is described in CLSI document EP17). Specifically, the sample with a concentration at the LoD (reported as ""analyte detected"" approximately 95% of the time, measured by the old system) should also be reported as ""analyte detected"" approximately 95% of the time, if measured by the new system. See Figure 6 below regarding the LoD.\n\nThe limit of quantitation (LoQ, or lower limit of measuring range) of the new system should be estimated and compared with the LoQ of the old system (see CLSI document EP17) and should be similar to that of the old system. The specification criteria for the LoQ of the new system should be the same as for the old system. We also recommend that the LoQ correspond to an analyte concentration level used in the precision studies.\n\n3.4.2 Precision\n\nThis section describes precision study designs including panel composition.\n\n(i) Composition of Precision Panel\n\nWe recommend you evaluate samples with the following levels of analyte:\n\nLowest limit of the measuring range\n\nFigure 6: Relationship between the signal distributions from multiple measurements of a blank sample and a sample with an analyte concentration at the Limit of Detection.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA level of analyte below the medical decision point\n\nAround the medical decision point\n\nA level of analyte above the medical decision point\n\nUpper limit of the measuring range.\n\nIn addition, you should run the appropriate control material and calibrators associated with the test kit in the precision study.\n\nIf the assay has more than one medical decision point, then samples with concentrations around these medical decision points should be evaluated. It is understood that some assays will not have a specific medical decision point, but rather a range of values; in such cases, the panel should contain samples scattered throughout the measuring range of the assay.\n\n4.2.3 Within-Laboratory Precision Study\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff']","['In most studies the sponsor should avoid multiple testings of the same subject because it may skew performance statistics and under-estimate standard deviations.

A validation plan would have prespecified acceptance criteria for relevant validation parameters such as precision, range, accuracy, specificity, detection limit, and quantitation limit. The proposed acceptance criteria for these parameters would ensure that the analytical procedure is appropriate for its intended use. The validation plan would assess whether a revised procedure is more susceptible than the original procedure to matrix effects by process buffers/media, product-related contaminants, or other components present in the dosage form. A plan would identify any statistical analyses that will be performed and whether product testing to compare the two procedures is intended. The need and plan for providing product testing to compare the two procedures could vary depending on the extent of the proposed change, type of product, and type of test (e.g., chemical, biological).\n\nWhen used for release or process control, use of the new revised analytical procedure should not result in deletion of a test or relaxation of acceptance criteria that are described in the approved application.\n\nDoes FDA Have Specific Concerns About Changes in Manufacturing Equipment That Should Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?\n\nComparability protocols may be most useful if applicants are planning to change to equipment with a different operating principal. Equipment changes are often made in conjunction with changes to the manufacturing process. We recommend that you evaluate this type of change with respect to its effect on the production process prior to deciding whether or not a comparability protocol would be appropriate.\n\nDoes FDA Have Specific Concerns About Changing Manufacturing Facilities That Should Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?\n\nThe utility of a comparability protocol is often limited due to the scope of the change and the need, in some cases, for an inspection. For example, a move to a new facility can involve many changes (e.g., new equipment, modified manufacturing process) that are difficult to prospectively identify as part of a comparability protocol because the new facility is unknown or not constructed at the time the comparability protocol is being considered. We recommend you consider carefully the appropriateness of a comparability protocol for a facility change that involves many other changes.\n\nWe recommend a statement be included in the comparability protocol for changing manufacturing facilities saying that a move to a different drug substance or drug product manufacturing site will be implemented only when the site has a satisfactory CGMP inspection for the type of operation. Furthermore, in the case of aseptically processed product, the statement would also indicate that a move to a different facility or area (e.g., room or building on a campus) will be made only when the specific facility or area has a satisfactory CGMP inspection (irrespective of the overall CGMP status for the campus). For a move to another type of site (e.g., drug substance intermediate manufacturing site, testing laboratory), a statement would be included that the move to this site would not be implemented if there were an unsatisfactory CGMP inspection for the site.9\n\nFootnote 9: A satisfactory CGMP inspection is an FDA inspection during which (1) no objectionable conditions or practices were found (No Action Indicated (NAI)) or (2) objectionable conditions were found, but corrective action is left to the firm to take voluntarily and the objectionable conditions will not be the subject of further administrative or regulatory actions (Voluntary Action Indicated (VAI)).\n\nCan a Comparability Protocol Be Used for Container Closure System Changes?\n\nIn the past, applicants have used protocols for container closure system changes, and they can continue to use them. A comparability protocol can be particularly useful for repetitive container closure system changes.\n\nG. Can Implementation of or Changes in Process Analytical Technology (PAT) Be Addressed in a Comparability Protocol?\n\nFDA anticipates that implementation of or changes in PAT could be addressed in a comparability protocol. Early dialogue with FDA is encouraged.10\n\nFootnote 10: See GFI titled “PAT – A Framework for Innovative Pharmaceutical Development, Manufacturing, and Quality Assurance” at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM070305.pdf.\n\nCan a VMF Be Cross-Referenced in an Applicant's Comparability Protocol?\n\nA master file can be cross-referenced in a comparability protocol that provides for CMC changes (e.g., new manufacturer of drug substance, container resin). The protocol would include a commitment to provide a letter authorizing the FDA to review the master file when a postapproval CMC change implemented using the approved comparability protocol is reported to FDA. The comparability protocol would also indicate the type of information (e.g., manufacturing and formulation information for a plastic resin) that will be referenced in the master file and the information that you will provide such as the studies you will perform to demonstrate the suitability of the new material (e.g., conformance to approved specification, compatibility studies, stability studies).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nI. Can a Comparability Protocol Be Included in a VMF?\n\nA comparability protocol can be included in a master file. The protocol can be cross-referenced for CMC changes. Comparability protocols are product specific. Therefore, the applicant's submission would provide a comparability protocol that augments the information provided in the master file by specifying, for example, any additional studies that will be performed to demonstrate suitability of the postchange material (e.g., conformance to approved specification, compatibility studies, and stability studies). The FDA ordinarily neither independently reviews master files nor approves or disapproves submissions to a master file.\n\nJ. Can a Comparability Protocol be Included in a (J)INAD?\n\nComparability protocols may be submitted in a chemistry, manufacturing and controls (J)INAD technical data submission11 or a (J)INAD protocol without substantial data.12\n\nFootnote 11: Technical data submissions are described in GFI #132 - Administrative Applications and the Phased Review Process at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM052\n\n532.pdf\n\nFootnote 12: According to the performance goals and procedures for the ADUFA and AGDUFA reauthorizations for fiscal years 2014 through 2018, comparability protocols as described in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(v) may be submitted as comparability protocols without substantial data in a (J)INAD file. For more complex comparability protocols, for example sterile process validation protocols, the sponsor should discuss and have Agency concurrence regarding the appropriate filing strategy.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: Define factors which effect the extent and nature of analytical characterisation, preclinical, and clinical comparability studies\n\nDefine the significance of product comparability in terms of the molecular and quality attributes as an essential and critical first step when introducing a change to a manufacturing process, e.g., studies involving analytical characterisation, in-process testing, quality control testing, stability determination.\n\nDescribe analytical techniques available to perform the comparison.\n\nDescribe the value of analytical data in assuring the quality and predicting in vivo behaviour of the molecule produced by the changed process.\n\nProvide a set of criteria to facilitate assessment of data generated from the comparison in order to evaluate the impact of documented differences between the products. The phase of product development (e.g., early development, marketed product) and the familiarity with the process and product (e.g., change within one site, change in sites) likely dictates the rigor with which the approaches are applied.\n\nType of Expert Working Group\n\nThe EWG should be composed of experts in the Quality field who will develop the guideline. When the Quality aspects have been addressed, experts from the Safety and Efficacy groups will be invited to consider issues in the preclinical and in the clinical areas, as appropriate. This staged approach to guideline development is sensible in view of the nature and complexity of this issue. It is anticipated that:\n\nthe ""FDA Guidance Concerning Demonstration Of Comparability Of Human Biological Products, Including Therapeutic Biotechnology-Derived Products, April 1996"";\n\nthe CPMP, ""Note For Guidance On Comparability Of Medicinal Products Containing Biotechnology-Derived Proteins As Drug Substance,"" CPMP/BWP/3207/00 March 2002;\n\nthe MHLW paper ""MHLW\'s views and scientific approaches for assessing the comparability of biotechnological / biological products, May 2001"";\n\nthe ICH guidelines: Q6B, CTD-Q, Q5A, Q5B, Q5C, Q5D, S6; and\n\nthe scientific discussions on comparability obtained at the Biologics 2000 conference sponsored by the IABS/USP/FDA,\n\ncan serve as a solid foundation and template, allowing for rapid development of the proposed ICH guideline. Initiation of the work by the EWG should be timely, with consideration given to a gradual phasing in approach, with the expert working group convening first when resources are available.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q5E Concept Paper'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: When Might a Comparability Protocol Be Inappropriate?\n\nA comparability protocol would be inappropriate for some CMC changes. In some cases, it may be impossible for the changes and/or plan for evaluating the effect of the CMC changes on the product to be fully described a priori. A change may also be too complex to evaluate its effect on the product without efficacy, safety (clinical or nonclinical), or pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic (PK/PD) information.\n\nIn general, we do not recommend comparability protocols for:\n\nBroad, nonspecific plans for CMC changes\n\nA change whose adverse effect on the product cannot be definitively evaluated by prespecified tests, studies, analytical procedures, and acceptance criteria\n\nAny CMC change that warrants the submission of a new original application.\n\nA CMC change that requires efficacy, safety (clinical or nonclinical), or PK/PD data to evaluate the effect of the change (e.g., certain formulation changes, clinical or nonclinical studies to qualify new impurities)\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:9]\n\nIn all cases, a comparability protocol would be reviewed and approved by FDA prior to an applicant implementing a change under the protocol. Furthermore, an applicant who is using an approved comparability protocol to implement postapproval CMC changes must assess the effect of the changes on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the product as these factors relate to the safety or efficacy of the product prior to distributing product made with the change. (Section 506A(b) of the act).\n\nHow Are Changes and Study Results Submitted After a Comparability Protocol is Approved?\n\nAfter a protocol is approved, you should document and submit each implemented change within the scope of the protocol using the reporting category designated by FDA. The submission would include (1) the results of all tests and studies specified in your comparability protocol, (2) discussions of any deviations that occurred during the tests or studies, (3) a summary of any investigations performed, and (4) any other pertinent information. To ensure prompt and accurate review, we recommend that you indicate in the cover letter to the submission that it includes data from a change covered under a comparability protocol and provide a reference to the submission in which the comparability protocol was approved.\n\nWhat If Study Results Do Not Meet the Criteria Specified in the Approved Comparability Protocol?\n\nIn certain instances, the tests and studies specified in an approved comparability protocol can lead to an unpredicted or unwanted outcome (e.g., test results do not meet predefined acceptance criteria). If this occurs, you can elect not to implement the change. If you decide to pursue the change, you should submit a prior approval supplement that provides the supporting data to justify why the change will not adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the specific drug product as these factors relate to the safety and effectiveness of the product.\n\nWhen Does a Comparability Protocol Become Obsolete?\n\nNew regulatory requirements, identification of a safety issue (e.g., screening for new infectious agents in materials from a biological source), identification of a new scientific issue, or technological advancement after the comparability protocol has been approved can render a protocol obsolete. We recommend you review the tests, studies, analytical procedures, and acceptance criteria in your approved comparability protocol to ensure they remain current and consistent with the approved application and current FDA policy. We recommend you determine whether the tests, studies, analytical procedures, and acceptance criteria described in your comparability protocol are still appropriate prior to implementing and submitting a change under the protocol. If you find the comparability protocol is no longer correct or adequate, the current protocol should be modified or withdrawn. FDA can request additional information to support a change that is implemented using an obsolete protocol.\n\nHow is an Approved Comparability Protocol Modified?\n\nYou can submit a revised protocol at any time. Like an original protocol, a revised protocol should be submitted as a PAS or (J)INAD protocol (see V.J.) to your application following the recommended submission procedures summarized in section IV.1. To ensure prompt and accurate review, we recommend that you indicate in the cover letter to the submission that it includes a revision to an approved comparability protocol and identify all modifications.\n\nA comparability protocol would be modified to reflect relevant changes in the application. For example, an applicant could request a change in an analytical procedure that is used for release testing but is also cited in an approved comparability protocol. As part of the request to make such a change, FDA recommends that the applicant indicate up front all comparability protocols that will be affected. The specified comparability protocols can be updated as part of this submission using the appropriate reporting category for the change, rather than submitting a separate submission requesting a modification of the comparability protocol.\n\nEditorial changes can also be made. Notification of editorial changes to a comparability protocol can be provided in the AR.\n\nV Content of a Comparability Protocol\n\nWe recommend that a comparability protocol be developed and used within the context of existing change control procedures. Such procedures ensure that specified changes do not adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product.\n\nThe comparability protocol can describe a single CMC change or multiple changes. Each change should be specified and the acceptance criteria for evaluating the effect of the changes should be well defined. If multiple changes are included in a protocol, we recommend that the multiple changes be interrelated (i.e., one change cannot be made without the others). For example, a change in a fermentation medium component used to produce an antibiotic can result in more rapid cell growth, which, in turn, causes a higher production rate of antibiotic. Changes related to this change in culture medium could include modification in the length of cell fermentation, increase in harvesting time, and/or changes to purification columns. We recommend that you submit separate comparability protocols for unrelated changes.\n\nWhat are the Basic Elements of a Comparability Protocol?\n\nv.1.1 Description of the Planned Changes\n\nA comparability protocol should provide a detailed description of the proposed changes clearly identifying all differences from the conditions approved in the application. A table, diagram, and/or flow chart can be included to help illustrate the differences.\n\niv.2.2 Specific Tests and Studies to Be Performed\n\nA list should be included of the specific tests (e.g., release, in-process) and studies (e.g., characterization, stability, removal of impurities, laboratory-scale adventitious agent removal or inactivation) you will perform to assess the effect of the change on the drug substance, drug product, and/or, if appropriate, the intermediate, in-process material, or component (e.g., container closure system) directly affected by the change. Include the rationale for selecting the particular battery of tests and studies. For example, the use of nonroutine studies (e.g., characterization) can be warranted in cases where in-process or release specifications are not sufficiently discriminatory to evaluate the change.\n\nA protocol should include a plan to compare results from routine batch release testing and, as appropriate, nonroutine testing (e.g., characterization studies) on pre- and postchange products or other material, if appropriate. The protocol should specify the number and type (e.g., pilot, production) of pre- and postchange batches and/or samples that will be compared. The number and type of batches and/or samples to be compared can vary depending on the extent of the proposed change, type of product or process, and available manufacturing information. Retained samples of prechange material can be used for comparison, provided there is no significant change in material on storage (e.g., level of degradants increasing over time). A plan would specify whether retained samples are going to be used and the maximum age of the retained samples, and include information to support the appropriateness of the use of retained samples. In general, the results from postchange material should fall within the normal batch-to-batch variation observed for prechange material.\n\nA comparability protocol should include a plan for the stability studies that will be performed to demonstrate the equivalence of pre- and postchange product. The comparability protocol would provide (1) information that is typically provided in a stability protocol, such as the number and type of batches that will be studied, test conditions, and test time points or (2) a reference to the currently approved stability protocol. The amount of stability data that will be generated before the product made with the change is distributed would be specified. The plan for evaluating stability could vary depending on the extent of the proposed change, type of product, and available manufacturing information. In some cases, no stability studies may be warranted or a commitment to report results from stability studies in an AR can be sufficient. If no stability studies are planned, we recommend that this be stated clearly.\n\nThe differences, if any, in the tests and studies from those previously reported in the approved application or subsequent updates (i.e., supplements, annual reports) would be described. We recommend you identify the location in your application of any referenced tests or studies.\n\niv.2.3 Analytical Procedures to be Used\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: Under 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(v), an applicant may submit one or more protocols (i.e., comparability protocols) describing tests, studies, and acceptance criteria to be achieved to demonstrate the absence of an adverse effect from specified types of changes. A comparability protocol can be used to reduce the reporting category for specified changes. A proposed comparability protocol must be submitted as a prior approval supplement, if not approved as part of the original application (21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(v)). On February 25, 2003, FDA issued a draft guidance on comparability protocols entitled Comparability protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\n4 General Requirements\n\nOther than for editorial changes in previously submitted information (e.g., correction of spelling or typographical errors, reformatting of batch records), an applicant must notify FDA about each change in each condition established in an approved application beyond the variations already provided for in the application (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(i)).\n\nA supplement or annual report must include a list of all changes contained in the supplement or annual report (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(v)). On the list, FDA recommends that the applicant describe each change in enough detail to allow FDA to quickly determine whether the appropriate reporting category has been used. For supplements, this list must be provided in the cover letter (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(v)). In annual reports, the list should be included in the summary section. The supplement or annual report also is required to describe the change fully (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(i)).\n\nAn applicant making a change to an approved application under section 506A of the Act also must conform to other applicable laws and regulations, including current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements of the Act (21 U.S.C. SS 351(a)(2)(B)) and applicable regulations in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (e.g., 21 CFR parts 210, 211, 225, 226, and 514). For example, manufacturers must comply with relevant CGMP validation and recordkeeping requirements (21 CFR parts 210, 211, 225, 226) and ensure that relevant records are readily available for examination by authorized FDA personnel during an inspection.\n\nAn applicant must include a statement in each supplement and amendment to a supplement certifying that a field copy has been provided to the appropriate FDA district office (21 CFR514.8(b)(1)(iv)).3\n\nFootnote 3: For a change to a product manufactured in a foreign facility, a field copy of the supplement or its amendment is not required to be submitted to an FDA district office. However, FDA recommends that the applicant state that the drug made with the change is manufactured only at a foreign site.\n\n4 Assessing the effect of manufacturing changes\n\nAssessment of the Effects of the Change\n\nThe holder of an approved application under section 512 of the Act must assess the effects of the change before distributing a drug made with a manufacturing change (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(ii)).4 For each change, the supplement or annual report must contain information determined by FDA to be appropriate and include the information developed by the applicant in assessing the effects of the change (section 506A(b), (c)(1), (d)(2)(A), and (d)(3)(A) of the Act). The type of information that must be included in a supplemental application or annual report is specified in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(iii), (b)(3)(iv), (b)(3)(vi), and (b)(4)(iii).\n\nFootnote 4: Assess the effects of the change means to evaluate the effects of a manufacturing change on the identity, strength, quality, purity and potency of a drug as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug. (21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(i)). The term assess or assessment as used in this guidance are not the same as validation. Certain validation information, such as sterilization processes, is considered information that is needed to assess the effect of the change as specified in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(ii) and should be submitted in an NADA or ANADA. Unless otherwise specified by FDA, other validation (e.g., process, equipment) data need not be submitted in the application, but must be retained at the facility and be available for review by FDA (see, e.g., 21 CFR 211.180).\n\nConformance to Specifications\n\nAn assessment of the effects of a change on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the drug should include a determination that the drug substance intermediates, drug substance, in-process materials, and/or drug product affected by the change conform to the approved specifications.5 A specification is a quality standard (i.e., tests, analytical procedures, and acceptance criteria) provided in an approved application to confirm the quality of drugs including, for example, drug substances, Type A medicated articles, drug products, intermediates, raw materials, reagents, components, in-process materials, container closure systems, and other materials used in the production of a drug. (21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iv)). Acceptance criteria are numerical limits, ranges, or other criteria for the tests described (21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iv)). Conformance to a specification means that the material, when tested according to the analytical procedures listed in the specification, will meet the listed acceptance criteria.\n\nFootnote 5: If a specification needs to be revised as a result of the change, this would be considered a multiple change (see sections VIII and XI).\n\n3 Contains Non-Binding Recommendations\n\nIn addition to confirming that the material affected by manufacturing changes continues to meet its specification, the applicant should perform additional testing, when appropriate, to assess whether the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a drug as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug have been or will be affected. The assessment should include, as appropriate, evaluation of any changes in the chemical, physical, microbiological, biological, bioavailability, and/or stability profiles. This additional assessment could involve testing of the post-change drug itself or, if appropriate, the material directly affected by the change. The type of additional testing that an applicant should perform would depend on the type of manufacturing change, the type of drug, and the effect of the change on the quality of the drug. For example:\n\nEvaluation of changes in the impurity or degradant profile could first involve profiling using appropriate chromatographic techniques and then, depending on the observed changes in the impurity profile, toxicology tests to qualify a new impurity or degradant or to qualify an impurity that is above a previously qualified level.6 Footnote 6: Recommendations on identifying, qualifying, and reporting impurities can be found in relevant guidances (e.g., VICH GL10(R), Impurities in New Veterinary Drug Substances (Revision), Draft Revised Guidance, (GFI 92) (January 6, 2006)).\n\nEvaluation of the hardness or friability of a tablet after certain changes.\n\nAssessment of the effect of a change on bioequivalence could include, for example, multipoint and/or multimedia dissolution profiling and/or an in vivo bioequivalence study.\n\nEvaluation of extractables from new packaging components or moisture permeability of a new container closure system.\n\nAn applicant should refer to all relevant FDA guidance documents for recommendations on the information that should be submitted to support a given change. If guidance for information that should be submitted to support a particular change is not available, CVM's Division of Manufacturing Technologies, HFV-140, should be consulted.\n\nEquivalence\n\nWhen testing is performed, the applicant should assess the extent to which the manufacturing change has affected the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the drug product. Typically, this is accomplished by comparing test results from pre- andpost-change material and determining if the test results are equivalent. Simply stated: Is the drug made after the change equivalent to the drug made before the change? Equivalence comparisons frequently have a criterion for comparison with calculation of confidence intervals relative to a predetermined equivalence interval. For this, as well as for other reasons, equivalent does not necessarily mean identical. Equivalence also may relate to maintenance of a quality characteristic (e.g., stability) rather than a single performance of a test.\n\nAdverse Effect\n\nSome manufacturing changes have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug. In many cases, the applicant chooses not to implement these manufacturing changes, but sometimes the applicant wishes to do so. If an assessment indicates that a change has adversely affected the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug, FDA recommends that the change be submitted in a prior approval supplement, regardless of the recommended reporting category for the change. For example, a process change recommended for a changes-being-effected-in-30-days supplement could cause the formation of a new degradant that requires qualification and/or identification. The applicant's degradation qualification procedures may indicate that there are no safety concerns relating to the new degradant. Even so, the applicant should submit this change in a prior approval supplement with appropriate information to support the continued safety and effectiveness of the drug. During the review of the prior approval supplement, FDA will assess the impact of any adverse effect on the drug as this change may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #83 Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Changes to Approved NADA:ANADA""

In some cases, changes to the drug substance or drug product manufacturing process may also warrant analytical procedure\n\n3.1.1 Realidation\n\nPrinciples described in the validation section (section 3.1.2) apply to revalidation. When a change is made to an analytical procedure (e.g., a change in a piece of equipment or reagent or because of a change in manufacturing process or formulation), revalidation of all or part of the analytical procedure should be considered. Analytical method revalidation may also be warranted because of manufacturing process changes, such as an alteration in the drug substance manufacturing process that could impact method performance (e.g., route of synthesis, fermentation) or introduction of a new drug product formulation.\n\nYou should revalidate to ensure that the analytical procedure maintains its critical performance characteristics (e.g., specificity, precision, accuracy). The degree of revalidation depends on the nature of the change.\n\nAppendix B Analytical Method Comparability Studies\n\nAnalytical method comparability study requests are typically generated when you propose to substitute an FDA-approved analytical procedure with an alternative analytical procedure or when an analytical method is transferred from one laboratory to the other. For information on statistical procedures to use for determining equivalence of two test methods, appropriate literature or text should be consulted.19 These scenarios are discussed below.\n\nFootnote 19: See References section for examples including USP General Chapter (<)1010(>)Analytical Data – Interpretation and Treatment and ASTM E2935 Standard Practice for Conducting Equivalence Testing in Laboratory Applications.\n\n3.1.1 Alternative Analytical Procedures\n\nAn alternative analytical procedure is an analytical procedure that you use in place of the FDA-approved analytical procedure. For an NDA or ANDA, you should include any proposed alternate analytical procedures in the application. You must include a description of the procedure.20 After approval, for an NDA or ANDA, or for a procedure approved in a BLA but not included in an FDA regulation, the addition, revision, or deletion of an alternative analytical procedure that provides the same or increased assurance of the identity, strength, quality, purity,\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]\n\n[544]Guidance for Industry: International Conference on Harmonization\n\n[545] Q1A(R2) Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products (November 2003)\n\n[547]\n\n[548] Q1B Stability Testing: Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products (May 1997)\n\n[549]\n\n[550] Q1C Stability Testing for New Dosage Forms (May 1997)\n\n[552]\n\n[553] Q2(R1) Validation of Analytical Procedures: Text and Methodology (March 1995, May 1997)\n\n[554]\n\n[555] Q3A(R2) Impurities in New Drug Substances (June 2008)\n\n[556]\n\n[557] Q3B(R2) Impurities in New Drug Products (August 2006)\n\n[558]\n\n[559] Q3C Impurities: Residual Solvents (December 1997)\n\n[560]\n\n[561] Q3C Tables and List (February 2012)\n\n[562]\n\n[563] Q5C Quality of Biotechnological Products: Stability Testing of Biotechnological/Biological Products (July 1996)\n\n[565]\n\n[566] Q6A Specifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Chemical Substances (December 2000)\n\n[568]\n\n[569] Q6B Specifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for Biotechnological/Biological Products (August 1999)\n\n[571]\n\n[572] Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guide for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients\n\n[573] (August 2001)\n\n[574]\n\n[575]United States Pharmacopeia/National Formulary\n\n[576]\n\n[577] General Chapter (<)621(>) Chromatography\n\n[578]\n\nInterpretation and Treatment\n\n[580]\n\n[581] General Chapter (<)1224(>) Transfer of Analytical Procedures\n\n[582]\n\n[583] General Chapter (<)1225(>) Validation of Compendial Procedures\n\n[584]\n\n[585] General Chapter (<)1226(>) Verification of Compendial Procedures\n\n[586]\n\n[587] General Notices and Requirements, Applying to Standards, Tests, Assays, and Other Specifications of the United States Pharmacopeia: 7.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: It should be noted that changes in the specification after approval of the application may need prior approval by the regulatory authority.\n\n3.1.2 Justification of Specifications\n\nWhen a specification is first proposed, justification should be presented for each procedure and each acceptance criterion included. The justification should refer to relevant development data, pharmacological standards, test data for drug substances and drug productsused in toxicology and clinical studies, and results from accelerated and long-term stability studies, as appropriate. Additionally, a reasonable range of expected analytical and manufacturing variability should be considered. It is important to consider all of this information.\n\nApproaches other than those set forth in this guidance may be applicable and acceptable. The applicant should justify alternative approaches. Such justification should be based on data derived from the new drug substance synthesis and/or the new drug product manufacturing process. This justification may consider theoretical tolerances for a given procedure or acceptance criterion, but the actual results obtained should form the primary basis for whatever approach is taken.\n\nTest results from stability and scaleup/validation batches, with emphasis on the primary stability batches, should be considered in setting and justifying specifications. If multiple manufacturing sites are planned, it may be valuable to consider data from these sites in establishing the initial tests and acceptance criteria. This is particularly true when there is limited initial experience with the manufacture of the drug substance or drug product at any particular site. If data from a single representative manufacturing site are used in setting tests and acceptance criteria, product manufactured at all sites should still comply with these criteria.\n\nPresentation of test results in graphic format may be helpful in justifying individual acceptance criteria, particularly for assay values and impurity levels. Data from development work should be included in such a presentation, along with stability data available for new drug substance or new drug product batches manufactured by the proposed commercial processes. Justification for proposing exclusion of a test from the specification should be based on development data and on process validation data (where appropriate).\n\nUniversal Tests/Criteria\n\nImplementation of the recommendations in the following section should take into account the ICH guidances ""Q2A Text on Validation of Analytical Procedures"" and ""Q2B Validation of Analytical Procedures: Methodology.""\n\n3.2.1 New Drug Substances\n\nThe following tests and acceptance criteria are considered generally applicable to all new drug substances. encompass the batch data at the time of filling (see section 2.5).\n\n3.2.2 New Drug Products\n\nThe following tests and acceptance criteria are considered generally applicable to all new drug products:\n\n(a) Description: A qualitative description of the dosage form should be provided (e.g., size, shape, and color). If any of these characteristics change during manufacture or storage, this change should be investigated and appropriate action taken. The acceptance criteria should include the final acceptable appearance. If color changes during storage, a quantitative procedure may be appropriate.\n\n(b) Identification: Identification testing should establish the identity of the new drug substance(s) in the new drug product and should be able to discriminate between compounds of closely related structure that are likely to be present. Identity tests should be specific for the new drug substance, e.g., infrared spectroscopy. Identification testing should establish the identity of the new drug product and should be able to discriminate between compounds of closely related structure that are likely to be present. Identity tests should be specific for the new drug substance, e.g., infrared spectroscopy. Identification solely by a single chromatographic retention time, for example, is not regarded as being specific. However, the use of two chromatographic procedures, where the separation is based on different principles, or a combination of its into a single procedure, such as a chiral assay. Please refer to section 3.3.1(d) in this guidance for further discussion of this topic.\n\n(c) Assay: A specific, stability-indicating procedure should be included to determine the content of the new drug substance. In many cases it is possible to employ the same procedure (e.g., HPLC) for both assay of the new drug substance and quantitation of impurities. Results of content uniformity testing for new drug products can be used for quantitation of drug product strength, if the methods used for content uniformity are also appropriate as assays.\n\nIn cases where use of a nonspecific assay is justified, other supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting the achieve overall specificity.\n\nIn cases where use of a nonspecific assay is justified, other supporting assay is justified, other supporting assay is justified, other supporting achieve overall specificity. For example, analysis and a suitable test for impurities achieve overall specificity. For example, where titration is adopted to assay the drug substance for release, the combination of the assay and a suitable test for impurities can be used. A specific procedure should be used when there is evidence of incipient interference with the nonspecific assay.\n\n(d) Impurities: Organic and inorganic extrapolation of meaningful limits on impurities from the body of data generated during development. At the time of filling it is unlikely that sufficient data will be available to assess process consistency. Therefore it is considered inappropriate to establish acceptance criteria that tightly encompass the batch data at the time of filling (see section 2.5).\n\n3.2.2 New Drug Products\n\nThe following tests and acceptance criteria are considered generally applicable to all new drug products:\n\n(a) Description: A qualitative description of the dosage form should be provided (e.g., size, shape, and color). If any of these characteristics change during manufacture or storage, this change should be investigated and appropriate action taken. The acceptance criteria should include the final acceptable appearance. If color changes during storage, a quantitative procedure may be appropriate.\n\n(b) Identification: Identification testing should establish the identity of the new drug substance(s) in the new drug product and should be able to discriminate between compounds of closely related structure that are likely to be present. Identity tests should be specific for the new drug substance, e.g., infrared spectroscopy. Identification solely by a single chromatographic retention time, for example, is not regarded as being specific. However, the use of two chromatographic procedures, where the separation is based on different principles, or a combination of its into a single procedure, such as a chiral assay. Please refer to section 3.3.1(d) in this guidance for further discussion of this topic.\n\n(c) Assay: A specific, stability-indicating assay to determine strength (content) should be included for all new drug products. In many cases it is possible to employ the same procedure (e.g., HPLC) for both assay of the new drug substance and quantitation of impurities. Results of content uniformity testing for new drug products can be used for quantitation of drug product strength, if the methods used for content uniformity are also appropriate as assays.\n\nIn cases where use of a nonspecific assay is justified, other supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting supporting evidence\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]\n\nprocedure to control the presence of the opposite enantiomer may be used.\n\nIdentity. A stereospecific identity test is not generally needed in the drug product release specification. When racemization is insignificant during manufacture of the dosage form and on storage, stereospecific identity testing is more appropriately addressed as part of the drug substance specification. When racemization in the dosage form is a concern, chiral assay or enantiomeric impurity testing of the drug product will serve to verify identity.\n\n(e) Water content: This test is important in cases where the new drug substance is known to be hygroscopic or degraded by moisture or when the drug substance is known to be a stoichiometric hydrate. The acceptance criteria may be justified with data on the effects of hydration or moisture absorption. In some cases, a loss on drying procedure may be considered adequate; however, a detection procedure that is specific for water (e.g., Karl Fischer titration) is preferred.\n\n(f) Inorganic impurities: The need for inclusion of tests and acceptance criteria for inorganic impurities (e.g., catalysts) should be studied during development and based on knowledge of the manufacturing process.\n\nProcedures and acceptance criteria for sulfated ash/residue on ignition should follow pharmaceutical precedents; other inorganic impurities may be determined by other appropriate procedures, e.g., atomic absorption spectroscopy.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q6A Specifications- Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products- Chemical Substances']","['For some changes, the rationale may be as simple as ""due to larger batch size a larger bin blender was required,"" whereas, more complex changes (e.g., change in operating parameters) should be supported by data (reference to the Pharmaceutical Development Report is acceptable).']",0.7499999999625,0.0

In this instance, such reports may be\n\nsubmitted directly to FDA by the applicant conducting the study.\n\nj. Multiple Suspect Drugs from the Same Applicant\n\nIf a reportable event involves two or more drugs from the same manufacturer, only one Form FDA 1639 should be completed. It should be submitted to the NDA, ANDA, or antibiotic application considered ""most suspect"" by the initial reporter. If they are ranked equally, the report should be submitted to the drug first in alphabetical order.\n\nThe adverse event is also reported in the narrative summary portion of the periodic report of the other drug(s).\n\nk. Suspect Drugs with Multiple NDA\'s, ANDA\'s, or Antibiotic Applications by the Same Applicant\n\nA drug product may be the subject of more than one. approved NDA, ANDA, or antibiotic application. This section applies to this situation.\n\nIf an applicant receives a report for a drug and the specific application is identifiable, the report should be submitted to that application.\n\nIf a drug has more than one application, and it cannot be determined which of the approved applications is involved, the report should be submitted to the application that was approved first (usually the one with the lowest application number).\n\nFor drugs having more than one application due to different dosages, reports should be analyzed for an increase in frequency for each individual dosage as well as all dosages combined.\n\nUnlabeled Indications\n\nAn adverse experience associated with the use of a drug for an unapproved indication should be reported as any other adverse event: 15-day report of a serious, unlabeled event on Form FDA 1639; 15-day narrative increased frequency report; or the periodic report.\n\n""Lack of effect"" for an unlabeled indication, however, should not be reported on a Form FDA 1639 nor used in increased frequency calculations; such information may be included in the narrative summary section of the periodic report.\n\nm. Drug Interactions\n\nIf an applicant receives a report classified as a drug interaction, each of the drugs must be identified in Item 14 as a suspect drug.\n\nn. Product Defects\n\nIf a product defect results in an adverse experience, the adverse event should be reported as described in this guideline.\n\no. Internal System for Monitoring, Identifying, and Reporting Adverse Events\n\nEach applicant should develop standardized, formal procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting of ADE\'s to FDA. As a general rule, FDA will consider an applicant responsible for information known to its employees and agents. All applicants should develop procedures that allow expedited report handling, and the applicant should keep on file documentation of due diligence. This applies to both domestic and international surveillance for, and processing of, ADE\'s.\n\np. Labeling Ambiguities\n\nIn some cases, it may be difficult to decide whether or not the reported experience is labeled. In these situations, the event should be considered unlabeled.\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nGLOSSARY\n\nAFFILIATE - Any corporate entity related to the applicant, including all subsidiaries, licensees, licensors, etc.\n\nAPPLICANT - Entity who holds the new drug application (NDA), abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or antibiotic application, and is thus required to report adverse drug experiences. For purposes of this guideline, this term includes manufacturers, packers, and distributors of the drug product.\n\nCAUSAITY ASSESMENT - Determination of whether there- is reasonable possibility that the drug is etiologically related to the adverse event. Causality assessment includes, for example, assessment of temporal relationships, dechallenge/rechallenge information, association with (or lack of association with) underlying disease, presence (or absence) of a more likely cause, plausibility, etc.\n\nCHALLENGE - Administration of a suspect drug by any route.\n\nDECHALLENGE - Withdrawal of a drug from the patient\'s therapeutic regimen.\n\nNEGATIVE DECHALLENGE - Continued presence of an adverse experience after withdrawal of the drug.\n\nPOSITIVE DECHALLENGE - Partial or complete disappearance of an adverse event after withdrawal of the drug.\n\nRECHALLENGE - Reintroduction of a drug suspected of having caused an adverse event following a positive dechallenge.\n\nNEGATIVE RECHALLENGE - Failure of the drug, when reintroduced, to produce signs or symptoms similar to those observed when the drug was previously introduced.\n\nPOSITIVE RECHALLENGE - Reoccurrence of similar signs and symptoms upon reintroduction of the drug.\n\nEXPERIENCE - Synonymous with adverse drug experience, adverse experience, adverse experience, adverse drug event, adverse event.\n\nADVERSE DRUG EXPERIENCE (ADE) - Any undesirable event that is associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug-related by the applicant. Reporting an adverse experience does not necessarily reflect a conclusion APPENDIX A--CONTINUED\n\nby the applicant or FDA that the event is causally related to the drug.\n\nEXPECTED (LABELED) EXPERIENCE - Event is listed in the current FDA-approved labeling for the drug as a possible complication of drug use.\n\nUNEXPECTED (UNLABELED) EXPERIENCE - Event is not listed in the current FDA-approved labeling for the drug. This includes an event that may differ from a labeled reaction because of greater severity or specificity (e.g., abnormal liver function versus hepatic necrosis). Events listed as occurring with a class of drugs but not specifically mentioned with a particular drug are considered unlabeled. (For example, rash with antibiotic X would be unlabeled even if the labeling said ""rash may be associated with antibiotics."" This is because the labeling does not specifically state ""rash is associated with antibiotic X."") Reports of death from an adverse event are considered unlabeled unless the possibility of a fatal outcome from that adverse event is stated in the labeling.\n\nINCREASED FREQUENCY - Increase in the rate of reporting for an adverse drug experience or related events during a specified time period (after adjustment for drug marketing data or number of patients exposed) when compared to the adjusted rate for similar reports during a previous period.\n\nINITIAL REPORTER - The original source of the information submitted by the applicant on Form FDA 1639.\n\nREPORT - A submission to FDA as described in this guideline.\n\nANNUAL REPORT - Contains information described in 21 CFR 314.81 and is NOT addressed in this guideline.\n\nFIFTEEN-DAY REPORT - Fifteen-day reports must be submitted within 15 working days of the time (1) of initial receipt by the applicant of the serious, unlabeled status of the event or (2) of determining that an increase in frequency of a serious, labeled event has occurred.\n\nPERIODIC REPORT - The four-part report described in the text of this guideline and in the regulations.\n\nSERIOUS - An adverse drug experience that is associated with:\n\nDeath;APPENDIX A--CONTINUED\n\nInitial inpatient hospitalization; Prolongation of hospitalization; Permanent or severe disability - permanent or severe disruption in one\'s ability to carry out normal life functions; A life-threatening situation - the initial reporter believed the patient was at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; Congenital anomaly; Cancer; Overdose. STUDY - Systematic collection of ADE\'s resulting from a protocol designed specifically to investigate drug(s) and adverse event(s). SUSPECT DRUG - Drug associated with the ADE as determined by the initial reporter, regardless of the opinion of the applicant.\n\nAPPENDIX B\n\nHOW TO COMPLETE FORM FDA 1639\n\nIn addition to the specific instructions on the back of Form FDA 1639, the following may be helpful:\n\nItem 1--For children under 5 years of age, date of birth should be indicated in Item 1.\n\nItem 2--For a child less than 5 years of age, the age can be stated in months, e.g., ""18 months."" However, make certain that the words ""days,"" ""weeks,"" or ""months"" are legibly written.\n\nItems 4-6--For congenital anomalies, the date of birth or the date pregnancy is terminated should be used for the reaction date.\n\nItem 7--The reaction should be described in detail using the reporter\'s own words. All relevant clinical information about the reaction should be summarized (signs, symptoms, diagnoses, clinical course, etc.). An additional sheet may be attached.\n\nIf serious, explain why.\n\nSpecify if reaction is life-threatening, cancer, overdose, congenital anomaly, or resulted in severe or permanent disability.\n\nUse initial reporter\'s own words; FDA COSTART or other coding may also be added.\n\nItems 8-12--The box for hospitalization should be checked only if the adverse event resulted in hospitalization or prolonged the hospitalization. For other hospitalized patients (i.e., those whose length of stay was not increased by the ADE), the hospitalization box should be left blank.\n\nItem 13--Include available relevant baseline laboratory data (prior to drug administration) and all laboratory data used in diagnosing the reaction.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, How long does FDA estimate it will take firms to compile and provide communications of follow-up information regarding previously communicated information to payors about their unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved/cleared products?\n--------------------\nContext: The followup report should include:\n\nCorrect information contained in the initial report plus the new data. The new data should be marked (e.g., with an asterisk, highlighted, underlined, etc.). Any attachments submitted in the initial report (e.g., journal articles, discharge summaries) should not be resubmitted.\n\nItem 24b - The same unique manufacturer control number used on the initial report; this is essential to prevent duplicate counting of reports.\n\nItem 24c - The date the followup information was received by the applicant.\n\nItem 25a - Clearly marked ""followup.""\n\nTo summarize, the followup report (and attachments, if any) must contain the applicant\'s same unique internal recordkeeping number (control number, Item 24b on Form FDA 1639) as the initial report.\n\nIf the initial report was submitted as a 15-day report, the followup report should be submitted as a 15-day followup report even if the followup information shows that the event was labeled or not serious. Conversely, a 15-day followup report should be submitted if the event is found to be serious and unlabeled, even if the original report was not submitted as a 15-day report.\n\nDO NOT submit a followup report if additional relevant information is not obtained. However, the documentation of the procedure followed in seeking to obtain the additional information should be maintained. FDA may request this documentation.\n\nFifteen-day followup reports should not be submitted in the same envelope with periodic reports. ""15-Day Alert Report"" should be marked on the outside envelope of the 15-day followup reports.\n\nDO NOT submit a followup report when reporting a different experience in a patient for whom a previous experience was reported and submitted. Submit an initial report with a new control number (Item 24b) on a Form FDA-1639 for a new, subsequent experience. Thus, a followup report follows an experience, not a patient.\n\nV. How and Where to Report\n\nWhat and Where to Report\n\nFor prescription drugs without approved NDA\'s, ANDA\'s, or antibiotic applications, adverse experience reports should be sent as single copies to:\n\nDivision of Epidemiology and Surveillance (HFD-730)\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nFor drugs with approved NDA\'s, ANDA\'s, or antibiotic\n\napplications, all 15-day Form FDA 1639 reports of serious, unlabeled\n\nevents; 15-day narrative increased frequency reports of serious,\n\nlabeled events; periodic reports; followup reports, and letters\n\nstating no reports were received during the reporting period should\n\nbe sent in duplicate to:\n\nCentral Document Room\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nPark Building, Room 214\n\n12420 Parklawn Drive\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nAll submissions must be legible, preferably typewritten.\n\nLegible photostatic copies are acceptable. However, visual contrast\n\nmust be adequate to assure clear readable microfilm copies.\n\nIf the applicant becomes aware of a reportable adverse event, the applicant is responsible for transferring the information to a Form FDA 1639 (and narrative increased frequency report if indicated) and submitting it to FDA. If it is a serious, unlabeled event, the Form FDA 1639 should be submitted within 15 days. The applicant should not assume the reporting requirements are fulfilled by asking the initial reporter to return a Form FDA 1639 to the applicant or FDA. The applicant should not wait for the reporter to complete a Form FDA 1639 before submitting a report of a serious, unlabeled event to FDA. A 15-day report can and should be submitted based only on verbal information.\n\nAll ADE reports, except 15-day narrative increased frequency reports, should be reported on a Form FDA 1639. (Detailed guidelines for narrative increased frequency reports are in Appendix C.)\n\nHow To Obtain Copies of Form FDA 1639\n\nTo obtain up to 10 copies of Form FDA 1639 write to:\n\nDivision of Epidemiology and Surveillance (HFD-730)\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n5600 Fishers Lane, Room 15B-31\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nAdditional copies can be obtained from:\n\nPHS Forms and Publications Distribution Center (HFA-268)\n\n12100 Parklawn Drive\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nCopies of blank Form FDA 1639 can also be duplicated by the applicant.\n\nComputerized Forms\n\nIn lieu of using the preprinted Form FDA 1639, a computer-generated report may be submitted if it contains all of the elements of information in the identical enumerated sequence of Form FDA 1639, is completed in accordance with this guideline, and is forwarded with the appropriate number of copies. The typeset must be large and clear enough to assure readable microfilm copies.\n\nEach applicant\'s use of a modified form must be preapproved by FDA in writing.\n\nElectronic Submissions\n\nElectronically produced adverse drug experience reports may be submitted; however, each applicant must obtain prior written approval.\n\nAt this time, only periodic reports may be submitted electronically. Fifteen-day reports (serious, unlabeled events and an increase in frequency of serious, labeled events) may not be submitted electronically. Also, followup reports (to both 15-day and non-15-day reports) may not be submitted electronically.\n\nCIOMS Forms for Foreign Reports\n\nThe Council for International Organizations for Medical Sciences (CIOMS), working with several member nations and industry, has developed a format (resembling Form FDA 1639) for international ADE reporting. With prior written approval, this format can be used for reporting foreign adverse experiences to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nQuestions or Comments about Reporting Formats\n\nRequests for approval of reporting formats (computerized forms, electronic submissions, CIOMS formats, etc.) should be addressed to:\n\nSurveillance and Data Processing Branch (HFD-737)\n\nDivision of Epidemiology and Surveillance\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nPhone: 301-443-6414\n\nQuestions about Determining and Reporting Increased Frequencies\n\nQuestions about determining increased frequencies should be addressed to:\n\nEpidemiology Branch (HFD-733)\n\nDivision of Epidemiology and Surveillance\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nPhone: 301-443-2306Other Questions and Comments\n\nGeneral questions or comments about this guideline or ADE reporting should be addressed to:\n\nReports Evaluation Branch\n\nDivision of Epidemiology and Surveillance (HFD-735)\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nPhone: 301-443-4580\n\nVI. Special Situations\n\nA number of special situations occur that may seemingly complicate reporting requirements. Following are several:\n\na. Scientific Literature Reports\n\nSerious, unlabeled adverse events that are reported in the literature (or as an unpublished manuscript) must be submitted as 15-day reports on Form FDA 1639.\n\nA copy of the article or manuscript must be attached to the completed Form FDA 1639.\n\nA separate Form FDA 1639 must be completed for each identifiable patient (with an identifiable adverse event). Thus, if an article describes six patients with a given adverse experience, six Form FDA 1639\'s should be completed.\n\nWhen an ADE is based on a foreign language article or manuscript, the applicant is expected to translate the publication into English promptly. The original article or manuscript and translation should be attached to the submitted Form FDA 1639.\n\nAll literature reports and manuscript reports should be marked ""Literature"" in Item 24d.\n\nIf multiple drug products are mentioned in the article, Form FDA 1639 should be submitted only by the manufacturer whose drug is the suspect drug.\n\nThe suspect drug is that identified by the article\'s author, and is usually mentioned in the article\'s title.\n\nb. Postmarketing, Clinical Trial, or Surveillance Study of Drugs Involving ADE Monitoring\n\nFor the purposes of this section, a study refers to a formal research effort including a protocol with specific objectives and a scientific methodology for collecting and analyzing ADE data. Anything less rigorous should be treated as a spontaneous report.\n\nThe only experiences from studies that should be considered for submission to FDA under 21 CFR 310.305 or 314.80 are those that would be reported as (1) 15-day reports of serious, unlabeled events and (2) 15-day narrative increased frequency reports of serious, labeled events. These should be reported only if there is a ""reasonable possibility"" that the event is causally related to the drug exposure.\n\nEvents reportable from investigational new drug (IND) trials (with marketed drugs) also must be submitted to the IND as described in 21 CFR 312.32.\n\nFor each ADE, a suspect drug must be identified. Thus, for blinded studies, reports shall be completed only after the code is broken.\n\nPostmarketing, clinical trial, and surveillance studies as described in this section and under 21 CFR 310.305 or 314.80(e) refer to studies specifically monitoring adverse effects of the drug. Adverse events incidental to other types of studies should be treated as spontaneous reports.\n\nc. Foreign Reports\n\nOnly 15-day reports of serious, unlabeled events and 15-day narrative increased frequency reports of serious, labeled events are required to be submitted with respect to foreign reports. Other foreign reports, including serious, labeled events and all nonserious events, are not required to be submitted. However, reports of serious, labeled events should be available and submitted to FDA if requested.\n\nReports are also to be submitted if the foreign ADE is for a product that has the same active moiety as the product marketed in the United States. This is true even if the excipients, dosage forms, strengths, routes of administration, and indications vary.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guideline for Postmarketing Reporting of Adverse Drug Experiences'

Firms should follow their plan for the submission of the stored reports not submitted in the regulatory timeframes. Firms are generally expected to submit stored reports to FDA within 6 months of restoration of the adverse event reporting process to the pre-pandemic state, or after notification by the Agency, any time frame established by FDA. Firms should prioritize the order of submission for stored reports. For example, reports with regulatory timeframes of 30 days or less (e.g., 15-day reports, 30-day reports) should be submitted before periodic safety reports.\n\nFirms that cannot meet adverse event reporting requirements at the minimum levels identified in this guidance should consult the appropriate FDA organizational unit responsible for adverse event reporting compliance.\n\nIV.

See Section E of this guidance for examples of when a 2D data matrix barcode may not be required.\n\nFootnote 48: See FD&C Act sections 582(b)(2)(A) and 582(a)(9).\n\nWith the enactment of the DSCSA, is the guidance for industry ""Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers"" (August 2011) still applicable for the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25?\n\nYes. The guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers remains applicable to the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25 unless or until such time the guidance is revised, replaced, or withdrawn. This guidance should be consulted for questions specific to the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.49\n\nFootnote 49: See guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers (August 2011), available at https://www.fda.gov/files/vaccines%2C%20blood%20%26%20biologies/published/Guidance-for-Industry–Bar-Code-Label-Requirements.pdf).\n\nCan I put only a 2D data matrix barcode on my product as required under the DSCSA in lieu of the linear barcode that is required under SS 201.25, since it also includes the NDC number?\n\nNo. At this time, a 2D data matrix barcode may not be used as a substitution for a linear barcode when one is required under SS 201.25 for packages of product.\n\nCan a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n\nYes. A manufacturer or repackager may voluntarily put the 2D data matrix barcode on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container, if the product remains compliant with all other labeling requirements, including the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.\n\nExamples of When the Product Identifier Is Required Under the DSCSA and the Linear Barcode Is Required Under SS 201.25\n\nFor each of their products, manufacturers and repackagers are responsible for determining the smallest individual saleable unit that they intend for ultimate sale to a dispenser. Under the DSCSA, both a 2D data matrix barcode and the human-readable portion of the product identifier are required to be affixed or imprinted on each such individual saleable unit. While other levels of product packaging may exist that do not require a 2D data matrix barcode, as noted in Question and Answer #19, manufacturers and repackagers may voluntarily affix or imprint a 2D data matrix barcode if the product remains compliant with all other labeling requirements, including the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.\n\nThe following table provides examples of different units of a package or case and what barcode would be required under the DSCSA and under SS 201.25. It is not an exhaustive list because the information required will depend on the specific details of particular product packaging.\n--------------------\nContext title: Product Identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: IV SCOPE OF GUIDANCE\n\nThis guidance is intended to help manufacturers and repackagers understand and satisfy the requirements of section 582(b)(2) and (e)(2) of the FD&C Act, respectively, to affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product that they intend to introduce in a transaction into commerce. The recommendations in this guidance are intended to assist manufacturers and repackagers in developing standardized formats for the human- and machine-readable information that is contained in the product identifier. The requirements set forth in the DSCSA do not change the linear barcode requirements under 21 CFR 201.25.\n\nV Product Identifiers under the DSCSA\n\nAs noted in Section II of this guidance, a product identifier is defined under section 581(14) of the FD&C Act as a standardized graphic that includes the product\'s standardized numerical identifier (composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number), lot number, and expiration date, in both human- and machine-readable formats. The machine-readable format must be on a data carrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization.10 The product identifier data is specifically required under section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act to be in a ""2-dimensional data matrix barcode"" for packages and in a ""linear or 2-dimensional data matrix barcode"" for homogenous cases, which can be verified using ""human-readable or machine-readable methods.""11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 581(14) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act. As described in section 582(a)(9)(A), FDA may decide in the future to allow the use of other technologies for data instead of, or in addition to, the 2-dimensional data matrix barcode or linear barcode.\n\nUnder section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act, manufacturers are required to ""affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce"" beginning no later than November 27, 2017. Under section 582(e)(2) of the FD&C Act, repackagers are required to ""affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction in commerce"" beginning no later than November 27, 2018. Therefore, each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce must include the NDC, unique serial number, lot number, and expiration date in both human- and machine-readable formats.\n\nVI Compliance Policy for Product Identifier Requirements\n\nIn the guidance titled ""Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Compliance Policy,"" FDA stated that it did not intend to take enforcement action against manufacturers who did not, prior to November 27, 2018, affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction intocommerce as required by section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.12 As the time frame described in this compliance policy has since ended, it no longer represents the Agency\'s thinking in terms of enforcement policy.\n\nFootnote 12: See guidance for industry Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy (September 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance web page at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nVII Products that are subject to the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA\n\nThe product identifier requirements of section 582(b)(2)(A) and (e)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act apply to packages and homogenous cases of product intended to be introduced into commerce via a transaction.13 A ""product"" under section 581(13) of the FD&C Act is a ""prescription drug in finished dosage form for administration to a patient without substantial further manufacturing.""\n\nFootnote 13: There are exemptions to the definition of “transaction” (see section 581(24)(B) of the FD&C Act).\n\nThe following prescription drug products are excluded from the definition of a ""product"" under the DSCSA, and thus are not subject to the product identifier requirements:14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 581(13) of the FD&C Act, defining “product.”\n\nblood or blood components intended for transfusion\n\ncertain radioactive drugs or radioactive biological products15\n\nimaging drugs\n\ncertain intravenous products16\n\nFootnote 15: Radioactive drugs and radioactive biological products excepted from the definition of “product” under the DSCSA are defined in 21 CFR 600.3(ee) and regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or by a state, pursuant to an agreement with such Commission under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2021).\n\nhave noted that the following rule is not applicable to the FD&C Act.\n\nhave noted that the following rule is not applicable to the FD&C Act.\n\ndrug compounds compounded in compliance with sections 503A or 503B of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353a or 353b).\n\nVIII Linear Barcode Requirements Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nConsidering the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA, manufacturers and repackagers have asked FDA whether some of their products are still required under 21 CFR 201.25 to include a linear barcode. The linear barcode requirements were established for different purposes than the DSCSA requirements and apply to additional FDA-regulated products and packaging in some instances, and are still in effect. In the Federal Register of February 26, 2004 (69 FR 9120), FDA published a final rule requiring certain human drug and biological product labels to have a linear barcode that contains, at a minimum, the drug\'s NDC number (SS 201.25).18 Manufacturers, repackers (also known as ""repackagers""), relabelers, and private label distributors of human prescription drug products, biological products, and over-the-counter (OTC) drug products dispensed pursuant to an order and commonly used in hospitals, are subject to the linear barcode requirement. The linear barcode must appear on the drug\'s label as defined by section 201(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(k)). FDA has interpreted that requirement to mean the linear barcode should be on the outside container or wrapper, as well as on the immediate container unless the barcode is readily visible and machine-readable through the outside container or wrapper.19\n\nFootnote 18: See 69 FR 9120 at 9140 (Feb. 26, 2004), https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2004-02-26/pdf/04-4249.pdf.\n\nAs stated in the preamble to the final rule:\n\nBar codes can help reduce or detect potential medication errors by enabling health care professionals to check whether they are giving the right drug via the right dose and right route of administration to the right patient at the right time.20\n\nFootnote 20: Id. at 9120.\n\nThe preamble contemplated that linear barcodes, the use of scanning equipment, and computerized databases would be part of a system that could help reduce the number of medication errors that occur in hospitals and other health care settings.21\n\nFootnote 21: Id. at 9120.\n\nManufacturers, repackers, relabelers, and private label distributors of drug products who are subject to the establishment registration and drug listing requirements in section 510 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360) are responsible for placing the appropriate barcode on the product.22 The following prescription drug products, however, are exempted under SS 201.25 from the linear barcode requirements:\n\nFootnote 22: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products. Private label distributors who do not also manufacture, repack, relabel, or salvage drugs are not required to register under part 207.\n\nFootnote 23: For the purposes of the linear barcode requirements, radiopharmaceuticals are considered “radioactive drugs” or “radioactive biological products”, as defined in 21 CFR 310.3(n) and 21 CFR 600.3(ce), respectively.\n\nFootnote 24: § 201.25(b)(1)(ii).\n\nprescription drug samples\n\nallergenic extracts\n\nintrauterine contraceptive devices regulated as drugs\n\nmedical gases\n\nradiopharmaceuticals23\n\nlow-density polyethylene form fill and seal containers that are not packaged with an overwrap.\n\nFootnote 23: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products. Private label distributors who do not also manufacture, repack, relabel, or salvage drugs are not required to register under part 207.\n\nIn addition, the linear bar code requirement does not apply to prescription drugs that are sold by a manufacturer, repacker, relabeler, or private label distributor directly to patients, unless versions of that same drug are also sold to or used in hospitals.24\n\nIX Questions and Answers\n\nAgency Contacts\n\nWho should be contacted for questions related to barcode requirements for drug packages and homogenous cases under the DSCSA?\n\nFor CDER-regulated products, inquiries should be emailed to:\n\nCDER BarcodeQuestions(@fda.hhs.gov.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 35: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 36: Dispenser is defined in section 581(3) of the FD&C Act.\n\nTherefore, manufacturers and repackagers must determine the smallest individual saleable unit product configuration that they intend to be sold to the dispenser, and affix or imprint a product identifier (included in a 2-dimensional data matrix barcode) to that package.\n\nTo determine what constitutes a package, manufacturers and repackagers should consider how their packages of product may be opened and separated by wholesale distributors, who may sell smaller individual units of product that were inside the larger package to a dispenser for ultimate dispensing or administration to a patient. For example, although a carton of 10 individual product units may be sold to a dispenser, manufacturers and repackagers may want to apply a product identifier to each of the 10 product units in the carton if it is reasonably foreseeable that a wholesale distributor might sell individual product units to a dispenser. See Section IX.E of this guidance for examples of potential individual saleable units and a discussion of the applicable barcode requirements. Also, see Section IX.C for additional regulatory requirements that may apply when determining whether to affix or imprint a product identifier to a product unit.\n\nDo manufacturer and repackager activities related to affixing or imprinting the product identifier need to comply with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP)?\n\nYes, the CGMP requirements under 21 CFR parts 210 and 211 apply to the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of a drug product, including packaging and labeling operations, testing, and quality control of drugs.\n\nCan manufacturers and repackagers request a waiver, exemption, or exception from the DSCSA requirement to include a product identifier?\n\nYes. FDA has authority under section 582(a)(3) of the FD&C Act to grant a waiver, exception, or exemption for products and transactions from certain requirements in section 582. Manufacturers and repackagers should use the processes set forth in FDA\'s draft guidance for industry Waivers, Exceptions, and Exemptions from the Requirements of Section 582 of the _Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to make a request.37 This guidance also describes what information should be included with the request.\n\nFootnote 37: Draft guidance for industry Waivers, Exceptions, and Exemptions from the Requirements of Section 582 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (May 2018). When finalized, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nDo the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA apply to prescription drugs marketed without FDA approval?\n\nYes. The DSCSA establishes requirements for ""products,"" which as defined under section 581(13) of the FD&C Act are generally prescription drugs in a finished dosage form for administration to patients without substantial further manufacturing. ""Prescription drugs"" in the DSCSA refer to drugs for human use,38 which meet the requirements of section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)), independent of approval status.\n\nFootnote 38: See section 581(12) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFor prescription drugs that are marketed without FDA approval, is the manufacturer required to submit the product identifier as part of its product labeling during registration and listing?\n\nYes. FDA interprets the definition of ""labeling"" in section 201(m) of the FD&C Act to include the product identifier. Accordingly, as part of registration and listing under 21 CFR part 207, a manufacturer of any prescription drug for commercial distribution39 must submit a copy of all current labeling as specified under SS 207.49(a)(15)(i), independent of approval status.\n\nFootnote 39: Commercial distribution is defined in 21 CFR 207.1.\n\nSubmission of Label Changes Under the DSCSA\n\nHow should manufacturers or repackagers submit a package label change to FDA that is solely for incorporating the product identifier of an already approved prescription drug?40\n\nFootnote 40: For purposes of this guidance, the term drug includes biological drug products that are licensed by CDER and CBER.\n\nApplicants who submit annual reports should be aware of product identifier changes made by manufacturers and repackagers in the supply chain. Under section 582(a)(8) of the FD&C Act, a change made to the drug package label solely to incorporate the product identifier may be submitted in an applicant\'s annual report41 in accordance with 21 CFR 314.70(d). Under SS 314.70(d), the applicant must document certain changes in the next annual report in accordance with SS 314.81(b)(2).42 Under SS 314.81(b)(2)(i), the annual report must contain a brief summary of significant new information from the previous year that might affect the safety, effectiveness, or labeling of the drug product.\n\nFootnote 41: For purposes of this guidance, the term establishment, as used in section 582(a)(8) of the FD&C Act, refers to the applicant.\n\nA table of contents may be included in the annual report which indicates the inclusion of the labeling change for incorporating the product identifier on products.\n\nIn certain instances, it may be appropriate to submit a labeling change in a Prior Approval Supplement (PAS) or in a Changes Being Effected supplement instead of in an annual report.43\n\nFootnote 43: For further information, consult the guidance for industry Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA (April 2004).\n\nIs a manufacturer or repackager required to submit to FDA information encoded in the product identifier for each package and homogenous case of product?\n\nIn general, the information encoded in each product identifier for packages and homogenous cases is not required to be submitted to FDA. However, FDA may request information from a manufacturer or repackager in the event of a recall or to investigate a suspect or illegitimate product. In this circumstance, the manufacturer or repackager must provide the applicable transaction information,44 which includes the NDC number and lot number, as well as the transaction history and transaction statement for the product.45\n\nFootnote 44: See section 582(b)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act for manufacturer requirement; section 582(e)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act for repackager requirement.\n\nAlso, FDA may request information from a manufacturer or repackager to verify a product identifier if FDA has made the determination that a suspect product is in the possession or control of such manufacturer or repackager. In this circumstance, the manufacturer or repackager must provide relevant information46 in response that FDA can use to determine whether the product identifier affixed to or imprinted on a package or homogenous case corresponds to the standardized numerical identifier47 or lot number and expiration date assigned to the product by the manufacturer or repackager.\n\nFootnote 45: Transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statement are defined in section 581(26), (25), and (27) of the FD&C Act, respectively.\n\nFootnote 46: See section 582(b)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act for manufacturer requirement; section 582(e)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act for repackager requirement.\n\nCan a manufacturer submit a placeholder when submitting initial or updated product labeling as part of an application or supplemental application (i.e., New Drug Application [NDA], Abbreviated New Drug Application [ANDA], or Biologics License Application [BLA]) to reflect its commitment to affix or imprint the product identifier on its product?\n\nYes. CDER and CBER will accept the submission of a drug product label that contains a placeholder when submitting initial or updated product labeling as part of an application or supplemental application (i.e., NDA, ANDA, or BLA) in lieu of an image of the final product identifier that the manufacturer intends to use at the time of drug manufacturing. The placeholder should be represented on the initial or updated product labeling submission as a blank space with labels to sufficiently describe what information will be placed in that space at the time the product is manufactured (e.g., ""lot number"" and ""expiration date"") (see Question and Answer #4 above for examples of how to label each element of information).\n\nThe Product Identifier Requirement of the DSCSA and the Linear Barcode Requirement Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nIs my product package required to have both a linear barcode and a 2D data matrix barcode?\n\nIt depends. There will be instances when a product package is required to have both a linear barcode, pursuant to SS 201.25, and a 2D data matrix barcode, pursuant to the DSCSA. For a product for which a manufacturer, under the DSCSA, has identified the smallest individual saleable unit intended for ultimate sale to a dispenser--which is a ""package"" under FD&C Act section 581(11)--the package would generally require a 2D data matrix barcode to comply with the DSCSA48 in addition to the requisite linear barcode under SS 201.25. See Section E of this guidance for examples of when a 2D data matrix barcode may not be required.\n\nFootnote 48: See FD&C Act sections 582(b)(2)(A) and 582(a)(9).\n\nWith the enactment of the DSCSA, is the guidance for industry ""Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers"" (August 2011) still applicable for the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25?\n\nYes. The guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers remains applicable to the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25 unless or until such time the guidance is revised, replaced, or withdrawn. This guidance should be consulted for questions specific to the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.49\n\nFootnote 49: See guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers (August 2011), available at https://www.fda.gov/files/vaccines%2C%20blood%20%26%20biologies/published/Guidance-for-Industry–Bar-Code-Label-Requirements.pdf).\n--------------------\nContext title: Product Identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 10: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(d)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 12: For this guidance, (tradangpartner) is defined as described in section 581(23)(A) of the FD&C Act. Although third-party logistics providers are also considered trading partners under section 581(23)(B) of the FD&C Act, they are not subject to the same product tracing requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nThe Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public Law 113-54) was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier, authorized trading partner, and verification requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers, and dispensersto facilitate the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act is prohibited under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nOne requirement of the verification scheme outlined in the DSCSA is the verification of saleable returned product. Under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act, wholesale distributors must have systems in place that will enable them to verify the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, on each sealed homogeneous case of saleable returned product, or, if such product is not in a sealed homogeneous case, on each package of saleable returned product. A saleable returned product may not be further distributed until the product identifier is verified.13 The product should be handled as suspect product if the product identifier is not successfully verified (i.e., it should be quarantined and investigated).14. 15 FDA published the 2019 Compliance Policy on September 24, 2019, announcing a 1-year delay in enforcement against wholesale distributors who do not verify the product identifier of saleable returned product prior to further distributing such product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 14: See Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs (October 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIn addition, section 582 of the FD&C Act requires certain trading partners (manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers) to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and a transaction statement when engaging in transactions involving certain prescription drugs.16({}^{,})17 A transaction statement must include a statement that the entity transferring ownership in a transaction had systems and processes in place to comply with verification requirements under section 582 of the FD&C Act.18 In the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA acknowledged that wholesale distributors may not have systems in place by November 27, 2019, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, the 2019 Compliance Policy indicated FDA\'s intent to take no enforcement action prior to November 27, 2020, against a wholesale distributor that provided a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor did not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(c)(4)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act details how wholesale distributors must handle suspect product.\n\nFootnote 17: Transaction, transaction history, transaction information, and transaction statement are defined under sections 581(24), (25), (26), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582 also includes requirements for dispensers to verify product identifiers when investigating suspect or illegitimate product. Specifically, section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act provides that, effective November 27, 2020, dispensers must verify ""the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, of at least 3 packages or 10 percent of such suspect product, whichever is greater, or all packages, if there are fewer than 3, corresponds with the product identifier for such product [in the dispenser\'s possession or control]"".19 Section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act requires dispensers to verify product as described in 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act when they have received a notification of illegitimate product from FDA or a trading partner.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIII Compliance Policy for Wholesale Distributor Verification of Saleable Returned Product\n\nAfter publishing the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA has received comments and feedback from wholesale distributors, as well as other trading partners and stakeholders, expressing additional concern with industry-wide readiness for implementation of the verification of saleable returned product requirement for wholesale distributors. Stakeholders have explained that the primary factors FDA considered when issuing the 2019 Compliance Policy still exist: (1) the very large volume of saleable returned products requiring verification; (2) the need to refine and test verification systems during actual production using real-time volumes of saleable returned product rather than simply in pilots; and (3) the complexities of building an interoperable, electronic system with the capabilities to timely and efficiently verify the large volume of saleable returned products amid immature technologies.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some wholesale distributors may still need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, when the delay in enforcement set forth in the 2019 Compliance Policy expires, before they can begin verifying returned products prior to resale or other further distribution as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act in an efficient, secure, and timely manner. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against wholesale distributors who do not verify a product identifier prior to resale or other further distribution of a package or sealed homogenous case of product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAdditionally, FDA recognizes that wholesale distributors may still not have systems in place by November 27, 2020, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, prior to November 27, 2023, FDA does not intend to take action against a wholesale distributor for providing a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor does not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.20\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPolicy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (September 2018), addresses such returns.28_\n\nFootnote 28: For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page.\n\nIV Compliance Policy for the Dispenser Verification Requirements\n\nIn the years since the passage of the DSCSA, FDA has received comments and feedback from dispensers expressing concern with readiness for implementation of certain requirements under section 582(d) of the FD&C Act, including the verification requirements addressed in this compliance policy. Specifically, dispensers have described challenges with implementation of these provisions in the DSCSA due to the time necessary to develop technologies and processes that would support a robust verification system.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some dispensers may need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, before they can begin to verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect and illegitimate products as described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect product as required by section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act. In addition, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify, as required by section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act, the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of product that is the subject of an illegitimate product notification by FDA or a trading partner.\n--------------------\nContext title: Wholesale Distributor Verification Requirement for Saleable Returned Drug Product and Dispenser Verification Requirements When Investigating a Suspect or Illegitimate Product—Compliance Policies'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: This guidance does not address how to link a repackager SNI to a manufacturer SNI, nor does it address standards for prescription drug SNI at levels other than the package-level including, for example, the case- and pallet-levels. Standards for track and trace, authentication, and validation are also not addressed in this guidance because this guidance only addresses the standardized numerical identifier itself and not implementation or application issues.\n\nIII Standardized Numerical Identifiers\n\nWhat should be a package-level SNI for most prescription drugs?\n\nThe SNI for most prescription drug packages should be a serialized National Drug Code (sNDC). The sNDC is composed of the National Drug Code (NDC) (as set forth in 21 CFR Part 207) that corresponds to the specific drug product (including the particular package configuration)4 combined with a unique serial number, generated by the manufacturer or repackager for each individual package. Serial numbers should be numeric (numbers) or alphanumeric (include letters and/or numbers) and should have no more than 20 characters (letters and/or numbers). An example is shown below with a 10-character NDC.\n\nFootnote 4: In the case of repackaged drugs, each package type should have an NDC that corresponds to the repacker or private label distributor for whom the drug is repacked and to the new package configuration.\n\nWhat should be the package-level SNI for certain biological products that do not use NDC numbers?\n\nSome prescription drugs approved under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, such as blood and blood components and certain minimally manipulated human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), do not currently use NDC numbers. Examples of HCT/Ps that do not use NDC numbers include allogeneic placental/umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood progenitor cells, and donor lymphocytes for infusion. Instead, such productscurrently use other recognized standards for identification and labeling, such as ISBT 128, which creates a unique identification number for each product package. See\n\nhttp://iccbba.org/about gettoknowisbt128.html, ""Guidance for Industry: Recognition and Use of a Standard for Uniform Blood and Blood Component Container Labels,""\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/BiopicicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Blood/ucm073362.htm.) The SNI for these products should be the unique identification number created for each package under these other recognized standards, such as ISBT 128.5\n\nFootnote 5: FDA currently also recognizes Codabar as a standard for blood and blood component container labels. We note that ISBT 128 is becoming the more widely-used industry standard.\n\nDoes the SNI include expiration date and/or lot or batch number?\n\nExpiration date and/or lot or batch numbers are not part of the recommended SNI. Expiration date and/or lot or batch numbers are already accessible because FDA regulations require the inclusion of this information on the label of each drug product. (See 21 CFR SSS 201.17, 201.18, 211.130, 211.137, 610.60, and 610.61.) In addition, the SNI can be linked to databases containing this and other information. Addition of this information within the SNI will unnecessarily increase the length of, and introduce complexity into, the SNI. However, if a manufacturer or repackager chooses to include expiration date and/or lot or batch number with the SNI, it should ensure that the resulting number still permits users to distinguish and make use of the SNI. For example, expiration date and lot or batch number may be incorporated in accordance with the GS1 standards for use of Global Trade Item Numbers (GTIN)6 (discussed below in Section F).\n\nWhy did FDA select the serialized NDC for package-level SNI for most prescription drugs?\n\nFDA chose the sNDC as the package-level SNI for most prescription drugs because we believe that it serves the needs of the drug supply chain as a means of identifying individual prescription drug packages,7 which in turn should facilitate authentication and tracking and tracing of those drugs. Most prescription drug product packages already have an NDC on them. By combining a serial number of up to 20 characters with the NDC, the sNDC should be sufficiently robust to support billions of units of marketed products without duplication of an SNI. This approach will allow manufacturers and repackagers to assign serial numbers to combine with the NDC for unique identification of individual product packages. The SNI can also be linked to databases containing such product attributes as lot or batch number, expiration date, distribution/transaction history information, and other identifiers related to a product. As already noted, defining the SNI is expected to be a first step to facilitate the development of other standards and systems for securing the drug supply chain. Many aspects of the implementation of package-level identification will take shape in the future, as the standards that make use of SNI are developed.\n\nFootnote 7: As described above, ISBT-128 and Codabar serve the same function for certain biologics that lack NDCs.\n\nShould the SNI be in human- and machine-readable forms?\n\nFDA believes that an SNI generally should be applied to each package in both human-readable and machine-readable forms. However, at this time, FDA is not specifying the means of incorporating the SNI onto the package. The SNIs described in this guidance are compatible with, and flexible for, encoding into a variety of machine-readable forms of data carriers, such as2-dimensional bar codes and radio-frequency identification (RFID),8 leaving options open as technologies for securing the supply chain continue to be identified, and standards making use of SNI are developed. A redundant human-readable SNI on the package would provide the ability to identify the package when electronic means are unavailable (e.g., in the event of hardware/software failure). Due to the wide-variety of packaging required to accommodate different products and product integrity needs, FDA also is not specifying a location on the package where an SNI should be placed. If the NDC is already printed on the package in human-readable form, then the serial number could be printed in human-readable form in a non-contiguous manner elsewhere on the product package. Any SNI placed on the package must not obstruct FDA-required labeling information9 and should be placed in a manner that allows it to be readily scanned/viewed without damaging the integrity of the packaging or product..\n\nFootnote 8: FDA’s enforcement policy with respect to the application of current good manufacturing practices to RFID technology is provided in Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Section 400.210. See http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074357.htm. This CPG would apply if an SNI were embedded into an RFID tag.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 502(c) of the Act.\n\nF. Is the SNI that FDA is recommending compatible with international standards? In addition to facilitating other actions to secure the drug supply chain, adoption of the sNDC as the SNI for most prescription drugs, and of other recognized standards, such as ISBT 128, for certain biological products, satisfies the requirement in 505D(b)(2) that the SNI developed by FDA be harmonized, to the extent practicable, with internationally recognized standards for such an identifier. Specifically, use of an sNDC is compatible with, and may be presented within, a GTIN, which can be serialized using an Application Identifier (AI) [(21)] to create a serialized GTIN (sGTIN) for use with RFID or for certain barcodes.10 GTIN is a global standard for item and object identification, established by GS1, a consensus-based, not-for-profit, international\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]\n--------------------\nContext title: Standards for Securing the Drug Supply Chain - Standardized Numerical Identification for Prescription Drug Packages Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: Repackages or otherwise changes the container, wrapper, or labeling of a device in furtherance of the distribution of the device from the original place of manufacture;\n\nInitiates specifications for devices manufactured by a second party for subsequent distribution by the person initiating the specifications; or\n\nManufactures components or accessories that are medical devices and that are (1) ready to be used and are intended to be commercially distributed and intended to be used as is, or (2) processed by a licensed practitioner or other qualified person to meet the needs of a particular patient.\n\nAll manufacturers of legally marketed medical devices in the US, including foreign manufacturers who export devices to the US, are subject to the MDR regulation and must submit required reports. US manufacturers of medical devices that are not cleared or approved in the US, but are exported to foreign locations, are also subject to the MDR regulation. Failure to submit required reports is a prohibited act [section 301(q) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(q)] (however, see Section 4.11.1 of this guidance for the circumstances under which FDA generally does not intend to enforce MDR reporting requirements for those devices exported under sections 801(e) or 802 of the FD&C Act).\n\nAny person who reprocesses a single use device for reuse in human beings becomes the manufacturer of the device and is subject to all the requirements applicable to the original manufacturer, including the requirements of the MDR regulation [69 FR 7490].\n\nWhen do I ""become aware"" that an MDR reportable event has occurred?\n\nAs a manufacturer, you are considered to have ""become aware"" of an event whenever [21 CFR 803.3]:\n\nAny of your employees becomes aware of information that reasonably suggests that an event is required to be reported in a 30-day report or in a 5-day report that we have requested from you; or\n\nAny of your employees with management or supervisory responsibilities over persons with regulatory, scientific or technical responsibilities (including consultants or contractors) or whose duties relate to the collection and reporting of adverse events, becomes aware from any information (including any trend analysis) that an MDR reportable event(s) necessitates remedial action to prevent an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health. In this case, you must submit a report no later than 5 work days after the day that you become aware.\n\nYour MDR procedures should identify the roles and responsibilities of contractors or consultants that work for you or on your behalf to review and process complaints.\n\nPlease note: The Quality System (QS) regulation requires you to have a formally designated unit to receive, review and evaluate complaints [21 CFR 820.198(a)]. Manufacturers who are subject to the QS regulation should ask all of their employees to forward device-related complaints to that unit in a timely manner (see also sections 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 3.1 of this guidance). Complaints should be evaluated in order to determine if they represent a reportable event in accordance with 21 CFR 803.3(o).\n\nWhat is ""information that reasonably suggests"" that an MDR reportable event has occurred?\n\nThis means any information, including professional, scientific, or medical facts, observations, or opinions that would cause you to come to a reasonable conclusion that a device has caused or may have caused or contributed to an MDR reportable event [21 CFR 803.20(c)]. For guidance on when an adverse event does not have to be reported to us, see section 2.16 of this guidance.\nThis means that a death or serious injury was or may have been attributed to a medical device or that a medical device was or may have been a factor in a death or serious injury, including events occurring as a result of [21 CFR 803.3]:\n\nFailure;\n\nMalfunction;\n\nImproper or inadequate design;\n\nManufacture;\n\nLabeling; or\n\nUser error.\n\nWhat is device ""user error"" and why do you want to know about events involving user error?\n\nWe consider a device ""user error"" (or ""use error"") to mean a device-related error or mistake made by the person using the device. The error could be the sole cause of an MDR reportable event, or merely a contributing factor. Such errors often reflect problems with device labeling, the user interface, or other aspects of device design. Thus, FDA believes that these events should be reported in the same way as other adverse events which are caused or contributed to by the device. This is especially important for devices used in non-health care facility settings. If you determine that an event is solely the result of user error with no other performance issue, and there has been no device-related death or serious injury, you are not required to submit an MDR report, but you should retain the supporting information in your complaint files.\n\nWhat form must I use to submit an MDR reportable event?\n\nYour submission must use an electronic equivalent of Form 3500A which is approved by FDA [21 CFR 803.11 and 803.14]. We have identified mandatory adverse event and reportable malfunction event reports as types of documents that must be submitted electronically.4 You must submit reports of individual adverse events to FDA in an electronic format in accordance with [21 CFR 803.12(a)] and [21 CFR 803.20], unless granted an exemption under [21 CFR 803.19]. (See also section 2.31 of this guidance for information about the electronic submission of MDR events).\n\nFootnote 4: The CDRH May 8, 2008 notification is posted on the Part 11 Docket at FDA-1992-S-0039-0054.\n\nWhat information must be included in my report?\n\nYour report must contain all the information required by 21 CFR 803.52 that is known, or reasonably known to you. Information we consider reasonably known to you includes any information [21 CFR 803.50(b)]:\n\nThat you can obtain by contacting a user facility, importer, or other initial reporter;That is in your possession; or\n\nThat you can obtain by analysis, testing or other evaluation of the device.\n\nInstructions for completing the Form 3500A, and information regarding codes to be used for specific sections of the form may be accessed via the following links:\n\nInstructions for completing Form 3500A:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/DownloadForms/UCM\n\n387002.pdf.\n\nInformation on the current Event Problem Code Hierarchy:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/PostmarketRequire\n\nments/ReportingAdverseEvents/EventProblemCodes/ucm134751.htm.\n\nInstructions for electronic reporting: electronic Medical Device Reporting (eMDR) -\n\nHome Page\n\n2.9 Can I include multiple devices in the same report?\n\nAlthough a user facility may submit one report for an adverse event that involves multiple suspect devices, a manufacturer should submit a separate report for each device involved in the MDR reportable event.5 For example, if you receive a report from a user facility which indicates that more than one of your devices may have contributed to one MDR reportable event, and you cannot determine which device actually caused or contributed to the event or which device malfunctioned, you should submit a separate report for each device potentially involved in the event.\n\nFootnote 5: See http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/DownloadForms/UCM387002.pdf.\n\n2.10 What do you consider to be a device-related complaint and do I have to evaluate the complaint?\n\nFor the purposes of this guidance document, we recommend that you use the definition of a complaint found in the QS regulation, which defines a complaint as:\n\n[A]ny written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of a device after it is released for distribution [21 CFR 820.3(b)].\n\nYou are required to review and evaluate all device-related complaints to determine whether the complaint represents an MDR reportable event [21 CFR 803.18(e) and 820.198].\nYou may receive complaint information from many different sources, including telephone calls or other verbal communication, FAX transmissions, written correspondence, e-mail notification, sales representative reports, service representative reports, scientific articles (literature), internal analyses, and legal documents. You may receive reports directly from user facilities, importers, or voluntary reporters. We may also send you a communication, such as a copy of a user facility or voluntary report.\n\nFDA believes that manufacturers have a responsibility to inform all employees, including marketing, sales, engineering, manufacturing, regulatory, legal, installation, and service personnel, to immediately forward adverse event information to the appropriate person appointed by those entities to submit MDR reports. Thus, FDA generally considers that a manufacturer becomes aware of an adverse event whenever any employee becomes aware of an adverse event (see section 2.20 of this guidance for the specific employees FDA expects to be able to recognize that an adverse event requiring ""remedial action"" to prevent a risk of substantial harm to the public has occurred). Employees should be trained to properly identify, collect, and report complaints to your formally designated complaint handling unit [see 21 CFR 820.198(a) for requirements related to complaint files].\n\nUser facilities and importers have specific mandatory reporting requirements [e.g., 21 CFR 803.10, 803.11, 803.20, 803.30, and 803.40]. If a user facility notifies you of a death or serious injury and has not submitted a completed Form 3500A, we suggest that you remind the user facility of their obligation to do so within 10 work days after the day that it becomes aware of a reportable event. If the report involves a death, the user facility must also send the report to us.\n--------------------\nContext title: Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff']","['Yes.

For additional information on 45 CFR Part 46\n\nsubpart A refer to the Office for Human Research Protections at\n\nhttp://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.htm.\nYes, in many cases an investigational IVD study is eligible for IRB expedited review (see 21 CFR 56.110), for both initial approval and continuing review. The categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure are described in the Federal Register notice on expedited review, found at http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/Guida ncesInformationSheetsandNotices/ucm118099.htm. As stated in a Federal Register notice, however, sponsors and investigators may not use the expedited review procedure where identification of the subjects and/or their responses would reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects\' financial standing, employability, insurability, reputation, or be stigmatizing, unless reasonable and appropriate protections will be implemented so that risks related to invasion of privacy and breach of confidentiality are no greater than minimal. (63 FR 60353, November 9, 1998).\n\n6. Can leftover specimens be used in IVD studies without informed consent?\n\nThe document entitled, ""Guidance for Industry, Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Food and Drug Administration: Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies using Leftover Human Specimens that are not Individually Identifiable,"" http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo currents/ucm078384.htm, describes the limited circumstances in which FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion regarding requirements for informed consent. (See Glossary for definition of ""leftover specimens"".)\n\n7. Can those who routinely conduct studies with IVDs (e.g., research hospitals) use a general informed consent to address future studies using samples collected in their own facility?\n\nTo fulfill FDA informed consent requirements for studies of IVDs, a site may develop an informed consent process to address the use of samples collected at the facility (see the Glossary for definition) in a specific study or for a broader category of future studies. This general informed consent process may be used for subjects seen at and/or admitted to a specific facility. The informed consent document must contain all of the required elements found in 21 CFR 50.25.\n\n8. Can a human specimen that was initially collected in a study with the informed consent of the subject be used in a later study without a new consent process?\n\nIf the original informed consent document contains a statement that excess specimen(s) will be stored for future use in specified types of studies and the new study meets the criteria stated in that consent document, it is possible that no further consent is necessary. This assumes that the original informed consent document contains all of the other essential elements, including notice to the subject that FDA may review their files and an explanation of the purposes and benefits of the research. (See 21 CFR 50.25.) We recommend sponsors and investigators consult with the IRB regarding the need for a new informed consent process in such a case. The IRB decision should include consideration of any state and/or local requirements regarding informed consent and patient rights. If new testing could expose the subject to previously unanticipated risks (e.g., privacy concerns for the subject and/or his family related to testing for a genetic marker), a new consent may be needed. In addition, if the original informed consent did not address future research use at all, or did not cover the type of study now under consideration, it is likely a new consent will be needed.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, for human specimens leftover from specimens originally collected for a previous study, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion regarding informed consent requirements. See ""Guidance for Industry, Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Food and Drug Administration: Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies using Leftover Human Specimens that are not Individually Identifiable,"" http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo\n\ncuments/ucm078384.htm.\n\nVI. Data Considerations\n\n1. What information should the protocol include to ensure that the investigational IVD study will be scientifically sound?\n\nWe recommend that the protocol include a clear description of study design; objectives, estimation of performance goals (e.g., desired confidence interval widths) that are directly related to the intended claims for the IVD device, or hypotheses; and a statistical plan to be applied to the data. (See the Glossary for definitions of protocol, statistical hypothesis, and confidence interval.)\n\n2. Is it acceptable to develop new or to revise existing study hypotheses as the study progresses?\n\nWe generally believe it would be inappropriate to draw conclusions from after-the-fact hypotheses. We recommend that changes in study protocols be carefully documented and explained. FDA encourages sponsors to contact the appropriate review division to discuss studies before they are initiated and to consult FDA before changes in protocols are made mid-study. (For the FDA divisions responsible for review of IVD products, see Introduction, Section II, of this guidance.)\n\n3. How should I determine appropriate sample size for a study?\n\nThe sponsor should formulate sample size based on standard statistical techniques and the sample size should account for any unique issues related to intended use(s), device technologies, and/or the biology of the condition being studied.\n\nWhat guidance is available for sponsors to determine how to estimate IVD performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity, how to handle discrepant results, and what to do when a study is performed without a truth standard (""gold standard"") (see the Glossary for definitions)?\n\nFDA has recognized a number of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [(CLSI), formerly National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS)] standards related to these issues. A list of these standards, but not the standards themselves, can be found through the database on the CDRH web page http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scrlpts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards\n\nThe agency\'s guidance entitled ""Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests"" can be viewed at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo currents/ucm071148.htm\n\nHow much leeway is there in deciding on the populations from which human specimens are collected and under what conditions are data on simulated specimens (see the Glossary for definition) acceptable?\n\nStudies should be performed in a representative sample of the intended use population (i.e., representation of both diseased and non-diseased cases, and controlling for subject demographics and morbidity factors that may affect the level of device performance). When a disease is rare or samples are needed specifically to challenge cut-off points, sponsors may use enriched samples, panels of credentialed samples (e.g., Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) panels), and/or spiked or contrived samples. The acceptance of simulated specimens depends on how well they represent specimens from the intended-use population and whether their performance accurately reflects what the IVD device user can expect.\n\nIs it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., ""outliers"")?\n\nAn outlier, an observation that lies an unexpected distance from other values, does not in itself prove that an error or violation has occurred. Therefore, the primary data analysis should include all such observations, including ""outliers"". A sponsor may perform some specific supplemental analyses on subsets of the data, if clinically and scientifically justified, that may exclude outlying data points. Excluding large amounts of data, regardless of the reasons for exclusion, will seriously bias the results.\n\nCan I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?In most studies the sponsor should avoid multiple testings of the same subject because it may skew performance statistics and under-estimate standard deviations. When multiple testing is done, the sponsor should explain why it is necessary and choose methods of statistical analysis that allow adjustment for within-subject correlation. It is appropriate to conduct repeated testing of the same sample to evaluate test reproducibility - i.e., the ability of the test to yield the same or similar readings when expected.\n\n8. How much precision (see the Glossary for definition) is needed for measurement data, e.g., in terms of decimal places?\n\nStudy data should contain no more decimal places than the precision of the instrument allows, i.e., if the instrument is only precise to the second decimal place the sponsor should not analyze the data using three decimal places.\n\n9. What records should help to ensure scientific soundness of an IVD investigational study?\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: The requirement in section 505(i) of the FD&C Act for informed consent for investigational use of drugs (including biologics) provided that FDA regulations must ensure informed consent is obtained ""except where it is not feasible or it is contrary to the best interest of such human beings."" In order to promote consistency across medical products, FDA adopted regulations reflecting the device standard for all medical product research.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s regulations governing the protection of human subjects conform to the requirements in the ""Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects"" (the Common Rule), with a few exceptions because of differences in FDA\'s mission or statutory authority. The Common Rule, originally promulgated in 19913, sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (see 45 CFR 46, Subpart A) and 15 other Federal departments and agencies. The purpose of the Common Rule is to promote uniformity, understanding, and compliance with human subject protections as well as to create a uniform body of regulations across the Federal departments and agencies.4 FDA regulations and the Common Rule share the same definition for ""minimal risk,"" but the Common Rule allows a waiver of informed consent for minimal risk research if specific criteria are met. As stated above, FDA\'s regulations currently do not include an exception from informed consent for minimal risk clinical investigations.5\n\nFootnote 4: 80 FR 53931 at 53935, September 8, 2015.\n\nFootnote 5: Note that this exception from the requirement to obtain informed consent differs from the waiver from the requirement for documentation of informed consent permitted under both the Common Rule and FDA regulations (45 CFR 46.117(c); 21 CFR 56.109(c)).\n\nIII Discussion\n\nThe Common Rule standard has been adopted and successfully employed for decades by numerous other Federal agencies. The Common Rule permits an IRB to waive the requirements to obtain informed consent, or to allow changes to, or omission of, some or all elements of informed consent if the IRB finds and documents that: (1) the research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects; (2) the waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; (3) the research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration; and (4) whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation. (45 CFR 46.116(d)).6\n\nFootnote 6: The final rule that recently revised the Common Rule (82 FR 7149, January 19, 2017) adds a fifth criterion (i.e., “if the research involves using identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, the research could not practicably be carried out without using such information or biospecimens in an identifiable format” (new 2018 requirement at 45 CFR 46.116(f)(3)(iii)). As FDA revises its regulations to harmonize to the extent appropriate and permissible with the Common Rule, we will consider including this new criterion in any waiver provision.\n\nThe Secretary\'s Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections (SACHRP) provided input on the issue of whether waiver of informed consent provisions for certain minimal risk clinical investigations would be appropriate and helpful to FDA-regulated research. On March 13, 2014, SACHRP considered this issue. Recognizing that harmonization with the Common Rule would promote consistency and help to reduce confusion in the research community about when a waiver of informed consent may be permitted, while also facilitating certain FDA-regulated research, SACHRP recommended to the Secretary of HHS that FDA adopt the provisions for waiver of informed consent that exist under the Common Rule at 45 CRF 46.116(d). On October 26, 2016, SACHRP reiterated that recommendation to the Secretary.7_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nIV IRB waiver or Alteration of Informed Consent\n\nWaiver of informed consent for certain FDA-regulated minimal risk clinical investigations will facilitate investigators\' ability to conduct studies that may contribute substantially to the development of products to diagnose or treat diseases or conditions, or address unmet medical needs. In light of the Cures Act amendment to the FD&C Act described above, FDA intends to revise its informed consent regulations to add this waiver or alteration under appropriate human subject protection safeguards to the two existing exceptions from informed consent (i.e., in life-threatening situations and for emergency research). However, until FDA promulgates these regulations, we do not intend to object to an IRB8 approving a consent procedure that does not include, or that alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set forth in 21 CFR 50.25, or waiving the requirements to obtain informed consent when the IRB finds and documents9 that:\n\nFootnote 8: An institutional review board (IRB) is defined in 21 CFR 56.102(g) and is subject to the requirements of 21 CFR part 56.\n\nFootnote 9: An IRB is required to prepare and maintain adequate documentation of its activities, including actions taken by the IRB, under 21 CFR 56.115.\n\nThe clinical investigation involves no more than minimal risk (as defined in 21 CFR 50.3(k) or 56.102(i)) to the subjects;\n\nThe waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects;\n\nThe clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration; and\n\nWhenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation.\n\nFDA does not intend to object to a sponsor initiating, or an investigator conducting, a minimal risk clinical investigation for which an IRB waives or alters the informed consent requirements as described above. FDA intends to withdraw this guidance after we promulgate regulations to permit a waiver or alteration of informed consent under appropriate human subject protection safeguards consistent with section 3024 of the Cures Act.\n\nV Inquiries about Specific Clinical Investigations\n\nSponsors, investigators and IRBs may contact FDA for questions about implementing the recommendations in this guidance for a specific clinical investigation.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.2 Are IDE exempt studies subject to the requirements for informed consent and IRB review and approval under Parts 50 and 56?\n\nIf an exempt study is being conducted to collect data to support either a clinical investigation or a marketing application, then the study must comply with 21 CFR Part 50 and should comply with 21 CFR Part 56. 21 CFR 50.1(a), 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 56.101(a), 21 CFR 56.103.\n\n3.3.3 Does FDA require IRB review and approval of off-label use of a legally marketed device?\n\nNo, when a physician uses a legally marketed device outside its labeling to treat a patient and no research is being done, IRB review is not required. Note: Although not required by FDA, an IRB may still decide on its own initiative to review such use. Yes, when the off-label use of a legally marketed device is part of a research study collecting safety and effectiveness data involving human subjects, IRB review and approval is required (21 CFR 812.2(a)).\n\nFor additional information on the off-label use of devices, see the FDA Information Sheet guidance, "" \'Off-label\' and Investigational Use of Marketed Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices.""6\n\nFootnote 6: This guidance can be found at: www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/offlabel.html\n\nMust an IRB review a study conducted after submission of a (510(k)) to FDA but prior to FDA\'s decision on that submission?\n\nYes. During FDA\'s review of the premarket notification submission, the device remains an investigational product. Therefore, the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations apply. The device may not be distributed, except for investigational use, unless FDA clears the device for marketing.\n\n16 Can a physician use an unapproved device in an emergency?\n\nIn general, an unapproved medical device may be used only on human subjects when the device is under clinical investigation and when used by investigators participating in a clinical trial. Section 561 of the Act, however, recognizes that there may be circumstances under which a health care provider may wish to use an unapproved device to save the life of a patient or to prevent irreversible morbidity when there exists no other alternative therapy. For investigational devices under an IDE, the IDE regulation permits deviations from the investigational plan without prior approval when necessary to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency. (See 21 CFR 812.35(a)). A physician may treat a patient with an unapproved medical device in an emergency situation if he/she concludes that:\n\nThe patient has a life-threatening condition that needs immediate treatment;7 Footnote 7: FDA considers “life-threatening condition” to include serious diseases or conditions such as sight-threatening and limb-threatening conditions as well as other situations involving risk of irreversible morbidity.\n\nNo generally acceptable alternative treatment for the condition exists; and\n\nBecause of the immediate need to use the device, there is no time to use existing procedures to get FDA approval for the use.\n\nFDA expects the physician to make the determination that the patient\'s circumstances meet the above criteria, to assess the potential for benefit from the use of the unapproved device, and to have substantial reason to believe that benefits will exist. In the event that a device is used in circumstances meeting the criteria listed above, the physician should follow as many of the patient protection procedures listed below as possible:\n\nInformed consent from the patient or a legal representative;\n\nClearance from the institution as specified by their policies;Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nConcurrence of the IRB chairperson;\n\nAn assessment from a physician who is not participating in the study; and\n\nAuthorization from the IDE sponsor, if an IDE exists for the device.\n\nWhile prior approval for shipment or emergency use of the investigational device is not required, the use must be reported to FDA by the IDE sponsor within 5 working days from the time the sponsor learns of the use. 21 CFR 812.35(a)(2) and 812.150(a)(4). The report should contain a summary of the conditions constituting the emergency, patient outcome information, and the patient protection measures that were followed. If no IDE exists, the physician should follow the above procedures and report the emergency use to CDRH or CBER.\n\nFor additional information on the procedures physicians and IRBs should follow in an emergency use situation, please see Chapter III Expanded Access to Unapproved Devices of the guidance entitled, ""IDE Policies and Procedures.""8\n\nFootnote 8: This guidance may be found at: www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/idepolcy.html\n\nWhat if the situation is not an emergency? Can a patient with a serious illness or condition have access to an investigational device outside a study?\n\nYes, FDA recognizes that there are circumstances in which an investigational device is the only option available for a patient faced with a serious or life-threatening condition (hereinafter referred to as ""compassionate use""). Unlike emergency use of an unapproved device discussed above, prior FDA approval is needed before compassionate use occurs. Section 561(b) of the act and 21 CFR 812.35. In order to obtain agency approval, the sponsor should submit an IDE supplement requesting approval for a protocol deviation under section 812.35(a) in order to treat the patient. The IDE supplement should include:\n\nA description of the patient\'s condition and the circumstances necessitating treatment;\n\nA discussion of why alternatives therapies are unsatisfactory and why the probable risk of using the investigational device is no greater than the probable risk from the disease or condition;\n\nAn identification of any deviations in the approved clinical protocol that may be needed in order to treat the patient; and\n\nThe patient protection measures listed above that will be followed.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe patient identified in the supplement should not be treated with the device until FDA approves its use under the proposed circumstances. In reviewing this type of request, FDA will consider the above information as well as whether the preliminary evidence of safety and effectiveness justifies such use and whether such use would interfere with the conduct of a clinical trial to support marketing approval.\n\nIf the request is approved, the attending physician should devise an appropriate schedule for monitoring the patient, taking into consideration the investigational nature of the device and the specific needs of the patient. The patient should be monitored to detect any possible problems arising from the use of the device. Following the compassionate use of the device, a follow-up report should be submitted to FDA in which summary information regarding patient outcome is presented. If any problems occurred as a result of device use, they should be discussed in the supplement and reported to the reviewing IRB as soon as possible.\n\nAdditional information on the procedures physicians and IRBs should follow in compassionate use situations may be found in Chapter III Expanded Access to Unapproved Devices of the guidance entitled, ""IDE Policies and Procedures.""9\n\nFootnote 9: This guidance may be found at: www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/idepolcy.html\n\n18 What is the definition of a custom device?\n\nTo be considered a custom device, the device must meet all of the following criteria, which are described in section 520(b) of the act and at 21 CFR 812.3(b):\n\n(1) It necessarily deviates from devices generally available or from an applicable performance standard or premarket approval requirement in order to comply with the order of an individual physician or dentist;\n\n(2) The device is not generally available to, or generally used by, other physicians or dentists;\n\n(3) It is not generally available in finished form for purchase or for dispensing upon prescription;\n\n(4) It is not offered for commercial distribution through labeling or advertising; and\n\n(5) It is intended for use by an individual patient named in the order form of a physician or dentist, and is to be made in a specific form for that patient, or is intended to meet the special needs of the physician or dentist in the course of professional practice (such as a particular operating tool).\n\n19 Does an IRB need to review custom use?\n\nFDA regulations do not require review and approval for custom device use. However, FDA recommends that as many of the patient protection measures listed in paragraph 16 be followed as possible. IRBs should be familiar with the regulatory requirements for custom devicesbecause physicians or institutions may seek information from the IRB about the use of a custom device in patients at their healthcare facility. IRBs may develop procedures for the use of custom devices to ensure that patient protection measures are thoughtfully carried out.\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Devices Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: In accordance with section 520(g) and the regulations, clinical studies of medical devices must comply with FDA\'s human subject protection requirements (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research) (21 CFR Part 50), Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements (21 CFR Part 56), Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) requirements (21 CFR Part 812), Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators requirements (21 CFR Part 54) regulations, as well as any other applicable regulations, including pertinent regulations at 21 CFR Part 809 (In Vitro Diagnostic Devices For Human Use).\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThere are three types of studies described in the regulations at 21 CFR Part 812: significant risk (SR) device studies, non-significant risk (NSR) device studies, and exempt studies. A brief description of these types of studies follows. Please refer to the FDA Information Sheet Guidance ""Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies"" for more detailed information about SR and NSR device studies, the importance of the IRB\'s review, the regulatory requirements for these studies, and examples of devices in each category.\n\nA. Significant t Risk Device Studies\n\nA significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. (21 CFR 812.3(m))\n\nSponsors of investigational SR device studies are required to get an approved IDE from FDA before starting their study. 21 CFR 812.20 (FDA gives each IDE a number - for example #GXX0000, where XX denotes the year of the submission). Sponsors and clinical investigators of these studies must comply with the regulations at 21 CFR Part 812, ""Investigational Device Exemptions.""\n\nIf FDA disapproves an IDE, FDA\'s letter will describe the reasons for the disapproval. If the sponsor submits an IDE amendment satisfactorily addressing the issues in FDA\'s letter, the agency sends an IDE approval letter to the sponsor. In accordance with the regulations at Part 812, the study may not start until both FDA and the IRB have given their approval.\n\nNote: A conditional approval letter from FDA allows the study to begin if the study is approved by the IRB, but requires the sponsor to provide additional clarifying information in order to obtain full approval for the study.\n\nIRBs do not have to make the SR or NSR determination if FDA has already made the risk determination. Most often, clinical investigators submit SR device investigations for IRB review after the study has already received IDE approval from FDA. IRBs may ensure that SR device investigations have an FDA-approved IDE by asking the clinical investigator to request from the sponsor a copy of FDA\'s IDE approval letter.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAn IRB may be asked to review an SR device study before the sponsor receives FDA approval of an IDE submission. Under this circumstance, IRBs should be aware that because it is possible that FDA may not approve the IDE or may request significant changes to the research protocol, the IRB may need to re-evaluate the study after FDA reviews the application. If an IRB approves the significant risk device study before FDA approves the IDE, there may be more of a risk that clinical investigators will mistakenly enroll subjects before the study should be started (i.e, before FDA approves the IDE.)\n\nNon-Significant Risk Device Studies\n\nAn NSR device is an investigational device that does not meet the definition of a significant risk device. If an IRB finds that an investigational medical device study poses a NSR, the sponsor does not need to submit an IDE to FDA before starting the study. If the IRB determines that the proposed study is an NSR study, the IRB may proceed to review the study under 21 CFR 56.109 and 21 CFR 56.111. FDA considers an NSR device study to have an approved IDE after IRB approval and when sponsors meet the abbreviated requirements at 21 CFR 812.2(b). Consequently, in most cases, FDA is not aware of non-significant risk device studies.\n\nAs stated above, if FDA has already made the risk determination, the IRB does not need to duplicate this effort. If, however, FDA has not made the risk determination or the IRB disagrees with the NSR determination made by a sponsor, then the IRB must notify the investigator and, where appropriate, the sponsor, that the study involves a significant risk device (21 CFR 812.66). If a sponsor or an IRB needs help in making the SR/NSR determination, it may ask for a written determination from FDA.3\n\nFootnote 3: See the guidance memorandum entitled, “Procedures for Handling Inquiries Regarding the Need for an Investigational Device Exemptions Application for Research Involving Medical Devices” at www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/blue-ide-d01-1.html\n\nThe IRB should consider the following in determining whether a device study poses a SR or NSR:\n\nthe sponsor\'s description of why the study is not SR\n\nwhether the proposed NSR research study meets the definition of ""significant risk"" (see above)\n\nthe proposed use of the device as well as any protocol related procedures and tests, not just the device (test article) alone. (This process is different from the IRB review process found at 21 CFR 56.111(a)(2)).)\n\nadditional information from the sponsor, if needed.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.3.1 C. Exempt Studies\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 812.2(b), sponsors and investigators of certain studies are exempt from the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812, with the exception of SS812.119 (disqualification of a clinical investigator). Examples of exempt studies are consumer preference testing, testing of a device modification, or testing of two or more devices in commercial distribution if the testing does not collect safety or effectiveness data, or put subjects at risk.4\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 CFR 812.2(c)(4).\n\nStudies of an already cleared medical device in which the device is used or investigated in accordance with the indications in the cleared labeling are exempt from Part 812.5 Note: Studies of a cleared device for a new use must comply with the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations. Similarly, studies of a PMA approved device are exempt from the IDE requirements if the device is being studied for the indications in the approved labeling.\n\nFootnote 5: See 21 CFR 812.2(c)(1) and (2).\n\nIn addition, diagnostic device studies (e.g., in vitro diagnostic studies) are exempt from the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812 under certain circumstances. The study is exempt as long as the sponsor complies with the requirements at 21 CFR 809.10(c) for labeling, and if the testing: (i) is noninvasive; (ii) does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents significant risk; (iii) does not by design or intention introduce energy into a subject; and (iv) is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure. 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3).\n\n3.2 Are IDE exempt studies subject to the requirements for informed consent and IRB review and approval under Parts 50 and 56?\n\nIf an exempt study is being conducted to collect data to support either a clinical investigation or a marketing application, then the study must comply with 21 CFR Part 50 and should comply with 21 CFR Part 56. 21 CFR 50.1(a), 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 56.101(a), 21 CFR 56.103.\n\n3.3.3 Does FDA require IRB review and approval of off-label use of a legally marketed device?\n\nNo, when a physician uses a legally marketed device outside its labeling to treat a patient and no research is being done, IRB review is not required. Note: Although not required by FDA, an IRB may still decide on its own initiative to review such use. Yes, when the off-label use of a legally marketed device is part of a research study collecting safety and effectiveness data involving human subjects, IRB review and approval is required (21 CFR 812.2(a)).\n\nFor additional information on the off-label use of devices, see the FDA Information Sheet guidance, "" \'Off-label\' and Investigational Use of Marketed Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices.""6\n\nFootnote 6: This guidance can be found at: www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/offlabel.html\n\nMust an IRB review a study conducted after submission of a (510(k)) to FDA but prior to FDA\'s decision on that submission?\n\nYes. During FDA\'s review of the premarket notification submission, the device remains an investigational product. Therefore, the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations apply. The device may not be distributed, except for investigational use, unless FDA clears the device for marketing.\n\n16 Can a physician use an unapproved device in an emergency?\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Devices Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'

Which regulations contain provisions relevant to the IVD industry?\n\nListed below are some of the regulations that implement the Act and that are relevant to IVDs covered by this guidance. See Table 1 (Appendix 1) for additional information. This is not an all-inclusive list.\n\nTitle 21, Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR)\n\nPart 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures\n\nPart 50, Protection of Human SubjectsPart 54, Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators\n\nPart 56, Institutional Review Boards\n\nPart 801, Labeling\n\nPart 803, Medical Device Reporting\n\nPart 807, Establishment Registration and Device Listing for\n\nManufacturers and Initial Importers of Devices\n\nPart 809, In Vitro Diagnostic Products for Human Use\n\nPart 810, Medical Device Recall Authority\n\nPart 812, Investigational Device Exemptions\n\nPart 814, Premarket Approval of Medical Devices\n\nPart 820, Quality System Regulation\n\nPart 860, Medical Device Classification Procedures\n\nPart 862, Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices\n\nPart 864, Hematology and Pathology Devices\n\nPart 866, Immunology and Microbiology Devices\n\nIn addition, certain sections of Part 610 apply to devices that employ\n\nhuman blood components. For example:\n\n610.40, Test Requirements (Testing Requirements for Communicable\n\nDisease Agents)\n\n610.42, Restrictions on Use for Further Manufacture of Medical Devices\n\n2. How do I determine the applicability of the IDE regulation to my IVD study?\n\nWe recommend that you begin with the exemptions in 21 CFR 812.2(c). Your\n\nproposed IVD study is exempt from most provisions of the IDE regulation if it fits any one of the following three categories:\n\na. The IVD is a pre-amendments device (i.e., a device that was in\n\ncommercial distribution prior to the enactment of the 1976 Medical\n\nDevice Amendments to the Act), other than a transitional device (see the\n\nGlossary for definition), and is used or investigated according to the\n\nindications in the labeling at that time.\n\nb. The IVD is a device, other than a transitional device, that has been\n\nfound to be substantially equivalent to a pre-amendments device and is\n\nused or investigated according to the indications in the labeling reviewed\n\nby FDA in determining substantial equivalence.\n\nc. The IVD\n\n({}^{\\star}) is properly labeled in accordance with 21 CFR 809.10(c);\n\n({}^{\\star}) is noninvasive (see question #5 below);\n\n({}^{\\star}) does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents\n\nsignificant risk (see question #4 below);\n\n({}^{\\star}) does not by design or intention introduce energy into a subject;\n\nand(\\bullet) is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure (see question # 6 below).\n\nFor your study to be exempt from most of the requirements of the IDE regulation under this third category, it must meet all of the conditions listed in ""c"" above. (See also the decision tree in Appendix 1.) You should refer to 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 for applicable requirements relating to IRBs and informed consent, including for device studies that meet the criteria described in 21 CFR 812.2(c). Additionally, investigators for those studies are still subject to 21 CFR 812.119 (the provision entitled ""Disqualification of a clinical investigator."")\n\nIf your proposed study does not fit into one of the three categories listed above, you, the sponsor, must have an approved IDE (21 CFR 812.2) before you may begin your investigation, including any shipment of your investigational IVD. (Note: A device that is approved under a premarket approval application (PMA) or cleared under a 510(k) and then used in a study in accordance with the approved or cleared labeling is not investigational and, therefore, is not subject to the IDE regulation.)\n\nThe requirements for an IDE depend on the level of risk that the study presents to subjects.\n\nFor a significant risk device (see the Glossary for definition), the sponsor must apply to FDA for an IDE approval (see 21 CFR 812.1, 812.20). For a non-significant risk device (see the Glossary for definition), the sponsor must meet the abbreviated requirements of 21 CFR 812.2(b), including review and approval of the investigation by an institutional review board (IRB) and compliance with informed consent requirements. A non-significant risk study is considered to have an approved IDE when the abbreviated requirements are met.\n\nNote: The requirements of the ""Protection of Human Subjects"" and ""Institutional Review Boards"" regulations (21 CFR Parts 50 and 56) apply to all clinical investigations regulated by FDA under section 520(g) of the Act, as well as other clinical investigations that support applications for research or marketing permits. (21 CFR 50.1, 56.101; see also Section V, Human Subject Protection, of this guidance.) Therefore, all studies of investigational IVDs that will support applications to FDA are subject to 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, even if they are not subject to most requirements of 21 CFR Part 812.\n\n3. How do I determine if the study is a significant or non-significant risk study under 21 CFR 812.2(b)?A significant risk IVD device is generally one that is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to health, safety, or welfare of a subject. 21 CFR 812.3(m).\n\nFor IVDs, we interpret ""potential for serious risk"" in relation to the nature of the harm that may result to the subject. Misdiagnosis and/or error in treatment caused by inaccurate test results would be considered a significant risk if the potential harm to the subject could be life-threatening, or could result in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to the body structure.\n\nFalse positive results can lead to unnecessary confirmatory testing, unnecessary treatment that can be invasive or have harmful side effects, and/or unnecessary psychological trauma when serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions are involved. False negative results can lead to a delay in establishing the correct diagnosis, failure to start or continue needed treatment, false security that may prevent timely follow-up and retesting, and contribute to the potential spread of infectious agents to others. If the potential risk does not rise to the level described above, the study is not considered to pose a significant risk. FDA recommends the sponsor consider all these factors when determining the risk associated with your investigational IVD. (See 21 CFR 812.3(m) and also ""Information Sheet Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors,"" available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/Guida\n\nncesInformationSheetsandNotices/ucm113709.htm, particularly the one on\n\n""Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Devices"" at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo\n\ncuments/ucm126622.htm.)\n\nHow do I determine if an invasive sampling technique presents a significant risk under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3)?\n\nTo determine whether an invasive sampling technique presents a serious risk, we recommend that you base your risk determination on the nature of the harm that may result from sampling. For example, FDA considers sampling techniques that require biopsy of a major organ, use of general anesthesia, or placement of a blood access line into an artery or large vein (subclavian, femoral, or iliac) to present a significant risk.\n\n5 What does noninvasive mean?\n\nA noninvasive device is one that does not, by design or intention:\n\na. penetrate or pierce the skin or mucous membranes of the body, the ocular cavity, or the urethra; or b. enter the ear beyond the external auditory canal, the nose beyond the nares, the mouth beyond the pharynx, the anal canal beyond the rectum, or the vagina beyond the cervical os.\n\n(21 CFR 812.3(k)).\n\nBlood sampling that involves simple venipuncture is considered noninvasive, and the use of surplus samples of body fluids or tissues that are left over from samples taken for noninvestigational purposes is also considered noninvasive (21 CFR 812.3(k)).\n\n6. What does it mean to have ""confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure?""\n\nFor an investigational study to be exempt under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3), clinical investigators must use a medically established means of diagnosis (e.g., another cleared or approved IVD or culture) of the disease or condition as the basis for decisions regarding treatment of all subjects participating in the study. 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3)(iv). Additionally, test results from the exempt IVD investigation should not influence patient treatment or clinical management decisions before the diagnosis is established by a medically established product or procedure.\n\nIf an investigational test uses a new technology or represents a significant technological advance, established diagnostic products or procedures may not be adequate to confirm the diagnosis provided by the investigational IVD. For example, if an investigational test is designed to identify an infection at the earliest stages of viral infection (before formation of antibodies), established diagnostic products or procedures that rely on the detection of antibodies to the virus would be inadequate to confirm diagnoses. Under these conditions the study would not meet the criteria for exemption under 812.2(c)(3) since the testing could not be confirmed with a medically established diagnostic product or procedure. You may consider whether the device is a non-significant risk device subject to abbreviated IDE requirements (21 CFR 812.2(b)).\n\n7.

A subject may be in normal health or may have a medical condition or disease (21 CFR 812.3(p)).\n\nSurplus samples - see excess samples.\n\nTransitional device - a product defined as a device as of May 28, 1976, but previously considered by FDA to be a new drug or an antibiotic drug (21 CFR 812.3(r)).\n\nTreatment IDE - use of an unapproved investigational device for the treatment or diagnosis of patients during the clinical trial or prior to final FDA action on the marketing application, if during the course of the clinical trial the data suggest that the device is effective. A treatment IDE may cover a large number of patients that exceeds the number of clinical sites and patients stipulated in the original IDE. The device must be for treatment or diagnosis of a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition; there must be no comparable or satisfactory alternative device or therapy available; the device must be under investigation in a controlled clinical study for the same use under an approved IDE, or such clinical studies have been completed; and the sponsor must be actively pursuing marketing approval or clearance of the device. Requirements for an application for a treatment IDE are found in the Investigational Device Exemptions regulation at 21 CFR 812.36.\n\nTruth Standard (""Gold"" Standard) - any medical procedure or laboratory method or combination of procedures and methods that the clinical community relies upon for diagnosis, that is accepted by FDA, and that is regarded as having negligible risk of either a false positive or a false negative result. The truth standard result should be definitive (positive/negative, present/absent, or diseased/non-diseased), and should not give an indeterminate result. As science and technology improve, newer, more reliable standards may replace previous standards, particularly in the case of new disease markers.\n\nVIII.

8,"After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?","[""--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: The definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n\nThe determination of the amount of added sugars contributed by a powdered fruit or vegetable juice that is added as an ingredient to a product and that is not reconstituted to single strength juice during processing (e.g., that is added to a pureed fruit or to a yogurt) would be the same as the determination of the sugars contributed by a liquid or frozen fruit or vegetable juice concentrate. In our response to question 11, we have suggested that when calculating the added sugars declaration for a product containing concentrated fruit or vegetable juice, the total moisture content of the finished product can be considered to go towards reconstitution of the fruit juice concentrate in the formulation. Thus, the total moisture content of a finished product formulated with powdered fruit or vegetable juice concentrates can be considered to contribute towards the dilution of the powdered fruit or vegetable juice. Further, the sugars contributed by the powdered fruit or vegetable juice that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type must be declared as added sugars on the label, as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule.\n8. Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates? We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12). We require that, when a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)). If you use Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 to calculate the amount of added sugars in a product containing juice concentrate, you must document this information in the records regarding the amount of added sugars added to the food during processing (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). If you use the amount of sugars present in a single strength juice and/or a juice concentrate, that is determined through chemical analysis or other available information, when calculating the amount of added sugars in a product containing fruit juice concentrate, you must document the source of the information and/or the amount of sugars determined through chemical analysis in the records that you make and keep (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). If a diluted juice concentrate slightly exceeds the amount of sugar that would be found in the same volume of the same type of 100 percent fruit juice, manufacturers should document the average and consistency with cGMPs in the records that they make and keep.\n9. Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis? The amount of added sugars declared on the label must be in grams (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The added sugars definition includes sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. For juice, the serving size is based on volume (e.g., 8 oz. or 240 ml) while the amount of added sugars per serving is based on weight. Therefore, when calculating the weight of added sugars per serving, you may need to consider the densities of both the finished juice product and the single strength juice of the same type. You may choose to arrive at the gram amount of added sugars in different ways. Please see our responses to questions 11 and 12 for examples of how to calculate the amount of added sugars in products containing concentrated fruit juices on both a volume and weight basis.\n10. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit or vegetable juice (juice made from a single type of fruit or vegetable) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength juice where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)? In the hypothetical example below, we provide three general steps to calculate the amount of added sugars (in grams) for an apple juice product (240 ml serving size) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength apple juice. The product in this hypothetical example is reconstituted to have juice soluble solids above the minimum Brixrequirement in 21 CFR 101.30 where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9). Therefore, all sugars in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice must be declared as added sugars. The apple juice example here uses the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration. This example is provided solely to demonstrate one method of calculating the added sugars content of the product. You can use alternate methods.\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 3: For the purposes of this guidance document, we consider a “comparable product” to be one that is in the same food category (e.g., fruit), that is in the same form (e.g., dried), and that has the same usage (e.g., a snack). For example, we consider unsweetened raisins to be comparable to sweetened dried cranberries.\n\nIn the Federal Register of June 6, 2019 (84 FR 28726), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled, ""The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, and Certain Cranberry Products; Guidance for Industry"" (hereafter referred to as ""the final guidance"")4.\n\nFootnote 4: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-declaration-added-sugars-honey-maple-syrup-other-single-ingredient-sugars-\n\nThe final guidance clarifies the labeling requirements for single-ingredient packages and/or containers of pure honey, pure maple syrup, and other pure sugars and syrups, which are not required to bear the words, ""Includes Xg Added Sugars"" but must still include the percent DV for added sugars on their labels. The final guidance also advises food manufacturers of our intent to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the use of truthful and not misleading statements on single-ingredient packages and/or containers of pure honey, pure maple syrup, and other pure sugars and syrups.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFurther, the final guidance states our intent to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the use of a ""(\\uparrow)"" symbol on single-ingredient packages and/or containers of pure honey, pure maple syrup, and other pure sugars and syrups immediately following the percent DV representing the contribution of added sugars to the diet obtained from a serving of these products. We also intend to exercise such enforcement discretion when the symbol leads the reader to a truthful and not misleading statement within a footnote at the bottom of the Nutrition Facts label that includes a description of the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent DV for added sugars in the diet.\n\nThe guidance also states our intent to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the use in the Nutrition Facts label of the ""(\\uparrow)"" symbol immediately after the added sugars percent DV information that leads consumers to a statement outside of the Nutrition Facts label on certain dried cranberry and cranberry beverage products that are made up of cranberry juice that is sweetened with added sugars and that contain total sugars at levels no greater than comparable products with endogenous (inherent) sugars, but no added sugars.\n\nThe final guidance advises manufacturers of single-ingredient packages and/or containers of pure honey, pure maple syrup, and other pure sugars and syrups, as well as certain dried cranberry and cranberry beverage products of our intent to exercise enforcement discretion until July 1, 2021, for complying with the updated labeling requirements in the Nutrition Facts label final rule and the Serving Size final rule.\n\nIV Discussion\n\nWhen we published the draft guidance, we extended our enforcement discretion to include certain cranberry products with added sugars that contain total sugars at levels no greater than comparable products. The draft guidance did not expressly discuss cranberry products with added flavorings. However, in the final guidance, we did not extend enforcement discretion to dried cranberries with added flavorings. After we announced the availability of the final guidance, we received correspondence from certain cranberry manufacturers (Ref. [2]). The cranberry industry presented us with concerns that manufacturers of dried cranberries with added flavorings have regarding their ability to comply with the Nutrition Facts label final rule and Serving Size final rule by January 1, 2020 and requested that we extend the compliance date for the final rules for dried cranberries with added flavorings. The cranberry industry explained that it had anticipated that the final guidance would extend to dried cranberries with added flavorings the same enforcement discretion as the other certain cranberry products covered under the draft guidance. Consequently, when the final guidance did not indicate an intent to extend enforcement discretion to dried cranberries with added flavorings, the cranberry industry sought additional time to comply with the Nutrition Facts final rule and Serving Size final rule.\n\nWe understand the change to exclude dried cranberries with added flavorings in the final guidance may have been unexpected for manufacturers of dried cranberries with added flavorings. We also understand that manufacturers of these dried cranberry products face operational constraints with respect to changing their labels by the compliance date for the final rules. To address these issues, through this guidance document, we are announcing our intent to exercise enforcement discretion with regard to compliance with the Nutrition Facts label final rule and the Serving Size final rule for certain dried cranberry products5 with added flavorings until July 1, 2020. We are taking this position because we recognize the importance of giving manufacturers of dried cranberries with added flavorings additional time to comply with the Nutrition Facts label final rule and Serving Size final rule.\n\nFootnote 5: See Footnote 2.\n\nV References\n\nThe following references are on display at the Dockets Management Staff, Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines includes a recommendation for healthy eating patterns that limit added sugars (including honey, syrups, and other caloric sweeteners) to less than 10 percent of calories per day (Ref. 3).\n\nNutrition Facts Label Final Rule\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016, we issued a final rule updating the Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods to reflect new scientific information (see 81 FR 33742). The Nutrition Facts label final rule includes changes in the individual nutrients that must be declared and also changes some of the DVs. The science underlying the Nutrition Facts label final rule, referenced above, is also reflected in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires that added sugars be included in the Nutrition Facts label and established a DV for added sugars. The Nutrition Facts label final rule defines ""added sugars,"" in part, to include sugars that are either added during the processing of foods or are packaged as such (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The term includes free sugars (free mono- and disaccharides), sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The Nutrition Facts label final rule requires added sugars to be declared on the food label by stating ""Includes Xg Added Sugars"" indented directly below ""Total Sugars"" (see 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(ii)).\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires a declaration for added sugars, in part, because excess consumption of added sugars makes it difficult to meet nutrient needs within the calorie limits generally needed to maintain a healthy weight and can lead to an increase in overall caloric intake. Further, healthy dietary patterns characterized, in part, by lower amounts of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, as compared to less healthy dietary patterns, are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary_Guidelines demonstrates that meeting nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits is difficult with more than 10 percent of total daily calories from added sugars (50 grams of added sugars based on a 2,000 calorie diet). Based on this science, the Nutrition Facts label final rule establishes a DV for added sugars, 50 grams based on a 2,000 calorie diet for adults and children 4 years of age and older and 25 grams based on a 1,000 calorie diet for children 1 through 3 years of age (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(vii)).\n\nPure (100%) honey, pure (100%) maple syrup, other single-ingredient sugars and syrups, and certain cranberry products sweetened with added sugars contribute to the DV of added sugars, regardless of whether they are added by consumers to foods (e.g., maple syrup poured over pancakes; sugar added to dried cranberries to increase palatability) or consumed in isolation (e.g., a spoonful of honey). FDA\'s definition encompasses the types of added sugars that were evaluated in the science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommendation that no more than 10 percent of calories be from added sugars. These sugars were considered ""empty calories"" or ""calories for other uses"" in the USDA Food Patterns.\n\nDraft Guidance\n\nIn the Federal Register of March 2, 2018 (83 FR 8953), we made available a draft guidance for industry entitled ""The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, and Certain Cranberry Products; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availability"" (hereafter referred to as ""the draft guidance"") and asked interested parties to submit comments by May 1, 2018. In the Federal Register of April 25, 2018 (83 FR 17961), we extended the comment period to June 15, 2018. We have considered comments to the draft guidance, and we have made modifications, where appropriate, that are now reflected in this final guidance.\n\nFarm Bill\n\nAfter we published the Nutrition Facts label final rule and the Serving Size final rule, and draft guidance, the President signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (""the Farm Bill""). Section 12516 of the Farm Bill states that the food labeling requirements under section 403(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)) shall not require that the Nutrition Facts label of any single-ingredient sugar, honey, agave, or syrup, including maple syrup, that is packaged and offered for sale as a single-ingredient food bear the declaration ""Includes Xg Added Sugars."" Therefore, single-ingredient sugars, honey, agave, and syrups, including maple syrup, do not need to have this statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving of their product on their label. At the same time, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nAlthough the gram amount of added sugars in a serving of pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups does not need to be declared on the label, these single-ingredient sugars and syrups are required under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV that they contribute to added sugars in the diet. The percent DV on pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups provides important information to consumers about how the addition of sugar from these products contributes to their total daily diet. In the absence of the declaration of the amount of added sugars in a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product, a statement that includes information about the amount of sugars in a serving, as well as how that amount contributes to the consumer\'s diet and the percent DV for added sugars, provides information that can assist consumers in constructing a diet that is consistent with recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nTherefore, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the use of a ""(\\dagger)"" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV and, per the Farm Bill, the term ""Includes Xg Added Sugars"" would not need to appear on the line on the Nutrition Facts label disclosing the added sugars percent DV. The ""(\\dagger)"" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading within a footnote in the Nutrition Facts label box that includes a description of the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent DV for added sugars in the diet. The footnote containing this factual statement should be placed beneath the required footnote that states, ""The % Daily Value (DV) tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice"" (see illustration below).5 Our intent to exercise enforcement discretion is limited to any pure, single-ingredient honey and maple syrup, and other pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups.\n\nFootnote 5: Note that the illustration provides an example of a truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet. FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for the use of any truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet.\n\nWe also intend to exercise our enforcement discretion for certain cranberry products described here (dried cranberries without added flavorings and cranberry beverages made up of cranberry juice that is sweetened with added sugars that provide an amount of total sugars in a serving that does not exceed the level of total sugars in a serving of a comparable product with no added sugars) to allow for the use of a ""(\\dagger)"" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV. The ""(\\dagger)"" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nManufacturers could explain, through the use of such statements, that the sugars added to dried cranberries or the cranberry beverage product are meant to increase the palatability of the naturally tart fruit and that the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. We have provided illustrations of such statements that we consider to be truthful and not misleading below.\n\nAt this time, we are not aware of products, other than the dried cranberry and cranberry beverage products previously discussed, for which the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. Therefore, at this time we only intend to exercise enforcement discretion for cranberry products previously discussed with respect to the use of the ""(\\uparrow)"" that would direct consumers to truthful and not misleading statements on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label, and do not intend to exercise enforcement discretion on other products (e.g., a granola bar or trail mix containing dried sugar-sweetened cranberries). We note that we would consider whether the same type of enforcement discretion discussed with respect to the cranberry products previously described might be warranted for other products where the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, such as naturally tart fruits, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: 3. Do I need to take into consideration sugars from ingredients that are used in formulating my product when determining the added sugars declaration for a serving of my product?\n\nIngredients containing free mono- and disaccharides that meet our definition of added sugars need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (e.g. sugars from cane sugar and concentrated fruit juice added to sweeten an apple sauce). Manufacturers may need to work with ingredient suppliers to determine the amount of added sugars provided by ingredients used in formulating food products.\n\n4. Do the sugars in dried fruits meet the definition of added sugars?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we responded to comments on dried fruits (see response to comment 212, 81 FR 33742 at 33837). We said that dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them should not be considered to contain added sugars because they are essentially a dehydrated whole fruit and still retain the nutrients and other components of a whole fruit (e.g. diced dried apples). However, if additional sugar is added to a dried fruit, the sugar added to the dried fruit must be declared on the label as added sugars (81 FR 33742 at 33837).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5. Are the sugars used in the production of vinegar added sugars?\n\nIn the production of vinegar, naturally occurring sugars are first fermented into alcohol and then a secondary fermentation occurs in which alcohol is converted to vinegar. For most vinegar products, no sugars remain in the final product. Vinegars that do not contain any sugars in the finished food would not need an added sugars declaration. However, we are aware of some vinegars (e.g., balsamic vinegar) that are made using ingredients that are often used as sweeteners in foods, and that are similar to concentrated fruit juices (e.g., grape must). According to the definition of added sugars, sugars found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type are added sugars. Therefore, fruit juices that are concentrated before or during processing of some vinegars contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars. To the extent that sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are present in the finished product, the added sugars must be declared on the label and in labeling, as required in our Nutrition Facts label final rule. We understand that the manufacturing of vinegar involves several steps, and manufacturers need to consider the impact of these steps (e.g. potential concentration due to water loss when aged in wooden barrels) on the final added sugars declaration.\n\n6. The definition of added sugars excludes the ""fruit component of fruit spreads."" What constitutes the ""fruit component"" of a non-standardized fruit spread?\n\nPlease see our response to question 1 above. The fruit component of a non-standardized fruit spread would include whole fruits, pieces of fruit, dried fruit, fruit or vegetable pures (single strength or concentrated), fruit pulps, single strength juices, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders that are not made from fruit or vegetable juices.\n\n7. Do sugars found in fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the form of the fruit or vegetable (e.g., concentrated fruit and vegetable pures, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders) need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833), we explained that we excluded from the definition of ""added sugars"" whole fruit, fruit pieces, dried fruit, pulps, and pures because they are nutrient rich and maintain the basic properties of a fruit when added to foods and are not considered to contain added sugars (see response to comment 208, 81 FR 33742 at33835). We also explained that sugars from 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, and sugars from certain fruit and vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under certain regulations, fruit juice concentrates used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, and preserves under our standards of identity, and 100 percent juice concentrate sold directly to consumers (e.g. frozen orange juice concentrate) are excluded from the definition of ""added sugars.""\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833 through 33834), we explained that, while foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices can be a part of a healthful diet, the sugars added to the foods by the concentrated fruit or vegetable juice provide additional calories. Over the course of the day, small amounts of calories in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages can add up and make it difficult to balance the amount of calories expended (81 FR 33742 at 33834). For these reasons, we consider foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices to be sugar-sweetened foods (id).\n\nWe also explained that in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report (Ref. 1) (81 FR 33742 at 33835).\n\nWe are applying these same guiding principles when determining when the sugars in an ingredient are added sugars. Concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes, and some fruit and vegetable powders are essentially whole fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the physical form of the fruit or vegetable and to remove moisture. They maintain the basic properties of a whole fruit or vegetable, even if the peel and seeds may be removed. Their composition and use is more consistent with that of whole fruits or vegetables, dried fruits or vegetables, pulps and pureses than that of concentrated fruit juices, which are commonly used by industry in place of sugars. Therefore, the sugars in concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes and some fruit and vegetable powders contribute to the diet the same way that sugars found in whole fruits or vegetables do, and do not have to be declared as added sugars on the label. However, we consider sugars in powders made from fruit and vegetable juices to be the same as those found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices because such powders are essentially concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that have all moisture removed. Therefore, some or all sugars contributed by a powder made from fruit or vegetable juices must be declared as added sugars on the label as required by the Nutrition Facts label final rule, depending on the degree of reconstitution in the finished food.\n\nThe definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: Products in the general food supply that contain insignificant amounts of eight or more of calories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium are eligible to provide a simplified declaration of nutrition information (21 CFR 101.9(f)). Products that qualify for the simplified declaration that bear nutrition claims are required to bear the statement ""Not a significant source of ____"" (with the blank filled in with the name(s) of any nutrient(s) identified in 21 CFR 101.9(f) that are present in insignificant amounts) and included at the bottom of the nutrition label). However, some products are sold in small packages (e.g., certain sugar-free chewing gums) for which the package size may render it impracticable for the label to display a substantial amount of information. Under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9), when ""circumstance[s] make it impracticable for firms to comply"" with Nutrition Facts labeling requirements, ""FDA may permit alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions to deal with the situation.""\n\nGiven the small package size of certain products and the potentially long statement that would be required if the label had to identify each nutrient that is present in insignificant amounts (see 21 CFR 101.9(f)), we consider 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9) to permit an alternative means of compliance with respect to the nutrition labeling for certain products sold in small packages for which the addition of such statement would be impracticable. In lieu of providing the ""Not a significant source of ____"" statement as required in 21 CFR 101.9(f)(4), we recommend that the label for such packages bear a statement such as ""Not a significant source of other nutrients"" at the bottom of the simplified Nutrition Facts label on such products sold in small packages.\n\nWhat are the requirements relating to multiunit retail food packages?\n\nWe recognize that many retail food products contain multiple, individually packaged items within the larger container (i.e., multiunit retail food packages). FDA\'s labeling requirements provide flexibility for such products, and manufacturers of such products generally have two options. The individual units within the multiunit retail food packages may be ""packaged and sold individually,"" meaning that each individually packaged item bears a Nutrition Facts label (81 FR 34000 at 34005). Note that, when individual units are packaged and sold individually, the Nutrition Facts label must still be visible at point of sale (see 21 CFR 101.9(h)). FDA regulations provide different requirements for unit containers in a multiunit retail food package when the individual unit containers are securely enclosed within and not intended to be separated from the retail package under conditions of retail sale and each unit container is labeled with the statement ""This Unit Not Labeled For Retail Sale"" or ""This Unit Not Labeled for Individual Sale"" in type size not less than 1/16-inch in height, except that this statement shall not be required when the inner unit containers bear no labeling at all (see 21 CFR 101.9(j)(15)(iii)). When this option is used, the multiunit retail food package must bear nutrition information in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9.\n\nCan Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels be placed on the bottom of a food package?\n\nGenerally not. The bottom of the package (such as the bottom of boxes, cans, and bottles, which generally cannot be viewed by the consumer at the point of sale) is not a permissible location for a Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels, unless it is visible during normal retail display and consumer handling (as with some frozen food packages or containers of mints and gum). The Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels must be placed either on the principal display panel or on the information panel (21 CFR 101.2(b)). The ""principal display panel"" means the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale (21 CFR 101.1). The ""information panel"" means the part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the principal display panel as observed by an individual facing the principal display panel, subject to a few exceptions (see 21 CFR 101.2(a)).\n\nWill the increase in RACCs for certain beverages, combined with recent changes to daily values (DVs) and the mandatory declaration of potassium--as updated in the Nutrition Facts label final rule--require products such as coffee, tea, and bottled water to bear mandatory nutrition labeling when such products were previously exempt under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(4)?\n\nNo. As explained in the serving size final rule, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to mandatory nutrition labeling on any products currently on the market, or that come on the market in the future, that would have been exempt under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(4) before the effective date of the serving size final rule, until such time as we have the opportunity to consider this issue in a future rulemaking (81 FR 34000 at 34026-34027). Examples of such products include coffee beans (whole or ground), tea leaves, commitment-type dehydrated vegetables, flavor extracts, food colors, and certain bottled water products.\n\nDoes FDA have recommendations or requirements relating to how nutrition information should be formatted if I use the tabular display for small packages as provided in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)? Specifically, are there limitations on the number of columns I can use in the tabular display?\n\nManufacturers using the tabular display must comply with all applicable requirements in 21 CFR 101.9. With respect to specific requirements that could impact the display of nutrition information using the tabular format, we note that 21 CFR 101.9 includes requirements for which nutrients must be indented under other nutrients (e.g., under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)(A), ""Soluble fiber content shall be indented under dietary fiber""). Attempting to divide the required nutrition information into more than two columns could result in a violation of such formatting requirements. We recommend that manufacturers follow the sample tabular display for small packages provided in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii), which uses two columns of nutrition information.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Size-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: A food that already contains some endogenous sugar and additional added sugars, either directly or as a component in an ingredient, such as sweetened fruit added to yogurt, would be misbranded if the actual ""Total Sugars"" amount is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label, or the records requirements for ""Added Sugars"" are not met (see SS 101.9(g)(11)).\n\nDo sugars present in a sweet fermented beverage after fermentation need to be declared as total or added sugars on the label?\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains only sugars that meet our definition of added sugars (e.g. table sugar), then the amount of sugars present in a serving of the product after fermentation must be declared as both total and added sugars (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains both sugars that do and do not meet our definition of added sugars, you may determine the amount of total sugars in the finished food analytically. You have the following options related to the added sugars declaration:\n\nDetermine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in the finished product and make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information you relied upon that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation; or\n\nDeclare the amount of added sugars added prior to fermentation and make and keep records to verify the amount (21 CFR 101.9(g)). The amount of added sugars declared should not exceed the amount of total sugars on the label; or\n\nIf you have no way to determine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in the finished food, but have reason to believe that a significant reduction of added sugars took place during fermentation, you may submit a petition, under 21 CFR 10.30, to request an alternative means of compliance. The petition should provide scientific data or other information for why the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product is likely to be significantly reduced compared to the amount added prior to fermentation. A significant reduction would be where reduction in added sugars after fermentation may be significant enough to impact the label declaration for added sugars by an amount that exceeds the reasonable deficiency acceptable within good manufacturing practice under SS 101.9(g)(6). In addition, the scientific data or other information should include the reason why you are unable to determine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in a serving of the finished product and a description of the process that you used to come to that conclusion.\n\nIngredients made primarily from sugar and created through non-enzymatic browning are added to some products for coloring and flavoring purposes (e.g. caramel color). After non-enzymatic browning occurs, the sugar is reduced in the ingredient. In such a case, how much sugar must be declared as added sugars on the label? If the remaining amount of the sugar contributed by an ingredient that undergoes non-enzymatic browning is detectable by testing in the finished product, you may declare that amount of sugar that is detectible by analytical testing in the finished product as the added sugars declaration. When such an ingredient is added to a product that contains other sugars that do not meet the definition of added sugars, you must make and keep records, which should include records of the results of the analytical testing that is used to demonstrate the amount of added sugars contributed by the ingredient in the finished product after non-enzymatic browning occurs, and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(v)(A)).\n\n20. If sugar is added for fermentation during the leavening process of a baked good and some of the sugars are consumed by yeast, should the reduction in the amount of sugars be accounted for the declaration of added sugars?\n\nAs described in our response to question 19, you may declare the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation. If you do so, you must make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information relied upon by the manufacturer that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(v)(A)).\n21. There is a chance that added sugars content prior to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation may be higher than the total sugars content of the finished food determined through chemical analysis. How do I approximate the added sugars value in this case?\n\nThe added sugars declaration should not exceed the total sugars declaration. In a case where sugars added prior to or during processing are reduced through non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation, and the manufacturer chooses to declare the amount of sugars added prior to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation, the added sugars declaration could conceivably exceed the amount of total sugars determined through chemical analysis. In such a case, you should declare the same amount for added sugars as the amount of total sugars obtained through analytical testing for a serving of the food.\n\nV Question and Answer on Format Issues\n\n1. What are the specifications for thickness of lines and leading (i.e., space between lines) on the Nutrition Facts label?\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(ii)(C) and (d)(1)(v) establish certain format requirements with respect to leading and the use of hairline rules.\n\nAdditionally, Appendix B to Part 101 in Title 21 provides examples of graphic enhancements (i.e., illustrations) that FDA uses. For more examples of graphic enhancements that FDA uses, please see our webpage at: https://www.fda.gov/media/99151/download.\n\nQuestion and Answer on the Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals\n\n1. What are the requirements (e.g. for rounding) for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals declared on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels? What does ""levels of significance"" mean in this context?\n\nWe require, under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii), that the quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals, excluding sodium, be the amount of the vitamin or mineral included in a serving of the product using the units of measurement and the levels of significance given in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) (which refers to the Reference Daily Intakes (RDI) table). However, zeros following decimal points may be dropped, and additional levels of significance may be used when the number of decimal places indicated is not sufficient to express lower amounts (e.g., the RDI for zinc is given in whole milligrams, but the quantitative amount may be declared in tenths of a milligram). This is consistent with the requirements for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the Supplement Facts label (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B)).\n\nIn addition, regarding conventional foods, quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals present at less than 2 percent of the RDI are not required to be declared on the Nutrition Facts label. However, they may be declared by a zero or by the use of an asterisk (or other symbol) that refers to another asterisk (or symbol) that is placed at the bottom of the table that is followed by the statement ""Contains less than 2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients)"" or ""Contains (<)2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients)."" Alternatively, if vitamin D, calcium, iron or potassium is present in amounts less than 2 percent of the RDI, label declaration of the nutrient(s) is not required if the statement ""Not a significant source of _(listing the vitamins or minerals omitted)"" is placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii)).\n\nRegarding dietary supplements, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium must be declared when they are present in a dietary supplement in quantitative amounts by weight that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling of foods in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c). (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAs for the phrase ""levels of significance,"" as used in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii) and 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and whether the phrase refers to statistical testing of hypotheses or mathematical concepts related to the degree of accuracy starting with the first nonzero digit, the phrase ""levels of significance"" refers to the degree of accuracy when rounding nutrients for purposes of declaring quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the label.\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c), provide specific rounding requirements for nutrients such as sodium. Before we issued the Nutrition Facts label final rule, sodium and potassium content was to be expressed as zero when the serving contained less than 5 milligrams (mg), to the nearest 5 mg increment when the serving contained less than or equal to 140 mg, and to the nearest 10 mg increment when the serving contained more than 140 mg.

These could be modified by other factors such as A through F above.\n\nExamples of ECG monitoring in late stage:\n\nThe thorough QT study results in a negative finding, as defined by the E14 criteria,4 at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapetic dose (relative to phase 3 dose) shows mean QTc effects between 10 and 20 ms. If there is reasonable assurance that the higher dose represents drug exposures that are unlikely to be seen in the patient population, only routine ECG monitoring is recommended in late phase trials. This approach provides reassurance for safety because patients are unlikely to experience a clinically significant QTc effect. Footnote 4: A negative study, as defined by the ICH E14 guidance criteria, is an upper one-sided 95% CI of QTc prolongation effect (<10) ms.\n\nThe thorough QT study results in a positive finding, as defined by the E14 criteria,5 at the therapeutic dose, with a mean prolongation (<20) ms. For drugs with this magnitude of effect on the QTc interval, intensive monitoring of phase 3 patients is called for. Footnote 5: Ibid.\n\nIntensive ECG monitoring in clinical trials has two main objectives. One objective is to provide protection to patients who might have large, worrisome QT intervals (>500) ms. A second objective is identifying the frequency of marked QT increases (e.g., prolonged QT (>500) ms or increases in QTc (>60) ms).\n\nGiven the limitations of collecting ECGs in late-stage trials, the focus of the analysis is on outliers, not on central tendency. Other than descriptive statistics, detailed statistical analysis is not expected. This monitoring is intended to be performed locally, without the involvement of a central core laboratory.\n\nThe timing of ECG collection should be based on the known properties of the drug. All patients should receive baseline, steady-state, and periodic ECGs during the trial. In addition, ECGs should be collected around T({}{\\text{max}}) at the first dose and/or around steady state in a subgroup of patients or in dedicated studies. ECG collection at around T({}{\\text{max}}) is not important for drugs with low fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations. If the drug shows a delayed effect in QT prolongation, then the timing of ECG collection should reflect this delay.\n3. The thorough QT study results in a negative finding, as defined by the E14 criteria,6 at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms. If supratherapeutic exposure is anticipated at the clinical dose only in a well-characterized subgroup, intensive monitoring as described in Example 2 above could be carried out in this subset of the phase 3 population. In this case, there should be reasonable assurance that the higher exposure is unlikely to be seen in the general patient population. In contrast, if people in the general patient population (who cannot be readily identified in advance) will in some cases achieve this higher exposure, intensive ECG monitoring in the phase 3 population is expected, as in Example 2. Footnote 6: Ibid.\n4. The therapeutic dose results in a mean QTc prolongation of (>20) ms. For drugs with large QTc prolongation effects, intensive ECG assessment would be appropriate in all patients in phase 2/3. Because of the risk of TdP, another important use of ECG monitoring in late phase trials would be to assess any risk mitigation strategies (e.g., electrolyte monitoring, dose reduction strategies). Additional ECG assessment over and above what is recommended earlier in this question and answer might also be called for (e.g., 24-hour ECG recording, telemetry, multiple trough ECGs through steady state).\n\nThe sponsor is encouraged to discuss these approaches with the relevant regulatory agency or agencies prior to initiation of the phase 3 program.\n\nS7b Questions and Answers\n\nIntegrated Risk Assessment (1)\n\nQ17. What is the general strategy for use of nonclinical information as part of an integrated risk assessment for delayed ventricular repolarization and torsade de pointes that can inform the design of clinical investigations and interpretation of their results? (1.1)\n\nThe ICH S7B guidance describes a nonclinical strategy for assessing risk of delayed ventricular repolarization and QT interval prolongation (section II.C (2.3)). A mechanistic understanding of the development of torsade de pointes (TdP) and the emergence of new types of assays have made it possible to obtain more information to assess TdP risk from nonclinical assays.\n\nThe in vitro IKr/hERG assay and in vivo QT assay as well as optional follow-up studies, as described in the ICH S7B guidance, are conducted for hazard identification and risk assessment relevant to delayed ventricular repolarization. It is generally accepted that drugs (note that the word ""drug(s)"" in the S7B Q&As is used interchangeably with word ""pharmaceutical(s)"" in the ICH S7B guidance) that delay ventricular repolarization may have increased risk of TdP.\n\nIn addition to supporting the planning and interpretation of First-in-Human clinical studies, nonclinical investigations can also contribute to an integrated risk assessment for TdP in later stages of development when clinical data are available. The following are points to consider when using in vitro IKr/hERG data and in vivo QT data in combination with clinical QT data as part of an integrated risk assessment for situations described in ICH E14 Q&As Q12 (5.1) and Q13 (6.1).\n\nTo predict whether or not the hERG block poses a risk of interfering with ventricular repolarization or TdP, evaluation of the hERG safety margin based on results of a best practice assay (see S7B Q&As Q18 (1.2) and Q19 (2.1)) is recommended. ICH S7A guidance, section II.F (2.6) describes considerations for when human metabolite(s) should be assessed with in vitro systems. In these cases, the metabolite\'s hERG safety margin should also be evaluated.\n\nIn the in vivo study, the effects on the QTc interval should be assessed at exposures that cover the anticipated high clinical exposure scenario. The adequacy of exposure to any major human metabolites should be determined (see ICH S7A guidance, sections II.C.3.b (2.3.3.2) and II.F (2.6), and S7B Q&A Q28 (3.5)). In addition, if the assay is to be used as part of an integrated clinical and nonclinical risk assessment for situations where a conventional thorough QT study is not feasible as described in ICH E14 Q&A Q13 (6.1), the in vivo study should have sufficient sensitivity to detect a QTc prolongation effect of a magnitude similar to dedicated clinical QT studies (see ICH S7B Q&A Q27 (3.4)). This additional consideration (sensitivity similar to dedicated clinical QT studies) does not apply to decision-making prior to First-in-Human studies or under ICH E14 Q&A Q12 (5.1).\n\nA drug with low TdP risk would be expected to have (1) a hERG safety margin higher than a threshold defined based on the safety margins computed under the same experimental protocol for a series of drugs known to cause TdP (see ICH S7B Q&A Q18 (1.2) for additional details); and (2) no QTc prolongation in an in vivo assay of sufficient sensitivity conducted at exposures of parent compound and major human metabolites that exceed clinical exposures. See ICH S7A guidance, section II.F (2.6) for considerations of human metabolite(s) in the in vitro or in vivo nonclinical assays. If these results are used to support an integrated clinical and nonclinical risk assessment strategy as described in ICH E14 Q&As Q12 (5.1) and Q13 (6.1), no additional nonclinical studies are needed. When there are factors that can confound or limit the interpretation of the nonclinical studies, such as metabolites and heart rate changes, follow-up studies as described in the ICH S7B guidance (section II.C.5 (2.3.5)) can be performed to address these specific issues.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the hERG assay and/or the in vivo QT study suggest an effect at clinical exposures, the drug has a risk of interfering with ventricular repolarization. Under this scenario, the drug\'s TdP risk could be affected by various other factors, such as blocking of additional repolarization currents (e.g., slow delayed rectifier potassium current [Iks]), blocking of inward currents (e.g., sodium and L-type calcium currents), effects on the trafficking of ion channel proteins from cytoplasmic sites to the surface membrane, metabolites with ion channel activities, and non-ion channel mediated QT prolongation. Follow-up studies (ICH S7B guidance, section II.C.5 (2.3.5)) could be performed to further explore the mechanisms and assess the TdP risk. If applicable, best practice considerations should be followed for assessment of additional ion channel currents (S7B Q&A Q19 (2.1)), in vitro cardiomyocyte assays (S7B Q&As Q20 (2.2) to Q23 (2.5)), or in vivo studies (S7B Q&As Q24 (3.1) to Q28 (3.5)). An appropriately qualified proarrhythmia risk prediction model (see S7B Q&As Q29 (4.1) to Q30 (4.2)) could be used according to its context of use to assess the possibility of TdP in humans. Use of in vitro and in silico models can reduce animal use in follow-up studies in accordance with the 3R (reduce/refine/replace) principles. The assessment of TdP risk using these follow-up studies, although optional, can be used together with other relevant nonclinical and clinical information to contribute to the design of subsequent clinical investigations and interpretation of their results.\n\n4.2.3 What is the recommended method to compute the hERG safety margin?

It is not the purpose of the thorough QT study to assess the risk of torsade de pointes (TdP) in the target population, but rather to determine whether further data are warranted to assess risk. A finding of QT prolongation above the regulatory threshold of interest (a positive thorough QT study) might call for further electrocardiographic follow-up in late phase studies. The extent of the follow-up would be affected by the magnitude of the estimated prolongation at doses and concentrations at which this occurs. If prolongation is substantial at concentrations expected to occur in clinical studies, it is important to protect patients in later trials and to obtain further information on the frequency of marked QT prolongation.

A second objective is identifying the frequency of marked QT increases (e.g., prolonged QT (>500) ms or increases in QTc (>60) ms).\n\nGiven the limitations of collecting ECGs in late stage trials, the focus of the analysis is on outliers, not on central tendency.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , What should be done if the thorough QT study results in a negative finding at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms?\n--------------------\nContext: Post-pubertal males have lower heart-rate corrected QT intervals than do pre-pubertal males or females generally. Women are generally smaller than men, so their exposure to a given fixed dose of a drug will generally be higher, and if a drug prolongs QT, it can be expected to prolong it more in women because of the higher exposure. It is not settled whether and how often there are sex differences in response to QT-prolonging drugs that are not explained by exposure alone.\n\nThe thorough QT study is primarily intended to act as a clinical pharmacology study in a healthy population using a conservative primary objective defining the drug\'s effect on QT. It is unlikely that any of a variety of baseline demographic parameters would introduce a large difference in QT response to a drug in subpopulations defined by factors such as age, co-morbidity, and gender that is not explained by exposure.\n\nIt is encouraged, but not mandatory, to include both men and women in the thorough QT study. Analyses of Concentration-Response Relationship by sex can be helpful for studying the effect of the drug on QT/QTc interval in cases where there is evidence or mechanistic theory for a gender difference. However, the primary analysis of a thorough QT study should be powered and conducted on the pooled population. If the primary analysis is negative and if there is no other evidence suggesting gender differences, subgroup analysis by sex is not expected.\n\nIII Positive control (3)\n\nThe ICH E14 guidance emphasizes the importance of assay sensitivity and recommends the use of a positive control. In order to accept a negative thorough QT/QTc study, assay sensitivity should be established in the study by use of a positive control with a known QT-prolonging effect. Please clarify how to assess the adequacy of the positive control in the thorough QT study. (3.1)\n\nThe positive control in a study is used to test the study\'s ability (its assay sensitivity ) to detect the study endpoint of interest, in this case QT prolongation by about 5 ms. If the study is able to detect such QT prolongation by the control, then a finding of no QT effect of that size for the test drug will constitute evidence that the test drug does not, in fact, prolong the QT interval by the amount of regulatory concern. There are two conditions required for ensuring such assay sensitivity:\n\nThe positive control should show a significant increase in QTc, i.e., the lower bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) must be above 0 ms. This shows that the trial is capable of detecting an increase in QTc, a conclusion that is essential to concluding that a negative finding for the test drug is meaningful.\n\nThe study should be able to detect an effect of about 5 ms (the QTc threshold of regulatory concern) if it is present. Therefore, the size of the effect of the positive control is of particular relevance. With this aim, there are at least two approaches: 1. To use a positive control showing an effect of greater than 5 ms (i.e., lower bound of a one-sided 95% CI (>) 5 ms). This approach has proven to be useful in many regulatory cases. However, if the positive control has too large an effect, the study\'s ability to detect a 5 ms QTc prolongation might be questioned. In this situation, the effect of the positive control could be examined at times other than the peak effect to determine whether an effect close to the threshold of regulatory concern can be detected. 2. To use a positive control with an effect close to 5 ms (point estimate of the maximum mean difference with placebo close to 5 ms, with a one-sided 95% CIlower bound (>0)). In using positive controls with smaller effects, it would be very important to have a reasonably precise estimate of the drug\'s usual effect.\n\nImportantly, whatever approach is used, the effect of the positive control (magnitude of peak and time course) should be reasonably similar to its usual effect. Data suggesting an underestimation of QTc might question the assay sensitivity, thus jeopardizing the interpretability of the thorough QT study results.\n\nPlease clarify the need for blinding the positive control in the thorough QT study. (3.2)\n\nThe use of a double-blinded positive control does not appear to be essential, provided that the reading of ECGs is performed in a blinded manner as described in Question Q2 (1.2), and the study is carefully designed to ensure that specified study procedures are followed uniformly. This means that the same protocol for administering the test drug and placebo, taking blood samples, and collecting the ECG data should also be used when giving the positive control. This does not mean that other aspects of the study, such as the duration of treatment with the positive control and the other treatment groups, would be identical. If blinding of the positive control is performed, common methods include the use of double-dummy techniques and over-encapsulation.\n\nIV Study design (4)\n\nIn the ICH E14 guidance, the recommended metric to analyze for a crossover study is the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period. Please discuss the most appropriate metric to assess a drug\'s effect on QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study (i.e., when there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient). (4.1)\n\nRegardless of the study design, ""the largest time-matched mean difference between drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted)"" is determined as follows: The mean QTc for the drug (i.e., averaged across the study population) is compared to the mean QTc for placebo (averaged across the study population) at each time point. The ""largest time-matched mean difference between drug and placebo"" is the largest of these differences at any time point.\n\nThe term ""baseline-adjusted"" in the ICH E14 guidance implies that the baseline data are taken into account in the statistical analysis.\n\nDifferences in baseline assessment between crossover and parallel design studies are discussed in Question Q11 (4.2).\n\nPlease discuss the need for baseline measurements, and when needed, how they should be collected, for cross-over and parallel design thorough QT studies. (4.2)Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAdjustment for baseline measurements is potentially useful for several purposes, including detection of carry-over effects, reducing the influence of inter-subject differences, and accounting for diurnal effects such as those due to food. There is no single best approach for baseline adjustment, but all planned baseline computations should be prospectively defined in the clinical trial protocol. Two kinds of baseline are commonly used: time-matched baseline (taken at exactly the same time-points on the day prior to the beginning of treatment as on the treatment day) and predose baseline (taken shortly prior to dosing). The predose baseline is used for adjustment for inter-subject differences but not for diurnal effects. The choice of baseline is influenced by whether the study is parallel or crossover.\n\nFor a parallel-group study, a time-matched baseline allows the detection of differences in diurnal patterns between subjects that would not be detected by a predose baseline. In a parallel study, a time-matched baseline day, if performed, would ideally occur on the day before the start of the study.\n\nIn contrast, in a crossover study, a time-matched baseline is usually not necessary because adjustments for subject- and study-specific diurnal variation are implicit by design in the assessment of time-matched drug-placebo differences in QT/QTc effect. The predose baseline, therefore, is usually adequate for crossover studies.\n\nObtaining replicate ECG measurements (for example, the average of the parameters from about 3 ECGs) within several minutes of each nominal time point at baseline and at subsequent times will increase the precision of the estimated changes in QT/QTc effect.\n\nV Use of Concentration Response Modeling of QTc Data (5)\n\nQ12. The ICH E14 guidance states (in section III (3), page 12) that analysis of the relationship between drug concentration and QT/QTc interval changes is under active investigation. Has this investigation yielded a reasonable approach to concentration-response modeling during drug development? How can assessment of the concentration-response relationship guide the interpretation of QTc data? (5.1)\n\nConcentration-response analysis, in which all available data across all doses are used to characterize the potential for a drug to influence QTc, can serve as an alternative to the by-time-point analysis or intersection-union test as the primary basis for decisions to classify the risk of a drug. In either case, this result is an important component of the totality of evidence assessment of the risk of QT prolongation. The overall assessment of risk of QT prolongation includes nonclinical data, the time course of QT prolongation, the magnitude of QT prolongation, categorical analyses of outliers, and certain adverse events in patients that can signal potential proarrhythmic effects.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs Questions and Answers (R3) Guidance for Industry'

It is not settled whether and how often there are sex differences in response to QT-prolonging drugs that are not explained by exposure alone.\n\nThe thorough QT study is primarily intended to act as a clinical pharmacology study in a healthy population using a conservative primary objective defining the drug\'s effect on QT. It is unlikely that any of a variety of baseline demographic parameters would introduce a large difference in QT response to a drug in subpopulations defined by factors such as age, co-morbidity, and gender that is not explained by exposure.\n\nIt is encouraged, but not mandatory, to include both men and women in the thorough QT study. Analyses of Concentration-Response Relationship by sex can be helpful for studying the effect of the drug on QT/QTc interval in cases where there is evidence or mechanistic theory for a gender difference. However, the primary analysis of a thorough QT study should be powered and conducted on the pooled population. If the primary analysis is negative and if there is no other evidence suggesting gender differences, subgroup analysis by sex is not expected.\n\nIII Positive control (3)\n\nThe ICH E14 guidance emphasizes the importance of assay sensitivity and recommends the use of a positive control. In order to accept a negative thorough QT/QTc study, assay sensitivity should be established in the study by use of a positive control with a known QT-prolonging effect. Please clarify how to assess the adequacy of the positive control in the thorough QT study. (3.1)\n\nThe positive control in a study is used to test the study\'s ability (its assay sensitivity ) to detect the study endpoint of interest, in this case QT prolongation by about 5 ms. If the study is able to detect such QT prolongation by the control, then a finding of no QT effect of that size for the test drug will constitute evidence that the test drug does not, in fact, prolong the QT interval by the amount of regulatory concern. There are two conditions required for ensuring such assay sensitivity:\n\nThe positive control should show a significant increase in QTc, i.e., the lower bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) must be above 0 ms. This shows that the trial is capable of detecting an increase in QTc, a conclusion that is essential to concluding that a negative finding for the test drug is meaningful.\n\nThe study should be able to detect an effect of about 5 ms (the QTc threshold of regulatory concern) if it is present. Therefore, the size of the effect of the positive control is of particular relevance. With this aim, there are at least two approaches: 1. To use a positive control showing an effect of greater than 5 ms (i.e., lower bound of a one-sided 95% CI (>) 5 ms). This approach has proven to be useful in many regulatory cases. However, if the positive control has too large an effect, the study\'s ability to detect a 5 ms QTc prolongation might be questioned. In this situation, the effect of the positive control could be examined at times other than the peak effect to determine whether an effect close to the threshold of regulatory concern can be detected. 2. To use a positive control with an effect close to 5 ms (point estimate of the maximum mean difference with placebo close to 5 ms, with a one-sided 95% CIlower bound (>0)). In using positive controls with smaller effects, it would be very important to have a reasonably precise estimate of the drug\'s usual effect.\n\nImportantly, whatever approach is used, the effect of the positive control (magnitude of peak and time course) should be reasonably similar to its usual effect. Data suggesting an underestimation of QTc might question the assay sensitivity, thus jeopardizing the interpretability of the thorough QT study results.\n\nPlease clarify the need for blinding the positive control in the thorough QT study. (3.2)\n\nThe use of a double-blinded positive control does not appear to be essential, provided that the reading of ECGs is performed in a blinded manner as described in Question Q2 (1.2), and the study is carefully designed to ensure that specified study procedures are followed uniformly. This means that the same protocol for administering the test drug and placebo, taking blood samples, and collecting the ECG data should also be used when giving the positive control. This does not mean that other aspects of the study, such as the duration of treatment with the positive control and the other treatment groups, would be identical. If blinding of the positive control is performed, common methods include the use of double-dummy techniques and over-encapsulation.\n\nIV Study design (4)\n\nIn the ICH E14 guidance, the recommended metric to analyze for a crossover study is the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period. Please discuss the most appropriate metric to assess a drug\'s effect on QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study (i.e., when there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient). (4.1)\n\nRegardless of the study design, ""the largest time-matched mean difference between drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted)"" is determined as follows: The mean QTc for the drug (i.e., averaged across the study population) is compared to the mean QTc for placebo (averaged across the study population) at each time point. The ""largest time-matched mean difference between drug and placebo"" is the largest of these differences at any time point.\n\nThe term ""baseline-adjusted"" in the ICH E14 guidance implies that the baseline data are taken into account in the statistical analysis.\n\nDifferences in baseline assessment between crossover and parallel design studies are discussed in Question Q11 (4.2).\n\nPlease discuss the need for baseline measurements, and when needed, how they should be collected, for cross-over and parallel design thorough QT studies. (4.2)Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAdjustment for baseline measurements is potentially useful for several purposes, including detection of carry-over effects, reducing the influence of inter-subject differences, and accounting for diurnal effects such as those due to food. There is no single best approach for baseline adjustment, but all planned baseline computations should be prospectively defined in the clinical trial protocol. Two kinds of baseline are commonly used: time-matched baseline (taken at exactly the same time-points on the day prior to the beginning of treatment as on the treatment day) and predose baseline (taken shortly prior to dosing). The predose baseline is used for adjustment for inter-subject differences but not for diurnal effects. The choice of baseline is influenced by whether the study is parallel or crossover.\n\nFor a parallel-group study, a time-matched baseline allows the detection of differences in diurnal patterns between subjects that would not be detected by a predose baseline. In a parallel study, a time-matched baseline day, if performed, would ideally occur on the day before the start of the study.\n\nIn contrast, in a crossover study, a time-matched baseline is usually not necessary because adjustments for subject- and study-specific diurnal variation are implicit by design in the assessment of time-matched drug-placebo differences in QT/QTc effect. The predose baseline, therefore, is usually adequate for crossover studies.\n\nObtaining replicate ECG measurements (for example, the average of the parameters from about 3 ECGs) within several minutes of each nominal time point at baseline and at subsequent times will increase the precision of the estimated changes in QT/QTc effect.\n\nV Use of Concentration Response Modeling of QTc Data (5)\n\nQ12. The ICH E14 guidance states (in section III (3), page 12) that analysis of the relationship between drug concentration and QT/QTc interval changes is under active investigation. Has this investigation yielded a reasonable approach to concentration-response modeling during drug development? How can assessment of the concentration-response relationship guide the interpretation of QTc data? (5.1)\n\nConcentration-response analysis, in which all available data across all doses are used to characterize the potential for a drug to influence QTc, can serve as an alternative to the by-time-point analysis or intersection-union test as the primary basis for decisions to classify the risk of a drug. In either case, this result is an important component of the totality of evidence assessment of the risk of QT prolongation. The overall assessment of risk of QT prolongation includes nonclinical data, the time course of QT prolongation, the magnitude of QT prolongation, categorical analyses of outliers, and certain adverse events in patients that can signal potential proarrhythmic effects.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs - Questions and Answers (R1)'

While increases in QT/QTc to >500 ms or of >60 ms over baseline are commonly used as thresholds forpotential discontinuation, the exact criteria chosen for a given trial will depend on the risk-tolerance level considered appropriate for the indication and patient group in question.\n\nThe Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nThe 'thorough QT/QTc study' is intended to determine whether the drug has a threshold pharmacologic effect on cardiac repolarization, as detected by QT/QTc prolongation. The threshold level of regulatory concern, discussed further below, is around 5 ms as evidenced by an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval around the mean effect on QTc of 10 ms. The study is typically carried out in healthy volunteers (as opposed to individuals at increased risk of arrhythmias) and is used to determine whether or not the effect of a drug on the QT/QTc interval in target patient populations should be studied intensively during later stages of drug development. It is not intended to identify drugs as being pro-arrhythmic. Although data are limited, it is not expected that the results of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' would be affected by ethnic factors.\n\nThe 'thorough QT/QTc study' would typically be conducted early in clinical development to provide maximum guidance for later trials, although the precise timing will depend on the specifics of the drug under development. It would usually not be the first study, as it is important to have basic clinical data for its design and conduct, including tolerability and pharmacokinetics. Some drugs might not be suitable for study in healthy volunteers because of issues related to tolerability (e.g., neuroleptic agents, chemotherapeutics).\n\nThe results of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' will influence the amount of information collected in later stages of development:\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline""]","['If supratherapeutic exposure is anticipated at the clinical dose only in a well-characterized subgroup, intensive monitoring as described in Example 2 above could becarried out in this subset of the phase 3 population.

(3.1)","['--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.1)\n--------------------\nContext: In the context of ICH M7(R2), (quantitative) structure-activity relationships ((Q)SARs) are considered an appropriate initial evaluation of mutagenic potential of an impurity at a daily dose of less than or equal to 1 mg. When a structural alert is identified, a follow-up in vitro evaluation (e.g., bacterial reverse mutation assay) could be conducted, or the impurity could be controlled by threshold of toxicological concern (TTC). Negative results in either evaluation would classify the impurity under Class 5. The result of the bacterial reverse mutation assay overrules the (Q)SAR prediction.\n\nAdditionally, impurities should not be assigned to Class 5 based solely on the absence of structural alerts by visual evaluation alone. There is an expectation that structural alert assessment will be conducted using (Q)SAR prediction.\n\nQ3. What are the expectations for evaluation of the genotoxic potential for an impurity where the amount of impurity exceeds 1 mg daily dose? (1.3)\n\nIn the context of Note 1 of ICH M7(R2), 1 mg refers to an absolute amount of an impurity, irrespective of the identification or qualification thresholds outlined in ICH Q3A and Q3B(R2).\n\nIn cases where the amount of impurity is less than 1 mg daily dose for chronic administration, and an impurity generated negative predictions in two appropriate (Q)SAR systems, a minimum screen of genotoxicity studies (point mutation and chromosomal aberration) could be considered.\n\nQ4.: If an impurity generates negative predictions in two appropriate (Q)SAR systems and is present at a level less than or equal to 1 mg daily dose, is further genetic toxicity testing warranted? (1.4)\n\nNo. If an impurity generates negative predictions in two appropriate (Q)SAR systems and is present at a level less than or equal to 1 mg/day, further genetic toxicity testing is not warranted.\n\nII SCOPE OF GUIDANCE (2)\n\nQ5.: Are semisynthetic drug substances and drug products included in the scope of ICH M7(R2)? (2.1)\n\nYes, for certain cases. If a semisynthetic drug substance, as defined in the ICH guidance for industry Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances (November 2012), is manufactured using steps that could introduce mutagenic impurities or degradation products (e.g., postmodification of a fermentation product, late-stage introduction of a linker), a risk assessment is warranted.\n\nThe following compounds used in the manufacturing process of semisynthetic drug substances and drug products should be considered within the scope of the application of ICH M7(R2):\n\nChemically synthesized intermediates and actual impurities therein\n\nReagents\n\nIII GENERAL PRINCIPLES (3)\n\nQ6.: Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.1)\n\nNo. Carcinogens that are negative in the bacterial reverse mutation assay do not have a DNA reactive mechanism of carcinogenicity and, therefore, are not in the scope of ICH M7(R2) (e.g., acetamide, hydroxylamine).\n\nQ7.: Should mutagenic, noncarcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.2)\n\nNo. Mutagens that are demonstrated to be noncarcinogenic in appropriate and well-conducted animal bioassays will be classified as Class 5 impurities.\n\nIV Considerations for Marketed Products (4)\n\nWhat does ""significant increase in clinical dose"" mean in section IV.C., Changes to the Clinical Use of the Marketed Products, (4.3)? (4.1)\n\nAny increase in dose of the active pharmaceutical ingredient that would increase any mutagenic impurity to levels above the acceptable limits is considered significant (see Tables 2 and 3 in ICH M7(R2) and the ICH guidance for industry M7(R2) Addendum: Application of the Principles of the ICH M7 Guidance to Calculation of Compound-Specific Acceptable Intakes (July 2023)).\n\nIn such cases a reevaluation of the mutagenic impurity limits is recommended.\n\nV DRUG SUBSTANCE AND DRUG PRODUT IMPURITY ASSESSMENT (5)\n\nNo Q&A drafted on this section. (5.1)\n\nVI HAZARD ASSESSMENT ELEMENTS (6)\n\nWhat information and/or documentation should be provided to regulatory agencies to sufficiently demonstrate validation of (Q)SAR models that are developed in-house or are not commonly used? (6.1)\n\nSection VI (6) of ICH M7(R2) states that ""(Q)SAR models utilizing these prediction methodologies should follow the general validation principles set forth by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)"" (OECD Validation 2007).\n\nIn the context of ICH M7(R2), the OECD principles of (Q)SAR validation are:\n\nA defined endpoint -- The model should be trained using experimental data generated according to the standard OECD protocol for the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay.\n\nAn unambiguous algorithm -- The algorithm used to construct the model should be disclosed. It should be clear whether the model is considered statistical (constructed via machine learning) or expert rule based (created from human expert-derived knowledge).\n\nA defined domain of applicability -- It should be described whether a test chemical falls within the model\'s applicability domain and how the applicability domain is calculated. The user should be warned when the model does not have enough information to make a reliable prediction on a chemical.\n\nAppropriate measures of goodness-of-fit, robustness, and predictivity -- The model should be evaluated and shown to be sufficiently predictive of bacterial reverse mutagenicity. Standard validation techniques that should be used are recall, crossvalidation, and external validation. Evidence that the model has not been over-fit should also be provided.\n\nA mechanistic interpretation -- Is there adequate information to allow an assessment of mechanistic relevance to be made (e.g., specific descriptors)?\n\nFor any system as a minimum recommendation to demonstrate how each model follows these principles and to understand how a (Q)SAR model was developed and validated, the sponsor is expected to provide the OECD (Q)SAR Model Reporting Format (QMRF) (OECD QMRF 2017) on request by the regulatory agency. This template summarizes and reports key information on (Q)SAR models, including the results of any validation studies as well as provides supplementary information on applicability of the model to a given chemical. Agencies may request this information depending on the experience of the specific agency with the specific models.\n\nQ11. When an out-of-domain or noncoverage result is obtained from one of the two (Q)SAR models as described in ICH M7(R2), can the impurity be classified as a Class 5 impurity? (6.2)\n\nNo, an out-of-domain or noncoverage result from one of the two (Q)SAR models warrants additional assessment to classify the compound as a Class 5 impurity.\n\nGiven that the relationship between chemical structure and DNA reactivity is well understood, it is unlikely that a structure with mutagenic potential would be associated with an out-of-domain result. However, expert review can provide reassurance in assignment of such impurities to Class 5.\n\nExpert review may include one or a combination of the following (Amberg et. al. 2019):\n\nComparison to structurally similar analogs for which bacterial reverse mutation assay data are available (read-across approach).\n\nExpert review of the chemical structure to determine if there is potential for the chemical to react with DNA.\n\n(Q)SAR output from an additional validated model (see Question Q10 (6.1)) of the same methodology (i.e., expert rule based or statistical) that generates a prediction that is within its applicability domain.\n\nIn a case where an impurity is demonstrated to be negative in an Ames test but positive in a clastogenicity study (e.g., chromosomal aberration test), how would the impurity be classified per ICH M7(R2) classification system? (6.3)\n\nIf an impurity tests negative in an Ames assay, it is considered a Class 5 impurity. Addressing positive results in a clastogenicity assay is out of the scope of ICH M7(R2).\n\nPlease clarify the rationale for the tests included under Note 3 as a follow-up to investigate the in vivo relevance of in vitro mutagens. (6.4)\n\nIf an impurity is positive in the Ames test, and levels of the impurity cannot be controlled to an appropriate acceptable limit, an in vivo follow-up test with mutagenic endpoint (mutagenicity) should be used. The other follow-up tests outlined in Note 3 are also acceptable when scientific rationale (as indicated in Note 3) is provided to support their uses.\n\nFor any of the above tests, adequate exposure should be demonstrated in line with the ICH guidance for industry S2(R1) Genotoxicity Testing and Data Interpretation for Pharmaceuticals Intended for Human Use (June 2012).\n\nVII Risk Characterization (7)\n\nIf an Ames positive impurity is subsequently tested in an appropriate in vivo assay and the results are negative, is that sufficient to demonstrate lack of in vivo relevance? (7.1)\n\nYes. A well-conducted and scientifically justified in vivo study (see Question Q13 (6.4) in this document) is sufficient to demonstrate lack of in vivo relevance. If the results of the in vivo study are negative, the impurity can be assigned to ICH M7(R2) Class 5.\n\nIf an Ames positive impurity cannot be controlled to an acceptable limit and is subsequently tested in an appropriate in vivo assay and the results are positive, does that support setting compound-specific impurity limits? (7.2)\n\nWhen a mutagenic impurity cannot be controlled to the TTC (or less than lifetime (LTL) based limit), results from an appropriate in vivo assay could complement the available data for a weight of evidence approach to support a higher limit on a case-by-case basis. However, in vivo gene mutation assays alone are currently not validated to directly assess cancer risk because the endpoint is mutation and not carcinogenicity (i.e., they are used for hazard identification).\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk Guidance for Industry'

However, ICH M7 does not provide specific guidance on how mutagenic impurity assessment can be used to justify selection of appropriate starting materials. This Q&A addresses the application of the principles in ICH M7 to the selection and justification of starting materials, based on the ICH Q11 concept of impact to the impurity profile of the drug substance.\n\nThis Q&A is not intended for the types of drug substances and indications for which ICH M7 does not apply (e.g., genotoxic drug substances, advanced cancer indications per ICH S9).\n\n[5.10] Do all steps that involve mutagenic reagents, impurities, or establish people- or stereochemical configurations, need to be included in the process description in Section 3.2.S.2.2.

These steps should normally also be included in Section 3.2.S.2.2 if:\n\n[5.16] They need to be carefully controlled (e.g., within narrow parameter ranges) to prevent generation of impurities that would otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance.\n\n[5.17] They include a unit operation that has been added to the manufacturing process to control specific impurities that would otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. While starting material manufacturing processes typically contain purification operations, addition of purification steps prior to a proposed starting material in order to avoid defining an earlier, upstream compound as the starting material would not be considered appropriate.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11_Q&As_Q&As'

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.1)\n--------------------\nContext: For mutagenic impurities introduced or generated in the last synthetic step, given the proximity to the final product, Option 1 control approach is preferred. However, Option 2 and Option 3 control approaches may be possible when appropriately justified. The control strategy may be influenced by the presence of a subsequent recrystallization step, a highly effective purification operation (e.g., chromatography, well-defined crystallization), the reactivity (e.g., highly reactive reagents such as thionyl chloride) and physical characteristics of the impurity (e.g., low boiling point such as methyl chloride), and the availability of data (analytical data supporting the purge assessment). In most cases, for mutagenic impurities introduced or generated in the last synthetic step, the justification of an Option 4 control approach solely based on prediction is not sufficient and supporting analytical data should be provided (see Question Q19 (8.1)).\n\nIs periodic verification testing (i.e., skip testing) allowed for Option 2 and Option 3 control approaches? (8.4)\n\nNo. Periodic verification testing is not appropriate for Option 2 and Option 3 control approaches. In ICH M7(R2) section VIII.A (8.1), periodic verification testing is only discussed as a control strategy when using Option 1 control approach.\n\nThe Option 1 periodic verification testing strategy references the ICH guidance for industry Q6A Specifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Chemical Substances (ICH Q6A) (December 2000). The Option 1 periodic verification testing concept (per ICH Q6A) should generally be implemented after approval and applies to testing in the final drug substance.\n\nIf batch analysis data on the drug substance for a mutagenic impurity is consistently less than 30 percent TTC or AI in multiple batches, is that sufficient to justify no specification of that impurity in the control strategy? (8.5)\n\nNo. Batch data alone demonstrating that a mutagenic impurity is consistently less than 30 percent TTC or AI is not sufficient to apply an Option 4 control strategy.\n\nHowever, if there is negligible risk of the impurity to be present in the drug substance, an Option 4 control strategy may be considered with appropriate justification. See Questions Q19 and Q20 (8.1 and 8.2) for recommendations on supporting an Option 4 control strategy.\n\nWhat scale considerations are relevant when generating analytical data in support of control Options 3 and 4? (8.6)\n\nLab scale experiments are typically sufficient when generating measured purge factors or when defining in-process control points. These studies should employ conditions representative of the final process as described in the application and should consider the potential impact of scale and equipment-related differences between the laboratory and production environment (e.g., the effects of mixing on impurity levels in heterogeneous systems, the quality of liquid-liquid phase separations). In the case of observed scale dependencies, confirmatory testing on batches manufactured at pilot or commercial scale may be advisable. There is no expectation to perform spiking studies at pilot or commercial scale.\n\nIX Documentation (9)\n\nIf (Q)SAR predictions are made during drug development, should they be repeated for the marketing application? (9.1)*\n\n(Q)SAR models developed for use under ICH M7(R2) are generally updated regularly with new bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay data and more refined structural alerts. A Sponsor is not expected to update its (Q)SAR assessment during drug development unless there is a safety concern such as when newly available bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay data and/or mechanistic knowledge suggest that the prediction is incorrect. As an example, in cases where there is reason to question the outcome of a negative prediction (e.g., an aromatic amine is present, but the model gave a negative prediction), a reassessment is recommended. It is recommended that the sponsor rerun (Q)SAR predictions before the initial marketing application to ensure predictions reflect the most current data available. If the marketing application is later submitted in other regulatory jurisdictions, reassessment may be considered. Reassessment may also be considered if the predictions made for the initial global marketing application did not use a recent version of the software.\n\nIn general, predictions generated with models developed before ICH M7's publication in 2014 are considered unacceptable.\n\nFor marketing applications, what content and common technical document (CTD) placement recommendations could improve the clarity of an ICH M7(R2) risk assessment and control strategy? (9.2)*\n\nIn Module 2, a brief summary of the ICH M7(R2) risk assessment and control strategy should be included (sections 2.3 and 2.6).\n\nIn Module 3, the ICH M7(R2) risk assessment and control strategy should be provided in detail. This type of information is recommended to be placed in the CTD locations per the ICH guidances for industry M4Q: The CTD -- Quality (August 2001) and related M4: The CTD -- Quality: Questions and Answers/Location Issues (June 2004)(e.g., 3.2.S.3.2 Impurities or 3.2.S.4.5 Justification of Specification for drug substance; 3.2.P.5.5 Characterization of Impurities or 3.2.P.5.6 Justification of Specification for drug product). A table summary of the ICH M7(R2) hazard assessment and ICH M7(R2) impurity control strategy is recommended to improve clarity.\n\nInformation recommended for an ICH M7(R2) hazard assessment table includes impurity chemical structure, individual (Q)SAR results (positive/negative predictions, out of domain), bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay results (positive/negative, if available),ICH M7(R2) impurity class (1 to 5) assignment, and supporting information (e.g., information/links for bacterial reverse mutagenicity assays, literature reports, (Q)SAR expert analysis). The in silico systems used (name, version, endpoint) can also be noted.\n\nInformation recommended for an ICH M7(R2) impurity control strategy table includes impurity origin (e.g., synthetic step introduced, degradant), ICH M7(R2) class, purge factors (e.g., measured or predicted), ICH M7(R2) control option (1 to 4), control strategy (i.e., including in-process or compound testing rationale), and supporting information (e.g., information/links for justifications, calculations). The maximum daily dose, TTC, and proposed duration of treatment can also be noted.\n\nAdditionally, it is recommended that compound code names be cross-referenced, if Module 3 and Module 4 (including toxicity study reports) use different compound naming conventions.\n\nIn Module 4, full safety study-related information on impurities (e.g., bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay reports, (Q)SAR reports, other genotoxicity test reports, additional testing) should be included to support the risk assessment and control strategy. This information is often placed in section 4.2.3.7.6 Impurities (see the ICH guidance for industry M4S: The CTD -- Safety(August 2001) for additional information) and can be cross-referenced to Module 3 by hyperlinks.\n\nX Illustrative Examples (10)\n\nNo Q&A drafted on this section.\n\nXI Glossary (11)\n\nNo Q&A drafted on this section.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]\n\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidance Documents\n\nOECD Validation, 2007, Test No. 69: Guidance Document on the Validation of (Quantitative) Structure-Activity Relationship ((Q)SAR) Models (available at\n\nhttp://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf?cote=env/jm/mono(2007)2&doclang usage=en)\n\nOECD (Q)SAR Model Reporting Format (QMRF), 2017, Joint Research Center QSAR Model Database: User Support and Tutorial (available at\n\nhttps://publications.irc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC107491/kina28713enn.pdf)\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk Guidance for Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.1)\n--------------------\nContext: Mutagenic substances that are impurities in commercially available chemicals or synthetic intermediates, or that are formed as the result of side reactions during the synthesis, could also be present in the drug substance at levels relevant to safety. However, such mutagenic impurities and by-products are usually present at much lower concentrations than reagents, solvents, and intermediates. Therefore, the risk that such impurities will carry over significantly into the drug substance from early reaction steps is lower than for reagents, solvents, or intermediates from the same steps. The applicant should use risk-based reasoning to determine which steps to include in the hazard assessment for this category of potential impurity, and include a discussion of the risk assessment when identifying the point in the synthesis where these impurities and by-products are included in the assessment.\n\nInformation collected during the evaluation of potential mutagenic impurities can be submitted in an application and could be valuable for multiple purposes. For example, the justification for a proposed starting material should include information demonstrating that none of the steps immediately upstream (i.e., earlier in the synthesis) of the proposed starting material impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. Also, the suitability of the proposed control strategy can be supported with information about any mutagenic impurities formed or purged in the manufacturing steps between the proposed starting material and the drug substance, or that are controlled in the specification of the proposed starting material. The ICH Q11 exception for impurities that ""persist"" is also applicable to mutagenic impurities (see Q&A 5.8). In addition, steps involving mutagenic reagents or impurities may be upstream of the starting material if they do not impact the impurity profile of the drug substance (see Q&A 5.10).\n\nThe approaches outlined in this Q&A are consistent with the principles in ICH M7 concerning hazard assessment, risk characterisation of mutagenic impurities, and their control. However, ICH M7 does not provide specific guidance on how mutagenic impurity assessment can be used to justify selection of appropriate starting materials. This Q&A addresses the application of the principles in ICH M7 to the selection and justification of starting materials, based on the ICH Q11 concept of impact to the impurity profile of the drug substance.\n\nThis Q&A is not intended for the types of drug substances and indications for which ICH M7 does not apply (e.g., genotoxic drug substances, advanced cancer indications per ICH S9).\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11_Q&As_Q&As']","['No. Carcinogens that are negative in the bacterial reverse mutation assay do not have a DNA reactive mechanism of carcinogenicity and, therefore, are not in the scope of ICH M7(R2) (e.g., acetamide, hydroxylamine).']",0.9999999999,0.3333333333333333
11,"When considering the information from ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , Are scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?","['--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , Are scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n--------------------\nContext: In cases where an intermediate bulk material is identical between the various strengths (dose proportional blends, bulk solutions, etc.), is it sufficient to perform stability on one lot of each strength, when each strength is produced from a separate intermediate bulk?\n\nNo. For ANDAs that contain multiple strengths (that are dose proportional), three separate intermediate bulk granulations (or blends) should be manufactured. One batch of bulk granulation (or blend) should be used to manufacture all the strengths proposed. The other two bulk granulations (or blends) can be used to manufacture only the lowest and the highest strengths, in addition to the strength used in BE studies (i.e., the strength(s) tested in the BE studies should have three batches). Stability testing should still use all three batches of drug product.\n\nAre differences in the capsule shell (i.e., imprint, color, size, etc.), allowed in cases where a multi-strength capsule product is dose-proportional across all strengths (based on common bead blend)?\n\nYes differences in the capsule shell are allowed in the described case.\n\nWhat are the criteria for an exception to the recommendations regarding minimum size for pilot scale for ANDA submission batches? What justification would be needed if we wanted to deviate from these guidance recommendations?\n\nThe submission ANDA batches can have a smaller size than the established pilot scale, according to the ICH definition, when any one of the following circumstances prevails:\n\nThe reference listed drug product has an orphan drug designation.\n\nUse of a controlled drug substance is based on a Drug Enforcement Administration allocation.\n\nThe test batch size is the same as the commercial batch size with the commitment that a prior approval supplement (PAS) will be provided when there is a scale-up.\n\nAre scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n\nNo. The three ANDA submission batches should maintain the chosen formula based on product development studies for components and composition.\n\nCan FDA provide specific examples of cases where statistical analysis is required and the type of statistical analysis needed?\n\nThe FDA stability guidance recommends analysis of data in accordance with ICH Q1E, Appendix A. The flowchart in that guidance provides clear situations where analysis is normally recommended or unnecessary. In addition, ICH Q1E B.7 figures provide example diagrams for assay and degradation products that illustrate how plots should be generated for the three batches using regression lines and upper and lower confidence limits.\n\nHow many batches of drug product should be tested for split-portions of scored tablets?\n\nIn general, one batch testing for each scored strength on the split tablets will suffice, as recommended in the guidance for industry, _Tablet Scoring: Nomenclature, Labeling, and Data for Evaluation.19 Footnote 19: See footnote 2.\n\nFor drug products that include placebo tablets, how many batches (of placebo tablets) are required for submission? Is 6 months of stability data on the placebo tablets needed if the ANDA is submitted after the June 2014 deadline?\n\nOne batch of placebo tablets with full CMC information should be included at the time of ANDA submission; however, the final packaging presentation (containing the placebo tablets) should have data from accelerated and long-term stability testing. Six months of accelerated and long-term stability data are recommended for the entire packaging presentation including placebo tablets, where applicable, at the time of submission.\n\nAppendix D Amendments to Pending ANDA Application\n\nWhat are the recommendations for amendments and responses filed to pending ANDAs after issuance of the final FDA stability guidance?__Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA1: All amendments submitted to pending ANDAs after the effective date of the final FDA stability guidance will be held to the standards in place concerning stability data at the time of the original ANDA submission, unless there is a concern with the submitted stability data.\n\nStability Studies\n\nWhat will be the expected testing time points on accelerated conditions?\n\nA1: The applicant should test at 0 (initial release), 3, and 6 months; for additional time points on accelerated conditions, please follow ICH Q1A(R2) recommendations for all ANDAs.20\n\nFootnote 20: This recommendation also applies to nasal spray, inhalation solution, suspension, aerosols, and liposomal drug products.\n\nCan the Agency clarify expectations for the storage positions for products placed into the stability program?\n\nA2: For primary batches of liquids, solutions, semi-solids, and suspensions, the product should be placed into an inverted (or horizontal) position and an upright (or vertical) position. For routine stability studies, the applicant should pick the worst case orientation for the study.\n\nWhen and how are reconstitution/dilution studies performed?\n\nA3: Recommendations listed in ICH Q1A(R2), section II, B, 7, Storage Conditions (2.2.7) should be followed for all three batches. These studies should be performed when the drug product is labeled for reconstitution or dilution.\n\nWhat types of containers are classified as semipermeable containers, and can the Agency clarify the stability expectations for the drug products in semipermeable containers?\n\nA4: Examples of semipermeable containers are provided in the ICH Q1A(R2) glossary. The recommendations for stability expectations for semipermeable containers are detailed in ICH Q1A(R2) section II, B, 7, c. Drug products packaged in semipermeable containers (2.2.7.3).\n\nCan the Agency clarify expectations around the number of batches to support tests such as preservative effectiveness and extractable leachable testing?\n\nA5: One of the primary batches of the drug product should be tested for antimicrobial preservative effectiveness (in addition to preservative content) at the end of the proposed shelf life. The drug product specification should include a test for preservative content, and this attribute should be tested in all stability studies. Extraction/leachable studies are generally one-time studies; however, if multiple types of containers/closures are employed for packaging, then additional studies could be recommended. Q6: When are in-use stability studies needed? A6: Please refer to response A3 under section E, Stability Studies. Q7: Are there changes to postapproval protocols and commitments when ICH stability guidances are implemented because of scale or type of batches submitted? A7: ICH Q1A(R2), section II, B, 8, Stability Commitment (2.2.8) addresses this question. Section 2.1.8 provides information regarding stability commitment for drug substances. Also, ANDAs and DMFs should include a commitment to place one batch of drug product and drug substance, respectively, into the annual long-term stability program, and to provide stability data in the annual reports.\n--------------------\nContext title: ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products, Questions and Answers'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , Are scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n--------------------\nContext: Significant body of information not available: Three batches with three months' accelerated stability data reported in prior approval supplement and long-term stability data of first three production batches reported in annual report. b. Dissolution documentation Extended release: In addition to application/compential release requirements, a multipoint dissolution profile should be obtained using the application/compential test conditions for the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product). Adequate sampling should be performed, for example, at 1, 2, and 4 hours and every two hours thereafter, until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached. Delayed release: In addition to application/compential release requirements, a multipoint dissolution profile should be obtained during the buffer stage of testing using the application/compential test conditions for the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product). Adequate sampling should be performed, for example at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 minutes (following the time from which the dosage form is placed in the buffer) until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached. c. Bioequivalence documentation A single-dose bioequivalence study [(3)]. The bioequivalence study may be waived in the presence of an established in vitro/in vivo correlation [(6)].\n3. Filing Documentation Prior approval supplement (all information including accelerated stability data); annual report (long-term stability data).\n\n4 Components and Composition -- Release Controlling Excipient\n\nThis section of the guidance focuses on changes in release controlling excipients in the drug product. For modified release solid oral dosage forms, consideration should be given as to whether or not the excipient is critical to drug release. The sponsor should provide appropriate justifications (i.e., mechanism of drug release and manufacturing process) for claiming any excipient(s) as a release controlling excipient in the formulation of the modified release solid oral dosage form. The functionality of each excipient should be identified. Changes in the amount of the drug substance are not addressed by this guidance. Changes exceeding the ranges defined in each of the levels below may be allowed if considered to be within normal batch-to-batch variation and contained within an approved original application. In such situations, sponsors should contact the appropriate CDER review division for further guidance.\n\nA. Level 1 Change\n\nDefinition of Level\n\nLevel 1 changes are those that are unlikely to have any detectable impact on formulation quality and performance.\n\nExample:\n\nChanges in the release controlling excipient(s), expressed as percentage (w/w) of total release controlling excipient(s) in the formulation less than or equal to 5% w/w of total release controlling excipient content in the modified release solid oral dosage form.\n\nThe drug substance in the product is formulated to 100% of label/potency. The total additive effect of all release controlling excipient changes should not be more than 5% w/w of the total release controlling excipients in the original approved formulation.4 The total weight of the dosage form should still be within the approved original application range.\n\nFootnote 4: Example: In a product consisting of active ingredient A, ethylcellulose and a plasticizer, the ethylcellulose and plasticizer content should not vary by more than an absolute total of 5% w/w of the total release controlling excipients (e.g., ethylcellulose content increases by 2.5% and plasticizer content increases by 2.5%) relative to the original approved total release controlling excipient content weight in the modified release solid oral dosage form if it is to stay within the given range allowed for level 1.\n\nThe components (active and excipients) in the formulation should have numerical targets that represent the nominal composition of the product on which any future changes in the composition of the product are to be based. Allowable changes in the composition should be based on the original approved target composition and not on previous level 1 changes in the composition. For products approved with only a range for excipients, the target value may be assumed to be the midpoint of the original approved application range.\n\nTest Documentation\n\na.

Dissolution documentation\n\nNone beyond application/compendial requirements.\n\nc. Bioequivalence documentation\n\nNone.\n\nFiling Documentation\n\nAnnual report (all information including long-term stability data).\n\nB. Level 2 Change\n\nDefinition of Level\n\nLevel 2 changes are those that could have a significant impact on formulation quality and performance. Test documentation for a level 2 change would vary depending on whether the product could be considered to have a narrow therapeutic range.5\n\nFootnote 5: At present, there is no official CDER list of narrow therapeutic range drugs. A list was developed earlier in a preliminary attempt to identify drugs where there was greater concern that deviation from the specifications and potential changes in bioavailability could raise clinical issues. This preliminary list was not based solely on 21 CFR 320.33(c) which is contained in a section of the regulations related to criteria and evidence to assess actual or potential bioequivalence problems, nor does it accurately reflect the Agency’s opinion on narrow therapeutic range drugs. Currently, the issue of narrow therapeutic range drugs is under discussion within CDER. If unsure about the classification of a drug as a narrow therapeutic range drug, sponsors should contact the appropriate CDER review division.\n\nExamples:\n\nChange in the technical grade and/or specifications of the release controlling excipient(s).6 Footnote 6: Example: Eudragit RS-100 vs. Eudragit RL-100.\n\nChanges in the release controlling excipient(s), expressed as percentage (w/w) of total release controlling excipient(s) in the formulation, greater than those listed above for a level 1 change, but less than or equal to 10% w/w of total release controlling excipient content in the modified release solid oral dosage form.\n\nThe drug substance in the drug product is formulated to 100% of label/potency. The total additive effect of all release controlling excipient changes should not be more than 10% w/w of the total release controlling excipient(s) in the original approved formulation. The total weight of the dosage form could still be within or outside the approved original application range.\n\nThe components (active and excipients) in the formulation should have numerical targets that represent the nominal composition of the product on which any future changes in the composition of the product are to be based. Allowable changes in the composition are based on the original approved target composition and not on the composition based on previous level 1 or level 2 changes. For products approved with only a range for excipients, the target value may be assumed to be the midpoint of the original approved application range.\n* Test Documentation\n* Chemistry documentation Application/compential product release requirements and updated executed batch records.\n\nStability:\n\nNonnarrow therapeutic range drugs: One batch with three months' accelerated stability data reported in prior approval supplement and long-term stability data of first production batch reported in annual report.\n\nNarrow therapeutic range drugs: Three batches with three months' accelerated stability data reported in prior approval supplement and long-term stability data of first three production batches reported in annual report.\n\nDissolution documentation\n\nNonnarrow therapeutic range drugs\n\nExtended release: In addition to application/compendial release requirements, multipoint dissolution profiles should be obtained in three other media, for example, in water, 0.1N HCl, and USP buffer media at pH 4.5, and 6.8 for the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product). Adequate sampling should be performed, for example, at 1, 2, and 4 hours and every two hours thereafter until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached. A surfactant may be used with appropriate justification.\n\nDelayed release: In addition to application/compendial release requirements, dissolution tests should be performed in 0.1 N HCl for 2 hours (acid stage) followed by testing in USP buffer media in the range of pH 4.5-7.5 (buffer stage) under standard (application/compendial) test conditions and two additional agitation speeds using the application/compendial test apparatus (three additional test conditions). If the application/compendial test apparatus is the rotating basket method (Apparatus 1), a rotation speed of 50, 100, and 150 rpm may be used, and if the application/compendial test apparatus is the rotating paddle method (Apparatus 2), a rotation speed of 50, 75, and 100 rpm may be used. Multipoint dissolution profiles should be obtained during the buffer stage of testing. Adequate sampling should be performed, for example, at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 minutes (following the time from which the dosage form is placed in the buffer) until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached. The above dissolution testing should be performed using the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product).\n--------------------\nContext title: SUPAC-MR- Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes- Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Dissolution Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation Guidance for Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , Are scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n--------------------\nContext: Q6: Can only two lots of finished product at pilot scale batch size ever be considered sufficient to support the stability of an ANDA for simple dosage forms?\n\nA6: According to the FDA stability guidance, the applicant should submit data from three pilot scale batches or should submit data from two pilot scale batches and one small scale batch. This applies to all dosage forms. If the size of the pilot scale batch does not follow ICH recommendations, the applicant should provide a justification. See also section C, question 20 for additional information regarding exceptions.\n\nQ7: How is the proposed shelf life supposed to be calculated? Will 6 months of accelerated data equal 24 months at long-term?\n\nA7: ICH Q1E principles will help in the calculation of shelf life. Data from the three ANDA submission batches (i.e., 6 months), accelerated data meeting all criteria (without significant change per ICH Q1A(R2)), and 12 months long-term data without variability will not need statistical evaluation, and with appropriate post approval stability commitments, can be used to support extrapolation to a 24 months shelf life.\n\nIf there is a significant change in the accelerated data, ICH Q1E, Appendix A, provides more details regarding when intermediate condition stability data are recommended.\n\nQ8: Will the recommendation for 6 months accelerated data be met by providing 24 weeks of data as 12 weeks is typically accepted as equivalent to 3 months?\n\nA8: No. FDA, following the recommendations of ICH stability guidances refers to timeframes in terms of months and not weeks.\n\nQ9: When a patent is due to shortly expire and there are no approved ANDAs, can we file with 3 months stability data with a commitment to supply 6 months data when available?\n\nA9: No. Data recommendations in the FDA stability guidance should be followed irrespective of patent status.\n\nQ10: How long do the three pilot scale batches, submitted as a part of an ANDA, need to be stored before destruction?\n\nA10: Sample storage times are discussed in 21 CFR 320.38 and 21 CFR 320.63 in connection with bioequivalence study samples. In general, ANDA submission batch samples should be stored for 1 year after approval of the ANDA, and samples of the drug product used for bioequivalence studies must be stored following the requirements listed in 21 CFR 320.38 and 21 CFR 320.63. In addition, the guidance for industry on Handling and Retention of BA and BE Testing Samples8 may be helpful regarding the procedure for handling reserve samples from relevant bioavailability and bioequivalence studies. Additional information on sample quantities (for retention purposes) is discussed in 21 CFR 211.170 (a) and (b), Reserve Samples.\n\nFootnote 8: See footnote 2.\n\nDrug Master File\n\nQ1: Please clarify the effect of the FDA stability guidance on Drug Master File (DMF) holders.\n\nQ1(i): How many months of long-term and accelerated data are required when a ""Completeness Assessment"" is performed on the DMF? Also, what should the DMF stability section contain for a Completeness Assessment?\n\nA1(i): To pass the Completeness Assessment, DMFs should include the stability protocol, commitments, and data demonstrating that stability studies have started. The initial and one additional time point for the accelerated studies and long-term studies are sufficient. If the DMF does not meet the recommendations under A1(ii) below at the time of the Completeness Assessment the DMF holder should amend the DMF with updated stability data to prepare for full scientific review.\n\nQ1(ii): Are stability data from three current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) batches required to be filed in the DMF to support the API retest date? Also, how many months of long-term and accelerated data are required for pilot scale batches?\n\nA1(ii): Yes. Per ICH Q1A(R2) data from formal stability studies should be provided on at least three primary batches9 and the batches should be manufactured to a minimum of pilot scale10 for the drug substance to be filed in the DMF. These batches should be made under CGMPs. The FDA stability guidance recommends 6 months of accelerated data and 6 months of long-term data for the pilot scale batches to be submitted for a full scientific review of the DMF. Additional long-term data for all three batches, as the data becomes available through the proposed retest period, should be submitted as an amendment.\n\nFootnote 9: “Primary batch” is defined in ICH Q1A(R2) Glossary.\n\nQ2: Will submissions to DMFs be accepted based on stability data from production scale batches?\n\nA2: Yes. Per ICH Q1A(R2), section II, A, 8, Stability Commitment (2.1.8), the submission is appropriate if satisfactory stability data from at least three production batches made under CGMP are filed in the DMF with 6 months of accelerated data and data for samples stored under long-term conditions that cover the proposed retest period.\n\nQ3: Should executed batch records for the three batches be included in the DMF submission?\n\nA3: One representative executed batch record will be sufficient.\n\nDrug Product Manufacturing and Packaging\n\nQ1: Can the split bulk solution filled into different fill volumes be considered discrete batches?\n\nA1: To be consistent with ICH Q1A(R2), we recommend that discrete finished product batches be produced that represent different batches of bulk solution. Split filling one batch of bulk solution into different fill volume sizes would not constitute discrete batches.\n\nQ2: Can you clarify the packaging recommendations for the submission batches for blow-fill-seal containers?\n\nA2: Blow-fill-seal containers are not an exception from regular packaging and are usually packaged inside a secondary container or a carton. The secondary packaging should be included in all three batches. ICH Q1A(R2) addresses secondary packaging usefulness (see section II, B, 4, Drug Product Container Closure System (2.2.4)).\n\nQ3: Should all three batches be stored in final proposed packaging?\n\nA3: Yes. You should package all three batches in the container closure system proposed for marketing. ICH Q1A(R2) addresses this question (see section II, B, 4, Drug Product Container Closure System (2.2.4)).\n\nQ4: What is the Agency\'s position on using different lots of APIs and/or packaging materials? How many API lots should be used in the manufacture of finished product lots used to support the ANDA?\n\nA4: It is not necessary to use different lots of packaging material, except in cases where the packaging material could affect drug product performance and/or delivery. A minimum of two lots of the drug substance should be used to prepare the three primary batches of drug product.11\n\nFootnote 11: For nasal aerosols and nasal sprays, you should use three different lots of drug substance.\n\nQ5: Should the small scale batches be packaged with commercial equipment? Also, is it acceptable to package using research equipment or by hand?\n\nA5: Yes. Small scale batches should be packaged with commercial equipment, or the packaging equipment should be similar to that proposed for use prior to market distribution. No, it is not recommended to package small scale batches using research equipment or by hand. Please refer to ICH Q1A(R2) section II, B, 3, Selection of Batches (2.2.3) and the glossary definition for primary batches.\n\nQ6: What will the recommendation for secondary packaging be?\n\nA6: We recommend following ICH Q1A(R2) section II, B, 4, Drug Product Container Closure System (2.2.4).\n\nQ7: What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n\nA7: Per ICH Q1A(R2) the applicant should provide data on three batches of all dosage forms including modified release dosage forms. ICH stability guidances do not distinguish among different dosage forms.\n\nQ8: What are the recommendations for the submission of oral solutions, ophthalmic solutions, oral and ophthalmic suspensions, transdermal patches, ointments, creams, granules for reconstitution, and paremetrals?\n\nA8: The applicant should provide three discrete batches and 6 months of accelerated data and 6 months of long-term data at the time of submission for all dosage forms. Also, refer to other questions and corresponding answers that specifically discuss other dosage forms included in this document (e.g., questions Q7, Q13).\n\nQ9: Are 6 months of stability data required on all three batches, or would one batch at 6 months and two lots at 3 months be acceptable?\n\nA9: Following ICH stability guidances, 6 months accelerated stability data on all three submission batches should be provided.\n\nQ10: Should the executed batch records for the three batches be included in the ANDA submission?\n\nA10: Yes.\n\nQ11: Does all relevant CMC batch information for the three stability batches need to be included in the application?\n\nA11: Yes. When more than one lot of API or excipients is used, the corresponding section in Module 3 should contain appropriate CMC information.\n\nQ12: If you are an applicant submitting an ANDA with two API sources, are you required to perform stability on three batches of drug product for each API source?\n--------------------\nContext title: ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products, Questions and Answers'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , Are scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA will RTR an ANDA if both worst-case scenario and non-worst-case stability data adhering to the recommendations described in section V.2.1 and this section are not submitted for the described drug product batches: liquids, solutions, semi-solids, and suspensions.55\n\nFootnote 55: See 21 CFR 314.94(a)(9)(i) stating that ANDAs must include chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information required under 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1).\n\nAppendix C Packaging Amount Considerations\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if the ANDA does not package a minimum (threshold) amount of the finished drug product in the container/closure systems that are proposed for marketing, as discussed in FDA\'s guidance for industry ANDAs: Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products, Questions and Answers.56 Also as discussed in the guidance, the threshold amount that should be packaged is governed by the specific dosage form (e.g., solid oral dosage forms, oral powders/solutions/suspensions, parenteral drug products, ophthalmic/otic drug products, transdermal patches, and topicals such as creams/lotions/gels and inhalation solutions/nasal sprays) of the finished drug product that is the subject of the ANDA submission.\n\nFootnote 56: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(ii).\n\nTo qualify the dosage units that are packaged toward the applicable threshold, the following three recommended criteria for each container/closure configuration should be satisfied:\n\nStability data (as described in section V.2.1 of this guidance).\n\nContainer/closure system information should be submitted in ANDA section 3.2.P.7. If bracketing or matrixing is used, an ANDA should include the container/closure system information applicable to configurations that were excluded from stability studies because of bracketing or matrixing.\n\nContainer and carton (if applicable) labeling for each packaging configuration containing dosage units to be counted in the overall packaged total should be provided in section 1.14.1 of the ANDA.\n\nAppendix D Batch Records\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if blank and executed batch records are not provided, regardless of whether commercial scale-up is proposed.57 For example, both commercial (blank) and executed (pilot) batch records for the pilot batches that are manufactured to support an ANDA should be submitted, along with any accompanying reconciliation sheets.\n\nFootnote 57: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(ii).\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if method validation/verification reports are not provided.58 It is critical that method validation/verification reports for all analytical methods be provided in sections 3.2.S.4.3 and 3.2.P.5.3 of the ANDA, for both the drug substance (API) and drug product, respectively. That is, for drug products for which a relevant official United States Pharmacopeia (USP) drug product monograph exists, verification59 of the USP analytical procedures should be provided. Verification should also be submitted for methods used from outside sources, such as a Type II API DMF holder, unless the methods have been fully validated in house. For any in-house methods used, validation of the analytical procedure should be submitted in either of the appropriate sections of the ANDA (i.e., sections 3.2.S.4.3 or 3.2.P.5.3). In-house methods used in lieu of USP methods should be compared to the USP method to support a demonstration that the in-house method is sufficient.\n\nFootnote 58: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1) and 314.94(a)(9)(i).\n\nFootnote 59: 25 EP (European Pharmacopoeia)/BP (British Pharmacopoeia)/JP (Japanese Pharmacopoeia) methods may be allowed, for which, in many cases, verification (versus full validation) may suffice.\n\nFootnote 60: On May 5, 2017, the electronic submission of ANDAs in a format specified by FDA will be required. See discussion in section III.B.\n\nIn addition, for ANDAs not submitted electronically60, the applicant should submit three copies of the method validation/verification package for the API, the drug product, or both.61\n\nFootnote 61: 21 CFR 314.50(e)(2)(i).\n\nFootnote 63: 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1).\n\nAppendix F Special Consideration for Transdermal Patches\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA for a transdermal patch if the ANDA does not address certain special considerations.62,63\n\nFootnote 63: In addition to the considerations identified in this section, FDA has provided recommendations on the submission of studies evaluating the adhesive performance of a Transdermal Delivery System (TDS) or topical patch in support of an ANDA in the guidance for industry Assessing Adhesion with Transdermal Delivery Systems and Topical Patches for ANDAs. The recommendations provided in the guidance will supersede the recommendations related to adhesion studies provided in individual product-specific recommendations published before the guidance was issued. Accordingly, FDA will RTR an ANDA for failure to follow the recommendations in the guidance once the final guidance is issued.\n\nMatrix Systems\n\nANDAs for matrix transdermal systems should be supported by stability data on three batches of drug product manufactured from three distinct laminates, where each batch of laminate is made using different lots of API, adhesives, backing, and/or other critical elements in the drug product. If an applicant is seeking approval for multiple strengths of a particular drug product, the applicant can choose to use a bracket approach by manufacturing three batches of the highest and lowest strengths and at least one batch of each of the bracketed strengths. An example is given below. * Laminate Batch # 1 (pilot-scale): All strengths (highest, lowest, and bracketed) * Laminate Batch # 2 (pilot-scale): Highest and lowest strengths * Laminate Batch # 3 (pilot- or small-scale): Highest and lowest strengths\n* Reservoir Systems\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]\n\ncontainer as the RLD. Therefore, a deviation from the fill volume (total drug content) of the RLD parenteral drug product may constitute a change in strength. A change in strength must first be approved via the suitability petition process (see section III.F of this guidance) before it can be proposed in an ANDA submission.\n\n3. Differences in Packaging and/or Labeling That May Be Associated With the Safe/Effective Use of the Drug Product\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA on a case-by-case basis if the ANDA contains differences in packaging and/or labeling from the RLD that may be associated with safe/effective use of the drug product.66 Generally, if the RLD is packaged with certain labeling in a manner to ensure its proper administration, the test product should be packaged and labeled similarly. For example, an RLD product may incorporate labeling on its packaging that contains a combination of visual and/or typographical aids, beyond the direct label text, to facilitate patient compliance and safety. Blister packaging is an example of such packaging, whereby certain drug products communicate crucial patient information directly on the blister carton (and/or the blister itself) to both improve patient compliance and reduce the incidence of harm or injury that may result from improper administration of the drug product. A blister carton may also better allow any supplemental patient information to be attached directly to it, which in turn ensures that each patient receives the necessary drug product information upon dispensing from a pharmacy. Such a proposed product should generally be packaged similarly to the RLD to account for these considerations.\n\nFootnote 66: 21 CFR 314.94(a)(8).\n\n4. Other Inconsistencies\n\nFDA will RTR an ANDA if the ANDA contains certain other inconsistencies. In accordance with 21 CFR 314.94(a)(4), an ANDA must include a statement that the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling proposed for the drug product have been previously approved for the RLD. However, there are certain exceptions (e.g., for labeling differences permitted pursuant to an approved suitability petition that is cited as an ANDA\'s basis of submission (see section III.F for further details)). Any other proposed condition-of-use changes would not be acceptable. Examples of proposed condition-of-use changes may include, but are not limited to, citing a sprinkle capsule dosage form as a basis of submission but producing a capsule that cannot be administered in the same manner as the RLD, or proposing alterations to either the amount of active ingredient delivered per dose or the dosing regimen such that neither are consistent with those described in the RLD labeling.\n\nAppendix H Microbiology Considerations\n\nGenerally, FDA will RTR an ANDA if it contains certain deficiencies related to microbiology considerations.\n\nAn ANDA should contain all sterility assurance validation studies for terminally sterilized drug products and aseptically filled drug products, as described below67:Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTerminally sterilized drug products\n\nValidation of production terminal sterilization process\n\nValidation of depyrogenation of product containers and closures\n\nValidation of container-closure package integrity\n\nAseptically filled drug products\n\nValidation of the sterilizing grade filters (bacterial retention studies)\n\nValidation of the sterilization of sterile bulk drug or product contact equipment, components, containers, and closures\n\nValidation of the depyrogenation of product containers and closures\n\nValidation of the aseptic filling process/line/room (media fills/process simulations)\n\nValidation of container-closure package integrity\n\nIn addition, an ANDA should include at the time of submission, at minimum, summaries of validation studies.\n\nVI Bioequivalence and clinical deficiencies\n\nAs a general matter, ANDA applicants should refer to FDA\'s ""Product Specific Recommendations for Generic Drug Development"" website for Bioequivalence (BE) guidances regarding recommended in vivo and/or in vitro BE and other recommended studies.68\n\nFootnote 68: FDA’s BE recommendations for specific products can be found at\n--------------------\nContext title: ANDA Submissions -- Refuse-to-Receive Standards Rev.2'

If the correct information is not submitted within 7 calendar days, FDA will RTR the ANDA. Footnote 94: Note that the minor deficiencies found during the API review are not counted against the total for all other ANDA deficiencies, as described in the introduction to Section III.\n\nFor those ANDAs using APIs that do not make reference to a Type II API DMF, an evaluation of the API information presented within Module 3 (drug substance)95 of the application will be performed. Any deficiencies96 will be communicated to the ANDA applicant for correction. If a response to the API deficiencies is not received within 7 calendar days, FDA will RTR the ANDA. Footnote 96: Note that the minor deficiencies found during the API review are not counted against the total for all other ANDA deficiencies, as described in the introduction to Section III.\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 314.94(a)(8)(iv), an ANDA's proposed labeling must be the same as the labeling approved for the RLD, except for (1) changes required because of differences approved under a petition filed under 21 CFR 314.93, or (2) because the drug product and the RLD are produced or distributed by different manufacturers. Differences between the applicant's proposed labeling and labeling approved for the RLD can include differences in expiration date, formulation, bioavailability or pharmacokinetics, labeling revisions made to comply with current FDA labeling guidelines or other guidance, or omission of an indication or other aspect of labeling protected by patent or accorded exclusivity under section 505(j)(5)(F) of the FD&C Act. Applicants must submit a side-by-side comparison of the RLD and the proposed labeling.97 In accordance with 21 CFR 314.94(d)(1)(iii), the content of labeling must be submitted in an electronic format that FDA can process, review, and archive. FDA periodically issues and updates its guidance on how to provide electronic submissions.98 If responses to these deficiencies are not received within 7 calendar days of being informed of these issues, FDA will RTR the ANDA.\n\nFootnote 97: See 21 CFR 314.94(a)(8)(iv).\n\nFootnote 98: See guidance for industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format—Content of Labeling.\n--------------------\nContext title: ANDA Submissions -- Refuse-to-Receive Standards Rev.2""

Describe the release mechanism.\n\nThe specific release mechanism should be described and the development studies leading to the final release mechanism should be summarized. The type of information may vary substantially since the development of release mechanisms will vary between different formulations, such as coated tablets versus in-situ forming gels.\n\nHow was the drug product designed to have these attributes?\n\nFor release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n\nFor example, does it use an enteric coating or slow release matrix.\n\nAre any overages used in the drug product? Why is an overage necessary?\n\nThe applicant should describe and justify the amount of the overage if needed to ensure dose delivery. This overage should also be included in the composition and batch formula.\n\nAre there any special design features of the product?\n\nA rationale should be given for these design features to support their appropriateness.\n\nWere alternative formulations or mechanisms investigated?\n\nWhat formulations were used to produce the clinical batches for safety and effectiveness studies?\n\nAre there differences in formulation between the clinical or pilot batches and that proposed for commercial batches? Describe the different formulations.\n\nApplicants should provide the complete list of formulations in the evolution of the final formulation. The rationale or justification should be given for differences in formulations between the commercial and clinical or stability batches. This information may include comparative in vitro or in vivo studies to link the clinical formulation(s) with the proposed commercial formulation.\n\nWhat excipients were chosen for use in the final formulation and what are their roles in the drug product (e.g., anti-dusting agent, binding agent)?\n\nThe applicant should briefly explain and/or justify the selection of each excipient for its particular role in the drug product and provide evidence that the excipients can fulfill their intended role. Reference to 2.3.P.2.1.2, when applicable, is acceptable.\n\nAre there multiple grades of an excipient available? What are the different grades and the properties that distinguish one grade from another (e.g., viscosity, particle size distribution)?\n\nThe applicant should provide justification for the use of one grade over another. If a USP monograph exists for the excipient, it can be used as a reference. If there is no USP monograph, the applicant should provide and justify specifications which ensure the quality of the excipient(s).\n\nDoes the excipient exert a critical function related to the product performance? What studies were executed to evaluate the appropriateness of multiple grades of that excipient for use with the drug substance and any other excipients?\n\nThe applicant should provide the results of any such studies.

For example, for a solid oral dosage form the sponsor should explain the choice between direct compression versus wet granulation or other approaches.__Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhat factors were considered in the selection of the manufacturing process - including the properties of the drug substance, the desired properties of the drug product, and the complexity and robustness of the process?\n\nOnce the process was selected, a sponsor should focus on describing particular steps for which there are alternatives available (for example rationale for the selection of high shear granulation versus fluid bed granulation) and explain the motivation for each choice.\n\nHow are the manufacturing steps (unit operations) related to the drug product quality?\n\nWhat are the critical steps in the manufacturing process?\n\nWhat studies established links between unit operations and the target product profile (through pilot scale studies or prior knowledge)?\n\nA sponsor should demonstrate which unit operations are critical to which drug product properties. It may be useful to present this information in the form of a matrix between unit operations and quality attributes. Once a step is identified as being critical then the sponsor should design their process to ensure that this step succeeds or have tests in place to detect if the step fails.\n\nHow were the critical process parameters identified, monitored, and/or controlled?\n\nA critical process parameter (CPP) is any measurable input (input material attribute or operating parameter) or output (process condition or output material attribute) of a process step that must be controlled to achieve the desired product quality and process consistency. Scale independent CPPs, such as material attributes, are the most valuable, because they can be directly used for scale up. For example, a material attribute CPP, such as moisture content, should have the same target value in the pilot batch process and the commercial scale process. An operating parameter CPP, such as air flow rate, would be expected to change as the process scale changes.\n\nWhat is the scale-up experience with the unit operations in this process?\n\nValuable experience includes experience with other products using the same unit operations, literature references/vendor scale-up factors, the lab scale to pilot batch process transfer for this product, pilot batch production, as well as modeling and dimensional analysis.\n\nWhat resulting plan was developed to scale-up the process to commercial scale and how was this scale-up plan developed?\n\nThis should include identification of operating parameters that may be scale dependent and process monitoring (in excess of meeting regulatory specifications) that ensures the commercial scale process will be equivalent to the process that produced the pilot batch.\n\n2.3.P.2.4 Container Closure System\n\nWhat specific container closure attributes are necessary to ensure product performance?\n\nHow were materials for the container-closure system chosen (e.g., to provide light protection or minimize leachability)?\n\nStandards for the selection and testing of glass and plastic containers to demonstrate their acceptability for use are provided in USP 4(<)660(>) 5({}^{\\text{\\text{\\tiny{ii}}}}) and (<)661(>),5({}^{\\text{\\text{\\tiny{iii}}}}) respectively.\n\nWhat studies to determine the compatibility of materials with the drug product were performed?\n\nFor drug products that incorporate delivery devices (e.g., inhalation devices, spray pumps), pharmaceutical development studies conducted to select the device should be discussed in this section.\n\n2.3.p.3 Manufacture\n\nSee CVM GFI #42: Animal Drug Manufacturing Guidelines 6 for information intended to provide guidance for the submission of appropriate manufacturing data and information to support the approval of an original (A)NADA.\n\nWho manufactures the drug product?\n\nWhat are the names, addresses, and responsibilities of each manufacturer and each proposed production site or facility?\n\nAll manufacturers and contractors, such as contract sterilization, and all facilities involved in the manufacturing, testing, packaging, storage, and labeling should be identified.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe objective of this document is to provide guidance to other Federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and to state and local governments regarding the safe and effective use of potassium iodide (KI) as an adjunct to other public health protective measures in the event that radioactive iodine is released into the environment. The adoption and implementation of these recommendations are at the discretion of the state and local governments responsible for developing regional emergency-response plans related to radiation emergencies.\n\nThis guidance updates the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 1982 recommendations for the use of KI to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer in radiation emergencies involving the release of radioactive iodine. The recommendations in this guidance address KI dosage and the projected radiation exposure at which the drug should be used.\n\nThese recommendations were prepared by the Potassium Iodide Working Group, comprising scientists from the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) in collaboration with experts in the field from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although they differ in two respects (as discussed in Section IV.2), these revised recommendations are in general accordance with those of the World Health Organization (WHO), as expressed in its Guidelines for Iodine Prophylaxis Following Nuclear Accidents: Update 1999 (WHO 1999).\n\nII Background\n\nUnder 44 CFR 351, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established roles and responsibilities for Federal agencies in assisting state and local governments in their radiological emergency planning and preparedness activities. The Federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), are to carry out these roles and responsibilities as members of the Federal Radiological Preparedness Coordinating Committee(FRPCC). Under 44 CFR 351.23(f), HHS is directed to provide guidance to state and local governments on the use of radioprotective substances and the prophylactic use of drugs (e.g., KI) to reduce the radiation dose to specific organs. This guidance includes information about dosage and projected radiation exposures at which such drugs should be used.\n\nThe FDA has provided guidance previously on the use of KI as a thyroid blocking agent. In the Federal Register of December 15, 1978, FDA announced its conclusion that KI is a safe and effective means by which to block uptake of radioiodines by the thyroid gland in a radiation emergency under certain specified conditions of use. In the Federal Register of June 29, 1982, FDA announced final recommendations on the administration of KI to the general public in a radiation emergency. Those recommendations were formulated after reviewing studies relating radiation dose to thyroid disease risk that relied on estimates of external thyroid irradiation after the nuclear detonations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki and analogous studies among children who received therapeutic radiation to the head and neck. Those recommendations concluded that at a projected dose to the thyroid gland of 25 cGy or greater from ingested or inhaled radioiodines, the risks of short-term use of small quantities of KI were outweighed by the benefits of suppressing radioiodine-induced thyroid cancer.1 The amount of KI recommended at that time was 130 mg per day for adults and children above 1 year of age and 65 mg per day for children below 1 year of age. The guidance that follows revises our 1982 recommendations on the use of KI for thyroid cancer prophylaxis based on a comprehensive review of the data relating radioioidine exposure to thyroid cancer risk accumulated in the aftermath of the 1986 Chernobyl reactor accident.\n\nFootnote 1: For the radiation emitted by ({}^{131}) I (electrons and photons), the radiation-weighting factor is equal to one, so that the absorbed dose to the thyroid gland expressed in centigrays (cGy) is numerically equal to the thyroid equivalent dose expressed in rem (1 cGy = 1 rem).\n\n3 Data Sources\n\nReliance on Data from Chernobyl\n\nIn epidemiological studies investigating the relationship between thyroidal radioiodine exposure and risk of thyroid cancer, the estimation of thyroid radiation doses is a critical and complex aspect of the analyses. Estimates of exposure, both for individuals and across populations, have been reached in different studies by the variable combination of (1) direct thyroid measurements in a segment of the exposed population; (2) measurements of ({}^{131})I (iodine isotope) concentrations in the milk consumed by different groups (e.g., communities) and of the quantity of milk consumed; (3) inference from ground deposition of long-lived radioisotopes released coincidentally and presumably in fixed ratios with radioiodines; and (4) reconstruction of the nature and extent of the actual radiation release.\n\nAll estimates of individual and population exposure contain some degree of uncertainty. The uncertainty is least for estimates of individual exposure based on direct thyroid measurements.\n\nUncertainty increases with reliance on milk consumption estimates; is still greater with estimates derived from ground deposition of long-lived radioisotopes, and is highest for estimates that rely heavily on release reconstruction.\n\nDirect measurements of thyroid radioactivity are unavailable from the Hanford, Nevada Test Site, and Marshall Islands exposures. Indeed, the estimates of thyroid radiation doses related to these releases rely heavily on release reconstructions and, in the former two cases, on recall of the extent of milk consumption 40 to 50 years after the fact. In the Marshall Islands cohort, urinary radioiodine excretion data were obtained and used in calculating exposure estimates.\n\nBecause of the great uncertainty in the dose estimates from the Hanford and Nevada Test Site exposures and due to the small numbers of thyroid cancers occurring in the populations potentially exposed, the epidemiological studies of the excess thyroid cancer risk related to these radioiodine releases are, at best, inconclusive. As explained below, the dosimetric data derived in the studies of individual and population exposures following the Chernobyl accident, although not perfect, are unquestionably superior to data from previous releases. In addition, the results of the earlier studies are inadequate to refute cogent case control study evidence from Chernobyl of a cause-effect relationship between thyroid radioiodine deposition and thyroid cancer risk.2\n\nFootnote 2: We have included in this guidance an extensive bibliography of the sources used in developing these revised recommendations.\n\nThe Chernobyl reactor accident of April 1986 provides the best-documented example of a massive radionuclide release in which large numbers of people across a broad geographical area were exposed acutely to radioiodines released into the atmosphere. Therefore, the recommendations contained in this guidance are derived from our review of the Chernobyl data as they pertain to the large number of thyroid cancers that occurred. These are the most comprehensive and reliable data available describing the relationship between thyroid radiation dose and risk for thyroid cancer following an environmental release of ({}^{131})I. In contrast, the exposures resulting from radiation releases at the Hanford Site in Washington State in the mid-1940s and in association with the nuclear detonations at the Nevada Test Site in the 1950s were extended over years, rather than days to weeks, contributing to the difficulty in estimating radioactive dose in those potentially exposed (Davis et al., 1999; Gilbert et al., 1998). The exposure of Marshall Islanders to fallout from the nuclear detonation on Bikini in 1954 involved relatively few people, and although the high rate of subsequent thyroid nodules and cancers in the exposed population was likely caused in large part by radioiodines, the Marshall Islands data provide little insight into the dose-response relationship between radioactive iodine exposure and thyroid cancer risk (Robbins and Adams 1989).\n--------------------\nContext title: Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n--------------------\nContext: The FDA recommendations for KI intervention encompass different threshold thyroid radioactive exposures for different groups within the population. Several factors were involved in this approach:\n\nDuring the Chernobyl accident, younger people exposed to radioactive iodine (especially children 0 to 4 years old) were most sensitive to its carcinogenic effects.\nIn the years following the accident, most children who subsequently developed thyroid cancer apparently received internal thyroid radioactive exposures of less than 30 cGy, and the best dose-response information supports increased risk in children receiving 5 cGy or more.\n\nAs age increases, the risk of thyroidal side effects following excess (i.e., nonradioactive) iodine ingestion increases. This is due to the increasing prevalence of underlying thyroidal illness with older age (e.g., Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, Hashimoto's thyroiditis).\n\nThyroid irradiation in older adults (e.g., over 40 years of age) is associated with an extremely low incidence of cancer. Therefore, KI is only recommended if a very large internal radioactive dose to the thyroid is projected. In such a situation, KI would be ingested to prevent destruction of the thyroid gland, which, if it occurred, would lead to lifelong dependence on thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\n\nIn short, the recommended stepped intervention approach to KI use during radiation emergencies is based on differences in overall benefit versus risk in different population groups. Specifically, the benefits from thyroid blockade with KI predominate in the young in whom the risks of thyroid cancer from radioiodine are the greatest. The risks of KI take on more prominence in older adults in whom the risks of thyroid cancer are very small.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, it is important to note that among 7 million adults who took stable iodine in Poland following Chernobyl, only two severe adverse reactions were reported, both in persons with known allergy to iodine. Based on these data, we have concluded that even if the risks associated with excess stable iodine are greater in adults than in children, the risk of serious adverse reactions overall is exceedingly small.\n\nIn summary, FDA understands that a KI administration program that sets different projected thyroid radioactive exposure thresholds for treatment of different population groups may be logistically impractical to implement during a radiological emergency. If emergency planners reach this conclusion, FDA recommends that KI be administered to both children and adults at the lowest intervention threshold (i.e., (\\geq 5) cGy projected internal thyroid exposure in children).\n\nAs a rule, however, individuals with known allergy to KI or with pre-existing thyroid disease (e.g., Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, Hashimoto's thyroiditis) that might predispose them to adverse reactions should avoid KI. Most likely these will be adults, who have little or no risk of developing thyroid cancer from radioactive exposure to the thyroid and who may, in these cases, incur substantial risks from taking KI.\n\nQ8: Does the FDA guidance apply to residents outside of the 10-mile emergency planning zone for nuclear poset plants?\n\nYes. KI administered in advance of an exposure will successfully block thyroidal uptake of radioiodine, wherever one may reside.\n--------------------\nContext title: (Potassium Iodide) KI in Radiation Emergencies-Questions and Answers""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n--------------------\nContext: For optimal protection against inhaled radioiodines, KI should be administered before or immediately coincident with passage of the radioactive cloud, though KI may still have a substantial protective effect even if taken 3 or 4 hours after exposure. Furthermore, if the release of radioiodines into the atmosphere is protracted, then, of course, even delayed administration may reap benefits by reducing, if incompletely, the total radiation dose to the thyroid.\n\nPrevention of thyroid uptake of ingested radioiodines, once the plume has passed and radiation protection measures (including KI) are in place, is best accomplished by food control measures and not by repeated administration of KI. Because of radioactive decay, grain products and canned milk or vegetables from sources affected by radioactive fallout, if stored for weeks to months after production, pose no radiation risk. Thus, late KI prophylaxis at the time of consumption is not required.\n\nAs time is of the essence in optimal prophylaxis with KI, timely administration to the public is a critical consideration in planning the emergency response to a radiation accident and requires a ready supply of KI. State and local governments choosing to incorporate KI into their emergency response plans may consider the option of predistribution of KI to those individuals who do not have a medical condition precluding its use.\n\nVI Summary\n\nFDA maintains that KI is a safe and effective means by which to prevent radioiodine uptake by the thyroid gland, under certain specified conditions of use, and thereby obviate the risk of thyroid cancer in the event of a radiation emergency. Based upon review of the literature, we have proposed lower radioactive exposure thresholds for KI prophylaxis as well as lower doses of KI for neonates, infants, and children than we recommended in 1982. As in our 1982 notice in the Federal Register, FDA continues to recommend that radiation emergency response plans include provisions, in the event of a radiation emergency, for informing the public about the magnitude of the radiation hazard, about the manner of use of KI and its potential benefits and risks, and for medical contact, reporting, and assistance systems. FDA also emphasizes that emergency response plans and any systems for ensuring availability of KI to the public should recognize the critical importance of KI administration in advance of exposure to radioiodine. As in the past, FDA continues to work in an ongoing fashion with manufacturers of KI to ensure that high-quality, safe, and effective KI products are available for purchase by consumers as well as by state and local governments wishing to establish stores for emergency distribution.\n\nKI provides protection only for the thyroid from radioiodines. It has no impact on the uptake by the body of other radioactive materials and provides no protection against external irradiation of any kind. FDA emphasizes that the use of KI should be as an adjunct to evacuation (itself not always feasible), sheltering, and control of foodstuffs.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe KI Taskforce would like to extend special thanks to our members from the NIH: Jacob Robbins, M.D., and Jan Wolff, Ph.D., M.D., of the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases and Andre Bouville, Ph.D., of the National Cancer Institute.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides answers to questions that FDA has received as state and local governments develop emergency response plans involving the use of potassium iodide (KI) to protect against the effects of radioactive iodine accidentally or intentionally released into the atmosphere. KI is recommended for use as an adjunct to other emergency measures, such as evacuation and control of the food supply to avoid ingestion of contaminated foodstuffs. When used correctly, KI can prevent or reduce the uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid gland. KI provides optimal protection when administered immediately prior to or in conjunction with passage of a radioactive cloud. The incorporation of KI into radiation emergency response plans is at the discretion of state and local governments.\n\nThis is a revision of the question and answer guidance published in April 2002. The revision incorporates two additional questions (question 4 and question 7) raised about KI intervention and makes minor editorial changes to the previous questions and answers.\n\nII Background\n\nIn a guidance entitled Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies (December 2001), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated its 1982 recommendations for the safe and effective use of KI to prevent or reduce the uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid gland. The current recommendations are based on conclusions reached after reviewing data on radioiodine exposure and thyroid cancer risk gathered after the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in 1986. The data suggest that the risk of thyroid cancer is inversely related to age. Fetuses, infants, and young children are at greatest risk and may be harmed by small amounts of radioiodine.\n\nAlthough special precautions should be taken when administering KI to pregnant women and newborns within the first month of life (adherence to the recommended dose, avoidance of repeat dosing, and monitoring of thyroid function in neonates), the benefits of short-term administration of KI as a thyroid blocking agent far exceed the risks of administration to any age group. For complete information, please refer to FDA\'s December 2001 guidance.\n\nIII Questions and Answers\n\nQ1:: Does FDA have specific recommendations about radiation emergency preparedness plans and the use of KI?\n\nNo. Decisions about the details of their preparedness plans are up to state and local authorities. FDA\'s guidance provides general recommendations about the use of KI prophylaxis in the event of a radiological emergency. These recommendations are discussed in Section V. of the guidance.\n\nQ2:: Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n\nNo. FDA has made recommendations on the lowest effective dose. Higher doses (e.g., up to 130 mg) would be equally effective and, particularly among school-age children, extremely safe (see also question 9).\n\nQ3:: If a graded dosing approach is considered, how does FDA suggest that fractional doses (i.e., 65, 32, 16 mg) be administered?\n\nKI tablets can be dissolved in liquids and the appropriate volume administered. For example, if a 130 mg tablet were dissolved in 8 ounces of liquid, one ounce would contain about 16 mg of KI. FDA has conducted studies of the palatability, solubility, and stability of KI dissolved in a number of different liquids, including juice and formula. (See the Home Preparation Procedure for Emergency Administration of Potassium Iodide Tablets to Infants and Small Children.2) Emergency planners and others should understand that absolute precision in dosing is generally not critical to safety or efficacy (see also question 4).\n\nFootnote 2: This is available at http://www.fda.gov/cder/drugprepare/default.htm.\n\nQ4.: FDA guidance recommends graded dosing by age, with neonates receiving the lowest dose (16 mg daily) and adults receiving the highest (130 mg). FDA approved KI tablets are available in two dosage strengths: 65 and 130 mg. At a minimum, dosing based on FDA guidance would require either splitting tablets or dissolving tablets in liquids. This may be impractical while responding to a radiological emergency. In this context, what is the impact of uniform dosing across all age groups eligible for KI prophylaxis?* The FDA\'s guidance on dosing KI in radiation emergencies adheres to principles of minimum effective dose and therefore recommends graded dosing according to age (and thus, in effect, body size). There is ample evidence that the recommended doses, as well as higher doses (e.g., up to 130 mg), will effectively block thyroidal uptake of radioactive iodine if taken in advance of exposure. Furthermore, particularly among school-age children, higher milligram doses are extremely safe. We also realize that a scheme of graded dosing may be difficult to implement during a radiological emergency involving large numbers of people. However, we continue to emphasize attention to KI dosing in infants. Excess iodine intake can lead to transient iodine-induced hypothyroidism. As we have said in our guidance, individuals who are intolerant of KI at protective doses, as well as neonates, pregnant, and lactating women, should be given priority with regard to other protective measures (i.e., sheltering, evacuation, and control of the food supply).\n\nIn summary, if local emergency planners conclude that graded dosing is logistically impractical, FDA believes that for populations at risk for radioiodine exposure, the overall benefits of taking up to 130 mg of KI instead of the lower doses recommended for certain age groups far exceed the small risks of overdosing. However, where feasible, adherence to FDA guidance should be attempted when dosing infants.\n\nWill dosage strengths of KI below 130 mg be available in the United States?\n\nYes. An FDA approved 65-mg KI tablet is being marketed now in the United States.\n\nAre there plans to update the labeling for marketed KI products to conform to the revised FDA recommendations on dosing?\n\nYes. FDA is working with manufacturers to amend the ""Drug Facts"" labeling for KI products, which are sold over the counter, to incorporate the new dosing recommendations.\n\nHow critical to public health is adherence to FDA\'s recommendations with regard to projected thyroid radioactive exposure thresholds for intervention by risk category? Specifically, the existence of different thresholds for neonates, children through age 18, and pregnant or lactating women ((\\geq) 5 cGy) versus adults aged 18 through 40 years ((\\geq) 10 cGy) versus adults over age 40 ((\\geq) 500 cGy) are confusing and logistically complex to follow in responding to a radiological emergency.\n\nThe FDA recommendations for KI intervention encompass different threshold thyroid radioactive exposures for different groups within the population. Several factors were involved in this approach:\n\nDuring the Chernobyl accident, younger people exposed to radioactive iodine (especially children 0 to 4 years old) were most sensitive to its carcinogenic effects.\nIn the years following the accident, most children who subsequently developed thyroid cancer apparently received internal thyroid radioactive exposures of less than 30 cGy, and the best dose-response information supports increased risk in children receiving 5 cGy or more.\n\nAs age increases, the risk of thyroidal side effects following excess (i.e., nonradioactive) iodine ingestion increases. This is due to the increasing prevalence of underlying thyroidal illness with older age (e.g., Graves\' disease, thyroid nodules, Hashimoto\'s thyroiditis).\n\nThyroid irradiation in older adults (e.g., over 40 years of age) is associated with an extremely low incidence of cancer. Therefore, KI is only recommended if a very large internal radioactive dose to the thyroid is projected. In such a situation, KI would be ingested to prevent destruction of the thyroid gland, which, if it occurred, would lead to lifelong dependence on thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\n\nIn short, the recommended stepped intervention approach to KI use during radiation emergencies is based on differences in overall benefit versus risk in different population groups. Specifically, the benefits from thyroid blockade with KI predominate in the young in whom the risks of thyroid cancer from radioiodine are the greatest. The risks of KI take on more prominence in older adults in whom the risks of thyroid cancer are very small.\n--------------------\nContext title: (Potassium Iodide) KI in Radiation Emergencies-Questions and Answers'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n--------------------\nContext: Thyroidal side effects of stable iodine include iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis, which is more common in older people and in iodine deficient areas but usually requires repeated doses of stable iodine. In addition, iodide goiter and hypothyroidism are potential side effects more common in iodine sufficient areas, but they require chronic high doses of stable iodine (Rubery 1990). In light of the preceding, individuals with multinodular goiter, Graves' disease, and autoimmune thyroiditis should be treated with caution, especially if dosing extends beyond a few days. The vast majority of such individuals will be adults.\n\nThe transient hypothyroidism observed in 0.37 percent (12 of 3214) of neonates treated with KI in Poland after Chernobyl has been without reported sequelae to date. There is no question that the benefits of KI treatment to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer outweigh the risks of such treatment in neonates. Nevertheless, in light of the potential consequences of even transient hypothyroidism for intellectual development, we recommend that neonates (within the first month of life) treated with KI be monitored for this effect by measurement of TSH (and FT4, if indicated) and that thyroid hormone therapy be instituted in cases in which hypothyroidism develops (Bongers-Schokking 2000; Fisher 2000; Calaciura 1995).\n\nAppendix B KI Use in Radiation Emergencies: Treatment Recommendations\n\nAfter careful review of the data from Chernobyl relating estimated thyroid radiation dose and cancer risk in exposed children, FDA is revising its recommendation for administration of KI based on age, predicted thyroid exposure, and pregnancy and lactation status (see Table).\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|} \\hline \\multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Threshold Thyroid Radioactive Exposures and} \\ \\multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Recommended Doses of KI for Different Risk Groups} \\ \\hline  & Predicted & KI dose (mg) & # of 130 mg & # of 65 \\  & Thyroid & tablets & mg tablets \\  & exposure(cGy) & & & \\ \\hline Adults over 40 yrs & (>)500 & & & \\ \\hline Adults over 18 through 40 yrs & (>)10 & & & \\ \\hline Pregnant or lactating women & & 130 & 1 & 2 \\ \\hline Adoles. over 12 through 18 yrs & (\\geq) 5 & & & \\ \\hline Children over 3 through 12 yrs & & 65 & 1/2 & 1 \\ \\hline Over 1 month through 3 years & & 32 & 1/4 & 1/2 \\ \\hline Birth through 1 month & & 16 & 1/8 & 1/4 \\ \\hline \\multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Adolescents approaching adult size ((\\geq) 70 kg) should receive the full adult dose (130 mg).} \\ \\end{tabular}\n\nThe protective effect of KI lasts approximately 24 hours. For optimal prophylaxis, KI should therefore be dosed daily, until a risk of significant exposure to radioiodines by either inhalation or ingestion no longer exists. Individuals intolerant of KI at protective doses, and neonates, pregnant and lactating women (in whom repeat administration of KI raises particular safety issues, see below) should be given priority with regard to other protective measures (i.e., sheltering, evacuation, and control of the food supply).\n\nNote that adults over 40 need take KI only in the case of a projected large internal radiation dose to the thyroid ((>)500 cGy) to prevent hypothyroidism.\n\nThese recommendations are meant to provide states and local authorities as well as other agencies with the best current guidance on safe and effective use of KI to reduce thyroidal radioiodine exposure and thus the risk of thyroid cancer. FDA recognizes that, in the event of an emergency, some or all of the specific dosing recommendations may be very difficult to carry out given their complexity and the logistics of implementation of a program of KI distribution. The recommendations should therefore be interpreted with flexibility as necessary to allow optimally effective and safe dosing given the exigencies of any particular emergency situation. In this context, we offer the following critical general guidance: across populations at risk for radioiodine exposure, the overall benefits of KI far exceed the risks of overdosing, especially in children, though we continue to emphasize particular attention to dose in infants.\n\nThese FDA recommendations differ from those put forward in the World Health Organization (WHO) 1999 guidelines for iodine prophylaxis in two ways. WHO recommends a 130-mg dose of KI for adults and adolescents (over 12 years). For the sake of logistical simplicity in the dispensing and administration of KI to children, FDA recommends a 65-mg dose as standard for all school-age children while allowing for the adult dose (130 mg, 2 X 65 mg tablets) in adolescents approaching adult size. The other difference lies in the threshold for predicted exposure of those up to 18 years of age and of pregnant or lactating women that should trigger KI prophylaxis. WHO recommends a threshold of 1 cGy for these two groups. As stated earlier, FDA has concluded from the Chernobyl data that the most reliable evidence supports a significant increase in the risk of childhood thyroid cancer at exposures of 5 cGy or greater.\n\nThe downward KI dose adjustment by age group, based on body size considerations, adheres to the principle of minimum effective dose. The recommended standard dose of KI for all school-age children is the same (65 mg). However, adolescents approaching adult size (i.e., (>)70 kg) should receive the full adult dose (130 mg) for maximal block of thyroid radioiodine uptake. Neonates ideally should receive the lowest dose (16 mg) of KI. Repeat dosing of KI should be avoided in the neonate to minimize the risk of hypothyroidism during that critical phase of brain development (Bongers-Schokking 2000; Calcaiuma et al., 1995). KI from tablets (either whole or fractions) or as fresh saturated KI solution may be diluted in milk, formula, or water and the appropriate volume administered to babies. As stated above, we recommend that neonates (within the first month of life) treated with KI be monitored for the potential development of hypothyroidism by measurement of TSH (and FT4, if indicated) and that thyroid hormone therapy be instituted in cases in which hypothyroidism develops (Bongers-Schokking 2000; Fisher 2000; Calcaiuma et al., 1995).\n\nPregnant women should be given KI for their own protection and for that of the fetus, as iodine (whether stable or radioactive) readily crosses the placenta. However, because of the risk of blocking fetal thyroid function with excess stable iodine, repeat dosing with KI of pregnant women should be avoided. Lactating females should be administered KI for their own protection, as for other young adults, and potentially to reduce the radioiodine content of the breast milk, but not as a means to deliver KI to infants, who should get their KI directly. As for direct administration of KI, stable iodine as a component of breast milk may also pose a risk of hypothyroidism in nursing neonates. Therefore, repeat dosing with KI should be avoided in the lactating mother, except during continuing severe contamination. If repeat dosing of the mother is necessary, the nursing neonate should be monitored as recommended above.\n\nAdditional Considerations in Prophylaxis against Thyroid Radioidoline Exposure\n\nCertain principles should guide emergency planning and implementation of KI prophylaxis in the event of a radiation emergency. After the Chernobyl accident, across the affected populations, thyroid radiation exposures occurred largely due to consumption of contaminated fresh cow's milk (this contamination was the result of milk cows grazing on fields affected by radioactive fallout) and to a much lesser extent by consumption of contaminated vegetables. In this or similar accidents, for those residing in the immediate area of the accident or otherwise directly exposed to the radioactive plume, inhalation of radioiodines may be a significant contributor to individual and population exposures. As a practical matter, it may not be possible to assess the risk of thyroid exposure from inhaled radioiodines at the time of the emergency. The risk depends on factors such as the magnitude and rate of the radioiodine release, wind direction and other atmospheric conditions, and thus may affect people both near to and far from the accident site.\n\nFor optimal protection against inhaled radioiodines, KI should be administered before or immediately coincident with passage of the radioactive cloud, though KI may still have a substantial protective effect even if taken 3 or 4 hours after exposure. Furthermore, if the release of radioiodines into the atmosphere is protracted, then, of course, even delayed administration may reap benefits by reducing, if incompletely, the total radiation dose to the thyroid.\n\nPrevention of thyroid uptake of ingested radioiodines, once the plume has passed and radiation protection measures (including KI) are in place, is best accomplished by food control measures and not by repeated administration of KI. Because of radioactive decay, grain products and canned milk or vegetables from sources affected by radioactive fallout, if stored for weeks to months after production, pose no radiation risk. Thus, late KI prophylaxis at the time of consumption is not required.\n\nAs time is of the essence in optimal prophylaxis with KI, timely administration to the public is a critical consideration in planning the emergency response to a radiation accident and requires a ready supply of KI. State and local governments choosing to incorporate KI into their emergency response plans may consider the option of predistribution of KI to those individuals who do not have a medical condition precluding its use.\n\nVI Summary\n--------------------\nContext title: Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies""

Vienna, International Atomic Energy Technical Reports Series No. 184.\n\nThere are suggestions in the literature that other nonabsorbed binding resins, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate, may also have utility in inhibiting the uptake of radioactive contaminants in the gut.2 Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is approved in the United States under the name Kayexalate but is not approved as a decorporation agent.\n\nFootnote 12: See Fasiska BC, Bohning DE, Brodsky A, and Horm J (1971), Urinary Excretion of ({}^{241})Am Under DTPA Therapy, Health Physics 21:523-529.\n\nAluminum-containing antacids are relatively well-tolerated and have been recommended for reducing the absorption of radioactive strontium.2,4 There are preliminary data to suggest that either aluminum phosphate gel or aluminum hydroxide, given immediately after exposure, may decrease the absorption of radioactive strontium in the gut. 2,4 However, the efficacy of these products as potential decorporation agents has not been established, and none is approved in the United States for that indication.\n\nFootnote 13: See the Federal Register, Vol. 68, p. 5645, February 4, 2003.\n\nFootnote 14: We update guidances periodically.

Prevention or Reversal of Radiocontaminant Interaction with Tissues\n\na. Blocking and Diluting Agents\n\nFor radiocontaminants already in the blood, blocking and diluting agents will reduce uptake at target tissues. Administering a blocking agent such as potassium iodide (KI) allows for saturation of metabolic processes in the thyroid with stable, nonradioactive iodine thereby preventing uptake of radioactive iodine. In 1978, FDA announced its\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nChelators are substances that bind with certain metals to form a stable complex that can be more rapidly eliminated from the body via excretion by the kidneys.\n\nDiethylenetriaminepentacetate (DTPA), as the calcium or zinc salt, has been used in this way as an investigational agent for many years.[7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19] DTPA forms stable complexes with transuranium elements, and these complexes are renally excreted, thus decreasing body burden. The calcium and zinc salts of DTPA have both been used investigationally for the treatment of plutonium, americium, or curium internal contamination under an IND (investigational new drug) application held by the Radiation Emergency Assistance Center/Training Site (REAC/TS). Ca-DTPA is administered as a single intravenous injection or inhaled dose as soon as possible after contamination, and repeated doses of Zn-DTPA administered intravenously may be given daily as maintenance therapy, as necessary. Based on a review of clinical data maintained by REAC/TS on acute occupational exposures, in 2003 FDA determined that Ca-DTPA and Zn-DTPA, when produced under conditions specified in an approved NDA, can be safe and effective for the treatment of internal contamination with plutonium, americium, and curium.[20] At the same time, FDA announced the availability of a guidance document, Calcium DTPA and Zinc DTPA Drug Products: Submitting a New Drug Application, to assist manufacturers who plan to submit NDAs for Ca-DTPA and Zn-DTPA. FDA has approved NDAs submitted by Hameln Pharmaceuticals GmbH for Ca- and Zn-DTPA.\n\nDTPAs bind uranium less well and are not expected to be effective for uranium contamination (see Ca-DTPA and Zn-DTPA product labeling at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/DTPA/default.htm). Uranium contamination has been treated with oral sodium bicarbonate, regulated to maintain an alkaline urine pH, and accompanied by diuretics.2 Oral sodium bicarbonate has not been approved in the United States for this indication.\n\nFootnote 2: See Breitenstein BD, Fry SA, and Lushbaugh CC (1990), DTPA Therapy: The US Experience 1958-1987. In The Medical Basis for Radiation Accident Preparedness, edited by RC Ricks and SA Fry, Amsterdam, Elsevier Science Publishing Co\n\n4. Potential Radioactive Contaminants and Possible Treatments\n\nRadioactive contaminants of immediate medical significance and possible treatments are listed in the following table.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAppendix E Animal Efficacy Rule\n\nIn May 2002, FDA promulgated a rule allowing for approval of new drug products based on animal data when adequate and well-controlled efficacy studies in humans cannot be ethically conducted because the studies would involve administering a potentially lethal or permanently disabling toxic substance or organism to healthy human volunteers, and field trials are not\n\nFootnote 23: The Animal Efficacy Rule is codified in 21 CFR part 314, subpart I for human drug products.\n\nEmergencies may arise necessitating human use of a decorporation agent still under development and for which approval under the Animal Efficacy Rule is not immediately feasible. Should this situation arise, it is conceivable that the product could be used under FDA's investigational new drug regulations in 21 CFR part 312 or under the emergency use authorization provision in section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) (21 U.S.C. 360bbb-3).\n\nii.2.1 Applying the Animal Efficacy Rule to Decorporation Agents\n\nFor decorporation agents used to enhance elimination or excretion of absorbed radioactive contaminants, animal studies may be used to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness only when (1) there is a reasonably well-understood pathophysiologic mechanism of the toxicity of the radioactive contaminant and its elimination or excretion by the decorporation agent, (2) the effect is demonstrated in more than one animal species expected to react with a response predictive for humans, unless the effect is demonstrated in a single animal species that represents a sufficiently well-characterized animal model for predicting the response in humans, (3) the animal study endpoint is clearly related to the desired benefit in humans, and (4) pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data or information in animals and humans are sufficient to allow selection of an effective dose in humans. It should be noted that animal efficacy studies are subject to the same good laboratory practice (GLP) requirements as animal toxicology studies (see Subsection III.D below).\n\nIn some situations, human efficacy studies using nontoxic levels of the radioactive contaminant or a stable, nonradioactive counterpart may be feasible and ethical. In such cases, approval could be based on efficacy standards described elsewhere in FDA's regulations, and evidence of effectiveness from animal studies alone would not be sufficient to support approval of a new product or a new indication for an already marketed product. Human efficacy studies would be needed to support marketing approval (see 21 CFR 314.600).\n\nEven if a new decorporation agent is eligible for approval under the Animal Efficacy Rule, that agent must still be evaluated for safety in humans; animal data is not sufficient to demonstrate safety (21 CFR 314.600). Products evaluated for effectiveness under the Animal Efficacy Rule must be evaluated for safety under preexisting requirements for establishing the safety of new drug products (21 CFR 314.600). FDA believes that the safety of these products (unlike their effectiveness) can be studied in human volunteers.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]\n\nalso the kinetics of the solution to solid (heterogeneous) exchange reaction. The synthetic procedure for manufacturing Prussian blue can produce insoluble solids of highly variable particle size, porosity, hydration, and defect impurities. In FDA's experience, it was important to consider the effects of all these factors on Prussian blue's cesium exchange properties.\n\nAnimal Efficacy Studies\n\nUnder the Animal Efficacy Rule, a sponsor can rely on animal studies to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness for certain new drug products intended to reduce or prevent the toxicity of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear substances. Under SSS 314.610(a)(2), one of the requirements for approval based on effectiveness data from animals alone is that the effect be demonstrated in more than one animal species expected to react with a response predictive for humans, unless the effect is demonstrated in a single animal species that represents a sufficiently well-characterized animal model for predicting the response in humans. Determination of the number of animal studies needed to support approval of a particular NDA will be made on a case-by-case basis, as will the determination of what constitutes a sufficiently well-characterized animal model for a given product or indication. In FDA's experience, animal efficacy studies found in the published literature or conducted without the express purpose of supporting regulatory submissions have often lacked adequate scientific rigor. Furthermore, unless there are sufficient pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic data to conclude that a rodent species will adequately predict the human response, FDA believes that the effectiveness of a proposed decorporation agent will need to be demonstrated in a second, probably nonrodent, animal species.\n\n1.1.1 Considerations Regarding Efficacy Studies Supporting Approval\n\nThe following considerations and study characteristics are important in designing and interpreting the animal studies that will be used to support product approval (this list is not comprehensive):\n\nEvaluation of efficacy in an appropriate animal species; the pharmacokinetic profile of the product and the distribution of the radioactive contaminant in the selected species should be similar to what is observed or expected in humans.\n--------------------\nContext title: Internal Radioactive Contamination —Development of Decorporation Agents""]","['No. FDA has made recommendations on the lowest effective dose.

The process includes four sequential parts: image acquisition (scanning), image processing, image file storage, and display of images. The FDA does not consider the resulting digital image to be an exact copy of the glass slide. A whole slide image used in a GLP-compliant study should include all the elements from the glass slide that are needed for histopathological examination or pathology peer review.\n\nFootnote 4: Digital images comprise a sequence of small images (referred to as tiles) taken from distinct locations on the glass slide. Whole slide imaging systems typically determine the optimal focal plane at a limited, discrete set of locations on the glass slide and interpolate the optimal focal plane to generate all of the tiles. The individual tiles are then combined to create the “whole slide” image.\n\nQ2: Should whole slide images be retained?\n\nA2: For GLP-compliant nonclinical toxicology studies, if whole slide images are assessed in lieu of the original glass slides and result in the generation of pathology raw data, the whole slide image files should be retained as study records and archived. Consideration should be given to ensure that archived digital images remain viewable as software/hardware updates/versions are implemented.\n\nQ3: If the whole slide image files are retained, should the glass slides also be retained?\n\nA3: Yes. The glass slides contain study specimens and must be retained as study specimens after study finalization in accordance with 21 CFR part 58.\n\nQ4: What should be retained with respect to the whole slide image file? Should modified whole slide image files be retained?\n\nA4: The whole slide image files provided to the study pathologist for histopathological examination and/or provided to the peer review pathologist(s) for pathology peer review (i.e., files containing all image data captured by the scanner and documentation of any technical image processing modifications), referred to here as the original whole slide image files, should be retained if they are used to generate raw data. Specifically, any technical image processing modifications made to whole slide image files prior to being provided to the pathologist (e.g., smoothing, color manipulation) should be documented and retained. Technical image processing should not obscure elements captured from the glass slide (e.g., label, artifact).\n\nThe pathologist should not permanently alter the original whole slide image files. Nonpermanent adjustments made by the pathologist using the image viewing software during whole slide image evaluation (e.g., brightness, contrast, annotations) do not need to be documented or retained.\n\nQ5: Should written procedures for whole slide imaging processes be in place?\n\nA5: Yes, written procedures for whole slide imaging processes should be in place because whole slide images may be used to generate raw data. These processes may include, for example, training, slide scanning, software management, and file access and exchange control.\n\nQ6: Should the whole slide imaging system be validated?\n\nA6: If the whole slide images are used to generate raw data, the whole slide imaging system (including software and hardware) should be validated in a manner specific to the intended use of the technology.\n\nQ7: Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n\nA7: If the whole slide images are used to generate raw data, they should be protected to prevent loss or alteration of data, maintain chain of custody, control access, and secure data systems and data transmission. These measures should be performed following written procedures and processes in compliance with electronic record requirements under 21 CFR part 11 to maintain whole slide image file integrity.\n\nQ8: Should the signed pathology report/peer review statement state that whole slide images were evaluated in lieu of glass slides?\n\nA8: Yes, the signed pathology report should state whether glass slides or whole slide images were used for histopathological evaluation by the study pathologist, consistent with 21 CFR 58.\n\nContents\n\n1 Introduction\n\n2 Preliminaries\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_POST]\n\nuidance for Industry Pathology Peer Review in Nonclinical Toxicology Studies: Questions and Answers (December 2021).

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides information to sponsors and nonclinical laboratories regarding the use and management of whole slide images used during histopathology assessment and/or pathology peer review performed for good laboratory practice (GLP)-compliant nonclinical toxicology studies using non-human specimens.2 The guidance does not cover the use of whole slide imaging for clinical applications. When whole slide imaging is used as part of a nonclinical study conducted in compliance with the GLP regulations (21 CFR part 58), adequate documentation is critical. The FDA's expectations regarding documentation practices during generation, use, and retention of whole slide images have not been clearly defined and vary among nonclinical testing facilities. This question-and-answer document is intended to clarify FDA's recommendations concerning the management, documentation, and use of whole slide imaging in histopathology assessment and/or pathology peer review for nonclinical studies conducted in compliance with the GLP regulations.\n\nFootnote 2: We support the principles of the “3Rs,” to reduce, refine, and replace animal use in testing when feasible. We encourage sponsors to consult with us if they wish to use a non-animal testing method they believe is suitable, adequate, validated, and feasible. We will consider if such an alternative method could be assessed for equivalency to an animal test method.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe histopathological assessment of tissue samples is one of the key activities conducted during GLP-compliant nonclinical laboratory studies. Commonly, the histopathological assessment includes an initial evaluation of glass histology slides3 by the study pathologist and a subsequent review (referred to as pathology peer review) by a second pathologist, group of pathologists, or Pathology Working Group. When whole slide imaging is used as part of a nonclinical study conducted in compliance with the GLP regulations, the management, documentation, and use of whole slide images in histopathology assessment and/or pathology peer review should be clear and follow written processes and procedures.\n\nFootnote 3: In the context of this guidance, the term histology slide refers to tissue mounted on a microscope slide, including organ sections and cell samples such as bone marrow and other cytological preparations.\n\nUse of whole slide images in casual consultations, opinion exchanges, and/or mentoring among pathologists is not covered by this guidance document.\n\nIII Questions and Answers\n\nQ1: What is whole slide imaging?\n\nA1: Whole slide imaging includes the software and hardware used to generate a two-dimensional digital image4 of a glass histology slide used for routine assessment in generation of the pathology report.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to provide industry and agency staff with recommendations regarding the technical performance assessment data that should be provided for regulatory evaluation of a digital whole slide imaging (WSI) system. This document does not cover the clinical submission data that may be necessary to support approval or clearance. This document provides our suggestions on how to best characterize the technical aspects that are relevant to WSI performance for their intended use and determine any possible limitations that might affect their safety and effectiveness.\n\nRecent technological advances in digital microscopy, in particular the development of whole slide scanning systems, have accelerated the adoption of digital imaging in pathology, similar to the digital transformation that radiology departments have experienced over the last decade. FDA regulates WSI system manufacturers to help ensure that the images intended for clinical uses are reasonably safe and effective for such purposes. Essential to the regulation of these systems is the understanding of the technical performance of the WSI system and the components in the imaging chain, from image acquisition to image display and their effect on pathologist\'s diagnostic performance and workflow. Prior to performing non-technical analytical studies (i.e., those using clinical samples) and clinical studies to evaluate a digital imaging system\'s performance, the manufacturer should first determine the technical characteristics that are relevant to such performance for its intended use and determine any possible limitations\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:9]\n\n(\\bullet) Condenser\n\n(\\circ) Illumination format (e.g., Kohler, critical)\n\n(\\circ) Manufacturer and model\n\n(\\circ) Numerical aperture\n\n(\\circ) Focal length\n\n(\\circ) Working distance\n\n(\\bullet) Auxiliary lens(es)\n\n(\\circ) Manufacturer\n\n(\\circ) Lens type\n\n(\\circ) Focal length\n\n(\\bullet) Magnification of imaging optics: ISO 8039:2014 Optics and optical instruments\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]\n\n352IV(A)(6). Image Processing Software\n\n353IV(A)(6)(a). Description\n\n355Image processing software refers to the embedded software components of the image\n\n357acquisition device. It typically includes control algorithms for image capture and\n\n358processing algorithms for raw data conversion into the digital image file.

Image Composition\n\n377IV(A)(7)(a). Description\n\n378(\\bullet) Image composition is a step present in systems that produce whole slide images as\n\n380opposed to individual fields of view. Whole slide scanning is typically performed in\n\n381accordance with the positioning of a stage that moves in submicron steps. At each\n\n382location of the stage movement, an image of the field of view is acquired. Images can be\n\n383acquired with a degree of overlapping (redundancy) between them to avoid gaps in data\n\n384collection. Images can also be acquired at different depths of focus followed by the\n\n385application of focusing algorithms. At the end of this process, all acquired images are\n\n386combined (stitched) together to create a composite high resolution image. There are a\n\n387number of features that can affect this process, and they are listed below.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA believes the policy set forth in this guidance may help address these urgent public health concerns by helping to expand the availability of remote digital pathology devices during this public health emergency. Increased availability of these devices may help to facilitate continuity of patient care by preventing disruptions to critical pathology services rendered by clinical laboratories, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities, and by reducing healthcare personnel contact and risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIII Scope\n\nThe enforcement policy described in this guidance applies to the following devices (""digital pathology devices""), which may be used during the COVID-19 public health emergency, when they are intended for use in remote reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides:\n\nTable 1\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \\hline\nClassification Regulation & Device Type & Product Code3 & Class \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.1860 & Automated Digital Image Manual Interpretation Microscope & OEO & II \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Whole Slide Imaging System & PSY & II \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Digital Pathology Image Viewing and Management & QKQ & II \\  & Software & & \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Digital Pathology Display & PZZ & II \\ \\hline \\end{tabular} Although the digital pathology devices listed above are typically used in clinical laboratories, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities, as further discussed in Section IV below, many of these devices possess the capability for reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides from remote locations.\n\nIV Policy\n\nOverview\n\nIn the context of the COVID-19 public health emergency, expanding the availability of remote digital pathology devices may help facilitate pathology services while reducing healthcare personnel contact and risk of potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) (42 U.S.C. 263a) require that clinical laboratories, including those within hospitals and other healthcare settings, obtain a certificate before accepting materials derived from the human body for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or the impairment of, or assessment of the health of human beings.4 Digital pathology devices have not been cleared for home use or categorized as waived by FDA and as a result, these devices have been limited to use in clinical laboratories, hospitals, and other healthcare settings that are CLIA-certified to perform nonwaived testing. However, in light of the COVID-19 public health emergency, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a memorandum on March 26, 2020, describing its exercise of enforcement discretion to ensure pathologists may review pathology slides and images remotely. The CMS memorandum states that laboratories that choose to utilize temporary testing sites (e.g., for remote review and reporting of slides/images) may do so if certain criteria outlined in the memorandum are met.5\n\nFootnote 4: For more information, see FDA’s guidance “Administrative Procedures for CLIA Categorization: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff”, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/administrative-procedures-clia-categorization.\n\nFootnote 5: See the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Memorandum, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Laboratory Guidance During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, March 26, 2020, https://www.cms.gov/medicareprovider-enrollment-and-certificationsurveycertificationgeninfopolicy-and-memos-states-and/clinical-laboratory-improvement-amendments-clia-laboratory-guidance-during-covid-19-public-health.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \\hline\nClassification Regulation & Device Type & Product Code3 & Class \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.1860 & Automated Digital Image Manual Interpretation Microscope & OEO & II \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Whole Slide Imaging System & PSY & II \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Digital Pathology Image Viewing and Management & QKQ & II \\  & Software & & \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Digital Pathology Display & PZZ & II \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1:\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn general, manufacturers of the digital pathology devices listed in Table 1 are required to submit a premarket notification under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act and receive FDA clearance prior to marketing these devices in the United States, as well as comply with post-marketing requirements.\n\nFDA recognizes that greater access to remote digital pathology devices may help facilitate the remote reviewing and reporting of pathology slides during this public health emergency which, in turn, may help facilitate continuity of patient care and reduce healthcare personnel contact and risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. For that reason, for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency, FDA does not intend to object to:\n\nmodifications to the FDA-cleared indications, functionality, hardware and/or software, of digital pathology devices identified in Table 1 above to provide for use in a remote setting, or\n\nthe marketing of new digital pathology devices of the types identified in Table 1 that are intended for use in remote settings and that are not currently 510(k) cleared for any use,\n\nwithout compliance with the following regulatory requirements, where such devices do not create an undue risk in light of the public health emergency: submission of a premarket notification under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 807.81,6 Good Manufacturing Practice requirements in 21 CFR Part 820, and Unique Device Identification (UDI) requirements in 21 CFR Part 830 and 21 CFR 801.20.\n\nFootnote 6: For further guidance on modifications that trigger the requirement that a manufacturer submit a new premarket notification (510(k)) to FDA, refer to “Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,” https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/deciding-when-submit-510k-change-existing-device.\n\nAdditionally, for remote digital pathology devices subject to this policy, FDA does not intend to enforce compliance with the special controls identified in 21 CFR 864.1860 (which are described in a special controls document for the submission of immunohistochemistry applications to the FDA7) and 21 CFR 864.3700 (83 FR 22), which includes requirements for the content of a premarket notification submission for a whole slide imaging system, where such devices or modifications do not create an undue risk in light of the public health emergency.\n\nFootnote 7: For more information, see “Guidance for Submission of Immunohistochemistry Applications to the Food and Drug Administration,” https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/guidance-documents-medical-devices-and-radiation-emitting-products/guidance-submission-immunohistochemistry-applications-food-and-drug-administration-final-guidance.\n\nFDA believes such devices will not create such an undue risk where the performance and labeling elements in Section 2.2.2 are met.\n\nAppendix B Labeling and Performance\n\nFDA believes such devices will not create such an undue risk when the following circumstances related to the performance of the device and the product labeling, including instructions specific to remote use, are present. FDA encourages firms to discuss any alternatives to these recommendations with FDA (CDRH-COVID19-DigitalPathology/fda.hhs.gov).\n\nFDA recommends that remote digital pathology devices use labeling that helps users better understand the device or device modifications, including instructions specific for remote use, such as:\n\nInstructions for clinical laboratories, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities to help them determine if remote reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides is feasible and appropriate based on an evaluation of their own information technology (IT) infrastructure and remote use environment for individual pathologists. FDA recommends that laboratories and hospitals consider performing a validation study where they deem necessary before remote reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides at a remote location.\n\nInstructions recommending that pathologists using such devices during the COVID-19 public health emergency use their clinical judgment to determine whether the quality of the images from the remote digital pathology devices are sufficient for interpretation of the pathological images.\n\nFDA recommends that manufacturers consider evaluating the performance of the device in accordance with the following FDA recognized standards, including (as applicable):\n\n_Medical Electrical Equipment\n\nPart 1: General Requirements for Basic Safety and Essential Performance_\n\n_Medical Electrical Equipment Part 1-2: General Requirements for Basic Safety and Essential Performance\n\nCollateral Standard: Electromagnetic Disturbances\n\nRequirements and Tests_\n\nAdditionally, while no device-specific performance recommendations are included in this enforcement policy, CLIA regulations and State law (including those related to performance) apply, although some CLIA regulations may be subject to CMS enforcement policies during this public health emergency.8\n\nFootnote 8: See the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Memorandum, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Laboratory Guidance During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, March 26, 2020, https://www.cms.gov/medicareprovider-enrollment-and-cerificationsurveycertificationgeninfopolicy-and-memos-states-and/clinical-laboratory-improvement-amendments-clia-laboratory-guidance-during-covid-19-public-health.\n--------------------\nContext title: Enforcement Policy for Remote Digital Pathology Devices During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry, Clinical Laboratories, Healthcare Facilities, Pathologists, and Food and Drug Administration Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n--------------------\nContext: If reformatting of data is done as part of the transfer described in question 4 above, is the new file not raw data even if all data is transferred intact although in a different organization? The Agency can not precisely answer this question without further details of the new data format.\n\nAre initials and dates on data printouts (e.g., scintillation counters, gas chromatographs), when these printouts include standards, sufficient documentation for standardization? Yes.\n\nIs there a time limit for submission of the final report of a nonclinical laboratory study after its conclusion? Generally no. On occasion, for marketed products, the Agency may establish time frames for study conduct. Of course alarming findings on marketed products should be reported as soon as possible.\n\nIs it permissible to list changes in a final report on a page, which is appended, to the original final report? Yes.\n\nDoes ""studies in progress on June 20, 1979"" refer to the phase of dosing of the test system or the phase post-dosing but not yet reported? The quotation pertains to all studies for which the final report has not yet been completed. Included are all post-dosing phases.\n\nThe final report requires a list of participants. Should this include technicians as well as people who perform support functions?The final report should include the name of the study director, the names of other scientists or professionals, and the names of all supervisory personnel involved in the study.\n\nWhen an analysis protocol is developed for the first time by using standard scientific technique, who shall validate the protocol?\n\nThe Agency does not per se validate protocols. Persons developing new protocols may submit them to the responsible bureau for review and comment prior to initiating a nonclinical laboratory study.\n* One of the testing deficiencies found in the early Agency investigations of nonclinical studies was protocol changes that were made without informing the sponsor. The changes prejudiced the validity of the studies. Accordingly, the GLPs require that each study have a specific protocol, which is attested to by the sponsor.\n* The identity of the individual collecting data entered into a computer can be recorded via the use of a code known only to the individual but directly identifying the individual; similarly the identity of the individuals witnessing or reviewing the data can be recorded. Is this acceptable?\n\nYes, this procedure is acceptable. The key to the code must be made available to Agency investigators. Do note, however, the final GLPs do not require that data entries need be witnessed by a second person.\n* Does the following proposal on data entry to computer files satisfy the GLP intent?\n\nData is entered through keyboard commands and stored in a ""temporary"" computer file with accompanying date, time, and analyst codes. The analyst may be technician level personnel. At the conclusion of a set of observations, no more than one day\'s worth, the data in the ""temporary file"" is reviewed by a scientist (this person may or may not be the same person who entered the original data) and ""corrected"" for any typing or entry errors. When it is determined that the data are correct, the data are transferred to a ""permanent"" computer file. Only authorized personnel may make changes to the ""permanent"" file.\n\nNo audit trail is kept for changes to ""temporary"" file. All changes to permanent file are recorded in a change file with appropriate data, personnel code, and comments regarding reason for change and original entry.\n\nNo. This method would permit unauthorized tampering with the temporary file before the raw data are transferred to the permanent file.\n* When should a protocol amendment issue? Should it be as soon as possible or could a list of all deviations from a protocol be prepared at the end of the study?If the deviation from the protocol is intended to be permanent, the protocol should be amended as soon as possible. If the deviation is an error, it should be promptly corrected and noted in the raw data.\n* 16. Section 58.120 describes a sixteen-part protocol and section 58.185 describes a fourteen part final report. Must all of these be included in protocols and reports for LD 50\'s and other short-term tests?\n\nYes.\n* 17. Is a protocol required for routine research and experimentation?\n\nProtocols are required for all studies covered by the GLPs.\n* 18. If all raw data are not required in a final report, does this mean, for example, that weekly body weight or food intake averages can be in a report without the individual animal data?\n\nThe data appearing in a final report depends on the type of study and the kind of regulated product. Specific advice can be obtained by contacting the Agency bureau, which has responsibility for the regulated product.\n* 19. If a compound or formula is proprietary, must the final report describe its detailed composition or chemical structure?\n\nIf the proprietary material is a commercially available article to be used as a control, the final report need only describe the trade or chemical name, the source and the manufacturer\'s batch number.\n* 20. How does the requirement for ""approval"" of protocols apply to ""in house"" studies which are\' conducted in the laboratories of the actual ""sponsor?"" Who approves? What is an ""approved"" protocol?\n\nThe word ""approved"" was retained in the final order to emphasize that a sponsor should have a mechanism for evaluation and approval of initial protocols and all amendments. The specifics of the mechanism can vary but a formal mechanism should be in place.\n* 21. Must the protocol contain both the name and the code number of the test article?\n\nNo, either designation is acceptable.\n* 22. Section 58.120 states that the protocol shall contain the records to be maintained. Is this intended as a detailed list of each data form to be generated?No, in this case generalized statements would be satisfactory.\n23. How much raw data must be entered into notebooks when performing well-documented routine tests? Basically, the GLPs define raw data as the immediate results of original observations. All such immediate results must be entered.\n24. What is meant by the statement in section 58.120(a)(12), which pertains to the method by which the degree of absorption of the test and control articles by the test system will be determined? The GLPs do not mandate that absorption studies need be done, or which kind of study is satisfactory. The GLPs do require, however, that the protocol describe the method used if one is necessary to achieve the study objectives.\n25. Please clarify the issue of having to provide reasons for all corrections to data entries. It seems unreasonable to require reasons for ""obvious"" error corrections such as misspellings, transposed numbers, and wrong year early in a calendar year. It must be remembered that ""raw data"" is basically the results of original observations. Thus, the wrong year is not raw data and can be easily corrected. Misspellings may or may not be raw data whereas in all probability numbers are raw data. The Agency believes that it is sometimes difficult for a second party, such as the personnel in your quality assurance unit, to distinguish ""obvious"" errors. Consequently, the Agency insists that all corrections to raw data entries be justified.\n26. How and to what extent is the selection of the test system to be justified in the protocol? Usually, the test system is selected after consideration of the state-of-the-art of toxicology testing in the area of interest. The protocol need not contain extensive justification.\n27. Are we expected to label all specimens (e.g. serum, blood, urine, tissue slides) with their exact nature?\n\nYes. Such information is useful in preventing mix-ups.\n28. Why does ""test system, study, nature and date of collection"" have to be located on a specimen container? Can such information be coded?Specimen refers to any material derived from a test system for examination or analysis. Consequently, blood, tissues, urine, feces, etc. are considered to be specimens whose containers must carry the required label information. Such information will help preclude mix-ups in the subsequent handling of the specimens. Accession numbers or code numbers can be used for samples of specimens, which are subjected to further analysis. For example, in histopathology the excised fixed tissue is a specimen, which must carry all the label information. However, the blocks and slides prepared from that tissue could be identified by accession numbers. Similarly, in tissue residue analysis, the excised tissue is a specimen; whereas, tissue samples, which are homogenized and otherwise prepared for further analysis, are not specimens and need not carry full labeling.\n\n58.185 Reporting of Nonclinical Laboratory Study Results\n\n58.190 Storage and Retrieval of Records and Data\n\n58.195 Retention of Records\n\nWhat types of storage conditions are required for the storage of retained specimens?\n\nThe Agency has not developed guidelines for storage conditions. The Agency does not expect heroic measures to be used, but conditions should be reasonable in light of the nature of the specimen. Storage conditions, which foster accelerated deterioration, should be avoided.\n\nIn section 58.185, it is stated that test and control article identification and characterization must appear in the final report signed by the study director. However, if the study director is affiliated with a contract laboratory, he/she has no need to know such details of a proprietary test article. Do you agree that such information can be appended to the final report by the sponsor rather than be provided by the study director?\n\nYes.\n\nIs the storage of archival material (tissues, slides, raw data) the responsibility of the testing laboratory or can this responsibility be assigned to the sponsor of the study?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry'

This Question and Answer (Q&A) document is intended to respond to those requests.\n\nThe ICH Q7 document should be read in its entirety regardless of the nature of the manufacturing activities being conducted to fully understand the linkages between certain sections and successfully implement appropriate Good Manufacturing practices (GMPs) at all stages of the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) supply chain, including distribution. A table is provided as an Annex of this document showing the link between each Q&A and the relevant Sections of ICH Q7 and other ICH Quality guidance.\n\nICH would like to acknowledge the work undertaken by the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S). PIC/S contributed to this document by selecting and reviewing relevant Q&As that had been collected from training sessions since the implementation of Q7 and transferred the output of these reviews to the ICH Q7 IWG for consideration and consolidation, as appropriate. Additional questions were developed based on responses from an ICH survey. PIC/S further contributed to the development of the document as an ICH Interested Party.\n\nPlease note that ICH Q7 should be applied in combination with the principles laid down for development and manufacturing in ICH Q11 (see definition of API starting material; see also ICH Q8(R2) Part II), Quality Risk Management (ICH Q9), and Pharmaceutical Quality Systems (ICH Q10). GMP principles as described in ICH Q7 should be applied regardless which approach is taken in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing.\n\nICH Q7 also describes principles of GMPs to be applied in the manufacture of APIs for use in clinical trials (Section 19) and for APIs manufactured by cell culture/fermentation (Section 18).\n\nDated: 10 June 2015\n\n1 INTRODUCTION - SCOPE\n\n1.2 & June 2015 & Does ICH Q7 apply to manufacturing Steps for the addition of substance(s) to an API (e.g., to stabilise the API)? & When a mixture is classified in the regulatory filing as an API in a region or country in which it is used in a drug product, ICH Q7 should be applied to the manufacturing of these mixtures [ICH Q7, Section 1.2, 20 - see Glossary for definition of 'API'].\n\n2 QUALITY MANAGEMENT\n\n3.

However, experience gained with the implementation of ICH Q7 since the approval in November 2000 shows that uncertainties related to the interpretation of some sections exist. Furthermore, the importance of the application of the life-cycle approach addressed in the new ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, Q10 Guidelines to API manufacturing procedures is emphasized by the ICH Quality Implementation Working Group (Quality IWG). Technical issues with regard to GMP of APIs - also in context with new ICH Guidelines - need to be addressed in order to harmonize expectations during inspections.\n\nA document would be helpful in removing these ambiguities and uncertainties and also in harmonizing the inspections of both small molecules and biotech APIs.\n\nIssues to be resolved\n\nThe following issues have so far been identified by practical experience and will need to be addressed in a Q&A document on Q7:\n\nOutput from the review of existing Q&As (e.g., from PIC/S Expert Circle on APIs, from initial Regulatory/PDA training 2002) currently underway by PIC/S teams will be considered for endorsement.\n\nTechnical issues for clarification such as application in the supply chain control, contractor/supplier management (outsourcing), monitoring of impurity profiles, quality systems, applicability to biologicals/biotech and relationship with Q5D, and GMP expectations in the development phase (manufacturing for clinical trials).\n\nImpact of the implementation of ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, and Q10 on Q7 (see also Quality IWG Q&As and Points to Consider).\n\nBackground to the Proposal\n\nIt has become apparent, based on the approval and implementation of ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11 principles into GMP of APIs that certain individual implementation approaches are leading to non harmonized interpretation and new expectations beyond the intention of ICH Q7. The Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme (PIC/S) launched the 'International Collaboration on APIs - Training programme on ICH Q7'. This training programme includes a basic training, an advanced training and a Q&A document on interpretation of ICH Q7. This provides a feedback by the global knowledge of its network of inspectors. PIC/S will be supportive of the Q7 IWG work.\n\nType of Implementation Working Group and Resources\n\nThe Q7 IWG should comprise of the Six ICH Parties (2 experts per Party), Observers to ICH (1 expert per Observer), RHIs, DRAs and DoH (1 expert per RHI/DRA/DoH), and Interested Parties (WSNI, IGPA, Biotechnology Industry, PIC/S, API Industry and CEP programme of EDQM, 1 expert per Interested Party).\n\nTiming\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Q&As Concept Paper""

It is also intended to help ensure that APIs meet the requirements for quality and purity that they purport or are represented to possess.\n\nIn this Guide ""manufacturing"" is defined to include all operations of receipt of materials, production, packaging, repackaging, labelling, relabelling, quality control, release, storage and distribution of APIs and the related controls. In this Guide the term ""should"" indicates recommendations that are expected to apply unless shown to be inapplicable or replaced by an alternative demonstrated to provide at least an equivalent level of quality assurance. For the purposes of this Guide, the terms ""current good manufacturing practices"" and ""good manufacturing practices"" are equivalent.\n\nThe Guide as a whole does not cover safety aspects for the personnel engaged in the manufacture, nor aspects of protection of the environment. These controls are inherent responsibilities of the manufacturer and are governed by national laws.\n\nThis Guide is not intended to define registration/filing requirements or modify pharmacopoeial requirements. This Guide does not affect the ability of the responsible regulatory agency to establish specific registration/filing requirements regarding APIs within the context of marketing/manufacturing authorizations or drug applications.

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , How should the ICH Q7 document be read?\n--------------------\nContext: It is important that the CGMP regulations are harmonized to the extent possible with other widely used quality management systems, including ISO 9000, non-U.S. pharmaceutical quality management requirements, and FDA's own medical device quality system regulations. This guidance serves as a first step to highlight common elements between the CGMP regulations and Quality Management Systems. With the globalization of pharmaceutical manufacturing and the increasing prevalence of drug- and biologic-device combination products, the convergence of quality management principles across different regions and among various product types is very desirable.\n\nThe FDA has concluded that modern quality systems, when coupled with manufacturing process and product knowledge and the use of effective risk management practices, can handle many types of changes to facilities, equipment, and processes without the need for prior approval regulatory submissions. Manufacturers with a robust quality system and appropriate process knowledge can implement many types of improvements. In addition, an effective quality system, by lowering the risk of manufacturing problems, may result in shorter and fewer FDA inspections.\n\nA quality system can provide the necessary framework for implementing quality by design4 (building in quality from the development phase and throughout a product's life cycle), continual improvement, and risk management in the drug manufacturing process. A quality system adopted by a manufacturer can be tailored to fit the specific environment, taking into account factors such as scope of operations, complexity of processes, and appropriate use of finite resources. Footnote 4: See ICH Q8 Pharmaceutical Development.\n\nScope of the Guidance\n\nThis guidance applies to manufacturers of drug products (finished pharmaceuticals), including products regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). It may also be useful to manufacturers of components (including active pharmaceutical ingredients) used in the manufacture of these products.\n\nThis document is not intended to create new requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturing that go beyond those established in the current regulations, nor is the guidance intended to be a guide for the conduct of FDA inspections. Rather, the document explains how implementing comprehensive quality systems can help manufacturers achieve compliance with 21 CFR parts210 and 211. Although the QS working group found that many of the quality system elements correlate with specific CGMP requirements, some do not. The Agency expects compliance with CGMP regulations, and FDA's inspection program will remain focused on compliance with those regulations.\n\nOrganization of this Guidance\n\nTo provide a reference familiar to industry, the quality systems model described in section IV of this guidance is organized -- in its major sections -- according to the structure of international quality standards. Major sections of the model include the following:\n\nManagement Responsibilities\n\nResources\n\nManufacturing Operations\n\nEvaluation Activities\n\nUnder each of these sections the key elements found in modern quality systems are discussed. When an element correlates with a CGMP regulatory requirement, that correlation is noted. In some cases, a specific CGMP regulation is discussed in more detail as it relates to a quality system element. At the end of each section, a table is included listing the quality system elements of that section and the specific CGMP regulations with which they correlate. A glossary is included at the end of the document.\n\nIII CGMPS and the Concepts of Modern Quality Systems\n\nSeveral key concepts are critical for any discussion of modern quality systems. The following concepts are used throughout this guidance as they relate to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.\n\nQuality\n\nEvery pharmaceutical product has established identity, strength, purity, and other quality characteristics designed to ensure the required levels of safety and effectiveness. For the purposes of this guidance document, the phrase achieving quality means achieving these characteristics for a product.\n\nQuality by Design and Product Development\n\nQuality by design means designing and developing a product and associated manufacturing processes that will be used during product development to ensure that the product consistently attains a predefined quality at the end of the manufacturing process.5 Quality by design, in conjunction with a quality system, provides a sound framework for the transfer of product knowledge and process understanding from drug development to the commercial manufacturing processes and for post-development changes and optimization. The CGMP regulations, when viewed in their entirety, incorporate the concept of quality by design. This guidance describes how these elements fit together.\n\nAppendix C Quality Risk Management\n\nQuality risk management is a valuable component of an effective quality systems framework.6 Quality risk management can, for example, help guide the setting of specifications and process parameters for drug manufacturing, assess and mitigate the risk of changing a process or specification, and determine the extent of discrepancy investigations and corrective actions.\n\nFootnote 6: See ICH Q9 Quality Risk Management.\n\nCAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action)\n\nCAPA is a well-known CGMP regulatory concept that focuses on investigating, understanding, and correcting discrepancies while attempting to prevent their recurrence. Quality system models discuss CAPA as three separate concepts, all of which are used in this guidance.\n\nRemedial corrections of an identified problem\n\nRoot cause analysis with corrective action to help understand the cause of the deviation and potentially prevent recurrence of a similar problem\n\nPreventive action to avert recurrence of a similar potential problem\n\nChange Control\n\nChange control is another well-known CGMP concept that focuses on managing change to prevent unintended consequences. The CGMP regulations provide for change control primarily through the assigned responsibilities of the quality control unit. Certain major manufacturing changes (e.g., changes that alter specifications, a critical product attribute or bioavailability) require regulatory filings and prior regulatory approval (21 CFR 314.70, 514.8, and 601.12).\n\nEffective change control activities (e.g., quality planning and control of revisions to specifications, process parameters, procedures) are key components of any quality system. In this guidance, change is discussed in terms of creating a regulatory environment that encourages change towards continual improvement. This means a manufacturer is empowered to make changes subject to the regulations based on the variability of materials used in manufacturing and process improvements resulting from knowledge gained during a product's lifecycle.\n\nAppendix F The Quality Unit\n\nMany of the modern quality system concepts described here correlate very closely with the CGMP regulations (refer to the charts later in the document). Current industry practice generally divides the responsibilities of the quality control unit (QCU), as defined in the CGMP regulations, between quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) functions.\n\nQC usually involves (1) assessing the suitability of incoming components, containers, closures, labeling, in-process materials, and the finished products; (2) evaluating the performance of the manufacturing process to ensure adherence to proper specifications and limits; and (3) determining the acceptability of each batch for release.\n\nQA primarily involves (1) review and approval of all procedures related to production and maintenance, (2) review of associated records, and (3) auditing and performing/evaluating trend analyses.\n\nThis guidance uses the term quality unit7 (QU) to reflect modern practice while remaining consistent with the CGMP definition in SS 210.3(b)(15). The concept of a quality unit is also consistent with modern quality systems in ensuring that the various operations associated with all systems are appropriately planned, approved, conducted, and monitored.\n\nFootnote 7: Generally, the term quality unit is used in this guidance. However, quality control unit is used when directly quoting parts 210 and 211.\n\nThe CGMP regulations specifically assign the QU the authority to create, monitor, and implement a quality system. Such activities do not substitute for, or preclude, the daily responsibility of manufacturing personnel to build quality into the product. The QU should not take on the responsibilities of other units of a manufacturer's organization, such as the responsibilities handled by manufacturing personnel, engineers, and development scientists.8 Manufacturing personnel and the QU are both critical in fulfilling the manufacturer's responsibility to produce quality products.\n\nFootnote 8: See Reference #1, comment 91.\n\nOther CGMP assigned responsibilities of the QU are consistent with modern quality system approaches (SS 211.22):\n\nEnsuring that controls are implemented and completed satisfactorily during manufacturing operations\n\nEnsuring that developed procedures and specifications are appropriate and followed, including those used by a firm under contract to the manufacturer\n\nApproving or rejecting incoming materials, in-process materials, and drug products\n\nReviewing production records and investigating any unexplained discrepancies\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations""]","['The ICH Q7 document should be read in its entirety regardless of the nature of the manufacturing activities being conducted to fully understand the linkages between certain sections and successfully implement appropriate good manufacturing practices (GMPs) at all stages of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) supply chain, including distribution.

It does not create any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist institutional review boards (IRBs), clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA\'s informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. This guidance supersedes FDA\'s guidance entitled ""A Guide to Informed Consent,"" issued in September 1998, and finalizes FDA\'s draft guidance entitled ""Informed Consent Information Sheet,"" issued in July 2014. This document is structured to first present general guidance on FDA\'s regulatory requirements for informed consent and a discussion of the roles of IRBs, clinical investigators, sponsors, and FDA related to informed consent, followed by a series of frequently asked questions.\n\nIn a final rule published on January 19, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal departments and agencies revised the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects. The final rule became effective in 2018 (codified for HHS at 45 CFR 46, subpart A; ""the 2018 Common Rule"").2,3 The 2018 Common Rule sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by federal departments or agencies that have adopted the Common Rule. The revisions include significant changes to the provisions regarding informed consent. FDA is currently engaged in notice and comment rulemaking to harmonize its human subject protection\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nof the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Summary of the Consent process\n\nTo many, the term informed consent is mistakenly viewed as synonymous with obtaining a subject\'s signature on the consent form;9 however, obtaining documentation of a subject\'s informed consent is only part of the consent process. Informed consent involves providing a prospective subject, or their legally authorized representative (LAR), with adequate information to allow for an informed decision about participation in the clinical investigation prior to enrollment. Informed consent also involves facilitating the prospective subject\'s understanding of the information, providing adequate opportunity for the prospective subject to ask questions and to consider whether to participate, obtaining the prospective subject\'s voluntary agreement to participate prior to enrollment, and continuing to provide information as the clinical investigation progresses or as the enrolled subject or situation requires.10\n\nFootnote 9: In this guidance document, the terms informed consent form and informed consent document are used interchangeably.\n\nExcept as provided in 21 CFR 50.23 and 50.24,11 (see section III.A.1, ""Exceptions to Informed Consent""), no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in FDA-regulated research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s LAR (21CFR 50.20).12 To be legally effective, the informed consent process must satisfy the general requirements under 21 CFR 50.20 and include the relevant elements of informed consent described at 21 CFR 50.25 (see section3), ""FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion"").\n\nFootnote 12: As described in guidance, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances, with respect to its current regulations governing the requirement for informed consent when human specimens are used for FDA-regulated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device investigations. See “Guidance on Informed Consent for in Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable: Guidance for Sponsors, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff”, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-informed- Consent-vitro-diagnostic-device-studies-using-leftover-human-specimens-are-not\n\nFDA considers advertising used to recruit subjects into the clinical trial to be the start of the ongoing consent process, and the information provided in any online or hard copy recruitment materials should be consistent with the informed consent document. Generally, FDA recommends that any advertisement to recruit subjects be limited to the information the prospective subjects need to determine their interest and potential eligibility. The FDA information sheet ""Recruiting Study Subjects"" includes information regarding scripts for those who will interface with subjects to determine basic eligibility.13\n\nFootnote 13: See the FDA Information Sheet “Recruiting Study Subjects,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects, for further information.\n\nOnce a prospective subject is identified, and before research activities requiring prior consent occur, a person knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and capable of answering questions raised by the prospective subject should conduct a consent discussion. The consent discussion and the consent form must contain information to allow prospective subjects to make an informed decision about participation in a clinical investigation and provide an opportunity for prospective subjects to ask questions about the clinical investigation and the information in the consent document (see section3), ""FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion"") (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25).14 The consent form serves several purposes, including helping to ensure that prospective subjects receive the required information, providing a ""take home"" reminder of the elements of the clinical investigation, providing contact information in case additional questions or concerns arise, and documenting prospective subjects\' voluntary agreement to participate as well as the date of their agreement.\n\nFootnote 14: The regulations allow use of a “short form” consent form when the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For a discussion of the short form written consent, see section3.5.4.2, “Short Form.”\n\nThe informed consent process is an ongoing exchange of information throughout a subject\'s participation in a clinical trial and does not end after the consent form is signed. For example, if new safety information or protocol changes occur during the conduct of the study, additional information may need to be given to the subject, and/or the subject may need additional opportunities to ask questions and receive answers throughout the clinical investigation (see sectionIII.3.5, ""Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects,"" and Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nIII FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b ""Short Form"" for more details). If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For ""applicable clinical trials"" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, “Element of Informed Consent for ‘Applicable Clinical Trials.”\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 64: See section IV.A.4 for guidance regarding identification of the most up-to-date version of the informed consent form.\n\niv.2.4 Identification of Revised Consent Forms\n\nThe IRB should ensure that there is a way to identify a revised consent form so that continued use of a previously approved version does not occur. While not required by FDA regulations, the use of date stamps is one possible mechanism for ensuring use of the most recently approved version of the consent form.\n\nThe Clinical Investigator\n\nThe clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects during a clinical investigation, and for ensuring that, unless an exception applies, legally effective informed consent is obtained from each subject or the subject\'s LAR before that subject takes part in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.20(a), 312.60, and 812.100). Legally effective informed consent includes meeting all applicable Federal, State, and local laws that require additional information in the informed consent form beyond what FDA regulations require. Sponsors and investigators may wish to seek legal guidance regarding specific local consent requirements applicable to their research.\n\nThe clinical investigator should notify the IRB regarding the consent process, including who (e.g., the investigator or another study team member) will conduct the consent discussion. Any information that will be given to subjects to review and discuss as part of informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)). An investigator may not begin the informed consent process with prospective subjects until the IRB reviews and approves the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process (21 CFR 50.20, 50.27, and 56.109).\n\nThe clinical investigator\'s institution may have standard language or a standard format for consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation). FDA recognizes that investigators may also need to identify and meet institutional requirements and incorporate them into the consent form for the IRB\'s initial review of the clinical investigation.\n\nDuring the clinical investigation, the investigator may need to revise the consent form to address new information that might arise during the conduct of the trial, such as a change to the protocol or new safety information. The investigator will need to obtain IRB review and approval of the revised consent form (21 CFR 50.27 and 56.109). In addition, because the consent form is being modified to reflect new information that might affect the willingness of already enrolled and actively participating subjects to continue in the clinical investigation, the IRB should determine the need to inform the previously enrolled subjects of the new information and determine their willingness to continue in the research (see\n\nFrequently Asked Questions #16).\n\nAny new information that is part of the consent process must be reviewed and approved by the IRB as a change in approved research before it is initiated, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject (see 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)). In the rare event that urgent safety information is provided to the subject prior to IRB approval, the IRB should promptly be notified of both the safety issue and the notification of subjects.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the clinical investigator:\n\niv.2.1 Delegation of Consent Discussion\n\nFDA regulations require that the investigator obtain the legally effective informed consent of subjects (21 CFR 50.20, 312.60 and 812.100). If the investigator delegates this responsibility, FDA expects that the individual to whom the responsibility is delegated be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform this activity. The individual obtaining informed consent should be knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and have the appropriate training and credentials to be able to address any questions or concerns the subject may have about the study and/or alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject. The investigator should have a detailed plan for the supervision and training of staff, and oversight of the clinical investigation, including the informed consent process.65 Even when a task is delegated to another individual, the investigator remains responsible for ensuring that legally effective informed consent is obtained for all subjects in accordance with 21 CFR part 50.\n\niv.2.2 Financial Relationships and Interests\n\nThe clinical investigator should consider whether information related to financial relationships or interests should be provided to subjects.66 Clinical investigators should consider the potential effects that a financial relationship might have on the clinical investigation or on interactions with subjects. When there are financial relationships or interests, clinical investigators should consider the following actions:\n\nFootnote 66: See the HHS guidance document, “Financial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidance for Human Subject Protection,” available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/financial-conflict-of-interest/index.html#.\n\nIncluding information in the informed consent form, such as:\n\nThe source of funding and funding arrangements for the conduct and review of the clinical investigation, or\n\nInformation about a financial arrangement or interest (e.g., stock in the study sponsor, patent on the investigational product) of an institution or an investigator and how it is being managed.\n\nUsing special measures to modify the informed consent process when a potential or actual financial conflict exists, such as:\n\nHaving another individual who does not have a potential or actual conflict of interest involved in the consent process, especially when a potential or actual conflict of interest could influence the tone, presentation, or type of information presented during the consent process.\n\nUsing independent monitoring of the consent process.\n\nAlthough the clinical investigator should consider these issues regarding financial relationships and interests, IRBs have the final responsibility of determining whether subjects should be provided with information regarding the source of funding, funding arrangements, or financial interests of parties involved in the clinical investigation as part of the informed consent process (see 21 CFR 56.109 and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).\n\nThe Sponsor\n\nSponsors often provide clinical investigators with a model consent form that may be adapted by the clinical investigator to meet local needs. When the consent form for studies that require an IND or IDE application is submitted to FDA for review, FDA\'s comments are generally directed to the sponsor (see sectionIV.4.1, ""Investigational New Drugs and Biologics,"" and sectionIV.4.2, ""Investigational Medical Devices""). The sponsor should promptly provide the clinical investigator with any necessary modifications required to satisfy the regulations at 21 CFR 50.25 so that changes can be made to the consent forms. A modified model consent form reflecting the changes may be used to convey the necessary edits. Because the clinical investigator must receive IRB approval before starting the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 312.66 and 21 CFR 812.110(a)), the sponsor should work closely with the clinical investigator to make certain the modified consent form is reviewed and approved by the IRB. The clinical investigator should provide the sponsor with a copy of the consent form approved by the IRB.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the sponsor:\n\niv.3.1 Considerations for Multicenter Clinical Investigations\n\nFor multicenter clinical investigations, changes may need to be made to the consent form to address local and institutional requirements. For multicenter clinical investigations reviewed by more than one IRB, when local IRB review results in substantive modifications to the consent form, i.e., changes that affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects, FDA expects the sponsor to share the revisions with all investigators and their IRBs. In this situation it may be more efficient to share the changes with the sites using a modified model consent form, when appropriate. If the multicenter clinical investigation has a central IRB cooperating with local IRBs or human research protection offices, the revisions should be forwarded to the central IRB.67 Alternatively, local issues may be addressed by the central IRB depending on the review agreement between the local IRB(s) and central IRB. Note that for medicaldevice studies that require submission of an IDE application, such changes must be submitted to FDA.68\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 812.35(a).\n\nFootnote 69: The 2018 Common Rule requires that any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States, unless the research is not subject to the provision (45 CFR 46.114(b)). The compliance date for research subject to this provision was January 20, 2020. On September 28, 2022, FDA issued a proposed rule to harmonize with this requirement to the extent practicable and consistent with statutory provisions (see https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/28/2022-21089/institutional-review-boards-cooperative-research). The January 19, 2017, final rule revising the Common Rule is available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/finalized-revisions-common-rule/index.html.\n\n.4.2 Sponsor Personnel\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 53: See the response to Comment 52 in the preamble to the 1981 final rule issuing regulations for the protection of human subjects (46 FR 8942, January 27, 1981); https://www.fda.gov/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/protection-human-subjects-informed-consent: “The fact that a short form is used to document informed consent does not mean that the subject will get less information than if handed a long, detailed written document...All the ‘form’ provides [whether long or short] is evidence that the information required by 50.25 has been provided to a prospective subject.”\n\nUse of the short form requires that there be a witness to the oral presentation of information to the subject or the subject\'s LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). FDA recommends that an impartial third party not otherwise connected with the clinical investigation (for example, clinical staff not involved in the research, a patient advocate or an independent interpreter) serve as the witness. The witness must be present physically or by some other means, for example, by phone or video conference, during the oral presentation, not just the signing of the consent form (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The purpose of the witness is generally to attest to the voluntariness of the subject\'s consent and the adequacy of the consent process by ensuring that the information was accurately conveyed and that the subject\'s questions were answered.\n\nThe subject or the subject\'s LAR signs and dates only the short form (21 CFR 50.27(a) and (b)(2)). The witness must sign both the short form and the summary, and the person obtaining consent must sign the summary (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). Due to the additional requirements of having a witness and providing a written summary of the consent discussion, use of the short form may not ease or expedite the consent process.\n\nIV Responsibilities for informed consent\n\nIRBs, clinical investigators, and sponsors share responsibility for ensuring that the informed consent form and process is adequate and meets FDA\'s regulatory requirements. The regulatory requirements represent the minimum information to be provided to prospective subjects for informed consent. The consent form should also incorporate any additional information that may affect subjects\' rights and welfare or willingness to participate in the clinical research. For example, information about certain financial relationships and interests may be important to the subject (see section IV.A.1, ""Review of All Informed Consent Materials"" and section IV.B.2, ""Financial Relationships and Interests"").\n\nThe IRB\n\nFDA requires that an IRB review and have authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove all research activities covered by the IRB regulations (21 CFR 56.109(a)). A critical part of this responsibility is for the IRB to review and approve a consent form that complies with applicable regulatory requirements at 21 CFR part 50 and to help ensure there is an adequate informed consent process that protects the rights and welfare of subjects participating in clinical investigations (21 CFR 56.109 and 56.111). Below are specific areas that IRBs should consider:\n\niv.1.1 Review of All Informed Consent Materials\n\nIRBs must review all materials used in the informed consent process (see 21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).54 This includes recruitment materials55, such as advertisements, and information provided in addition to the informed consent form (for example, a chart explaining what to expect at each study visit or a document explaining the costs to subjects). The IRB\'s review is to ensure that information given to subjects as part of the consent process is in accordance with the requirements of 21 CFR part 50 (see 21 CFR 56.109 and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).\n\nFootnote 54: IRBs are not required under 21 CFR part 56 to review stand-alone HIPAA authorizations, so long as an IRB’s written procedures, adopted pursuant to 21 CFR 56.108(a), do not require such review and approval. See page 8 of FDA’s “Guidance for Industry IRB Review of Stand-Alone HIPAA Authorizations Under FDA Regulations” (available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/irb-review-stand-alone-hipaa-authorizations-under-fda-regulations).\n\nWhen reviewing clinical investigations, IRBs must ensure that the consent process minimizes the possibility of coercion and undue influence (21 CFR 50.20 and 56.111(a)(4)). When a clinicalinvestigation involves subjects who are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, IRBs must determine that additional safeguards have been included in the clinical investigation to protect their rights and welfare (21 CFR 56.111(b)). In the event an IRB regularly reviews clinical investigations involving vulnerable subject populations, for such clinical investigations, the IRB membership should include individuals with knowledge about and/or experience working with such subjects, in order to provide expertise and identify techniques for obtaining their informed consent.56\n\nFootnote 56: For additional information see Frequently Asked Question #6. “What are some considerations for enrolling subjects with low literacy and numeracy?”; Frequently Asked Question #7, “What are some considerations for enrolling physically challenged subjects?”; and Frequently Asked Question #8. “What are some considerations for enrolling subjects with impaired consent capacity?”\n\nThe IRB has the authority to require that subjects receive information in addition to what 21 CFR 50.25 requires, if in the judgment of the IRB, the information would meaningfully add to the protection of the rights and welfare of the subjects (21 CFR 56.109(b)). For example, the IRB may determine that local circumstances necessitate the inclusion of additional information relevant to the informed consent process for prospective subjects from that particular community.\n\nHHS recommends that IRBs consider whether subjects should be informed of any financial relationships or interests that are associated with the clinical investigation, such as payments for services, equity interests or intellectual property rights.57 As indicated in the HHS guidance, some conflicting financial interests in the clinical investigation may affect the rights and welfare of subjects, and IRBs should consider approaches to assure subjects are adequately protected, including providing subjects with information about the financial relationships and interests. IRBs should determine whether subjects should be provided with information regarding the source of funding, funding arrangements, financial interests of parties involved in the clinical investigation, and any financial interest management techniques applied. The IRB should consider the kind, amount, and level of detail of information to be provided to subjects.\n\nFootnote 57: This topic is addressed in the HHS guidance document, “Financial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidance for Human Subject Protection.” This guidance, which applies to FDA-regulated clinical investigations as well as human subjects research conducted or supported by HHS, is available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/financial-conflict-of-interest/index.html.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n1.1.1 Adequacy and Appropriateness of Wording\n\nThe IRB has the authority and responsibility to require that information given to subjects as part of informed consent be in accordance with 21 CFR 50.25.58 In order to approve the research, the IRB must determine that informed consent will be obtained in accordance with the informed consent regulations (21 CFR 56.111(a)(4)).\n\nFootnote 58: See 21 CFR 56.109(b).\n\nInvestigators must use an IRB-approved written consent form when documenting informed consent, in accordance with 21 CFR 50.27, except as provided in 21 CFR 56.109(c). Thus, the IRB should review the adequacy and appropriateness of all wording in the consent materials, as well as the overall length and presentation of information. Consent forms that are long, complex, legalistic, and have a high reading level may overwhelm prospective subjects and may inhibit reading of the full document and understanding of the relevant information.\n\nThe IRB should ensure that technical and scientific concepts and terms are explained, or common terms substituted, so that the anticipated subject population can understand all provided information (see 21 CFR 50.20).59 Pictures, diagrams, or other visual aids may be used to improve understanding of medical terms or how an investigational product functions. IRBs may wish to evaluate, through subject discussions, how well the consent materials communicate critical information. Additional guidance on the requirements at 21 CFR 50.20 can be found in section 1.1.2, ""General Requirements for Informed Consent"" above.\n\nFootnote 59: Various strategies exist to improve communication with patients, for example, see Doak CC, Doak LG, Friedell GH, Meade CD. Improving comprehension for cancer patients with low literacy skills: strategies for clinicians. CA Cancer J Clin. 1998 May-Jun;48(3):151-62. doi: 10.3322/canjclin.48.3.151. PMID: 9594918.\n\n1.1.2 Use of Standardized Language\n\nInstitutions may develop standard language or a standard format to use in portions of all consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation) to meet certain FDA regulatory requirements, as well as institutional and other Federal, State, or local requirements.\n\n5.3.2 Review of the Consent Process\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: In the event that an IRB waives the requirement for documentation of informed consent (under 21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)), FDA recommends that the elements of informed consent be reviewed verbally with the subject or the subject\'s LAR. Additionally, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects with a written statement regarding the clinical investigation (21 CFR 56.109(d)). See section III. E.2, ""Alternative Methods of Obtaining Informed Consent"" below for additional information regarding documentation of consent. FDA recommends that when an IRB waives the documentation requirement for informed consent in circumstances where there is minimal risk of harm under 21 CFR 56.109(c)(1), the consent process and discussion be described and noted in subject case histories required to be maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3).46\n\nFootnote 46: Documentation requirements related to emergency research, as mentioned in 21 CFR 56.109(c)(2), can be found in 21 CFR 50.24. Discussion of these studies is in a separate guidance, “Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors; Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/exception-informed-consent-requirements-emergency-research.\n\nFootnote 47: For additional information on alternative methods of obtaining informed consent, please see “Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Investigators, and Sponsors, Use of Electronic Informed Consent in Clinical Investigations,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-electronic-informed-consent-clinical-investigations-questions-and-answers, and FDA’s MyStudies Application (App) at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/science-and-research-drugs/covid-mystudies-application-app.\n\n2.2.2 Alternative Methods of Obtaining Informed Consent\n\nTraditionally, informed consent has been obtained and documented in a face-to-face interview using paper consent forms. Technologies are available that may serve as an alternative to the paper consent form in the informed consent process.47 Parties interested in pursuing alternative methods of obtaining informed consent should discuss their plan with their IRB and are welcome to contact FDA as needed for advice.48\n\nFootnote 48: Questions related to alternative methods of obtaining informed consent can be directed to the Office of Clinical Policy at gcpaquestions@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nEven in the context of paper consent forms, there may be certain circumstances when an alternative to a face-to-face consent discussion may be appropriate. For example, such an alternative may be appropriate\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:31]\n\nbe described and noted in subject case histories required to maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3).\n\niv.1.3 Requirement for Dating Consent Form\n\nIn addition to signing the consent form, the subject or the subject\'s LAR must enter the date of signature on the form (21 CFR 50.27(a)) to allow confirmation that the subject or the subject\'s LAR provided consent prior to participation in the clinical investigation, as required by 21 CFR 50.20. In those cases where the subject provides consent on the same day51 that they begin participation in the clinical investigation, the subject\'s case history must document that the subject provided consent prior to participation in the research for studies conducted under an IND or IDE, (312.62(b) and 812.140(a)(3)), and the subject\'s case history should contain the signed and dated consent form. Although FDA regulations do not require the subject\'s copy to be a signed copy, FDA recommends that a copy of the signed consent form be provided.\n\nFootnote 51: Prospective subjects should have sufficient opportunity and time to consider enrollment in the research, such that coercion and undue influence are minimized. See sectionIII.A.2, “Coercion and Undue Influence”.\n\niv.1.4 Forms for Documentation of Informed Consent\n\nUnder 21 CFR 50.27:\n\n(b) Except as provided in SS 56.109(c), the consent form may be either of the following:\n\nA written consent document that embodies the elements of informed consent required by SS 50.25_. This form may be read to the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative, but, in any event, the investigator shall give either the subject or the representative adequate opportunity to read it before it is signed._\n\nA short form written consent document stating that the elements of informed consent required by SS 50.25 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Also, the IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the representative. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining the consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.\n\nThe regulations provide for obtaining written informed consent by two different methods: a long form that embodies all the elements of informed consent (see 21 CFR 50.25), or a short form that states that the elements of informed consent have been presented orally to the subject\'s LAR.\n\nLong Form\n\nAs stated above, the long form must incorporate all the elements of informed consent as required under 21 CFR 50.25. When the long form is used, a copy must be provided to the person signing the form, that is, the subject or the subject\'s LAR (21 CFR 50.27(a)).\n\nShort Form\n\nAn IRB may approve a short form to be used in appropriate situations where the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 are presented orally to the subject or the subject\'s LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For example, IRBs may consider approving the use of a short form in situations where the subject or the subject\'s LAR is unable to read due to low literacy or visual impairment.52\n\nFootnote 52: For additional information see Frequently Asked Question #6, “What should be considered when enrolling subjects with low literacy and numeracy?” and Frequently Asked Question #7, “What should be considered when enrolling subjects with physical or sensory disabilities?” In addition, for information on enrolling individuals with limited English proficiency see Frequently Asked Question #3, “What are some considerations for enrolling non-English speaking subjects?”, Frequently Asked Question #4, “What process should be followed when it is expected that subjects who do not understand English will be enrolled?”, and Frequently Asked Question #5, “What process should be followed when the enrollment of subjects who do not understand English, or who are limited English proficient, is not expected?”\n\nWhen the short form is used, the IRB is required to approve a written summary of the information to be presented orally (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The information presented orally should be as thorough as the information contained in the long form.53 A copy of the short form and the written summary must be given to the person signing the form (that is, the subject or the subject\'s LAR) (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)).\n\nFootnote 53: See the response to Comment 52 in the preamble to the 1981 final rule issuing regulations for the protection of human subjects (46 FR 8942, January 27, 1981); https://www.fda.gov/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/protection-human-subjects-informed-consent: “The fact that a short form is used to document informed consent does not mean that the subject will get less information than if handed a long, detailed written document...All the ‘form’ provides [whether long or short] is evidence that the information required by 50.25 has been provided to a prospective subject.”\n\nUse of the short form requires that there be a witness to the oral presentation of information to the subject or the subject\'s LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). FDA recommends that an impartial third party not otherwise connected with the clinical investigation (for example, clinical staff not involved in the research, a patient advocate or an independent interpreter) serve as the witness. The witness must be present physically or by some other means, for example, by phone or video conference, during the oral presentation, not just the signing of the consent form (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The purpose of the witness is generally to attest to the voluntariness of the subject\'s consent and the adequacy of the consent process by ensuring that the information was accurately conveyed and that the subject\'s questions were answered.\n\nThe subject or the subject\'s LAR signs and dates only the short form (21 CFR 50.27(a) and (b)(2)). The witness must sign both the short form and the summary, and the person obtaining consent must sign the summary (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). Due to the additional requirements of having a witness and providing a written summary of the consent discussion, use of the short form may not ease or expedite the consent process.\n\nIV Responsibilities for informed consent\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: 19. Should investigators/sponsors include the statement in consent documents for a trial that is not an ""applicable clinical trial?""\n\nBecause U.S. law only requires that applicable clinical trials be submitted to www.ClinicalTrials.gov, the new statement only applies to the legal requirements for applicable clinical trial informed consent documents. Again, the new rule does not prevent investigators from voluntarily reporting data from clinical trials that do not meet the definition of an applicable clinical trial to www.ClinicalTrials.gov and sharing that information with participants.\n\n20. If an organization has used the same model template for informed consent documents for years, must they update the template?\n\nYes, the compliance deadline of March 7, 2012, provided sufficient time for all institutions involved in applicable clinical trials to update their model forms and templates.\n\n21. Do informed consent documents for studies conducted outside of the United States have to comply with the new regulations?Yes, any applicable clinical trial, including applicable clinical trials conducted outside the United States, must comply with the new regulation (21 CFR SS 50.25(c)) and include the statement regarding www.ClinicalTrials.gov in informed consent forms. The statute defines applicable clinical trials as trials of drugs and devices that are subject to FDA regulation. If the clinical trial is not of a drug or device subject to FDA regulation, and, thus, not an applicable clinical trial, at the time of the initiation of the trial, then the statement is not required. See the response to questions 3 and 4 concerning the definition of an applicable clinical trial.\n\nFDA accepts data from foreign clinical trials not under an IND when in compliance with 21 CFR SS 312.120. The mere fact that we accept data from a foreign clinical trial in connection with a marketing application does not make it an applicable clinical trial; the foreign clinical trial constitutes an applicable clinical trial only when it meets the definitions set forth in 42 U.S.C. SS 282(j)(1)(A). See, also, the response to questions 3 and 4.\n\nThis requirement does not preclude the inclusion of mandatory or recommended language from non-U.S. governments, and it does not preclude reference to other clinical trial registries or regulatory bodies.\n\n22. What if the new statement conflicts with foreign informed consent requirements?\n\nCongress did not provide an exemption from the statutory requirement. If the clinical trial is an applicable clinical trial, then it must include the new statement.\n\n23. Can sponsors or investigators translate the new required statement?\n\nYes, if potential participants are non-English speaking or the clinical investigator or IRB anticipates that the consent interviews will be conducted in a language other than English, the IRB should require investigators or sponsors to prepare translated consent documents. FDA recommends that the IRB review, and if appropriate, approve procedures for ensuring that the translations will be prepared by a qualified individual or entity. However, FDA will not provide translations of the statement. We have written the required statement to use simpler language and do not believe that the statement will pose translation difficulties.\n\n24. Are clinical trials that are funded, conducted, or supported by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (i.e., subject to 45 CFR SS 46) subject to the new regulation?\n\nAs a general matter, applicable clinical trials involving FDA-regulated products and conducted or supported by HHS must meet the requirements of both 45 CFR SS 46 and 21 CFR SS 50.\n\n25. How does the new rule affect informed consent for children?\n\nParent or guardian permission, as defined in 21 CFR SS 50.3(r), must include the elements of informed consent. Therefore, the parent and guardian consent forms must include the new statement word for word.\n\n26. What are the consequences of not including the new language in consent documents for applicable clinical trials?\n\nFDA has several options that enable enforcement of the new informed consent requirement. FDA has the authority to regulate the protection of human subjects and the authority to impose penalties for violations of these regulations. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) prohibits the failure to establish or maintain any record or make any report required under section 505(i) and the failure or refusal to comply with any requirement under 520(g). 21 U.S.C. SS 331(e) ""The FD&C Act and implementing regulations allow FDA to seek administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for violations of section 301 of the FD&C Act. 21 U.S.C. SS 303(a); SS SS 312.44(b)(1)(ix), 312.70(a), 812.30(b)(4), 812.119(a), 56.121(b)."" 76 FR 256 at 265.\n\n27.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: III FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b ""Short Form"" for more details). If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For ""applicable clinical trials"" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, “Element of Informed Consent for ‘Applicable Clinical Trials.”\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n\nNo informed consent, whether oral or written, may include any exculpatory language through which the subject or the representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject\'s legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence.\n\nii.2.1 Exceptions to Informed Consent\n\nInformed consent is required for participation in FDA-regulated clinical investigations except under limited circumstances as described in 21 CFR 50.23 (involving certain life-threatening situations, military operations, or public health emergencies) and 21 CFR 50.24 (involving emergency research16) (see 21 CFR 50.20). We note that, to implement statutory changes made to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C) Act by section 3024 of the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act), FDA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would allow IRBs responsible for the review, approval, and continuing review of clinical investigations to approve an informed consent procedure that waives or alters certain informed consent elements or that waives the requirement to obtain informed consent for certain minimal risk clinical investigations.17({}^{,})18 In addition, FDA issued guidance explaining that until the Agency promulgates regulations implementing the Cures Act amendments to the FD&C Act, FDA does not intend to object to an IRB approving a consent procedure that does not include, or that alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set forth in 21 CFR 50.25, or to an IRB waiving the requirements to obtain informed consent for certain minimal risk clinical investigations under the circumstances described in the guidance.19 Nothing in FDA\'s informed consent regulations is intended to limit the authority of a physician to provide emergency medical care to the extent the physician is permitted to do so under applicable Federal, State, or local law (21 CFR 50.25(e)).\n\nFootnote 16: See “Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors; Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/exception-informed-consent-requirements-emergency-research.\n\nFootnote 17: See section 3024 of the Cures Act, Pub. L. 114-255, available at https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ255/PLAW-114publ255.pdf.\n\nFootnote 18: See “Institutional Review Board Waiver or Alteration of Informed Consent for Minimal Risk Clinical Investigations,” (83 FR 57378, November 15, 2018) at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2018-11-15/pdf/2018-24822.pdf.\n\nii.2.2 Coercion and Undue Influence\n\nThe conditions under which informed consent is sought and the relationship between the subject and the person obtaining consent should be carefully considered to minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence (21 CFR 50.20). According to the Belmont Report, ""Coercion occurs when an overt threat of harm is intentionally presented by one person to another in order to obtain compliance. Undue influence,by contrast, occurs through an offer of an excessive, unwarranted, inappropriate or improper reward or other overture in order to obtain compliance.""20\n\nFootnote 20: The Belmont Report was written by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The Commission, created as a result of the National Research Act of 1974, was charged with identifying the basic ethical principles that should underlie the conduct of biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects and developing guidelines to assure that such research is conducted in accordance with those principles. See Belmont Report, available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html.\n\nFor example, if an employer seeks to enroll employees in a clinical investigation sponsored or conducted by the employer, the informed consent process should contain safeguards to ensure that participation is voluntary and that the possibility of undue influence or coercion by supervisors, peers, or others is minimized. Similarly, because of a potential conflict of interest and the nature of the physician-patient relationship,21 when the investigator is also the prospective subject\'s physician, for example, the-investigator should ensure that the prospective subject understands that enrollment in the clinical investigation is voluntary, and that a decision to forgo enrollment will not adversely affect their medical care, in accordance with 21 CFR 50.25(a)(8). The consent process and form should emphasize that an individual\'s participation is truly voluntary.\n\nNote that coercion and undue influence may be situational, and can affect any population, not just subject populations seen as vulnerable to coercion or undue influence. For example, in a clinical investigation involving the collection of extra tissue samples during a planned surgical procedure, waiting to obtain informed consent until the prospective subject is in the preoperative area would generally fail to minimize the possibility of undue influence. The possibility of undue influence could be addressed by first discussing the study with the prospective subject during a preoperative visit as part of the informed consent process. The prospective subject could be told that the study will be reviewed with them again prior to the procedure and, after all questions are resolved, they will be asked to sign a consent form acknowledging their willingness to participate in the study at that time.\n\nIn addition, statements that claim investigational drugs and devices are safe or effective for the purposes for which they are being investigated are prohibited (21 CFR 312.7(a) and 21 CFR 812.7(d)). Likewise, statements that overstate the possibility of benefit may unduly influence prospective subjects by leading them to incorrectly assume that it is known that the investigational product will be of benefit to them, influencing them to agree to participate when they might not have otherwise chosen to do so. For example, wording that refers to the clinical investigation as a ""therapeutic trial"" could contribute to a prospective subject\'s misunderstanding that the trial will offer a direct benefit for their disease or condition.\n\nFurthermore, we generally recommend against including statements such as ""FDA has given permission for the clinical investigation to proceed"" or ""FDA has approved the clinical investigation"" in the informed consent process, because such statements may suggest to subjects that the investigation has FDA\'s endorsement. In addition, these statements may not be accurate for the particular clinical investigation at issue (see, e.g., 21 CFR 312.40(b) and 21 CFR 812.2(b)).\n\nFDA does not consider reimbursement for reasonable travel expenses to and from the clinical trial site (e.g., airfare, gas, tolls), and associated costs, such as parking and lodging, to raise issues related to coercion or undue influence. Reimbursement for other expenses may be considered by an IRB on a case-by-case basis, and IRBs should consider whether the proposed remuneration could be an undue influence. Payment for participation in research should be just and fair.

We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nFootnote 6: In this guidance, we use the terms safety and effectiveness and safety, purity, and potency interchangeably in the discussions pertaining to biosimilar products.\n\nIII General principles for draft labeling of proposed biosimilar products (biosimilar product labeling)\n\nThe goal of a biosimilar product development program is to demonstrate biosimilarity between the proposed product and the reference product -- not to independently establish safety and effectiveness of the proposed product. A demonstration of biosimilarity means, among other things, that FDA has determined that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.7 Thus, FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness for the reference product, as reflected in its FDA-approved prescribing information, may be relied upon to provide health care providers with the essential scientific information needed to facilitate prescribing decisions for the proposed biosimilar product's labeled conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)). Accordingly, FDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, such as those described in sections V and VI of this guidance.8\n\nFootnote 7: Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act.\n\nInformation and data from a clinical study of a proposed biosimilar product should be described in its labeling only when necessary to inform safe and effective use by a health care provider. As a general matter, it is FDA's view that biosimilar product labeling should not include a description of or data from clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.9 Generally, clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarityare not designed to support an independent demonstration of safety or effectiveness of the proposed biosimilar product and thus would generally not be expected to facilitate an understanding of product safety and effectiveness. For example, the endpoints used in a clinical study conducted to support a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences may not be the same endpoints evaluated to support licensure of the reference product and thus may not inform prescribing decisions regarding safety and effectiveness. Similarly, the patient population may differ from the patient population studied in the clinical trials that supported the determination of safety and effectiveness of the reference product. For example, subjects in a study conducted to support a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product may be healthy volunteers, or the condition of use studied may be one for which the reference product is not licensed or for which the applicant of the biosimilar product is not seeking licensure but for which sufficient data indicate that the population or condition of use is adequately sensitive to detect clinically meaningful differences between the products, should they exist.\n\nBecause clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarity generally are not designed to support an independent demonstration of safety or effectiveness, such studies may be misinterpreted in the context of drug labeling, resulting in an inaccurate understanding of the risk-benefit profile of the biosimilar product. Therefore, studies conducted to support biosimilarity generally should not be included in biosimilar product labeling. Biosimilar product labeling should incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, including clinical data that supported FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness of the reference product.\n\nAs required under 21 CFR 201.56(c)(1), biosimilar product labeling must meet the content and format requirements of the physician labeling rule (PLR) as described in 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57, regardless of the format of the reference product labeling.10 In addition, biosimilar product labeling must meet the content and format requirements of the pregnancy and lactation labeling final rule (PLLR) as described in 21 CFR 201.57(c)(9)(i) through (iii), regardless of whether the reference product must meet these requirements.11\n\nFootnote 10: See the final rule “Requirements on Content and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products” (71 FR 3922, January 24, 2006). This rule is commonly referred to as the physician labeling rule because it addresses prescription drug labeling that is used by prescribing physicians and other health care providers. Also see additional labeling guidances at https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm.\n\nFootnote 11: See the final rule “Content and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products; Requirements for Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling” (79 FR 72064, December 4, 2014). The final rule describes the implementation schedule for applications submitted on or after the effective date of the rule, applications pending at the time the rule became effective, and applications approved before the rule became effective (79 FR 72064 at 72095–96).\n\nIV Specific Recommendations on Content of Biosimilar Product Labeling\n\nFDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, as explained in sections V and VI of this guidance. The relevant data and information from the reference product labeling that should be incorporated into the biosimilar product labeling will depend on whether the applicant is seeking licensure for all conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)) or fewer than all conditions of use of the reference product for the biosimilar product.12\n\nFootnote 12: A biosimilar product applicant generally may seek licensure for fewer than all conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed. The 351(k) application must include information demonstrating that the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling submitted for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously licensed for the reference product (see section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act).\n\nIn sections of the biosimilar product labeling that are based on the reference product labeling, it is anticipated that the text will be similar to the corresponding text in the reference product labeling. Text based on the reference product labeling need not be identical to the reference product labeling and should reflect currently available information necessary for the safe and effective use of the biosimilar product. Certain differences between the biosimilar and reference product labeling may be appropriate. For example, biosimilar product labeling conforming to PLR and/or PLLR may differ from reference product labeling because the reference product labeling may not be required to conform to those requirements at the time of licensure of the biosimilar product. In addition, biosimilar product labeling may include information specific to the biosimilar product that is necessary to inform safe and effective use of the product, including administration, preparation, storage, or safety information. This information may differ from that of the reference product labeling when it reflects differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product that do not preclude licensure of the biosimilar product.\n\nAppendix A Approaches to Product Identification\n\nIn biosimilar product labeling, the approach to product identification depends on the context of the information being presented. FDA acknowledges that there will be variations on the general concepts outlined in this section because the approach to product identification will depend on the specific statements. The illustrative examples in this section use a fictional reference product JUNEXANT (replicamab-hyxf) and a fictional biosimilar product NEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen use of the biosimilar product name is recommended:\n\nThe biosimilar product name should be used in labeling text that is specific to the biosimilar product or that refers solely to the biosimilar product. If a biosimilar product has a proprietary name, the proprietary name (e.g., NEXSYMEO) should be used in the appropriate sections. However, if a proprietary name is not available, or if referring to the drug substance (as discussed below), the biosimilar product's proper name (e.g., replicamab-cznm) should be used.13\n\nFootnote 13: The proper name is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (see section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)).\n\nThe biosimilar product's proprietary name (or, if a proprietary name is not available, the biosimilar product's proper name) should be used in circumstances such as the following:\n\nIn sections where the information described is specific to the biosimilar product -- This includes, but is not limited to, the following sections: INDICATIONS AND USAGE, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, DESCRIPTION, and HOW SUPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING.\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry""

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist applicants in complying with the content and format requirements of labeling for human prescription drug and biological products under 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57. FDA is issuing this guidance to provide recommendations for applicants developing labeling for new prescription drugs and revising labeling for already approved prescription drugs. This guidance also provides recommendations on developing Highlights of Prescribing Information (Highlights), formatting labeling, and procedural information.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nOn January 24, 2006, FDA published a final rule that amended the requirements for the content and format of labeling for human prescription drug and biological products. The rule is commonly referred to as the Physician Labeling Rule (PLR) because it addresses prescription drug labeling that is used by prescribers and other health care practitioners. The rule was designed to make information in prescription drug labeling easier for health care practitioners to access, read, and use to facilitate practitioners' use of labeling to make prescribing decisions. Labeling includes three sections: Highlights of Prescribing Information (Highlights), a Table of Contents (Contents), and the Full Prescribing Information (FPI). Highlights contains selected information from the FPI that health care practitioners most commonly reference and consider most important. Contents lists the sections and subsections of the FPI. FPI contains the detailed prescribing information necessary for safe and effective use of the drug. The final rule also reordered and reorganized the FPI, made minor changes to the content of the FPI, and set minimum graphic requirements for the format of the labeling.\n\nNot all drugs are subject to the labeling requirements under SSSS 201.56(d) and 201.57. The final rule is being implemented on a staged implementation schedule that, based on approval date or application status, requires new and recently approved prescription drugs to comply with these labeling requirements by a particular date (see SS 201.56(b) and Appendix A). Prescription drugs that are not subject to SSSS 201.56(d) and 201.57 are subject to the labeling requirements under SSSS 201.56(e) and 201.80. The final rule also made minor changes to these regulations.\n\nFor the purpose of this guidance, the term PLR format refers to labeling that meets the content and format requirements at SSSS 201.56(d) and 201.57. The term old format refers to labeling that meets the requirements at SSSS 201.56(e) and 201.80. See Appendix B for a listing of prescription drug labeling sections in the old and PLR formats.\n\nIn general, the most challenging aspects of this regulation are developing Highlights and distributing information among sections that have been substantially affected by the rule, particularly when the information originates from the labeling in the old format. Therefore, the guidance focuses primarily on these issues. Additional guidance documents that address content and format for specific FPI sections are available and should be consulted when developing labeling (see section VIII of this document).\n\nIII Considerations for Revising Labeling\n\nMaking the transition to the PLR format provides an ideal opportunity to review the labeling content for general quality (e.g. format, organization, and readability) and to make it a better communication tool. FDA recommends following these general principles when converting labeling in the old format to the PLR format.\n\nDeveloping New Sections\n\nFDA expects that most sections or subsections from labeling in the old format can be moved, with little or no modification, to corresponding sections in the PLR format (see Appendix C). However, the labeling in the old format may not include the information specified by the new regulations, or the content of a section may not adequately reflect scientific information needed for safe and effective use of the drug. In this case, the labeling must be updated (SS 201.56(a)).\n\nIf the labeling in the old format lacks an entire section that is required in the PLR format, the section must be developed unless it is clearly inapplicable (SS 201.56(d)). For example, if the labeling in the old format does not contain an Information for Patients subsection in the PRECAUTIONS section, the applicant must develop a PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION section because, with only limited exceptions, there will be important information about a drug for the prescriber to convey to the patient or caregiver. In another example, it may not be necessary to develop a CLINICAL STUDIES section for certain older products (e.g., when data are not readily available).\n\nData Analyses or New Studies\n\nFDA recognizes that revising labeling to comply with the PLR regulations is an excellent opportunity to update labeling content to ensure that it accurately reflects current knowledge. FDA expects that, in most cases, the revisions will involve limited rewriting aimed at clarifying text, eliminating redundancies, and updating outdated terminology. Generally, no new data analyses of the information in the old format are required if the labeling is truthful and accurate. However, if new information is available that causes the labeling to be inaccurate, the labeling must be updated to incorporate the new information (SS 201.56(a)(2)). In some cases, a reanalysis of the data may be necessary.\n\nFurthermore, if essential information is missing from the labeling (e.g., new information about a class drug interaction), this information must be included (SS 201.56(a)(2)). In this case, the review division would determine the need for a new study, a decision that would be made independent of the labeling conversion process.\n\nUpdating Information in Labeling\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products - Implementing the PLR Content and Format Requirements""

The collections of information related to the submission of a BLA under section 351(k) of the PHS Act have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0719, and the collections of information in 21 CFR part 601 have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0338.\n\nAn Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The information collection provisions in this guidance, including resulting proposed modifications to the information collections approved under OMB control number 0910-0338, have been submitted to OMB for review as required by section 3507(d) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and are not for current implementation. Before implementing the information collection provisions contained in this guidance, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing OMB's decision to approve, modify, or disapprove those information collection provisions.\n\n6 Glossary\n\nBiosimilar Product means a biological product submitted in a 351(k) application that has been shown to be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product (see section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act).\n\nCore Name means the component shared among an originator biological product and any related biological product, biosimilar product, or interchangeable product as part of the proper names of those products. Two examples of a core name are filgrastim and epoeetin alfa.\n\nInterchangeable Product means a biological product that has been shown to meet the standards described in section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act and may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nNonproprietary Name means a name unprotected by trademark rights that is in the public domain. It may be used by the public at large, both lay and professional.\n\nOriginator Biological Product means a biological product submitted in a BLA under section 351(a) of the PHS Act (i.e., a stand-alone BLA) that is not a related biological product.\n\nProper Name means the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act.18\n\nFootnote 18: Section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a)(1)(B)(i) and § 600.3(k)( 21 CFR 600.3(k)).\n\nProprietary Name means the trademark or brand name.\n\nReference Product means the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in a 351(k) application (section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nRelated Biological Product means a biological product submitted in a BLA under section 351(a) of the PHS Act (i.e., a stand-alone BLA) for which there is a previously licensed biological product submitted in a different section 351(a) BLA that contains a drug substance for which certain nomenclature conventions (e.g., United States Adopted Names (USAN) Guiding Principles19) would be expected to provide for use of the same drug substance name.20\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: An application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that ""the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product"" based upon data derived from:11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(3) of the PHS Act.\n\nAnalytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;\n\nAnimal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and\n\nA clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.\n\nThe Agency has the discretion to determine that an element described above is unnecessary in a 351(k) application.12 FDA advises sponsors intending to develop biosimilar products to meet with FDA to present their product development plans and establish a schedule of milestones that will serve as landmarks for future discussions with the Agency. FDA anticipates that early discussions with FDA about product development plans and about approaches to providing adequate scientific justifications will facilitate biosimilar development.13\n\nFootnote 12: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See the draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants for a detailed discussion. When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\n4 Complexities of Protein Products\n\nA sponsor should consider the complexities of protein products and related scientific issues when designing a development program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.\n\nNature of Protein Products and Related Scientific Considerations\n\nUnlike small molecule drugs, whose structure can usually be completely defined and entirely reproduced, proteins are typically more complex and are unlikely to be shown to be structurally identical to a reference product. Many potential differences in protein structure can arise. Because even minor structural differences (including certain changes in glycosylation patterns) can significantly affect a protein\'s safety and/or effectiveness, it is important to evaluate these differences.\n\nIn general, proteins can differ in at least three ways: (1) primary amino acid sequence; (2) modification to amino acids, such as sugar moieties (glycosylation) or other side chains; and (3) higher order structure (protein folding and protein-protein interactions). Modifications to amino acids may lead to heterogeneity and can be difficult to control. Protein modifications and higher order structure can be affected by formulation and environmental conditions, including light, temperature, moisture, packaging materials, container closure systems, and delivery device materials. Additionally, process- as well as product-related impurities may increase the likelihood and/or the severity of an immune response to a protein product, and certain excipients may limit the ability to characterize the protein product.\n\nAdvances in analytical sciences enable some protein products to be extensively characterized with respect to their physicochemical and biological properties, such as higher order structures and functional characteristics. These analytical methodologies have increasingly improved the ability to identify and characterize not only the drug substance of a protein product but also excipients and product- and process-related impurities.\n\nDespite such significant improvements in analytical techniques, however, current analytical methodology may not be able to detect all relevant structural and functional differences between two protein products. In addition, there may be incomplete understanding of the relationship between a product\'s structural attributes and its clinical performance. Thus, as set forth in the PHS Act, data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies are required to demonstrate biosimilarity unless FDA determines an element unnecessary.14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nManufacturing Process Considerations\n\nDifferent manufacturing processes may alter a protein product in a way that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the product. For example, differences in biological systems used to manufacture a protein product may cause different posttranslational modifications, which in turn may affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the product. Thus, when the manufacturing process for a marketed protein product is changed, the application holder must assess the effects of the change and demonstrate--through appropriate analytical testing, functional assays, and/or in some cases animal and/or clinical studies--that the change does not have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they relate to the safety oreffectiveness of the product.15 The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process (ICH Q5E) describes scientific principles in the comparability assessment for manufacturing changes.\n\nFootnote 15: See 21 CFR 601.12 and 21 CFR 314.70 for regulatory requirements for changes (including manufacturing changes) made to a licensed biologics license application (BLA) and an approved NDA, respectively.\n\nDemonstrating that a proposed product is biosimilar to a reference product typically will be more complex than assessing the comparability of a product before and after manufacturing changes made by the same manufacturer. This is because a manufacturer that modifies its own manufacturing process has extensive knowledge and information about the product and the existing process, including established controls and acceptance parameters. By contrast, the manufacturer of a proposed product is likely to have a different manufacturing process (e.g., different cell line, raw materials, equipment, processes, process controls, and acceptance criteria) from that of the reference product and no direct knowledge of the manufacturing process for the reference product. Therefore, even though some of the scientific principles described in ICH Q5E may also apply in the demonstration of biosimilarity, in general, FDA anticipates that more data and information will be needed to establish biosimilarity than would be needed to establish that a manufacturer\'s post-manufacturing change product is comparable to the pre-manufacturing change product.\n\nV U.S.-LICENSED Reference Product and Other Comparators\n\nTo obtain licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act, a sponsor must demonstrate that the proposed product is biosimilar to a single reference product that previously has been licensed by FDA.16 In general, a sponsor needs to provide information to demonstrate biosimilarity based on data directly comparing the proposed product with the reference product. As a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical PK study and, if appropriate, at least one PD study, intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity for purposes of section 351(k) of the PHS Act must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed. However, a sponsor may seek to use data derived from animal or clinical studies comparing a proposed product with a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act. In such a case, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.17 Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program their plans to provide an adequate scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of such justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFootnote 16: Sections 7002(a)(2) and (b)(3) of the Affordable Care Act, adding sections 351(k), 351(i)(2), and 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act.\n\nVI Approaches to developing and assessing evidence to demonstrate biosimilarity\n\nFDA recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to develop the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity. FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence provided by a sponsor when the Agency evaluates the sponsor\'s demonstration of biosimilarity, consistent with a longstanding Agency approach to evaluating scientific evidence.18\n\nFootnote 18: See footnote 4.\n\nUsing a Stepwise Approach to Demonstrate Biosimilarity\n--------------------\nContext title: Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product'

This guidance should be used as a companion to other guidances available from FDA that describe the CMC information appropriate for evaluation of protein products.7 We encourage early interaction with FDA to discuss specific CMC issues that may arise for a sponsor's proposed product.\n\nFootnote 7: For CMC requirements for submission of a marketing application, sponsors should consult current regulations and see the guidance for industry Submission on Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for a Therapeutic Recombinant DNA-Derived Product or a Monoclonal Antibody Product for In-vivo Use, as well as other applicable FDA guidance documents.\n\nIn addition to comparative analytical studies, an assessment of whether a proposed product is biosimilar to a reference product generally will include animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity) and a clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics).8\n\nFootnote 8: For a discussion of the Agency’s current thinking on animal and clinical studies relevant to demonstrating biosimilarity, see the guidance for industry Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product.\n\nThis guidance applies to applications submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. However, some scientific principles described in this guidance may be informative for the development of certain biological products under section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act.9 Section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act and section 351(k) of the PHS Act are two separate statutory schemes. This guidance is not intended to describe any relationship between the standards for approval under these schemes.\n\nFootnote 9: A 505(b)(2) application is an NDA that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the sponsor and for which the sponsor has not obtained a right of reference or use (e.g., the Agency’s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug or published literature). A 505(b)(2) application that seeks to rely on a listed drug (i.e., the reference product) must contain adequate data and information to demonstrate that the proposed product is sufficiently similar to the listed drug to justify reliance, in part, on FDA’s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for the listed drug. Any aspects of the proposed product that differ from the listed drug must be supported by adequate data and information to show that the differences do not affect the safety and effectiveness of the proposed product.\n\n4 General Principles\n\nAdvances in analytical sciences (both physicochemical and biological) enable some protein products to be characterized extensively in terms of their physicochemical and biological properties. These analytical procedures have improved the ability to identify and characterize not only the desired product but also product-related substances and product- and process-related impurities.10 Advances in manufacturing science and production methods, as well as advances in analytical sciences, may enhance the likelihood that a proposed product can be demonstrated to be highly similar to a reference product by better targeting the reference product's physiochemical and functional properties. In addition, advances in analytical sciences may enable detection and characterization of differences between the protein products. These differences should be further assessed to understand the impact on product performance.\n\nDespite improvements in analytical techniques, current analytical methodology may not be able to detect or characterize all relevant structural and functional differences between the two protein products. A thorough understanding of each analytical method's limitations will be critical to a sponsor's successful identification of residual uncertainties and, in turn, to the design of subsequent testing. In addition, there may be incomplete understanding of the relationship between a product's structural attributes and its clinical performance. Sponsors should use appropriate analytical methodology that has adequate sensitivity and specificity to detect and characterize differences between the proposed product and the reference product. Accordingly, FDA encourages the use of widely available state-of-the-art technology.\n\nIn addition to a complete CMC data submission as required under section 351(a) of the PHS Act, an application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act is required to include data supporting the analytical similarity of the proposed biosimilar product to the reference product. The rationale for the analytical similarity assessment should be clearly described with consideration for the known quality attributes and performance characteristics of the specific reference product.\n\nComparative analytical data provide the foundation for a biosimilar development program and can influence decisions about the type and amount of animal and clinical data needed to support a demonstration of biosimilarity. Such analytical data should be available early in product development and will permit more detailed discussion with the Agency because known quality attributes can be used to shape biosimilar development and justify certain development decisions. Thus, in addition to the preliminary comparative analytical similarity data that should be submitted to support an initial advisory meeting, FDA encourages sponsors to submit comprehensive analytical similarity data early in the development process: at the pre-IND stage; with the original IND submission; or with the submission of data from the initial clinical studies, such as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. FDA will best be able to provide meaningful input on the extent and scope of animal and additional clinical studies for a proposed biosimilar development program once the Agency has considered the analytical similarity data.\n\nExtensive, robust comparative physicochemical and functional studies (these may include biological assays, binding assays, and enzyme kinetics) should be performed to evaluate whether the proposed product and the reference product are highly similar. A meaningful assessment as to whether the proposed product is highly similar to the reference product depends on, among other things, the capabilities of available state-of-the-art analytical assays to assess, for example, the molecular weight of the protein, complexity of the protein (higher order structure and posttranslational modifications), degree of heterogeneity, functional properties, impurity profiles, and degradation profiles denoting stability. The capability of the methods used in these analytical assessments, as well as their limitations, should be described by the sponsor. Physicochemical and functional characterization studies should be sufficient to establish relevant quality attributes including those that define a product's identity, quantity, safety, purity, and potency. The product-related impurities, product-related substances, and process-related impurities should be identified, characterized as appropriate, quantified, and compared with multiple lots of the proposed product to multiple lots of the reference product, to the extent feasible and relevant, as part of an assessment of the potential impact on the safety, purity, and potency of the product.\n\nPrimary structure of some protein products can be highly heterogeneous, which could affect the expected clinical performance of a protein product. Protein heterogeneity may arise in a number of ways. Replication errors in the DNA encoding the protein sequence and amino acid misincorporation may occur during translation, although the level of these errors is typically low. In addition, most protein products undergo some posttranslational modification that can alter the functions of the protein by attaching other biochemical groups such as phosphate and various lipids and carbohydrates; by proteolytic cleavage following translation; by changing the chemical nature of an amino acid (e.g., formylation); or by many other mechanisms. Such modifications can result from intracellular activities during cell culture or by deliberate modification of the protein, for example, PEGylation. Other posttranslational modifications can be a consequence of manufacturing process operations; for example, glycation may occur with exposure of the product to reducing sugars. Also, storage conditions may be permissive for certain degradation pathways such as oxidation, deamidation, or aggregation. All of these product-related variants may alter the biological properties of the expressed recombinant protein. Therefore, identification and determination of the relative levels of these protein variants should be included in the comparative analytical characterization studies.\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity of a Therapeutic Protein Product to a Reference Product Guidance for Industry""

The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n\nThe determination of the amount of added sugars contributed by a powdered fruit or vegetable juice that is added as an ingredient to a product and that is not reconstituted to single strength juice during processing (e.g., that is added to a pureed fruit or to a yogurt) would be the same as the determination of the sugars contributed by a liquid or frozen fruit or vegetable juice concentrate. In our response to question 11, we have suggested that when calculating the added sugars declaration for a product containing concentrated fruit or vegetable juice, the total moisture content of the finished product can be considered to go towards reconstitution of the fruit juice concentrate in the formulation. Thus, the total moisture content of a finished product formulated with powdered fruit or vegetable juice concentrates can be considered to contribute towards the dilution of the powdered fruit or vegetable juice. Further, the sugars contributed by the powdered fruit or vegetable juice that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type must be declared as added sugars on the label, as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule.\n8. Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates? We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12). We require that, when a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)). If you use Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 to calculate the amount of added sugars in a product containing juice concentrate, you must document this information in the records regarding the amount of added sugars added to the food during processing (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). If you use the amount of sugars present in a single strength juice and/or a juice concentrate, that is determined through chemical analysis or other available information, when calculating the amount of added sugars in a product containing fruit juice concentrate, you must document the source of the information and/or the amount of sugars determined through chemical analysis in the records that you make and keep (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). If a diluted juice concentrate slightly exceeds the amount of sugar that would be found in the same volume of the same type of 100 percent fruit juice, manufacturers should document the average and consistency with cGMPs in the records that they make and keep.\n9. Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis? The amount of added sugars declared on the label must be in grams (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The added sugars definition includes sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. For juice, the serving size is based on volume (e.g., 8 oz. or 240 ml) while the amount of added sugars per serving is based on weight. Therefore, when calculating the weight of added sugars per serving, you may need to consider the densities of both the finished juice product and the single strength juice of the same type. You may choose to arrive at the gram amount of added sugars in different ways. Please see our responses to questions 11 and 12 for examples of how to calculate the amount of added sugars in products containing concentrated fruit juices on both a volume and weight basis.\n10. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit or vegetable juice (juice made from a single type of fruit or vegetable) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength juice where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)? In the hypothetical example below, we provide three general steps to calculate the amount of added sugars (in grams) for an apple juice product (240 ml serving size) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength apple juice. The product in this hypothetical example is reconstituted to have juice soluble solids above the minimum Brixrequirement in 21 CFR 101.30 where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9). Therefore, all sugars in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice must be declared as added sugars. The apple juice example here uses the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration. This example is provided solely to demonstrate one method of calculating the added sugars content of the product. You can use alternate methods.\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals""

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.

It specifically explains how FDA intends to consider exercising enforcement discretion when a conflict occurs between compliance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), section 101.9(c), and compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(g) such that compliance with both sections is not possible.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nFDA\'s regulations in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 describe requirements for nutrition labeling in conventional foods and dietary supplements, respectively. The requirements for declaring the nutrient value in a serving of conventional food are in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8). Certain dietary ingredients in dietary supplements are also required to be declared in accordance with these requirements (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)). These dietary ingredients are listed in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2) and are referred to as ""(b)(2)-dietary ingredients."" Unlike nutrients in conventional food, the (b)(2)-dietary ingredients can only be declared when they are present in dietary supplements in amounts that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling according to 21 CFR 101.9(c) (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nFDA\'s regulations under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and (5) describe compliance requirements for declaring nutrients and dietary ingredients2 in nutrition labeling. A conventional food or dietary supplement declaring the amount of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in its labeling is misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)] if:\n\nFootnote 2: See 21 CFR 101.36(f)(1).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber is below 80 percent of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).3 Footnote 3: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of calories, total sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).4 Footnote 4: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).\n\nFor the remainder of this document, we refer to 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) as ""the compliance requirements.""\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nIn many cases, the amount of a nutrient or (b)(2)-dietary ingredient declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) will not conflict with the compliance requirements. However, certain small amounts of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients cannot be declared in accordance with both 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) and the compliance requirements. In these cases, the amount declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) is below or above the level provided by the compliance requirements.\n\nExample 1 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(iv), monounsaturated fat content must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams. Therefore, if the analyzed value of monounsaturated fat is 0.75 to 1.00 grams, the amount of monounsaturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 1.00 gram (or 1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value is 0.80 gram or greater. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value of monounsaturatedfat is 0.75 to 0.79 gram because values in this range are not at least equal to 80 percent of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 1 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are below 80 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are greater than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable excesses of nutrients, such as monounsaturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nExample 2 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i), saturated fat must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams, unless the amount is less than 0.5 gram. Therefore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.50 to 0.74 gram, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 0.50 gram (0.5g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 0.50 to 0.60 gram. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.61 to 0.74 gram because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 0.50 gram.\n\nFurthermore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 1.00 to 1.24 grams, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i) is 1.00 gram (1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.20 grams or less. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.21 to 1.24 grams because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 2 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are above 20 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are less than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable deficiencies of nutrients, such as saturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nFor certain nutrients, such as total fat and its components (including monounsaturated fat and saturated fat), if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the amount must be expressed as zero in nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(c)). Unlike nutrients in conventional food, (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in dietary supplements must not be declared in nutrition labeling when the amount is zero (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nIV FDA\'s Policy\n\nAs discussed, when the analyzed value of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients present in small amounts is declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8), the declared amount may conflict with the compliance requirements. In such cases, we intend to consider the use of our enforcement discretion with respect to the compliance requirements and recommend that manufacturers declare nutrients and (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: A food that already contains some endogenous sugar and additional added sugars, either directly or as a component in an ingredient, such as sweetened fruit added to yogurt, would be misbranded if the actual ""Total Sugars"" amount is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label, or the records requirements for ""Added Sugars"" are not met (see SS 101.9(g)(11)).\n\nDo sugars present in a sweet fermented beverage after fermentation need to be declared as total or added sugars on the label?\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains only sugars that meet our definition of added sugars (e.g. table sugar), then the amount of sugars present in a serving of the product after fermentation must be declared as both total and added sugars (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains both sugars that do and do not meet our definition of added sugars, you may determine the amount of total sugars in the finished food analytically. You have the following options related to the added sugars declaration:\n\nDetermine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in the finished product and make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information you relied upon that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation; or\n\nDeclare the amount of added sugars added prior to fermentation and make and keep records to verify the amount (21 CFR 101.9(g)). The amount of added sugars declared should not exceed the amount of total sugars on the label; or\n\nIf you have no way to determine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in the finished food, but have reason to believe that a significant reduction of added sugars took place during fermentation, you may submit a petition, under 21 CFR 10.30, to request an alternative means of compliance. The petition should provide scientific data or other information for why the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product is likely to be significantly reduced compared to the amount added prior to fermentation. A significant reduction would be where reduction in added sugars after fermentation may be significant enough to impact the label declaration for added sugars by an amount that exceeds the reasonable deficiency acceptable within good manufacturing practice under SS 101.9(g)(6). In addition, the scientific data or other information should include the reason why you are unable to determine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in a serving of the finished product and a description of the process that you used to come to that conclusion.\n\nIngredients made primarily from sugar and created through non-enzymatic browning are added to some products for coloring and flavoring purposes (e.g. caramel color). After non-enzymatic browning occurs, the sugar is reduced in the ingredient. In such a case, how much sugar must be declared as added sugars on the label? If the remaining amount of the sugar contributed by an ingredient that undergoes non-enzymatic browning is detectable by testing in the finished product, you may declare that amount of sugar that is detectible by analytical testing in the finished product as the added sugars declaration. When such an ingredient is added to a product that contains other sugars that do not meet the definition of added sugars, you must make and keep records, which should include records of the results of the analytical testing that is used to demonstrate the amount of added sugars contributed by the ingredient in the finished product after non-enzymatic browning occurs, and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(v)(A)).\n\n20. If sugar is added for fermentation during the leavening process of a baked good and some of the sugars are consumed by yeast, should the reduction in the amount of sugars be accounted for the declaration of added sugars?\n\nAs described in our response to question 19, you may declare the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation. If you do so, you must make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information relied upon by the manufacturer that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(v)(A)).\n21. There is a chance that added sugars content prior to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation may be higher than the total sugars content of the finished food determined through chemical analysis. How do I approximate the added sugars value in this case?\n\nThe added sugars declaration should not exceed the total sugars declaration. In a case where sugars added prior to or during processing are reduced through non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation, and the manufacturer chooses to declare the amount of sugars added prior to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation, the added sugars declaration could conceivably exceed the amount of total sugars determined through chemical analysis. In such a case, you should declare the same amount for added sugars as the amount of total sugars obtained through analytical testing for a serving of the food.\n\nV Question and Answer on Format Issues\n\n1. What are the specifications for thickness of lines and leading (i.e., space between lines) on the Nutrition Facts label?\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(ii)(C) and (d)(1)(v) establish certain format requirements with respect to leading and the use of hairline rules.\n\nAdditionally, Appendix B to Part 101 in Title 21 provides examples of graphic enhancements (i.e., illustrations) that FDA uses. For more examples of graphic enhancements that FDA uses, please see our webpage at: https://www.fda.gov/media/99151/download.\n\nQuestion and Answer on the Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals\n\n1. What are the requirements (e.g. for rounding) for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals declared on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels? What does ""levels of significance"" mean in this context?\n\nWe require, under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii), that the quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals, excluding sodium, be the amount of the vitamin or mineral included in a serving of the product using the units of measurement and the levels of significance given in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) (which refers to the Reference Daily Intakes (RDI) table). However, zeros following decimal points may be dropped, and additional levels of significance may be used when the number of decimal places indicated is not sufficient to express lower amounts (e.g., the RDI for zinc is given in whole milligrams, but the quantitative amount may be declared in tenths of a milligram). This is consistent with the requirements for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the Supplement Facts label (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B)).\n\nIn addition, regarding conventional foods, quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals present at less than 2 percent of the RDI are not required to be declared on the Nutrition Facts label. However, they may be declared by a zero or by the use of an asterisk (or other symbol) that refers to another asterisk (or symbol) that is placed at the bottom of the table that is followed by the statement ""Contains less than 2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients)"" or ""Contains (<)2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients)."" Alternatively, if vitamin D, calcium, iron or potassium is present in amounts less than 2 percent of the RDI, label declaration of the nutrient(s) is not required if the statement ""Not a significant source of _(listing the vitamins or minerals omitted)"" is placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii)).\n\nRegarding dietary supplements, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium must be declared when they are present in a dietary supplement in quantitative amounts by weight that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling of foods in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c). (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAs for the phrase ""levels of significance,"" as used in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii) and 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and whether the phrase refers to statistical testing of hypotheses or mathematical concepts related to the degree of accuracy starting with the first nonzero digit, the phrase ""levels of significance"" refers to the degree of accuracy when rounding nutrients for purposes of declaring quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the label.\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c), provide specific rounding requirements for nutrients such as sodium. Before we issued the Nutrition Facts label final rule, sodium and potassium content was to be expressed as zero when the serving contained less than 5 milligrams (mg), to the nearest 5 mg increment when the serving contained less than or equal to 140 mg, and to the nearest 10 mg increment when the serving contained more than 140 mg.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: 3. Do I need to take into consideration sugars from ingredients that are used in formulating my product when determining the added sugars declaration for a serving of my product?\n\nIngredients containing free mono- and disaccharides that meet our definition of added sugars need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (e.g. sugars from cane sugar and concentrated fruit juice added to sweeten an apple sauce). Manufacturers may need to work with ingredient suppliers to determine the amount of added sugars provided by ingredients used in formulating food products.\n\n4. Do the sugars in dried fruits meet the definition of added sugars?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we responded to comments on dried fruits (see response to comment 212, 81 FR 33742 at 33837). We said that dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them should not be considered to contain added sugars because they are essentially a dehydrated whole fruit and still retain the nutrients and other components of a whole fruit (e.g. diced dried apples). However, if additional sugar is added to a dried fruit, the sugar added to the dried fruit must be declared on the label as added sugars (81 FR 33742 at 33837).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5. Are the sugars used in the production of vinegar added sugars?\n\nIn the production of vinegar, naturally occurring sugars are first fermented into alcohol and then a secondary fermentation occurs in which alcohol is converted to vinegar. For most vinegar products, no sugars remain in the final product. Vinegars that do not contain any sugars in the finished food would not need an added sugars declaration. However, we are aware of some vinegars (e.g., balsamic vinegar) that are made using ingredients that are often used as sweeteners in foods, and that are similar to concentrated fruit juices (e.g., grape must). According to the definition of added sugars, sugars found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type are added sugars. Therefore, fruit juices that are concentrated before or during processing of some vinegars contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars. To the extent that sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are present in the finished product, the added sugars must be declared on the label and in labeling, as required in our Nutrition Facts label final rule. We understand that the manufacturing of vinegar involves several steps, and manufacturers need to consider the impact of these steps (e.g. potential concentration due to water loss when aged in wooden barrels) on the final added sugars declaration.\n\n6. The definition of added sugars excludes the ""fruit component of fruit spreads."" What constitutes the ""fruit component"" of a non-standardized fruit spread?\n\nPlease see our response to question 1 above. The fruit component of a non-standardized fruit spread would include whole fruits, pieces of fruit, dried fruit, fruit or vegetable pures (single strength or concentrated), fruit pulps, single strength juices, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders that are not made from fruit or vegetable juices.\n\n7. Do sugars found in fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the form of the fruit or vegetable (e.g., concentrated fruit and vegetable pures, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders) need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833), we explained that we excluded from the definition of ""added sugars"" whole fruit, fruit pieces, dried fruit, pulps, and pures because they are nutrient rich and maintain the basic properties of a fruit when added to foods and are not considered to contain added sugars (see response to comment 208, 81 FR 33742 at33835). We also explained that sugars from 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, and sugars from certain fruit and vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under certain regulations, fruit juice concentrates used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, and preserves under our standards of identity, and 100 percent juice concentrate sold directly to consumers (e.g. frozen orange juice concentrate) are excluded from the definition of ""added sugars.""\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833 through 33834), we explained that, while foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices can be a part of a healthful diet, the sugars added to the foods by the concentrated fruit or vegetable juice provide additional calories. Over the course of the day, small amounts of calories in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages can add up and make it difficult to balance the amount of calories expended (81 FR 33742 at 33834). For these reasons, we consider foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices to be sugar-sweetened foods (id).\n\nWe also explained that in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report (Ref. 1) (81 FR 33742 at 33835).\n\nWe are applying these same guiding principles when determining when the sugars in an ingredient are added sugars. Concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes, and some fruit and vegetable powders are essentially whole fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the physical form of the fruit or vegetable and to remove moisture. They maintain the basic properties of a whole fruit or vegetable, even if the peel and seeds may be removed. Their composition and use is more consistent with that of whole fruits or vegetables, dried fruits or vegetables, pulps and pureses than that of concentrated fruit juices, which are commonly used by industry in place of sugars. Therefore, the sugars in concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes and some fruit and vegetable powders contribute to the diet the same way that sugars found in whole fruits or vegetables do, and do not have to be declared as added sugars on the label. However, we consider sugars in powders made from fruit and vegetable juices to be the same as those found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices because such powders are essentially concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that have all moisture removed. Therefore, some or all sugars contributed by a powder made from fruit or vegetable juices must be declared as added sugars on the label as required by the Nutrition Facts label final rule, depending on the degree of reconstitution in the finished food.\n\nThe definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: The amount of added sugars declared on the label should never exceed the amount of total sugars on the label.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(i) Do Honey, Maple Syrup, and Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n\nIn the Federal Register of June 20, 2019 (84 FR 28726), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled ""The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products,"" which provides clarity on the labeling of added sugars for such products (Ref. 1). In that guidance, we discuss section 12516 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (""the Farm Bill""), which states that the food labeling requirements cannot require the declaration ""Includes Xg Added Sugars"" in a serving of these single-ingredient products. While these products are not required to have this declaration of the gram amount of added sugars, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet, so the percent DV for added sugars must still be included consistent with 21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii). We stated that we intend to exercise enforcement discretion by permitting the use of the ""+"" symbol immediately following the percent DV declaration for added sugars on packages and containers of single-ingredient sugars and syrups. This symbol would lead to a footnote inside the Nutrition Facts label, explaining the amount of added sugars that one serving of the product contributes to the diet, as well as the contribution of a serving of the product toward the percent DV for added sugars. This symbol and footnote are not required; however, we encourage you to use them.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(ii) Do Added Sugars in Dried Cranberry Products and Cranberry Beverage Products Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n\nYou must still declare added sugars in grams and the corresponding percent DV on labels for all dried cranberry products and cranberry beverage products (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). In the Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products guidance, we said that we intend to exercise enforcement discretion for these cranberry products to allow the use of a symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV declaration which would lead to a truthful and not misleading statement outside the Nutrition Facts label explaining that sugars are added to improve the palatability of naturally tart cranberries (see Ref. 1). This symbol can be used for cranberry products that are sweetened with added sugars and that contain total sugars per serving at levels no greater than comparable products with no added sugars (i.e. unsweetened grape juice) (Ref. 1).\n\nV.A.1.(a).(iii) Does Allulose Count as an Added Sugar?\n\nThe final rule does not reach a decision as to whether allulose should be excluded from the labeling of carbohydrate, sugars, and/or added sugars. We stated that, as a monosaccharide, itmust be included in the declaration of each, pending any future rulemaking that would otherwise exclude it from the declaration (81 FR 33742 at 33796; 21 CFR 101.9(c)(i) through (iii)).\n\nIn the Federal Register of April 18, 2019 (84 FR 16272), we announced the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled ""The Declaration of Allulose and Calories from Allulose on Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels."" This guidance, when finalized, would advise manufacturers of our intent to exercise enforcement discretion for the exclusion of allulose from the amount of ""Total Sugars"" and ""Added Sugars"" declared on the label and the use of a general factor of 0.4 calories per gram for allulose when determining ""Calories"" on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels, pending review of the issues in a rulemaking (Ref. 2).\n\nv.a.1.(b) How Do I Calculate Added Sugars?\n\nIn the Federal Register of November 5, 2018 (83 FR 55266), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled ""Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels: Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals."" This guidance provides questions and answers (Q&A) on topics related to compliance with the labeling of added sugars. The Q&A discusses how you should determine the amount of added sugars in a serving of a product, as well as which ingredients need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (Ref. 3).\n\nThis guidance also provides a detailed discussion on the calculation of added sugars for ingredients and products such as concentrated fruit and vegetable purees, fruit and vegetable pastes, fruit and vegetable powders, juice cocktails, or juice blends, which often contain juice concentrates (Q&A IV. 7-12), products for which manufacturers employ a hydrolysis step (Q&A IV. 14-16), and products that undergo non-enzymatic browning or fermentation (Q&A IV. 18-21) (Ref. 3). Please refer to this guidance for questions you may have regarding the calculation and declaration of added sugars for a serving of your product.\n\nv.a.2 Vitamin D\n\nVitamin D is now considered a nutrient of ""public health significance"" for the general population, and its declaration is now mandatory (81 FR 33742 at 33884). Both the gram amount and the percent DV for Vitamin D must be declared at the bottom of the label, directly preceding the calcium declaration (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(ii)). While only the term ""vitamin D"" can be used on the food labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv)), the specific form that is added to a food must be listed in the ingredient list statement (21 CFR 101.4). For Supplement Facts labels, the source ingredient may be identified within the nutrition label in parentheses immediately following or indented beneath the name of a dietary ingredient and preceded by the word ""as"" or ""from"" (21 CFR 101.36(d)). When you do not identify a source ingredient within the nutrition label, you must list it in an ingredient statement (21 CFR 101.4(g)). You should not list it in both places (81 FR 33742 at 33891).\n\nv.a.3 Potassium\n\nPotassium is also now considered a nutrient of ""public health significance"" for the general population (81 FR 33742 at 33884). It has been assigned an RDI, instead of a DRV (21 CFR 101.9(8)(iv)). We now require the declaration of both the gram amount and the percent DV for potassium at the bottom of the label, directly following the iron declaration. Potassium is now covered under the term ""mineral"" that appears in each section of 21 CFR 101.9. Any listing of potassium on the Nutrition Facts label must meet the specific nutrient declaration requirements for minerals under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4), 101.9(g)(4)(i), 101.9(g)(4)(ii), and 101.9(g)(6).

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended for conventional food and dietary supplement manufacturers. It provides questions and answers on topics related to compliance with our final rules issued on May 27, 2016, entitled ""Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels"" (81 FR 33742; the ""Nutrition Facts label final rule"") and ""Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments"" (81 FR 34000; the ""serving size final rule"") (codified at title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 101 (21 CFR part 101)). This guidance also discusses labeling of added sugars, as well as formatting for lines (e.g. thickness of lines) and leading (e.g. space between lines) in the examples of graphics used by FDA on the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nIn this guidance, ""you"" (or ""I"") refers to a manufacturer of conventional food or dietary supplements.\n\nII Background\n\nOn May 27, 2016, we published the Nutrition Facts label and the serving size final rules related to the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels, which amended our labeling regulations for foods to provide updated nutrition information to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices.\n\nBelow is a summary of the combined major provisions of the Nutrition Facts label final rule and serving size final rule.\n\nThe final rules revise the Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts labels by:\n\nRemoving the declaration of ""Calories from fat"";\n\nRequiring the declaration of the gram (g) amount of ""added sugars"" in a serving of a product, establishing a Daily Reference Value (DRV) for added sugars, and requiring the percent Daily Value (DV) declaration for added sugars;\n\nChanging ""Sugars"" to ""Total Sugars"" and requiring that ""Includes \'X\' g Added Sugars"" be indented and declared directly below ""Total Sugars"";\n\nUpdating the list of vitamins and minerals of public health significance;\n\nUpdating certain reference values used in the declaration of percent DVs of nutrients on the Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts labels;\n\nRevising the format of the Nutrition Facts labels to increase the prominence of the declaration of ""Calories"";\n\nRemoving the requirement for the footnote table listing the reference values for certain nutrients for 2,000 and 2,500 calorie diets;\n\nRequiring the maintenance of records to support the declarations of certain nutrients under specified circumstances;\n\nAmending the definition of a single-serving container;\n\nRequiring dual-column labeling for certain packages;\n\nAmending several reference amounts customarily consumed that are used by manufacturers to determine their label serving size; and * Establishing an effective date of July 26, 2016, and a compliance date of January 1, 2020, for manufacturers with more than $10 million in food sales (originally scheduled to be July 26, 2018) and January 1, 2021, for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales (originally scheduled to be July 26, 2019).2 Footnote 2: On October 2, 2017, FDA issued a proposed rule that would extend the compliance dates to January 1, 2020 (i.e., for manufacturers with more than $10 million in food sales) and January 1, 2021 (i.e., for manufacturers with less than $10 million in food sales) (82 FR 45753). We finalized the changes to the compliance date in the Federal Register of May 4, 2018 (83 FR 19619).\n\nIII. Questions and Answers on Compliance Issues\n\nMust the updated Nutrition or Supplement Facts label appear on all foods sold by the applicable compliance date? After publication of the final rule, we included a frequently asked question on our website asking ""When must the label be displayed on food packages?"" In our response, we stated that the revised labels were to be displayed on food products that are initially introduced into interstate commerce on or after the compliance date, and said we would address the issue further in guidance. We received a number of questions about products at various points in the distribution chain and whether the product would need to bear the new version of the Nutrition or Supplement Facts label. After further consideration, we are providing the following guidance. Products that are labeled (i.e., when the label is placed on the product) on or after the applicable compliance date must bear a nutrition label that meets our new nutrition labeling requirements in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36. Products that are labeled before the applicable compliance date do not need to be in compliance with the new labeling requirements, and therefore, do not need to bear the new nutrition label. We consider the date the food product was labeled for purposes of determining whether the product must bear a nutrition label that meets the new requirements. We would not consider the location of the food in the distribution chain to determine whether a food product must bear a nutrition label that meets our new nutrition labeling requirements. For example, the food product, whether labeled before or after the compliance date, may be at the manufacturing facility awaiting distribution, at a warehouse awaiting further distribution, in transit to the United States to be offered for import, or on the store shelf of a U.S. retail establishment. We do not object to the use of a sticker for providing a revised nutrition label that meets our new requirements in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 before new packaging is printed. The sticker label should not cover any other mandatory information and should adhere to the package during normal handling.\n\nWhen determining whether labels need to be in compliance with the new requirements, should the determination as to whether my company has $10 million or more in annual food sales be based on domestic food sales or total food sales, including international sales, and how many years of sales should I consider? To determine whether a company has $10 million or more in annual food sales, a firm can either take the smallest sales volume from the previous three years (e.g., 2013, 2014, and 2015), or alternately the firm can take the average of the previous three years sales volume. A firm\'s total (domestic plus international) food sales best reflects the firm\'s resources and, thus, ability to comply with the final rules by the applicable compliance date.\n\nAre there certain approved companies or nutrition databases that manufacturers can use to get the nutrition values for their products? FDA does not approve nutrition databases. However, the United States Department of Agriculture provides nutrition information for a number of foods, and there are also several commercially available nutrition databases you can use to determine nutrition values for your products.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals']","['The amount of added sugars is based on the finished product composition. Juice (fruit or vegetable) ingredients are unique in that the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient depends on whether the juice ingredient is concentrated, and thus, contains sugar in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. We realize that food formulation is complex and manufacturers can use different ingredients or alternative formulas to achieve the same finished product composition. For example, you may use 100% fruit juice and dry sugar in a baking application. You also may have an alternative formulation that uses concentrated fruit juice and liquid syrup to achieve the same product composition. When water or other wet ingredients containing water (e.g. milk, syrup, egg, diluted wines and cider with less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, etc.) are added to a formulation containing concentrated juice and other ingredients during processing, the amount of moisture that goes towards reconstituting the juice or towards wetting or reconstituting other ingredients is not known. Furthermore, if the water added during formulation is divided among the ingredients when determining the amount of reconstitution or wetting that has occurred, different formulations of the same finished food could have different calculated added sugar amounts. Therefore, we considered an approach that we believe would provide a reasonable estimate of the added sugars content of a multi-ingredient product that includes concentrated fruit juice as an ingredient (e.g. a bakery product, marinade, or diluted wines and cider with less than 7 percent alcohol by volume). When concentrated juices are used in the formulation, we believe that it is practical to use all of the moisture in the formulation towards reconstitution of the concentrated juice when calculating the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product. It is also possible that the initial juice ingredient in the formulation (either diluted, 100%, or concentrated) is further concentrated during processing due to loss of water (e.g., during drying or baking). Because the amount of added sugars is based on the finished product composition, you should account for the loss of water during processing to reflect the concentration of the juice ingredient after processing. Considering the complexity of food formulation and processing, we believe it is also appropriate to use the moisture content of the finished product towards reconstitution of the juice soluble solids when the product is subject to water loss during processing. This approach is consistent with our approach for the use of all of the moisture in the formulation towards reconstitution of concentrated juices when calculating the added sugars content of an ingredient. The following general approach can be used to calculate the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation. This general approach applies when there is either dilution or concentration during manufacturing.']",0.8099999999838,0.2
18,"Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?","[""--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 4: Specifications must be scientifically sound and appropriate (§ 211.160(b)), test procedures must be validated as to their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility (§ 211.165(e)), and the suitability of the test procedures under actual conditions of use must be documented (§ 211.194(a)(2)). For products that are the subjects of new drug applications (NDAs), abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), or investigational new drug applications (INDs), specifications are contained in the application or DMF. Specifications for nonapplication products may be found in official compendia or established by the manufacturer.\n\nBoth finished pharmaceuticals and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are to be manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practice under section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act. Current good manufacturing practice for APIs includes the performance of scientifically sound raw material testing, in-process monitoring, release and stability testing, process validation, and adequate investigations of any OOS result obtained from such testing. All citations to part 211 in this document pertain to finished pharmaceuticals, but these referenced regulatory requirements are also consistent with Agency guidance on CGMP for APIs with respect to laboratory controls, which include out-of-specification investigations. See FDA'sguidance for industry Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (September 2016) (ICH Q7) for specific recommendations.5\n\nFootnote 5: We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the CDER guidance page at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/guidances-drugs.\n\nThe responsibility of a contract testing laboratory in meeting these requirements is equivalent to that of a manufacturing firm.\n\nIII Identifying and Assessing OOS Test Results -- Phase I: Laboratory Investigation\n\nFDA regulations require that an investigation be conducted whenever an OOS test result is obtained (SS 211.192).6 The purpose of the investigation is to determine the cause of the OOS result. The source of the OOS result should be identified either as an aberration of the measurement process or an aberration of the manufacturing process. Even if a batch is rejected based on an OOS result, the investigation is necessary to determine if the result is associated with other batches of the same drug product or other products. Batch rejection does not negate the need to perform the investigation. The regulations require that a written record of the investigation be made, including the conclusions and follow-up (SS 211.192).\n\nFootnote 6: Although the subject of this document is OOS results, much of the guidance may be useful for examining results that are out of trend.\n\nTo be meaningful, the investigation should be thorough, timely, unbiased, well-documented, and scientifically sound. The first phase of such an investigation should include an initial assessment of the accuracy of the laboratory's data. Whenever possible, this should be done before test preparations (including the composite or the homogenous source of the aliquot tested) are discarded. This way, hypotheses regarding laboratory error or instrument malfunctions can be tested using the same test preparations. If this initial assessment indicates that no causative errors were made in the analytical method used to arrive at the data, a full-scale OOS investigation should be conducted. For contract laboratories, the laboratory should convey its data, findings, and supporting documentation to the manufacturing firm's quality unit (QU). The manufacturing firm's QU should then initiate the Phase 2 (full-scale) OOS investigation, whenever no clearly causative laboratory error was identified.\n\nResponsibility of the Analyst\n\nThe first responsibility for achieving accurate laboratory testing results lies with the analyst who is performing the test. The analyst should be aware of potential problems that could occur during the testing process and should watch for problems that could create inaccurate results.\n\nIn accordance with the CGMP regulations in SS 211.160(b)(4), the analyst should ensure that only those instruments meeting established performance specifications are used and that all instruments are properly calibrated.\n\nCertain analytical methods have system suitability requirements, and systems not meeting these requirements should not be used. For example, in chromatographic systems, reference standard solutions may be injected at intervals throughout chromatographic runs to measure drift, noise, and repeatability. If reference standard responses indicate that the system is not functioning properly, all of the data collected during the suspect time period should be properly identified and should not be used. The cause of the malfunction should be identified and, if possible, corrected before a decision is made whether to use any data prior to the suspect period.\n\nAnalysts should check the data for compliance with test specifications before discarding test preparations or standard preparations. When unexpected results are obtained and no obvious explanation exists, test preparations should be retained, if stable, and the analyst should inform the supervisor. An assessment of the accuracy of the results should be started immediately.\n\nIf errors are obvious, such as the spilling of a sample solution or the incomplete transfer of a sample composite, the analyst should immediately document what happened. Analysts should not knowingly continue an analysis they expect to invalidate at a later time for an assignable cause (i.e., analyses should not be completed for the sole purpose of seeing what results can be obtained when obvious errors are known).\n\nResponsibilities of the Laboratory Supervisor\n\nOnce an OOS result has been identified, the supervisor's assessment should be objective and timely. There should be no preconceived assumptions as to the cause of the OOS result. Data should be assessed promptly to ascertain if the results might be attributed to laboratory error, or whether the results could indicate problems in the manufacturing process. An immediate assessment could include re-examination of the actual solutions, test units, and glassware used in the original measurements and preparations, which might provide more credibility for laboratory error hypotheses.\n\nThe following steps should be taken as part of the supervisor's assessment:\n\nDiscuss the test method with the analyst; confirm analyst knowledge of and performance of the correct procedure.\n\nExamine the raw data obtained in the analysis, including chromatograms and spectra, and identify anomalous or suspect information.\n\nVerify that the calculations used to convert raw data values into a final test result are scientifically sound, appropriate, and correct; also determine if unauthorized or unvalidated changes have been made to automated calculation methods.\n\nConfirm the performance of the instruments.\n\nDetermine that appropriate reference standards, solvents, reagents, and other solutions were used and that they met quality control specifications.\n\nEvaluate the performance of the test method to ensure that it is performing according to the standard expected based on method validation data and historical data.\n\nFully document and preserve records of this laboratory assessment.\n\nThe assignment of a cause for OOS results will be greatly facilitated if the retained sample preparations are examined promptly. Hypotheses regarding what might have happened (e.g., dilution error, instrument malfunction) should be tested. Examination of the retained solutions should be performed as part of the laboratory investigation.\n\nExamples:\n\nSolutions can be re-injected as part of an investigation where a transient equipment malfunction is suspected. Such hypotheses are difficult to prove. However, reinjections can provide strong evidence that the problem should be attributed to the instrument, rather than the sample or its preparation.\n\nFor release rate testing of certain specialized dosage form drugs that are not destroyed during testing, where possible, examination of the original dosage unit tested might determine whether it was damaged during laboratory handling in a way that affected its performance. Such damage would provide evidence to invalidate the OOS test result, and a retest would be indicated.\n\nFurther extraction of a dosage unit, where possible, can be performed to determine whether it was fully extracted during the original analysis. Incomplete extraction could invalidate the test results and should lead to questions regarding validation of the test method.\n\nIt is important that each step in the investigation be fully documented. Laboratory management should ascertain not only the reliability of the individual value obtained, but also the significance these OOS results represent to the laboratory quality assurance program. Laboratory management should be especially alert to developing trends. As part of an effective quality system, a firm's upper management should appropriately monitor these trends and ensure that any problematic areas are addressed.\n\nLaboratory error should be relatively rare. Frequent errors suggest a problem that might be due to inadequate training of analysts, poorly maintained or improperly calibrated equipment, or careless work. Whenever laboratory error is identified, the firm should determine the source of that error and take corrective action to prevent recurrence. To ensure full compliance with the CGMP regulations, the manufacturer also should maintain adequate documentation of the corrective action.\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigating Out-of-Specification (OOS) Test Results for Pharmaceutical Production - Level 2 revision Guidance for Industry""

However, experience gained with the implementation of ICH Q7 since the approval in November 2000 shows that uncertainties related to the interpretation of some sections exist. Furthermore, the importance of the application of the life-cycle approach addressed in the new ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, Q10 Guidelines to API manufacturing procedures is emphasized by the ICH Quality Implementation Working Group (Quality IWG). Technical issues with regard to GMP of APIs - also in context with new ICH Guidelines - need to be addressed in order to harmonize expectations during inspections.\n\nA document would be helpful in removing these ambiguities and uncertainties and also in harmonizing the inspections of both small molecules and biotech APIs.\n\nIssues to be resolved\n\nThe following issues have so far been identified by practical experience and will need to be addressed in a Q&A document on Q7:\n\nOutput from the review of existing Q&As (e.g., from PIC/S Expert Circle on APIs, from initial Regulatory/PDA training 2002) currently underway by PIC/S teams will be considered for endorsement.\n\nTechnical issues for clarification such as application in the supply chain control, contractor/supplier management (outsourcing), monitoring of impurity profiles, quality systems, applicability to biologicals/biotech and relationship with Q5D, and GMP expectations in the development phase (manufacturing for clinical trials).\n\nImpact of the implementation of ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, and Q10 on Q7 (see also Quality IWG Q&As and Points to Consider).\n\nBackground to the Proposal\n\nIt has become apparent, based on the approval and implementation of ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11 principles into GMP of APIs that certain individual implementation approaches are leading to non harmonized interpretation and new expectations beyond the intention of ICH Q7. The Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme (PIC/S) launched the 'International Collaboration on APIs - Training programme on ICH Q7'. This training programme includes a basic training, an advanced training and a Q&A document on interpretation of ICH Q7. This provides a feedback by the global knowledge of its network of inspectors. PIC/S will be supportive of the Q7 IWG work.\n\nType of Implementation Working Group and Resources\n\nThe Q7 IWG should comprise of the Six ICH Parties (2 experts per Party), Observers to ICH (1 expert per Observer), RHIs, DRAs and DoH (1 expert per RHI/DRA/DoH), and Interested Parties (WSNI, IGPA, Biotechnology Industry, PIC/S, API Industry and CEP programme of EDQM, 1 expert per Interested Party).\n\nTiming\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Q&As Concept Paper""

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?\n--------------------\nContext: The intent of ICH Q7 is that samples be retained for the period of time that the API could be in the market in order to investigate any problems and/or product complaints. Based on accepted industry practice at the time ICH Q7 was written, it was not anticipated that a manufacturer would set a retest date longer than 3 years. It is a basic GMP principle that reserve samples be retained for the entire period the material is available on the market. For example, if a company sets a retest date of 5 years and the API is completely distributed immediately after manufacturing, it is not intended that the reserve sample be destroyed before the 5-year retest date is reached.\n\nWhy does ICH Q7 permit the use of a packaging system for reserve/retention samples that is ""more protective than the marketed packaging system"" (ICH Q7, paragraph 11.72)?\n\nUnlike stability samples, the purpose of the reserve/retention sample is not to represent the quality of the batch in the market place but to allow future evaluation of the quality of the original API batch (e.g., in evaluation of potential counterfeits). Therefore, reserve/retention samples may be stored in packaging (and conditions) that better preserve the original state of the API.\n\nValidation (12)\n\nIs the lifecycle approach to process validation acceptable for APIs under ICH Q7?\n\nYes, ICH Q7 does not preclude the lifecycle approach (ICH Q7, paragraph 12.10; ICH Q10; ICH Q11).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCan the range of a process parameter be expanded based only on a process deviation(s)?\n\nNo. However, information from the investigation into a process deviation(s) can be used to support expanding the range of a process parameter. Additional work and studies are normally needed to adequately demonstrate that the expanded range for the process parameter consistently produces API of the necessary quality (ICH Q7, paragraphs 2.16, 12.11, 13.13).\n\nWould additional process validation studies be needed to support a change in the source of an API starting material?\n\nAny change in the API starting material should be assessed for impact on the API manufacturing process and the resulting API quality (ICH Q7, paragraph 7.14). Additional validation studies of the API process may be warranted if the change in the API starting material is deemed significant. In most cases, validation would be expected for a different source of the starting material unless otherwise justified (ICH Q7, paragraphs 12.1, 13.13).\n\nIs a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n\nProspective validation is normally expected for processes introduced since the publication of ICH Q7. The concept of retrospective validation remains acceptable as an exception for existing, well-established products prior to the implementation of ICH Q7 (ICH Q7, paragraph 12.44).\n\nIf regulatory discussions redefine a step as critical, which had previously been considered noncritical, a protocol describing retrospective analysis of data together with the commitment for concurrent or prospective validation may be an option.\n\nRegardless of the type of validation, the quality system should confirm the ongoing robustness of the process (e.g., product quality review).\n\nChange Control (13)\n\nWho is responsible for notifying the drug product manufacturer about relevant changes in API manufacturing?\n\nEach party in the supply chain is responsible for transferring information related to quality or regulatory changes to the next customer in the supply chain. The intention is that the information is transferred along the supply chain to the drug product manufacturer in a timely manner (ICH Q7, paragraphs 13.17, 17.60).\n\nRejection and Reuse of Materials (14)\n\nShould rejected materials be stored under physical and secure segregation? ICH Q7 does not specify a need for physical and secure segregation. Both paragraphs 4.14 and 10.11 of ICH Q7 include the provision for the use of alternative control systems for storage of rejected material. Whatever control system is used, the purpose should be to prevent the unintentional or unauthorized use of the rejected material (ICH Q7, paragraphs 7.44, 10.11, section XIV.A (14.1)).\n\nDoes the definition of expiry date in ICH Q7 preclude the rework or reprocess of an expired API? According to the definition, material should not be used after the expiry date. The original intent of this definition in ICH Q7 was that expired API should not be used in drug product formulation. It may be acceptable to reprocess (ICH Q7, section XIV.B (14.2)) or rework (ICH Q7, section XIV.C (14.3)) the expired API where the API manufacturer has all related historical GMP documentation and additional stability data on the reworked or reprocessed API. There may be registration/filing considerations that are beyond the scope of ICH Q7 in addition to the GMP considerations.\n\nIs validation expected for the recovery of material from mother liquor? It depends. Recovery of material(s) from mother liquor is a process, and the need for validation should be assessed as for any other process step (ICH Q7, paragraph 14.40). Recovery of material from mother liquor in any process step that must be controlled within predetermined criteria to ensure the API meets its specification is, by definition, a critical process step and should be validated. For example, recovery of API from mother liquor would be considered a critical process step and should be validated (ICH Q7, paragraphs 12.11, 12.12, 14.41, 14.43 -- see Glossary (section 20) for definitions of critical, materials, mother liquor, and validation).\n\nComplaints and Recalls (15)\n\nCan quality defects of released APIs that are identified by another entity belonging to the same company be handled outside of the API manufacturer\'s complaint procedure? Yes. After the release of an API for further use, any identified quality defect should be investigated and addressed according to the API manufacturer\'s complaint system or equivalent (i.e., nonconformance, deviations, etc.) (ICH Q7, paragraphs 15.10 to 15.12). Where equivalent systems are used, such defects should be categorized in a manner that provides clear visibility that the defect was discovered after being released by the API site.\n\nMust a quality related return, at the request of the API manufacturing site, from another site within the same company be recorded as a ""recall""? No, provided that no portion of the batch left direct control of the company for sale or use. The return must be clearly visible in the API site\'s quality system as a return triggered by the API manufacturing site so this fact is clear in quality system trend reporting and in the product quality review (ICH Q7, paragraphs 2.50, 15.13, 15.14).\n\nContract Manufacturers (Including Laboratories) (16)\n\nDoes ICH Q7 preclude a contract manufacturer\'s independent quality unit from performing the main responsibilities as described in ICH Q7, paragraph 2.22? No. The original intent of section II.B (2.2) was to distinguish the main responsibilities (e.g., batch record review, review of nonconformances and investigations, sampling, testing, release or rejection of intermediate or API) of the independent quality unit from other departments within a company. Contract manufacturers are expected to have an independent quality unit that meets the responsibilities defined in ICH Q7, section II.B (2.2) for all activities performed. Given the potential complexity of outsourcing contract manufacturing arrangements, GMP responsibilities should be clearly defined between both parties in detail in a written agreement (ICH Q7, paragraph 16.12). However, the overall responsibility for API quality must not be delegated.6 Footnote 6: See 21 U.S.C. 351 (“the term ‘current good manufacturing practice’ includes the implementation of oversight and controls over the manufacturer of drugs to ensure quality, including managing the risk of and establishing the safety of raw materials, materials used in the manufacturing of drugs, and finished drug products.”).\n\nWhich outsourced activities are covered by ICH Q7? In the context of ICH Q7, contract manufacturing is the outsourced activity. The term outsourced activities, as defined and described in ICH Q10, section III.G (2.7) and Glossary (section VI (5)), aligns with the description of contract manufacturer in ICH Q7, section XVI (16). ICH Q7 defines manufacture as ""all operations of receipt of materials, production, packaging, repackaging, labeling, relabeling, quality control, release, storage, and distribution of APIs and related controls.""""Related controls"" include any activities or services necessary to support production (e.g., maintenance, calibration). ICH Q7 applies to any activities performed by the original manufacturer or the company that is performing the activity on behalf of the original manufacturer.\n\n16.3: What is meant by ""where subcontracting is allowed"" (ICH Q7, paragraph 16.14)?\n\nSubcontracting as used in ICH Q7, paragraph 16.14 refers to the contract acceptor further contracting out a specific activity to another party (third party). This should only be done when the written and approved contract, as described in ICH Q7, paragraph 16.12, specifically allows for such subcontracting. Even when subcontracting is allowed, the original contract given should approve specific subcontracting before it occurs as stated in ICH Q7, paragraph 16.14.\n\nQ.: Agents, Brokers, Traders, Distributors, Repackers, and Relabelers (17)\n\n17.1: What does ICH Q7 mean by ""agents, brokers, traders, distributors, repackers, or relabelers""?\n\nRegardless of what terms are used in different regions, ICH Q7 applies to all parties in the supply chain after the original API/intermediate manufacturer to the drug product manufacturer, in order to maintain the integrity, traceability, and transparency of the supply chain (ICH Q7, section XVII.A (17.1)).\n\n17.2: Could a distributor of an API engage a contract manufacturer for production steps?\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry']","['For incoming production materials, identity tests and related methods should be used as described in the relevant sections of a pharmacopoeia monograph, in an approved regulatory filing, or in an in-house specification (including method/analytical procedure) (ICH Q7, paragraph 7.30).

19,"In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?","['--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA receives frequent inquiries from the academic community (e.g., clinical investigators, IRBs) and the pharmaceutical industry about whether an IND should be submitted for various types of clinical research. Inquiries have related to a range of issues concerning application of the IND requirements in part 312, including, for example:\n\nClinical investigations using marketed drugs\n\nBioequivalence/bioavailability studies\n\nStudies using radiolabeled or cold isotopes\n\nStudies using dietary supplements or foods\n\nStudies using endogenous compounds\n\nPathogenesis studies using modified organisms\n\nStudies using wild-type organisms in challenge models\n\nStudies that do not have a commercial purpose\n\nBecause of the large number of inquiries and wide range of issues, FDA determined that it would be helpful to provide to potential sponsors, clinical investigators, and sponsor-investigators an overview of the IND requirements and related issues.\n\nWith certain exceptions, clinical investigations in which a drug is administered to human subjects must be conducted under an IND as required in part 312. Sections 3, 4, and 5 of this guidance elaborate on the criteria for when a study must be conducted under an IND; the types of studies that involve drugs, but that are exempt from the IND requirements; studies involving radioactive drugs that are generally recognized as safe and effective (and to which IND requirements therefore do not apply); and FDA\'s use of enforcement discretion with respect to certain studies using cold isotopes conducted without an IND. Section 6 discusses specific issues that frequently arise concerning application of the IND regulations; section 7 contains frequently asked questions; and section 8 describes the process for seeking advice from FDA concerning the application of the IND regulations to a planned clinical investigation.\n\n3 Research studies that require an IND\n\nIn general, the IND regulations in part 312 require that human research studies be conducted under an IND if all of the following conditions exist:* The research involves a drug as that term is defined in section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)).\n* The research is a clinical investigation as defined in the IND regulations (21 CFR 312.3).\n* The clinical investigation is not otherwise exempt from the IND requirements in part 312 (see section IV of this guidance).\n\n1 What Is a Drug?\n\nThe definition of the term drug in section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act includes, among other things, ""articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease..."" and ""articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals."" Biological products subject to licensure under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) may also be considered drugs within the meaning of the FD&C Act. A biological product is:\n\n... a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, protein (except any chemically synthesized polypeptide), or analogous product, or argphenamine or derivative of argphenamine (or any other trivalent organic arsenic compound), applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings.\n\nBiological products include, among other products, bacterial vaccines, allergenic extracts, gene therapy products, growth factors, cytokines, and monoclonal antibodies.\n\nIt is important to note that the drug definition is not limited to compounds intended for a therapeutic purpose.4 The definition also includes compounds intended to affect the structure or function of the body, without regard to whether the compound is intended to influence a disease process. For example, the definition includes compounds administered to healthy individuals to prevent pregnancy or treat male pattern baldness. The definition also includes compounds used for research purposes in healthy subjects to blunt or provoke a physiologic response or study the mechanism of action or metabolism of a drug (see section VI.A). Note, however, that (1) a dietary supplement intended only to affect the structure or function of the body and not intended for a therapeutic purpose is not a drug5 (see section VI.D.1) and (2) a food used as such (i.e., primarily for its taste, aroma, or nutritive value) and not for a therapeutic purpose or to affect the structure or function of the body, other than by providing nutrition, is not a drug (see section VI.D.2).6\n\nWhat Is a Clinical Investigation?\n\nThe IND regulations in SS 312.3(b) define clinical investigation7 as:\n\nFootnote 7: Additional information on clinical investigations is available on FDA’s Web site at http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/default.htm.\n\n... [an] experiment in which a drug is administered or dispensed to, or used involving, one or more human subjects. For the purposes of [the IND regulations], an experiment is any use of a drug [whether approved or unapproved] except for the use of a marketed drug in the course of medical practice.\n\nFor example, a randomized trial evaluating an unapproved use of a lawfully marketed drug is a clinical investigation and may require an IND.8 In contrast, use of a lawfully marketed drug for an unapproved use in the course of medical practice is not a clinical investigation and does not require an IND because it involves the use in an individual patient where the primary intent is to treat the patient.\n\nFootnote 8: See section IV.A of this guidance.\n\nIV Clinical Investigations that are Exempt from the IND requirements by Regulation\n\nFDA regulations describe two categories of clinical investigations that are exempt from the IND requirements in part 312, provided the criteria for exemption are met (see 21 CFR 312.2(b) and 320.31(b)). The two categories of clinical investigations and the applicable criteria are described in the following subsections. Ordinarily, clinical investigations of drugs that do not meet these criteria must be conducted under an IND as required in part 312.\n\nCertain Research Involving Marketed Drug Products\n\nWhether an IND is needed to conduct a clinical investigation of a marketed drug primarily depends on the intent of the investigation and the degree of risk associated with the use of the drug in the investigation. A clinical investigation of a marketed drug is exempt from the IND requirements if all of the criteria for an exemption in SS 312.2(b) are met:\n\nThe drug product is lawfully marketed in the United States.\n\nThe investigation is not intended to be reported to FDA as a well-controlled study in support of a new indication and there is no intent to use it to support any other significant change in the labeling of the drug.\n\nIn the case of a prescription drug, the investigation is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the drug.\n\nThe investigation does not involve a route of administration, dose, patient population, or other factor that significantly increases the risk (or decreases the acceptability of the risk) associated with the use of the drug product (21 CFR 312.2(b)(1)(iii)).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements for review by an IRB (21 CFR part 56) and with the requirements for informed consent (21 CFR part 50).\n\nThe investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements of SS 312.7 (i.e., the investigation is not intended to promote or commercialize the drug product).\n\nThe potential sponsor or sponsor-investigator of a planned clinical investigation using a marketed drug is responsible for determining whether the investigation meets the criteria for an exemption.9 If there is uncertainty about whether the exemption criteria are met, the potential sponsor or sponsor-investigator can seek advice from FDA on the applicability of the IND regulations (SS 312.2(e)).\n\nFootnote 9: The preamble to the rule finalizing the IND regulations provides: FDA recognizes that a considerable amount of professional judgment must be exercised in determining whether the conditions of an investigation “significantly increase” the risk associated with use of the drug. Because the assessment of risks involved in a therapeutic procedure is an everyday part of the practice of medicine, the individual investigator should usually be able to determine the applicability of the exemption. (See the final rule on New Drug, Antibiotic, and Biologic Drug Product Regulations that published in the Federal Register of March 19, 1987 (52 FR 8798 at 8802)).\n\nThree of the criteria for exemption listed previously merit further discussion.\n\nWhat is meant by a drug product that is lawfully marketed in the United States?\n\nThe preamble to the final rule incorporating the IND exemption criteria into the IND regulations makes clear that the exemption provision was not intended to require use of only the marketed version of the drug product for a clinical investigation to be exempt from the IND requirements. The intent was to provide some latitude to modify the marketed version of the drug product for use in a clinical investigation. In responding to comments asking FDA to clarify to what extent a sponsor could change the marketed drug product or conditions of use and still be exempt from the IND regulations, FDA stated that: The exemption was not intended to require an investigator to use the drug in exactly the same dosage form, dosage levels, and patient populations described in the marketed labeling for the product, but rather to permit changes to the lawfully marketed drug product that do not increase the risks...over the risk presented by use of the product in conformance with its marketed labeling.10\n\nFootnote 10: Final rule, “New Drug, Antibiotic, and Biologic Drug Product Regulations” (52 FR 8798 at 8801, March 19, 1987).\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs'

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nOn April 28, 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) amended its regulations on the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application (IND) (""non-IND foreign clinical studies"") as support for an IND or a new drug application (NDA), abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or a biologics license application (BLA) (collectively known as ""marketing applications"" or ""applications for marketing approval"").2 The final rule requires that such studies be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP), including review and approval by an independent ethics committee (IEC) and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. This final rule, which took effect on October 27, 2008, is codified at 21 CFR 312.120. It is intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data.\n\nFootnote 2: 73 Fed. Reg. 22800 (April 28, 2008).\n\nThis guidance is applicable to all applications submitted under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and\n\nCosmetic Act (FD& C Act) (21 U.S.C. 355) or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262).\n\nThis guidance document is intended to clarify for sponsors and applicants how they can\n\ndemonstrate compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.3 It provides\n\nrecommendations for the submission of information, whether in an IND or application for\n\nmarketing approval for a drug or biological drug product,4 to demonstrate that a non-IND foreign clinical study was conducted in accordance with GCP.\n\nFootnote 4: For the purposes of this guidance, all references to drugs, drug products, and drug substances include both human\n\ndrug products and biological drug products regulated by CDER and CBER, unless otherwise specified.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nClinical research is becoming increasingly global, as detailed in reports by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (""OIG Reports"").5 FDA recognizes that sponsors may choose to conduct multinational clinical studies under a variety of scenarios. Multinational studies may include domestic sites conducted under an IND, foreign sites conducted under an IND, and/or foreign sites not conducted under an IND.6 Sponsors may decide to use the data that is obtained from non-IND foreign sites to support clinical investigations and/or marketing approval(s) in the United States. Some sponsors may even seek to rely solely on foreign clinical data as support for an IND or application for marketing approval in the U.S.7 Indeed, the number of INDs and applications for marketing approval supported by foreign clinical trials has increased in recent years and will likely continue to increase in the future.\n\nFootnote 5: See HHS OIG Report, Challenges to FDA’s Ability to Monitor and Inspect Foreign Clinical Trials (June 2010), OEI-01-08-00510, available at http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-08-00510.pdf; HHS OIG Report, The Globalization of Clinical Trials: A Growing Challenge in Protecting Human Subjects (September 2001), OEI-01-00-00190, available at http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-00-00190.pdf.\n\nFootnote 6: For information on how conducting both IND and non-IND studies affects the requirement for investigators to sign the Form FDA 1572, see FDA’s Guidance, Information Sheet Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs: Frequently Asked Questions – Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572), available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM214282.pdf.\n\nThis increasing globalization of clinical trials presents challenges to both U.S. and foreign regulators, many of which are detailed in the OIG reports. Among other challenges, resource constraints limit the number of foreign clinical site inspections that can be conducted. To address these challenges, FDA has sought to leverage its resources more efficiently by: (1) encouraging sponsors to utilize data standardization in their INDs and applications for marketing approval, in order to improve review and analysis of data and facilitate implementation of a site selection model to prioritize sites for inspection; (2) engaging in collaboration and outreach with international regulatory authorities; and (3) considering alternative mechanisms of clinical trial oversight both by sponsors and FDA, such as a quality management system approach which emphasizes building quality into the research process.\n\nThis guidance document is part of FDA\'s overall efforts to strengthen oversight of foreign clinical trials.8 Specifically, FDA is issuing this guidance as part of its efforts to encourage sponsors and applicants to standardize information relating to foreign clinical trials in their INDs and applications for marketing approval (see (1), above). This guidance should help sponsorsand applicants submit information in a consistent and standardized manner to demonstrate compliance with the requirements in 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nMuch of the information in this guidance comes from the preamble to the final rule, 73 Fed. Reg. 22800 (April 28, 2008). It is organized in a question and answer format that tracks the regulatory provisions. In addition to addressing the substantive requirements of the final rule, this guidance addresses organization and submission procedures. Specifically, as described in Section III.B, when sponsors or applicants submit information about a non-IND foreign clinical study, they should clearly identify in the cover letter (a) that the material is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120, and (b) where in the submission the information required by 21 CFR 312.120(b) can be located.\n\nAlthough FDA will not accept as support for an IND or application for marketing approval any study that does not meet the conditions of 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will examine the data from such a study because the data may have a bearing on the safe use of the product.9 Sponsors and applicants are reminded that they must submit all studies and other information as required under the applicable regulations for drugs,10 including studies that do not comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nFootnote 9: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(2); 73 Fed.

When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived.11 When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with the requirements in 21 CFR 312.120 in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Under 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and if FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary.12 Note that marketing approval of a new drug based solely on foreign clinical data is governed by 21 CFR 314.106.\n\nFootnote 10: See, for example, 21 CFR 314.50, 314.80, 600.80, and 601.2.\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR part 312.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if that approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist sponsors in deciding whether a study of marketed drugs or biological products for treating cancer falls within the exemption under SS 312.2(b)(1) (21 CFR 312.2(b)(1)) from the general requirement to submit an investigational new drug application (IND). The guidance discusses the Agency\'s current thinking on when studies of marketed cancer products are exempt from IND regulation based on a risk assessment. The Agency hopes that clarifying its policy will help sponsors identify which studies are exempt, thus saving them from submitting unnecessary IND applications.\n\nThis guidance revises the guidance of the same title published in September 2003. In the September 2003 version, the Agency\'s final statement was that it believed that most randomized studies of a size that could support a labeling supplement would likely not be exempt from IND regulation under SS 312.2(b)(1)(i), (ii). This is because they would be intended to support approval of a new indication, a significant change in the product labeling, or a significant change in advertising. Experience has shown that this interpretation was formulated too broadly and inappropriately referred to size alone. The Agency has decided to revise this guidance by removing that statement (the last sentence in section V.B). Whether a study could support a change in labeling is a complex determination, based on study design, size, and other factors.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements arecited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nGenerally, regulations in part 312 (21 CFR part 312) require sponsors who wish to study a drug or biological product in humans to submit an IND to the Agency.2 However, these regulations also provide for the exemption of some studies from the requirement to submit an IND if they meet certain criteria. Each year, many INDs for cancer drugs are submitted that contain studies that the Agency determines are exempt. This guidance is intended to help applicants identify which studies may be exempt.\n\nFootnote 2: Part 312 applies to all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) or to the licensing provisions of the Public Health Service Act (58 Stat. 632, as amended (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.)).\n\nRegulations\n\nRegulations in SS 312.2(b)(1) provide for the exemption of some studies for some drugs from IND regulations if the studies meet the following five criteria:\n\nThe study is not intended to support FDA approval of a new indication or a significant change in the product labeling.\n\nThe study is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the product.\n\nThe investigation does not involve a route of administration or dosage level or use in a patient population or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug product.\n\nThe study is conducted in compliance with institutional review board (IRB) and informed consent regulations set forth in parts 56 and 50 (21 CFR parts 56 and 50).\n\nThe study is conducted in compliance with SS 312.7 (promotion and charging for investigational drugs).\n\nRequirements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are not directly related to the specific protocol submitted, and their interpretation is similar for oncologic and nononcologic therapies. Requirement 3 is protocol related and has special meaning in the oncology therapy setting, particularly with respect to doses above the labeled dose, use with other treatments, and use in different populations.\n\nIn the preamble to the IND regulations, which published in the Federal Register on March 19, 1987, the Agency explained that the exemption was not necessarily intended to tie the investigator to the doses and routes of administration and patient population described in the approved labeling, but to permit deviations from the approved labeling to the extent that such changes are supported by the scientific literature and generally known clinical experience. The Agency recognizes that a considerable amount of professional judgment is exercised in determining whether the planned investigation significantly increases the risk associated with the use of the drug. FDA maintains that ""because the assessment of risks involved in a therapeutic procedure is an everyday part of the practice of medicine, the individual investigator should usually be able to determine the applicability of the exemption.""3\n\nFootnote 3: New Drug, Antibiotic, and Biologic Drug Product Regulations, Federal Register, March 19, 1987, Vol. 52, Nr. 53, p. 8802.\n\n1996 Agency Cancer Initiative\n\nIn 1996, as part of the President\'s National Performance Review, the Agency launched its Reinventing the Regulation of Cancer Drugs initiative with the goal of accelerating the approval of and expanding patient access to cancer drugs.4 As part of this initiative, the Agency explained that many sponsor-investigators were submitting INDs for exploratory studies for so-called off-label indications for two reasons: (1) IRBs incorrectly believe an IND is required, or (2) the pharmaceutical manufacturer agrees to provide a drug free of charge, but mistakenly concludes that the FDA will view this as promotional activity. With the intent of clarifying the Agency\'s policy and decreasing the number of unnecessary submissions, the Agency emphasized that it would no longer accept INDs considered exempt under SS 312.2(b)(1). (See SS 312.2(b)(4).) Furthermore, FDA stated that providing a drug for study would not, in and of itself, be viewed as a promotional activity if the manufacturer or distributor provides the product for a physician-initiated, bona fide clinical investigation. The Agency explained that it is the responsibility of the investigator to determine whether an IND is necessary.\n\nFootnote 4: Reinventing the Regulation of Cancer Drugs – Accelerating Approval and Expanding Access (March 1996), CBER, Office of Communication, Training, and Manufacturer Assistance, Voice Information System at 1-800-835-4709 or 301-827-1800, document ID number 0281. Available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cber/genadmin/reincanc.htm\n\nDespite the Agency\'s attempts to clarify its policy on IND exemptions, many cancer drug IND applications that the Agency determines are exempt from IND regulation are still being submitted unnecessarily. From 1997 to 1999, a majority of investigator IND submissions for marketed cancer drugs were considered exempt (204, 205, and 140 applications in 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively).\n\nIII Risk/Benefit analysis in the practice of oncology\n\nAs noted above, a critical question in determining whether a study is exempt involves criterion 3 in the exemption regulations (SS 312.2(b)(1)(iii)): The investigation may not significantly increase the risk associated with use of a drug product. The question of increased risk is determined by assessing the deviation in the planned investigation from the use described in the approved label. In oncology, modifications of labeled dosing recommendations are common and occur as part of oncologists\' clinical practice. As outlined below, oncologists are familiar with evaluating the risk of off-label dosing regimens for cancer drug and biological products.\n\nTreatment with cancer drugs may be associated with significant risk from known toxicity. Because effectiveness is often related to dose, a dose close to the maximal tolerated dose is often selected for studies of cancer drugs. This same dose usually becomes the recommended dose in labeling when the new cancer drug is approved with the knowledge that the dose may be altered if it is not tolerated by a patient. Because it is not generally possible to have maximal efficacy in a population without inducing toxicity in some patients, it is not uncommon to observe severe or even lethal side effects from cancer drugs in some patients. In general, these circumstances mean that the toxicity, even potentially lethal toxicity, of cancer drugs is described in approved labeling.\n--------------------\nContext title: IND Exemptions for Studies of Lawfully Marketed Drug or Biological Products for the Treatment of Cancer Guidance for Industry'

REFERENCESGUIDANCE FOR INDUSTRY1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration. Although this guidance does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the industry, it does represent the agency\'s current thinking on data requirement issues related to the initial entry of an unapproved drug into human studies in the United States. For additional copies of this guidance, contact the Consumer Affairs Branch (formerly the Executive Secretariat Staff), HFD-210, CDER, FDA, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857 (Phone: 301-594-1012) or the Congressional and Consumer Affairs Branch (HFM-12), CBER, FDA, 1401 Rockville Pike (STE 200N), Rockville, MD 20852-1448 (Phone: 301-594-1800 or 800-835-4709). An electronic version of this guidance is also available via Internet by connecting to the CDER file transfer protocol (FTP) server (CDVS2.CDER.FDA.GOV).\n\n1 Introduction\n\nWith FDA\'s recent successes in meeting the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 (PDUFA) review action performance goals, and the resulting significant declines in mean and median time from submission of a marketing application to approval for marketing, attention has turned to increasing the efficiency of other components of the drug development process without sacrificing the long-standing safety and efficacy standards Americans expect their drug products to meet. One part of IND regulation of particular interest - under active discussion for more than two years and the subject of various degrees of attention since the McMahon Committee - is the regulation of the initial testing of drugs in humans (i.e., Phase 1 trials).\n\nThis guidance clarifies requirements for data and data presentation in 21 CFR 312.22 and 312.23 related to the initial entry into human studies in the United States of an investigational drug, including well-characterized, therapeutic, biotechnology-derived products2. Present regulations allow a great deal of flexibility in the amount and depth of various data to be submitted in an IND depending in large part on the phase of investigation and the specific human testing being proposed. In some cases, the extent of that flexibility has not been appreciated. FDA believes clarifications of many of these requirements will help expedite entry of new drugs into clinical testing by increasing transparency and reducing ambiguity and inconsistencies, and by reducing the amount of information submitted, while providing FDA with the data it needs to assess the safety of the proposed Phase 1 study. If the guidance specified in this document is followed, IND submissions for Phase 1 studies should usually not be larger than two to three, three inch, 3-ring binders (""jackets"").\n\nThe most significant clarifications are: 1) the explicit willingness to accept an integrated summary report of toxicology findings based upon the unaudited draft toxicologic reports of completed animal studies as initial support for human studies, and 2) specific manufacturing data appropriate for a Phase 1 investigation. For products not covered by this Guidance, other FDA guidance documents should be consulted. In addition, the Center responsible for the product may be contacted for guidance.\n\nBecause of the manufacturing and toxicologic differences between well-characterized, therapeutic, biotechnology-derived products and other biologic products, this Guidance only applies to drugs and well-characterized, therapeutic, biotechnology-derived products. For products not covered by this Guidance, the Center responsible for the product should be contacted for guidance.\n\nThis guidance applies equally to both commercial and individual investigator sponsored INDs.\n\nII Current Requirements and Practices\n\nUnder current regulations, any use in the United States of a drug product not previously authorized for marketing in the United States first requires submission of an IND to the FDA. Current regulations at 21 CFR 312.22 and 312.23 contain the general principles underlying the IND submission and the general requirements for an IND\'s content and format.\n\nIII Clarifications of Present IND Regulations\n\nAn IND submission for Phase 1 studies is required by regulation to contain the sections enumerated below. Clarifications are described when appropriate beneath each section heading.\n\nF. Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control Information [21 CFR 312.23(a)(7)]:\n\nThe regulations at 312.23(a)(7)(i) emphasize the graded nature of manufacturing and controls information. Although in each phase of the investigation sufficient information should be submitted to assure the proper identification, quality, purity, and strength of the investigational drug, the amount of information needed to make that assurance will vary with the phase of the investigation, the proposed duration of the investigation, the dosage form, and the amount of information otherwise available. For example, although stability data are required in all phases of the IND to demonstrate that the new drug substance and drug product are within acceptable chemical and physical limits for the planned duration of the proposed clinical investigation, if very short-term tests are proposed, the supporting stability data can be correspondingly very limited.\n\nIt is recognized that modifications to the method of preparation of the new drug substance and dosage form, and even changes in the dosage form itself, are likely as the investigation progresses. The emphasis in an initial Phase 1 CMC submission should, therefore, generally be placed on providing information that will allow evaluation of the safety of subjects in the proposed study. The identification of a safety concern or insufficient data to make an evaluation of safety is the only basis for a clinical hold based on the CMC section.\n\nReasons for concern may include, for example: 1) a product made with unknown or impure components; 2) a product possessing chemical structures of known or highly likely toxicity; 3) a product that cannot remain chemically stable throughout the testing program proposed; or 4) a product with an impurity profile indicative of a potential health hazard or an impurity profile insufficiently defined to assess a potential health hazard; or 5) a poorly characterized master or working cell bank.\n\nIn addition, for pre-clinical studies to be useful in assuring the safety of human studies, sponsors should be able to relate the drug product being proposed for use in a clinical study to the drug product used in the animal toxicology studies that support the safety of the proposed human study.\n\nThe information discussed in the following numbered paragraphs should usually suffice for a meaningful review of the manufacturing procedures for drug products used in Phase 1 clinical studies. Additional information should ordinarily be submitted for review of the larger-scale manufacturing procedures used to produce drug products for Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials or as part of the manufacturing section of a marketing application. Any questions sponsors have about potential large scale IND clinical trials or potential marketing application manufacturing requirements or specifications should be directed to the appropriate division in the CDER Office of New Drug Chemistry, or the appropriate CBER division with responsibility for the product, for clarification and discussion. As clinical development of a drug product proceeds, sponsors should discuss the manufacturing data that will be needed to support the safe use of their products in Phase 2 and 3 trials with the appropriate division in the CDER Office of New Drug Chemistry, or the appropriate CBER division with responsibility for the product.\n\n1 Chemistry and Manufacturing Introduction:\n\nAt the beginning of this section, the sponsor should state whether it believes: 1) the chemistry of either the drug substance or the drug product, or 2) the manufacturing of either the drug substance or the drug product, presents any signals of potential human risk. If so, these signals of potential risks should be discussed, and the steps proposed to monitor for such risk(s) should be described, or the reason(s) why the signal(s) should be dismissed should be discussed.\n\nIn addition, sponsors should describe any chemistry and manufacturing differences between the drug product proposed for clinical use and the drug product used in the animal toxicology trials that formed the basis for the sponsor\'s conclusion that it was safe to proceed with the proposed clinical study. How these differences might affect the safety profile of the drug product should be discussed. If there are no differences in the products, that should be stated.\n\nDrug Substance [312.23 (a)(7)(iv)(a)]:\n\nSponsors are reminded that, under present regulations, references to the current edition of the USP-NF may be used to satisfy some of the requirements, when applicable.\n\nInformation on the drug substance should be submitted in a summary report containing the following items.\n--------------------\nContext title: Content and Format of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-derived Products Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: Although FDA will not accept as support for an IND or application for marketing approval any study that does not meet the conditions of 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will examine the data from such a study because the data may have a bearing on the safe use of the product.9 Sponsors and applicants are reminded that they must submit all studies and other information as required under the applicable regulations for drugs,10 including studies that do not comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nFootnote 9: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(2); 73 Fed. Reg. at 22807.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nA sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived.11 When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with the requirements in 21 CFR 312.120 in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Under 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and if FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary.12 Note that marketing approval of a new drug based solely on foreign clinical data is governed by 21 CFR 314.106.\n\nFootnote 10: See, for example, 21 CFR 314.50, 314.80, 600.80, and 601.2.\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR part 312.\n\nThe GCP requirements at 21 CFR 312.120 help protect human subjects and enhance the quality and integrity of the resulting clinical data.13 They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.14 Many of the requirements at 21 CFR 312.120 are already incorporated into the IND regulations at 21 CFR part 312, as well as 21 CFR parts 50 and 56,15 and are consistent with certain international ethical and policy standards for clinical trials (e.g., International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) ""GoodClinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline"" (ICH E6), which FDA adopted for use as guidance for industry in 1997).16\n\nFootnote 16: ICH E6 and other FDA guidance documents adopted from the ICH are available electronically at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\n1 Acceptance of Studies (21 Cfr 312.120(a))\n\nFDA regulations define GCP as ""a standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials in a way that provides assurance that the data are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects are protected.""17\n\nFootnote 17: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(1)(i).\n\nGCP includes review and approval (or provision of a favorable opinion) by an independent ethics committee (IEC) before initiating a study, continuing review of an ongoing study by an IEC, and obtaining and documenting the freely given informed consent of the subject (or a subject\'s legally authorized representative, if the subject is unable to provide informed consent) before initiating a study.\n\nAs defined at 21 CFR 312.3(b), an IEC is ""a review panel that is responsible for ensuring the protection of the rights, safety, and well-being of human subjects involved in a clinical investigation, and is adequately constituted to provide assurance of that protection."" We consider an IEC to be ""adequately constituted"" if it includes a reasonable number of members with the qualifications and experience to perform the IEC\'s functions. One type of IEC is an institutional review board (IRB) as defined in 21 CFR 56.102(g) and subject to the requirements of 21 CFR part 56. Another type of IEC is one that adheres to section 3.2.1 of ICH E6. Compliance with 21 CFR part 56 or ICH E6 is not required, however, for an IEC to be considered ""adequately constituted"" under 21 CFR 312.120. We have expressly allowed for flexibility in how to meet the requirements of this regulation in recognition that the organization and membership of IECs may differ among countries because of local needs.18 For more information on IEC membership, see Section 3.2.6 of this guidance document, below.\n\nFootnote 18: 73 Fed. Reg. at 22805.\n\nICH E6 defines informed consent as ""a process by which a subject voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to participate in a particular trial, after having been informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to the subject\'s decision to participate.""19 Informed consent is ""documented by means of a written, signed, and dated informed consent form.""20 In obtaining and documenting informed consent, an investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) and should adhere to principles of GCP.21 Prior to the beginning of the trial, the investigator should obtain the IEC\'s written approval of the informed consent form and any additional written information that will be provided to study subjects.22\n\nFootnote 19: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM073122.pdf.\n\nAppendix B Supporting Information (21 CFR 312.120(b))\n\nA sponsor or applicant submitting non-IND foreign data in support of an IND or an application for marketing approval for a drug must include a description of the actions the sponsor or applicant took to ensure that the research conformed to GCP. Because the description is not required to duplicate information already submitted in the IND or the application for marketing approval, the sponsor or applicant may indicate the location of the required information by providing cross-references (and/or hyperlinks) to relevant sections of the IND application, to relevant sections of an application for marketing approval, or to relevant sections of previously submitted materials.\n\nThe location of all information required by 21 CFR 312.120 should be clearly delineated in the submission. FDA recommends that the sponsor or applicant clearly indicate the following:\n\nwhether each clinical study was conducted at both foreign and domestic sites or only foreign sites;\n\nwhether each foreign site was under an IND or was subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120; and\n\nfor each clinical study subject to 21 CFR 312.120, where in the submission or in previously submitted materials the following information can be found: 1. each of the elements required under 21 CFR 312.120(b) (e.g., ""Information showing that the study is adequate and well controlled, 21 CFR 312.120(b)(5) -- See IND Application, Section X.1, pp. y-z""); and 2. any waiver requests as applicable under 21 CFR 312.120(c) (e.g., ""Waiver request for certain requirements applicable to Study [X] -- see IND Application, Section X.6, pp. y-z"").\n\nClearly delineating where the required information can be found will facilitate FDA\'s review of the IND or marketing application by enabling Agency confirmation of the sponsor\'s/applicant\'s compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nWithin an eCTD format of an application (for marketing approval or an IND), FDA recommends that a sponsor or applicant list the studies subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120 in Section 5.2 of Module 5. The listing can be part of an overall tabular listing or be constructed as an accompanying table and appropriately identified as such. A sponsor or applicant might also use a submission\'s cover letter, particularly in the case of an IND, to indicate whether the submission contains studies subject to 21 CFR 312.120. Whether in Module 5 or in a cover letter, the submission should contain page references and/or links to the respective individual full Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) for the identified studies.\n\nWithin a CSR of a study, using an ICH E3 format as an example, FDA recommends that a sponsor or applicant identify on the Title Page that the study is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120. The Title Page should contain a reference and/or alink to a section or an appendix which specifically addresses the sponsor\'s compliance with 21 CFR 312.120. (In ICH E3 format, such an Appendix would be in addition to the kind of Appendices already listed in the ICH E3 Guidance, e.g. 16.5). FDA further recommends identifying specific foreign non-IND clinical sites using Appendix 16.1.4 (""List and Description of Investigators"") in ICH E3 format or a similarly designated section.\n\nThe section or appendix specifically intended to address compliance with 21 CFR 312.120 should include a brief statement describing actions the sponsor has taken and should provide supporting information in accordance with all the required elements as listed in the regulations (see below). FDA anticipates that for each such element the sponsor would provide the necessary information or provide reference and/or links to other sections of the study report which contain the information. FDA strongly advises against duplicating information provided elsewhere in the application.\n\nThe regulation allows for flexibility in how the requirements are to be met. For example, a full CSR prepared in accordance with ICH E3 ""Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports""23 may meet many of the requirements under 21 CFR 312.120, but adherence to ICH E3 is not required. The same holds for ICH E6: a sponsor or applicant may choose but is not required to meet many of the requirements of this rule through adherence to ICH E6. Note, however, that even if studies are submitted according to ICH E3 or E6, in some cases it may be necessary to provide additional information to FDA to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120, as well as other applicable requirements in 21 CFR parts 312, 314, or 601.24\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsors must also report such information to FDA. Sponsors of drug/biologic studies are required under 21 CFR 312.31(a)(2) to report to FDA any information regarding the discontinuation of a clinical investigation in an information amendment to the Investigational New Drug (IND) application. Sponsors of device studies are required under 21 CFR 812.150(b)(2) to notify FDA and all reviewing IRBs and participating investigators of any withdrawal of IRB approval of an investigation or a part of an investigation within 5 working days after receipt of the withdrawal.\n\n(5) Confirming or establishing the date for the next continuing review.\n\nIf the receiving IRB performs a review at the time of clinical investigation transfer (whether an initial or a continuing review), it may choose to maintain the anniversary date of approval established by the original IRB or decide to establish a new anniversary date. If the receiving IRB decides to establish a new anniversary date, the new date must be within one year of the receiving IRB\'s review.\n\nIf the receiving IRB does not conduct a review of the clinical investigation at the time of transfer, the date of clinical investigation approval by the original IRB is presumed to remain in effect for the full approval period established at the time of the most recent review by the original IRB. For example, if the original IRB initially approved the clinical investigation for one year effective July 1, 2011, and the clinical investigation is transferred to a new IRB effective October 1, 2011, the expiration date of IRB approval would continue to be July 1, 2012, unless or until the receiving IRB establishes a new expiration date. Note that review in accordance with a newly established expiration date would nonetheless need to be conducted prior to the original July 1, 2012 expiration date.\n\n(6) Determining whether the consent form needs to be revised.\n\nThe informed consent document is required to contain ""[a]n explanation of whom to contact for answers to pertinent questions about the research and research subjects\' rights, and whom to contact in the event of a research-related injury to the subject.""35 Therefore, when a change in IRB oversight results in changes in the contact information regarding subject rights and/or whom to contact in the event of research-related injury, the new contact information must be provided to subjects. For subjects who are already enrolled (whether or not they are active), this may be accomplished in a number of ways, including sending a letter providing the relevant contact information.36 For new subjects, the informed consent, assent, and/or parental permission form must be revised to reflect the new contact information.37 The clinical investigator should promptly notify the IRB of any such administrative changes to the consent form.\n\nFootnote 36: FDA does not require subjects who are already enrolled (whether or not they are active) to be re-consented for such minor changes; however, IRBs may choose to do so.\n\nFootnote 37: 21 CFR 50.25(a)(7).\n\nOther changes to the consent form may also be necessary, for example, if the receiving IRB requires modifications to the consent form at the site(s) under its jurisdiction as a condition of approval (e.g., changes in template language, changes in risks, etc.).38 Depending upon the types of changes needed, they may be conveyed to the clinical investigator and sponsor as required modifications to secure IRB approval for the clinical investigation at that site or sites and may require reporting to FDA.39\n\nFootnote 38: 21 CFR 56.109(a) and (b).\n\nFootnote 39: 39 See, e.g., 21 CFR 56.109(a), 21 CFR 312.31, and 21 CFR 812.35.\n\nFootnote 40: 21 CFR 312.31(a).\n\n(7) Notifying the key parties.\n\nAs discussed above, all key parties involved in the transfer of oversight (e.g., clinical investigator, sponsor, and original and receiving IRBs) should discuss their respective responsibilities before implementing the transfer. In addition, the sponsor should notify pertinent entities involved in the clinical investigation (e.g., institutional members, Data Safety Monitoring Board, CRO), as and when appropriate. After IRB transfer of oversight for the clinical investigation is complete, the sponsor must update the associated IND40 or IDE41 with the name and contact information of the receiving IRB and should include the effective date of transfer.\n\nFootnote 41: 21 CFR 812.35(a)(4).\n\nFor studies for which the original IRB acts as a central IRB, those local institutions/IRBs that have written agreements with the original IRB (to transfer review responsibility to that original IRB) should be notified that responsibility for the study is now being transferred to a new central IRB (receiving IRB). We recommend that those local institutions/IRBs be given the option to enter into new written agreements with the receiving IRB or opt out of the central review arrangement if they do not believe central review by the receiving IRB is appropriate for their local institution (e.g., are concerned about the ability of the receiving IRB to adequately address local issues).42\n\nFootnote 42: For more information on the responsibilities of central IRBs and local institutions/IRBs with respect to central IRB review, see “Using a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials,” available at:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm127004.htm.\n\nAdditionally, when an IRB declines to accept oversight of a clinical investigation, FDA recommends that the IRB notify the appropriate party(ies) who initiated the transfer process (refer to page 3 for further information; parties responsible for initiating the transfer may not be those responsible for securing IRB review) to enable the clinical investigator and/or sponsor to make alternate arrangements for IRB review.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:15]\n\nthe reasons for the transfer and the risk posed by the study. In the case of a natural disaster, although the transfer may initially be thought to only be required for a short period of time, additional time may ultimately be needed before the original IRB is able to resume its oversight responsibilities. The original and receiving IRBs would need to ensure that study oversight does not lapse; adverse events are reported to the appropriate IRB, etc. during this interim period.\n\nAppendix B Transfer of a Clinical Investigation to a New Research Site Requiring IRB Review\n\nA sponsor may decide to transfer a clinical investigation to a different research site when, for instance, a clinical investigator relocates to that new site. Because the transfer involves changes to the research (i.e., conducting the research in a new location, consent form revisions, possible changes in key staff, etc.), the sponsor or investigator must submit these changes to the receiving IRB for review and approval, prior to implementing the changes.44 In many cases, these changes represent a ""minor change"" to the research, which the IRB may review under an expedited review procedure.45\n\nSuch a move to a new research site may or may not entail changing the IRB. If the reviewing IRB changes as a result, then the considerations described in Section III apply, except initial or continuing IRB review must be conducted (an IRB may not approve a change in research without first conducting an initial or continuing review).46\n\nFDA notes that, even if the IRB remains the same when a study is transferred to a new research site, IRB review/approval for the new research site is required because such a move is considered a change in previously approved research.47 Additionally, the sponsor must notify FDA of any change in research site, clinical investigator, and/or IRB. For drug or biologics studies, this notification can generally be accomplished through an IND protocol or information amendment, whereas for device studies it can generally be accomplished in an IDE annual report.48\n\nFootnote 44: 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4). For drug/biologic studies, clinical investigators are responsible for securing IRB approval under 21 CFR 312.66; for device studies, the sponsor is responsible under 21 CFR 812.35(a)(1) and (3).\n\nFootnote 45: 21 CFR 56.110(b)(2).\n\nFootnote 46: 21 CFR 56.103(a), 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4), and 21 CFR 56.110(b)(2). There is an exception to this general requirement: changes necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to human subjects may be initiated without IRB review and approval, as described in 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4).\n\nFootnote 47: 21 Didd.\n\nFootnote 48: 21 CFR 312.30, 21 CFR 312.31, 21 CFR 812.35, and 21 CFR 812.150(b)(5).

In such situations, either IRB may contact FDA for additional guidance. Affected sponsors and clinical investigators may also contact FDA in these situations.

May one member satisfy more than one membership category?","['--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n--------------------\nContext: II IRB Membership\n\n12. May a clinical investigator be an IRB member?\n\nYes, however, the IRB regulations [21] CFR 56.107(e)] prohibit any member from participating in the IRB\'s initial or continuing review of any study in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB. When selecting IRB members, the potential for conflicts of interest should be considered. When members frequently have conflicts and must absent themselves from deliberation and abstain from voting, their contributions to the group review process may be diminished and could hinder the review procedure. Even greater disruptions may result if this person is chairperson of the IRB.\n\n13. The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n\nYes. For example, one member could be otherwise unaffiliated with the institution and have a primary concern in a non-scientific area. This individual would satisfy two of the membership requirements of the regulations. IRBs should strive, however, for a membership that has a diversity of representative capacities and disciplines. In fact, the FDA regulations [21] CFR 56.107(a)] require that, as part of being qualified as an IRB, the IRB must have ""... diversity of members, including consideration of race, gender, cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes....""\n\n14. When IRB members cannot attend a convened meeting, may they send someone from their department to vote for them?No. Alternates who are formally appointed and listed in the membership roster may substitute, but ad hoc substitutes are not permissible as members of an IRB. However, a member who is unable to be present at the convened meeting may participate by video-conference or conference telephone call, when the member has received a copy of the documents that are to be reviewed at the meeting. Such members may vote and be counted as part of the quorum. If allowed by IRB procedures, ad hoc substitutes may attend as consultants and gather information for the absent member, but they may not be counted toward the quorum or participate in either deliberation or voting with the board. The IRB may, of course, ask questions of this representative just as they could of any non-member consultant. Opinions of the absent members that are transmitted by mail, telephone, telefax or e-mail may be considered by the attending IRB members but may not be counted as votes or the quorum for convened meetings.\n\n15 May the IRB use alternate members?\n\nThe use of formally appointed alternate IRB members is acceptable to the FDA, provided that the IRB\'s written procedures describe the appointment and function of alternate members. The IRB roster should identify the primary member(s) for whom each alternate member may substitute. To ensure maintaining an appropriate quorum, the alternate\'s qualifications should be comparable to the primary member to be replaced. The IRB minutes should document when an alternate member replaces a primary member. When alternates substitute for a primary member, the alternate member should have received and reviewed the same material that the primary member received or would have received.\n\n16 Does a non-affiliated member need to attend every IRB meeting?\n\nNo. Although 21 CFR 56.108(c) does not specifically require the presence of a member not otherwise affiliated with the institution to constitute a quorum, FDA considers the presence of such members an important element of the IRB\'s diversity. Therefore, frequent absence of all non-affiliated members is not acceptable to FDA. Acknowledging their important role, many IRBs have appointed more than one member who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution. FDA encourages IRBs to appoint members in accordance with 21 CFR 56.107(a) who will be able to participate fully in the IRB process.\n\n17 Which IRB members should be considered to be scientists and non-scientists?\n\n21 CFR 56.107(c) requires at least one member of the IRB to have primary concerns in the scientific area and at least one to have primary concerns in the non-scientific area. Most IRBs include physicians and Ph.D. level physical or biological scientists. Such members satisfy the requirement for at least one scientist. When an IRB encounters studies involving science beyond the expertise of the members, the IRB may use a consultant to assist in the review, as provided by 21 CFR 56.107(f).\n\nFDA believes the intent of the requirement for diversity of disciplines was to include members who had little or no scientific or medical training or experience. Therefore, nurses, pharmacists and other biomedical health professionals should not be regarded to have ""primary concerns in the non-scientific area."" In the past, lawyers, clergy and ethicists have been cited as examples of persons whose primary concerns would be in non-scientific areas.\n\nSome members have training in both scientific and non-scientific disciplines, such as a J.D., R.N. While such members are of great value to an IRB, other members who are unambiguously non-scientific should be appointed to satisfy the non-scientist requirement.\n\nIII. IRB Procedures\n\n18. The FDA regulations [21 CFR 56.104(c)] exempt an emergency use of a test article from prospective IRB review, however, ""... any subsequent use of the test article at the institution is subject to IRB review."" What does the phrase ""subsequent use"" mean?\n\nFDA regulations allow for one emergency use of a test article in an institution without prospective IRB review, provided that such emergency use is reported to the IRB within five working days after such use. An emergency use is defined as a single use (or single course of treatment, e.g., multiple doses of antibiotic) with one subject. ""Subsequent use"" would be a second use with that subject or the use with another subject.\n\nIn its review of the emergency use, if it is anticipated that the test article may be used again, the IRB should request a protocol and consent document(s) be developed so that an approved protocol would be in place when the next need arises. In spite of the best efforts of the clinical investigator and the IRB, a situation may occur where a second emergency use needs to be considered. FDA believes it is inappropriate to deny emergency treatment to an individual when the only obstacle is lack of time for the IRB to convene, review the use and give approval.\n\n19. Are there any regulations that require clinical investigators to report to the IRB when a study has been completed?\n\nIRBs are required to function under written procedures. One of these procedural requirements [21 CFR 56.108(a)(3)] requires ensuring ""prompt reporting to the IRB of changes in a research activity."" The completion of the study is a change in activity and should be reported to the IRB. Although subjects will no longer be ""at risk"" under the study, a final report/notice to the IRB allows it to close its files as well as providing information that may be used by the IRB in the evaluation and approval of related studies.\n\n20. What is expedited review?\n\nExpedited review is a procedure through which certain kinds of research may be reviewed and approved without convening a meeting of the IRB. The Agency\'s IRB regulations [21 CFR 56.110] permit, but do not require, an IRB to review certain categories of research through an exedited procedure if the research involves no more than minimal risk. A list of categories was last published in the Federal Register on January 27, 1981 [46 FR 8980].\n\nThe IRB may also use the expedited review procedure to review minor changes in previously approved research during the period covered by the original approval. Under an expedited review procedure, review of research may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced members of the IRB designated by the chairperson. The reviewer(s) may exercise all the authorities of the IRB, except disapproval. Research may only be disapproved following review by the full committee. The IRB is required to adopt a method of keeping all members advised of research studies that have been approved by expedited review.\n\n[See Conditions for IRB Use of Expedited Review - Federal Register: November 9, 1998 (Volume 63, Number 216), Notices (/about-fda/page-not-found)]\n\n21. The number of studies we review has increased, and the size of the package of review materials we send to IRB members is becoming formidable. Must we send the full package to all IRB members?\n\nThe IRB system was designed to foster open discussion and debate at convened meetings of the full IRB membership. While it is preferable for every IRB member to have personal copies of all study materials, each member must be provided with sufficient information to be able to actively and constructively participate. Some institutions have developed a ""primary reviewer"" system to promote a thorough review. Under this system, studies are assigned to one or more IRB members for a full review of all materials. Then, at the convened IRB meeting the study is presented by the primary reviewer(s) and, after discussion by IRB members, a vote for an action is taken.\n\nThe ""primary reviewer"" procedure is acceptable to the FDA if each member receives, at a minimum; a copy of consent documents and a summary of the protocol in sufficient detail to determine the appropriateness of the study-specific statements in the consent documents. In addition, the complete documentation should be available to all members for their review, both before and at the meeting. The materials for review should be received by the membership sufficiently in advance of the meeting to allow for adequate review of the materials.\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n--------------------\nContext: This formal review of the research effort, as required under 21 CFR 56.109(f), is the subject of this guidance. An IRB must review previously approved research at least once a year (21 CFR 56.109(f)). Review must be conducted at convened meetings at which a majority of the IRB members are present, including at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas, unless the research qualifies for review through an expedited process (21 CFR 56.108(c) and 56.110). See Section III.D. of this guidance for more information on the application of expedited review procedures to continuing review.\n\nIRBs involved in multi-site studies may find it difficult to conduct a thorough review with data solely from the site(s) under their purview and may need to obtain study-wide information. Sponsors are in the unique position of having information for the entire study6 and may provide it to investigators, who in turn provide it to the IRBs. FDA's regulations do not prohibit sponsors from providing study-wide information directly to IRBs.7 FDA encourages efforts by investigators and sponsors to ensure that IRBs receive meaningful study-wide information, particularly when doing so may assist IRBs in reviewing the studies and protecting subjects.\n\nFootnote 6: See FDA’s Guidance for Industry, “Adverse Event Reporting to IRBs – Improving Human Subject Protection,” http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126572.pdf.\n\nFootnote 7: Note that FDA’s regulations for device studies specifically assign general responsibility to sponsors “...for ensuring IRB review and approval are obtained and ensuring that any reviewing IRB and FDA are promptly informed of significant new information about an investigation...” 21 CFR 812.40.\n\nOne way to enable a useful continuing review of multi-site studies while reducing or eliminating duplication of effort is through the use of cooperative review agreements or other mechanisms (e.g., using a centralized IRB review process), in accordance with 21 CFR 56.114. Cooperative agreements may vary with respect to how continuing review will be carried out. For example, some agreements may designate a specific IRB as having primary responsibility for continuing review of an investigation.8 Other agreements may assign responsibility for local issues to the institution's IRB, but assign the remaining aspects of continuing review to a central IRB.\n\nFootnote 8: See FDA’s Guidance for Industry, “Using a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials,” http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm080606.pdf.\n\nWhatever the arrangement, the IRB(s) responsible for continuing review of multi-site studies may find it helpful to obtain and review information across the entire study. For additional discussion, see Section III.B. of this guidance.\n\nAppendix A Criteria for Approving Research During Continuing Review\n\nFDA regulations set forth the criteria for IRB approval of research (21 CFR 56.111). These criteria apply to both initial review and continuing review. In order to approve research, the IRB must determine that all of following requirements are satisfied:\n\nRisks to subjects are minimized;\n\nRisks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may be expected to result;\n\nSelection of subjects is equitable;\n\nInformed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and appropriately documented;\n\nWhere appropriate, the research plan adequately provides for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects;\n\nWhere appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data;\n\nAppropriate additional safeguards are included to protect vulnerable subjects; and\n\nWhere the study involves children, the research complies with 21 CFR part 50, Subpart D.\n\nThe IRB makes its continuing review determination by considering whether any new information is available that would affect the IRB's prior finding that the research meets the criteria in 21 CFR 56.111. IRBs have authority to disapprove or require modifications in (to secure re- approval of) a research activity that does not meet any of the above criteria (e.g., the full study or any part thereof, such as changes to the protocol, advertisements; 21 CFR 56.109(a))\n\nAppendix B Process for Conducting Continuing Review\n\nContinuing review takes place at a convened meeting of the IRB, unless it meets the criteria for expedited review under 21 CFR 56.110. (See 21 CFR 56.108(c) and Section III.D. of this guidance.) The IRB is required to review the research (21 CFR 56.109(f)) and must maintain records of its continuing review activities, including minutes of meetings at which such activities are undertaken (21 CFR 56.115(a)(2) and (3)). The minutes must be in sufficient detail to show actions taken by the IRB, and the vote on these actions, and to summarize the discussion of controverted issues and their resolution (21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)). For research to be approved, a majority of IRB members present at a meeting must approve it (21 CFR 56.108(c)).\n\nThe IRB must ensure that a member does not participate in the IRB's continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB (21 CFR 56.107(e)). Meeting minutes must reflect meeting attendance, the votes taken, and a summary of the discussion and resolution of controverted issues, and should provide confirmation that conflicted members did not participate in the IRB's continuing review of their studies (21 CFR 56.115((a)(2)). FDA recommends that IRB members with a conflicting interest in a project recuse themselves by leaving the meeting room when the IRB conducts continuing review of that project, except when requested by the IRB to be present to provide information.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThis IRB member recusal should be noted in the minutes of the IRB meeting when recording votes on IRB actions.\n\nAn IRB must maintain and follow written procedures for the continuing review of research (21 CFR 56.108(a)(1) and 56.115(a)(6)). In developing procedures for continuing review, the IRB should consider the use of templates, checklists, or other tools to standardize the request for information or list of materials to be provided to the IRB at the time of continuing review.\n\nInvestigators are responsible for ensuring that studies they conduct comply with applicable regulatory requirements.9 To ensure that the reviewing IRB can carry out its review prior to the expiration date of the current IRB approval, investigators should follow the IRB's policies and procedures for continuing IRB review of research (procedures required by 21 CFR 56.108(a)(1)), in particular by submitting materials and information required by the IRB. FDA encourages IRBs to make investigators aware of the IRB's procedures, for example, by enclosing a copy in correspondence informing the investigator of the IRB's decisions, or posting the information on a website.\n\nFootnote 9: See 21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vii), 312.60, 312.66, 812.36(c)(viii), 812.100, 812.110(b), 812.40, and 812.43(c)(4)(i).\n\nFDA recommends that the IRB's written procedures call for submission of the following information for consideration by the IRB in continuing review, if not already available to the IRB as part of the existing IRB records for the research10:\n\nFootnote 10: Some of this information may come from the sponsor, who would have access to data across all study sites. Sponsors may provide information directly to IRBs or to the clinical investigators who in turn would share it with the IRBs.\n\nA written progress report/brief project summary that includes the following or references other documents made available to the IRB:\n\nThe number of subjects accrued; (For multi-site studies, the number of subjects accrued at the local site and the number accrued study-wide, if available, should be provided.)\n\nA brief summary of any amendments to the research approved by the IRB since the IRB's initial review or the last continuing review;\n\nAny new and relevant information, published or unpublished, since the last IRB review, especially information about risks associated with the research; (Note that FDA does not expect the IRB to perform an independent review of the relevant scientific literature related to a particular research project undergoing continuing review.)\n\nA summary of any unanticipated problems.11 In many cases, such a summary could be a brief statement that there have been no unanticipated problems (i.e., adverse events have occurred at the expected frequency and level of severity as documented in the research protocol, the informed consent document, and Investigator's Brochure (if applicable)); *\n(\\circ) A summary of any subject withdrawals from the research since the last IRB review, and the reasons for withdrawal, if known; and (\\circ) A summary of any complaints about the research from subjects enrolled at the local site since the last IRB review;\n\nThe latest version of the protocol and sample informed consent document(s) in use at the site;\n\nAny proposed modifications to the informed consent document or protocol;\n\nThe current Investigator's Brochure, if any, including any modifications;\n--------------------\nContext title: IRB Continuing Review After Clinical Investigation Approval Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors""

This document has been revised to provide updated information and is being issued in accordance with the Agency\'s regulations on Good Guidance Practices (21 CFR 10.115)2.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nFootnote 2: 65 FR 56477, September 19, 2000.\nFDA regulations generally require IRB review and approval of research involving FDA regulated products (e.g., investigational drugs, biological products, and medical devices) (21 CFR Part 56).\n\nFDA developed its BIMO Program to ensure the protection of the rights, welfare, and safety of human subjects and the quality and integrity of data submitted to the Agency. Among other things, the FDA BIMO Program involves site visits to IRBs, clinical investigators, sponsors, monitors, contract research organizations, nonclinical (animal) laboratories, and bioequivalence analytical laboratories. This document addresses site visits to IRBs that review clinical investigations that are regulated by FDA under 21 USC 355(i) and 21 USC 360(j) and clinical investigations that support applications for research or marketing permits for products regulated by FDA.\n\n3 When Are IRB Inspections Conducted?\n\nFDA conducts IRB inspections to determine if IRBs are operating in compliance with current FDA regulations and statutory requirements and if the IRBs are following their own written procedures. The FDA regulations pertinent to IRBs include 21 CFR Part 50 (Protection of Human Subjects), Part 56 (Institutional Review Boards), Part 312 (Investigational New Drug Application), and Part 812 (Investigational Device Exemptions).\n\nFDA inspections of IRBs generally fall into one of two categories:\n\nperiodic, scheduled inspections to review the overall operations and procedures of the IRB.\n\nunscheduled inspections focused on the IRB\'s review of a specific clinical trial or trials. Directed inspections generally result from a complaint, clinical investigator misconduct, or safety issues pertaining to a trial or site.\n\n4 How Are IRB Inspections Conducted?\n\nFDA personnel from one of FDA\'s District Offices contact a responsible individual at the institution, usually the IRB chairperson to schedule the site visit. FDA personnel issue a notice of inspection (Form FDA 482) and present their credentials to the most responsible individual before the inspection begins. They interview appropriate people and obtain information about the IRB\'s policies and procedures. Usually, the IRB\'s performance is evaluated by tracking one or more studies that are subject to IRB review under FDA regulations. Also, the IRB\'s procedures and membership rosters are examined to determine whether they conform to current FDA regulations (21 CFR Part 56, subparts A-D). During the inspection, FDA personnel typically review and copy:\n\nRecords of IRB membership\n\nIRB procedures and guidelines\n\nMinutes of IRB meetings for the past year * Documents related to the studies given by the clinical investigator to the IRB\n\nDocuments related to the studies sent by the IRB to the clinical investigator\n\nAny other materials about these studies\n\nV What happens after an inspection?\n\nAt the end of an inspection, FDA personnel conduct an exit interview with responsible institutional and IRB representatives. At this interview, FDA personnel who conducted the inspection review and discuss the findings from the inspection and, if deficiencies are found, issue a written Form FDA 483 (Inspectional Observations; 483) to the most responsible IRB representative. The 483 describes any inspectional observations that, in the opinion of the FDA personnel conducting the inspection, represent deviations from applicable statutes and regulations. The IRB may respond to the 483 observations verbally during the exit interview and/or respond in writing after the inspection. If the IRB/responsible institution chooses to respond in writing to the deficiencies listed on the 483, the response should be directed to the FDA District Office listed in the upper left corner of the 483. A list of FDA District Offices is also posted on FDA\'s website (http://www.fda.gov/ora).\n\nFollowing the inspection, the FDA personnel who conducted the IRB inspection prepare a written Establishment Inspection Report (EIR). The EIR, 483 (if issued), copies of any materials collected during the inspection, and any IRB response are forwarded to the appropriate FDA Center for further evaluation. After this review, one of the following types of letters is typically sent from the Center to the IRB chairperson or other responsible institutional official:\n\nA letter that generally states that FDA observed no significant deviations from the regulations. Note that a letter is not always sent when FDA observes no significant deviations.\n\nAn informational or untilted letter that identifies deviations from statutes and regulations for which voluntary corrective action is sufficient. Occasionally, such letters request a response from the IRB.\n\nA Warning Letter that identifies serious deviations from applicable statutes and regulations. A Warning Letter generally requests prompt correction by the IRB and a formal written response to the Agency.\n\nLetters may also be issued in accordance with 21 CFR 56.120. In such cases, the Agency will require that the IRB or parent institution respond to the letter within a time period specified by FDA and describe the corrective actions that will be taken by the IRB or the parent institution, or both, to achieve compliance. Based on the response from the IRB or institution to these letters, FDA may schedule a reinspection to confirm the adequacy of corrective actions. In addition to issuing these letters, FDA can take other administrative actions against IRBs, or their institutions,for noncompliance with applicable statutes and regulations (21 CFR Part 56, subpart E). Until the IRB or parent institution takes appropriate corrective action, FDA may (for studies subject to FDA\'s IRB regulations):\n\nWithhold approval of new studies that are conducted at the institution or reviewed by the IRB\n\nDirect that no new subjects be added to ongoing studies\n\nTerminate ongoing studies when doing so would not endanger the subjects\n\nNotify relevant State and Federal regulatory agencies and other parties with direct interest in the Agency\'s action of the deficiencies in the operation of the IRB in instances when the apparent noncompliance creates a significant threat to the rights and welfare of human subjects\n\nThe FDA Commissioner can also begin proceedings to disqualify an IRB or the institution if the IRB has refused or repeatedly failed to comply with FDA\'s IRB regulations (21 CFR Part 56) and the noncompliance adversely affects the rights or welfare of the human subjects in a clinical investigation.\n\nVI Who can provide more information?\n\nIf, during an inspection, an IRB official has any questions the FDA personnel conducting the inspection has not answered, either the District Office Director or the contact person at the Center that assigned the inspection can be contacted. The FDA personnel conducting the inspection should be able to provide the name and telephone number of the District Office Director and the Center contact person.\n\nIn addition, the FDA Compliance Program Guidance Manual for Institutional Review Board Inspections (Program 7348.809), used by FDA to conduct these inspections, is available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/ora/cpgm/default.html#bimo.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Institutional Review Board Inspections Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nInstitutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/institutional-review-boards-frequently-asked-questions)\n\nOffice of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nThe following is a compilation of answers to questions asked of FDA regarding the protection of human subjects of research. For ease of reference, the numbers assigned to the questions are consecutive throughout this section. These questions and answers are organized as follows.\n\nI. IRB Organization\n\nII. IRB Membership\n\nIII. IRB Procedures\n\nIV. IRB Records\n\nV. Informed Consent Process\n\nVI. Informed Consent Document Content\n\nVII. Clinical Investigations\n\nVIII. General Questions\n\nI. IRB Organization\n\nWhat is an Institutional Review Board (IRB)?\n\nUnder FDA regulations, an IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects. In accordance with FDA regulations, an IRB has the authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove research. This group review serves an important role in the protection of the rights and welfare of human research subjects.\n\nThe purpose of IRB review is to assure, both in advance and by periodic review, that appropriate steps are taken to protect the rights and welfare of humans participating as subjects in the research. To accomplish this purpose, IRBs use a group process to review research protocols and related materials (e.g., informed consent documents and investigator brochures) to ensure protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects of research.\n\n2 Do IRBs have to be formally called by that name?\n\nNo, ""IRB"" is a generic term used by FDA (and HHS) to refer to a group whose function is to review research to assure the protection of the rights and welfare of the human subjects. Each institution may use whatever name it chooses. Regardless of the name chosen, the IRB is subject to the Agency\'s IRB regulations when studies of FDA regulated products are reviewed and approved.\n\n3 Does an IRB need to register with FDA before approving studies?\n\nAs published in the Federal Register on January 15, 2009, (74 FR 2358), 21 CFR Part 56, Institutional Review Boards, was amended with regard to IRB registration (21 CFR 56.106). This amendment requires each IRB in the United States (U.S.) that reviews FDA-regulated studies to register. IRB registration information is entered into an Internet-based registration system maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). (See Guidance for Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) Frequently Asked Questions - IRB Registration (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/frequently-asked-questions-irb-registration)).\n\n4 What is an ""assurance"" or a ""multiple project assurance?""\n\nAn ""assurance,"" is a document negotiated between an institution and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in accordance with HHS regulations. For research involving human subjects conducted by HHS or supported in whole or in part by HHS, the HHS regulations require a written assurance from the performance-site institution that the institution will comply with the HHS protection of human subjects regulations [45 CFR part 46]. The assurance mechanism is described in 45 CFR 46.103. Once an institution\'s assurance has been approved by HHS, a number is assigned to the assurance. The assurance may be for a single grant or contract (a ""single project assurance""); for multiple grants (""multiple project assurances"" - formerly called ""general assurances""); or for certain types of studies such as oncology group studies and AIDS research group studies (""cooperative project assurances""). The Office for Human Research Protection (OHRP) is responsible for implementing the HHS regulations. The address and telephone number for OHRP are: 1101 Wootton Parkway, The Tower Building, Suite 200, Rockville, MD 20852; Toll-Free Telephone within the U.S.: (866) 447-4777, Telephone: (240) 453-6900, FAX: (240) 453-6909.\nCurrently, FDA regulations do not require an assurance. FDA regulations [21 CFR parts 50 and 56] apply to research involving products regulated by FDA - federal funds and/or support do not need to be involved for the FDA regulations to apply. When research studies involving products regulated by FDA are funded/supported by HHS, the research institution must comply with both the HHS and FDA regulations. [A table of significant differences between 45 CFR Part 46, Subpart A and 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 (/science-research/good-clinical-practice-educational-materials/comparison-fda-and-hhs-human-subject-protection-regulations) is available on the FDA website.]\n\n6 Must an institution establish its own IRB?\n\nNo. Although institutions engaged in research involving human subjects will usually have their own IRBs to oversee research conducted within the institution or by the staff of the institution, FDA regulations permit an institution without an IRB to arrange for an ""outside"" IRB to be responsible for initial and continuing review of studies conducted at the non-IRB institution. Such arrangements should be documented in writing. Individuals conducting research in a non-institutional setting often use established IRBs (independent or institutional) rather than form their own IRBs. Also see the information sheets entitled ""Non-local IRB Review"" and ""Cooperative Research.""\n\n7 May a hospital IRB review a study that will be conducted outside of the hospital?\n\nYes. IRBs may agree to review research from affiliated or unaffiliated investigators, however, FDA does not require IRBs to assume this responsibility. If the IRB routinely conducts these reviews, the IRB policies should authorize such reviews and the process should be described in the IRB\'s written procedures. A hospital IRB may review outside studies on an individual basis when the minutes clearly show the members are aware of where the study is to be conducted and when the IRB possesses appropriate knowledge about the study site(s).\n\n8 May IRB members be paid for their services?\n\nThe FDA regulations do not preclude a member from being compensated for services rendered. Payment to IRB members should not be related to or dependent upon a favorable decision. Expenses, such as travel costs, may also be reimbursed.\n\n9 What is the FDA role in IRB liability in malpractice suits?\n\nFDA regulations do not address the question of IRB or institutional liability in the case of malpractice suits. FDA does not have authority to limit liability of IRBs or their members. Compliance with FDA regulations may help minimize an IRB\'s exposure to liability.\nThe fundamental purpose of IRB review of informed consent is to assure that the rights and welfare of subjects are protected. A signed informed consent document is evidence that the document has been provided to a prospective subject (and presumably, explained) and that the subject has agreed to participate in the research. IRB review of informed consent documents also ensures that the institution has complied with applicable regulations.\n\n11. Does an IRB or institution have to compensate subjects if injury occurs as a result of participation in a research study?\n\nInstitutional policy, not FDA regulation, determines whether compensation and medical treatment(s) will be offered and the conditions that might be placed on subject eligibility for compensation or treatment(s). The FDA informed consent regulation on compensation [21] CFR 50.25(a)(6)] requires that, for research involving more than minimal risk, the subject must be told whether any compensation and any medical treatment(s) are available if injury occurs and, if so, what they are, or where further information may be obtained. Any statement that compensation is not offered must avoid waiving or appearing to waive any of the subject\'s rights or releasing or appearing to release the investigator, sponsor, or institution from liability for negligence [21] CFR 50.20].\n\nII IRB Membership\n\n12. May a clinical investigator be an IRB member?\n\nYes, however, the IRB regulations [21] CFR 56.107(e)] prohibit any member from participating in the IRB\'s initial or continuing review of any study in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB. When selecting IRB members, the potential for conflicts of interest should be considered. When members frequently have conflicts and must absent themselves from deliberation and abstain from voting, their contributions to the group review process may be diminished and could hinder the review procedure. Even greater disruptions may result if this person is chairperson of the IRB.\n\n13. The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n\nYes. For example, one member could be otherwise unaffiliated with the institution and have a primary concern in a non-scientific area. This individual would satisfy two of the membership requirements of the regulations. IRBs should strive, however, for a membership that has a diversity of representative capacities and disciplines. In fact, the FDA regulations [21] CFR 56.107(a)] require that, as part of being qualified as an IRB, the IRB must have ""... diversity of members, including consideration of race, gender, cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes....""\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators'

It does not create any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist institutional review boards (IRBs), clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA\'s informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. This guidance supersedes FDA\'s guidance entitled ""A Guide to Informed Consent,"" issued in September 1998, and finalizes FDA\'s draft guidance entitled ""Informed Consent Information Sheet,"" issued in July 2014. This document is structured to first present general guidance on FDA\'s regulatory requirements for informed consent and a discussion of the roles of IRBs, clinical investigators, sponsors, and FDA related to informed consent, followed by a series of frequently asked questions.\n\nIn a final rule published on January 19, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal departments and agencies revised the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects. The final rule became effective in 2018 (codified for HHS at 45 CFR 46, subpart A; ""the 2018 Common Rule"").2,3 The 2018 Common Rule sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by federal departments or agencies that have adopted the Common Rule. The revisions include significant changes to the provisions regarding informed consent. FDA is currently engaged in notice and comment rulemaking to harmonize its human subject protection\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nof the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Summary of the Consent process\n\nTo many, the term informed consent is mistakenly viewed as synonymous with obtaining a subject\'s signature on the consent form;9 however, obtaining documentation of a subject\'s informed consent is only part of the consent process. Informed consent involves providing a prospective subject, or their legally authorized representative (LAR), with adequate information to allow for an informed decision about participation in the clinical investigation prior to enrollment. Informed consent also involves facilitating the prospective subject\'s understanding of the information, providing adequate opportunity for the prospective subject to ask questions and to consider whether to participate, obtaining the prospective subject\'s voluntary agreement to participate prior to enrollment, and continuing to provide information as the clinical investigation progresses or as the enrolled subject or situation requires.10\n\nFootnote 9: In this guidance document, the terms informed consent form and informed consent document are used interchangeably.\n\nExcept as provided in 21 CFR 50.23 and 50.24,11 (see section III.A.1, ""Exceptions to Informed Consent""), no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in FDA-regulated research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s LAR (21CFR 50.20).12 To be legally effective, the informed consent process must satisfy the general requirements under 21 CFR 50.20 and include the relevant elements of informed consent described at 21 CFR 50.25 (see section3), ""FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion"").\n\nFootnote 12: As described in guidance, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances, with respect to its current regulations governing the requirement for informed consent when human specimens are used for FDA-regulated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device investigations. See “Guidance on Informed Consent for in Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable: Guidance for Sponsors, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff”, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-informed- Consent-vitro-diagnostic-device-studies-using-leftover-human-specimens-are-not\n\nFDA considers advertising used to recruit subjects into the clinical trial to be the start of the ongoing consent process, and the information provided in any online or hard copy recruitment materials should be consistent with the informed consent document. Generally, FDA recommends that any advertisement to recruit subjects be limited to the information the prospective subjects need to determine their interest and potential eligibility. The FDA information sheet ""Recruiting Study Subjects"" includes information regarding scripts for those who will interface with subjects to determine basic eligibility.13\n\nFootnote 13: See the FDA Information Sheet “Recruiting Study Subjects,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects, for further information.\n\nOnce a prospective subject is identified, and before research activities requiring prior consent occur, a person knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and capable of answering questions raised by the prospective subject should conduct a consent discussion. The consent discussion and the consent form must contain information to allow prospective subjects to make an informed decision about participation in a clinical investigation and provide an opportunity for prospective subjects to ask questions about the clinical investigation and the information in the consent document (see section3), ""FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion"") (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25).14 The consent form serves several purposes, including helping to ensure that prospective subjects receive the required information, providing a ""take home"" reminder of the elements of the clinical investigation, providing contact information in case additional questions or concerns arise, and documenting prospective subjects\' voluntary agreement to participate as well as the date of their agreement.\n\nFootnote 14: The regulations allow use of a “short form” consent form when the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For a discussion of the short form written consent, see section3.5.4.2, “Short Form.”\n\nThe informed consent process is an ongoing exchange of information throughout a subject\'s participation in a clinical trial and does not end after the consent form is signed. For example, if new safety information or protocol changes occur during the conduct of the study, additional information may need to be given to the subject, and/or the subject may need additional opportunities to ask questions and receive answers throughout the clinical investigation (see sectionIII.3.5, ""Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects,"" and Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nIII FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b ""Short Form"" for more details). If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For ""applicable clinical trials"" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, “Element of Informed Consent for ‘Applicable Clinical Trials.”\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors']","['Yes.

For more information visit: https://www.fda.gov/international-programs/international-arrangements/mutual-recognition-agreement-mra.\n\nFootnote 8: See FDA guidance for industry Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (April 2021).\n\n2.2.2 What types of inspections would be deemed ""mission-critical""?\n\nA2: FDA\'s assessment of whether an inspection is mission-critical considers many factors related to the public health benefit of U.S. patients having access to the product subject to inspection. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether the product has received breakthrough therapy designation, orphan-drug designation, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation; is included in the Drug Shortage or CBER-Regulated Products Shortage list; is used for critical care or as a medical countermeasure; is used to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a serious disease or medical condition, including COVID-19, for which there is no other appropriate and available treatment. Therefore, for-cause (including follow-up and where a specific drug quality problem or facility issues come to FDA\'s attention), preapproval, and pre-license inspections can be deemed mission-critical. When determining whether to conduct a mission-critical inspection, FDA also takes into account concerns about the safety of its investigators, employees at a site or facility, and where applicable, clinical trial participants and other patients at investigator sites.\n\n2.3 Does FDA determine what is ""mission-critical"" using the same factors for both domestic and foreign inspections?\n\nA3: Yes, the determination is made considering the same factors regardless of whether the site is domestic or foreign.\n\n2.2.4 How will FDA ensure the quality of imported products while inspections are limited?\n\nA4: During this interim period, FDA is expanding the use of other tools and approaches for assessing manufacturing facilities, when appropriate, to help ensure the quality of the drug products imported into the United States. These may include physical examinations of products arriving at U.S. borders or product sampling and testing before release into commerce, reviewing the compliance histories of facilities, using information shared by trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements, requestingrecords directly from facilities ""in advance of or in lieu of"" certain drug inspections,9 and conducting remote interactive evaluations where appropriate. If a product appears not to meet applicable standards for safety, effectiveness, or quality based on these approaches, FDA has the authority to refuse admission of the product into the United States.10\n\nFDA continues to work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to target products intended for importation into the United States that violate applicable legal requirements for FDA-regulated products. FDA has the ability to use a risk-based analytics tool (Predictive Risk-based Evaluation for Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT)) to electronically screen regulated shipments imported or offered for import into the United States.11 PREDICT uses automated data mining, pattern discovery, and automated queries of FDA databases to determine the potential risk of a shipment. It takes into consideration the inherent risk of a product and also information about the previous history of importers, manufacturers, and shippers.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 10: See section 801(a) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: For more details visit FDA’s Entry Screening Systems and Tools page at https://www.fda.gov/industr/import-systems/entry-screening-systems-and-tools.\n\nQ5: How will travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency affect my application?\n\nA5: During the COVID-19 public health emergency, FDA is using all available tools and sources of information to support regulatory decisions on applications12 that include sites impacted by travel restrictions due to COVID-19. For example, FDA will continue the assessment of all applications per normal assessment operations for all disciplines, where all manufacturing facilities will be evaluated using a risk-based approach consistent with existing guidelines. Similarly, the need for and selection of sites for BIMO inspections will continue to be risk-based, considering application and site-specific factors. During this interim period, FDA is using alternative tools, where available, to determine or mitigate the need for an inspection and to support the application assessment. This includes reviewing a firm\'s previous compliance history, using information sharing from trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements, requesting records ""in advance of or in lieu of"" facility inspections13 or voluntarily from facilities and sites, and conducting remote interactive evaluations where appropriate.\n\nFootnote 12: See 21 CFR 314.50(d), 314.94(a), and 601.20(d).\n\nCDER and CBER are continuing to evaluate applications, strategically applying a holistic approach in the decision-making process to determine if an inspection is warranted or if an inspection is no longer needed due to information gained through the use of the alternative tools mentioned above. FDA will continue to work directly with the applicants of those impacted applications.\n\nFDA is also working directly with facilities to communicate any issues identified through a review of records or other information requested. For example, for both CDER- and CBER-regulated products, interim processes have been implemented to communicate with manufacturing facilities regarding issues identified following a review of records or other information requested ""in advance of or in lieu of"" a preapproval or pre-license inspection. Responses from the facility regarding these issues will, as feasible, be considered before taking an action on a pending application.\n\nThe Agency encourages applicants to be in communication with all their facilities and sites to ensure timely responses to any inquiries to support application assessment.\n\nQ6: If my application includes sites that cannot be inspected because of travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency will my application automatically receive a complete response letter?\n\nA6: No, FDA will not automatically issue a complete response (CR) letter if FDA cannot conduct an inspection because of travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency.14 Decisions regarding applications will be based on the totality of the information available to FDA, including information obtained from use of the alternative tools as described in Q5/A5.\n\nFootnote 14: For mission-critical and prioritized domestic inspections needed to support application approval, FDA aims to conduct those inspections during the review of the application. However, in cases where travel restrictions due to the public health emergency prevent FDA from performing those inspections during the review clock, recommendations in Q6/A6 are applicable.\n\nBased on an assessment of the product information provided in the application and based on available information about the facility or site, FDA will take one of the following actions:\n\nFDA plans to *approve\n\nthe application if\n\nAvailable information, including information obtained from the use of alternate tools, supports the adequacy of the facilities and sites named in a pending application, no other deficiencies have been identified, and the application otherwise satisfies the requirements for approval.15 Footnote 15: See 21 CFR 314.50, 314.94, and 601.2.\n\nIn this case, the need for an inspection could be sufficiently mitigated by the FDA\'s use of alternate tools, including a firm\'s responses to outstanding issues identified from the use of alternate tools (see Q5/A5).\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter with facility- or site-related deficiencies\n\nAvailable information from a prior FDA or mutual recognition agreement inspection or the use of alternate tools identifies concerns about the adequacy of a facility or site, and an inspection needed to address those concerns cannot be completed during the review cycle, or\n\nResponses to outstanding issues identified from requested records and other alternate sources (see Q5/A5) are not sufficient to address the issues identified for a facility or site.\n\nIn this case, FDA intends to inform the applicant of the facility or site issues as soon as possible during the review cycle. Specifically, FDA intends to inform the applicant that an inspection will be needed before the application can be approved\nand that the inspection may not be conducted before the action date due to restrictions on travel. * FDA generally intends to issue a CR letter, including a deficiency related to the facility or site, if the inspection has not been conducted by the action date.\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter without facility or site deficiencies\n\nAn inspection is necessary because there is insufficient information currently available to make a determination on the acceptability of a facility or site16,17 and other deficiencies have been identified.\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats such as emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to describe how we will request and conduct voluntary remote interactive evaluations at facilities2 where drugs3 are manufactured, processed, packed, or held; facilities covered under FDA\'s bioresearch monitoring (BIMO) program; and outsourcing facilities registered under section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nFootnote 2: In this guidance, the term facility covers persons, sites, and establishments subject to FDA drug manufacturing and bioresearch monitoring regulations and statutory authority.\n\nFootnote 3: In this guidance, the term drug includes biologics.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]\n\nconduct an evaluation. In this guidance, we refer to our use of any combination of these interactive tools as a remote interactive evaluation. FDA may request to conduct a remote interactive evaluation prior to or following other types of regulatory oversight activities (e.g., an inspection or a request for records or other information).7\n\nFootnote 7: A remote interactive evaluation is not the same as an inspection as described in section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act or a request for records or other information in advance of or in lieu of an inspection, as described in section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act. Similarly, a remote interactive evaluation or a request under section 704(a)(4) does not constitute an inspection for purposes of section 510(h)(3) of the FD&C Act. Section 704(a)(4) does not apply to every inspection program covered by this guidance (e.g., section 704(a)(4) does not apply to the BIMO inspection program). Failure to cooperate with either an inspection or a 704(a)(4) request for records or other information may constitute a limiting of inspection and as a result, FDA may deem the relevant drugs manufactured at these establishments adulterated. See the guidance for industry Circumstances that Constitute Delaying, Denying, Limiting, or Refusing a Drug Inspection (October 2014) for further information.\n\nIII Planning a Remote Interactive Evaluation\n\nFDA may request to conduct a remote interactive evaluation whenever a program office determines it is appropriate based on mission needs and any travel limitations. FDA conducts inspections for many purposes and programs, and we will consider each of those inspection program areas as possible candidates for a remote interactive evaluation. This policy applies to all drug inspection programs including, but not limited to:\n\nPre-Approval Inspections (PAIs) and Pre-License Inspections (PLIs): FDA may perform a PAI or PLI to assess a marketing application. FDA uses these inspections to ensure that any facility named or referenced in support of an application can perform the proposed manufacturing operations in conformance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements, to verify conformance with the application, and to confirm that data submitted in the application are accurate and complete.\n\nPost-Approval Inspections (PoAIs): PoAIs focus on a specific drug and changes to its manufacturing operations, the evaluation of process validation, any changes submitted to the application, and the execution of supporting activities according to application commitments and CGMP requirements.\n\nSurveillance Inspections: Surveillance drug quality inspections examine overall operations, including controls that ensure manufacturing processes produce quality drugs, thereby reducing the risk of adulterated or misbranded drugs reaching consumers and patients. FDA uses surveillance inspections to evaluate the CGMP compliance of manufacturing operations. Surveillance inspections are performed at active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product manufacturing facilities, as well as outsourcing facilities that have registered with FDA under section 503B of the FD&C Act.\n\nFollow-Up and Compliance Inspections: When a specific drug quality problem or facility issue comes to FDA\'s attention, we may initiate a follow-up or compliance drug quality inspection. For example, FDA may conduct an inspection to investigate: (1) product safety, effectiveness, or quality concerns arising from defect reports; (2) information provided by an informant about a facility; (3) violata facility that were discovered during the inspection of another facility; or (4) corrective actions undertaken by a facility in response to, for example, a warning letter or regulatory meeting.\n--------------------\nContext title: Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry'

FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to provide answers to frequently asked questions about regulatory and policy issues related to inspections, pending drug applications, and changes in manufacturing facilities for approved pharmaceutical products.1 This document updates the guidance of the same title issued in August 2020, and revised in January 2021.\n\nFootnote 1: In this guidance, the terms drug and pharmaceutical product include biological products.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS) (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\nFDA has issued guidance on how to implement manufacturing process and facility changes; relevant guidances that describe the process for reporting changes to an application can be found in section V. References. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), and the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) remain fully capable of continuing daily activities, such as application assessments, including facility evaluation and certain inspection activities, while responding to public health needs related to the current COVID-19 pandemic. As this remains an evolving and very dynamic situation, FDA will continue to be flexible and as transparent as possible.\n\nInspections\n\nThe following questions and answers are intended to provide information regarding common queries related to inspections for facilities manufacturing pharmaceutical products and sites involved in the conduct of clinical, analytical, and nonclinical studies.\n\nQ1: How are inspections impacted by COVID-19?\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA has continued, on a case-by-case basis, to conduct mission-critical inspections and other activities to ensure that FDA-regulated pharmaceutical products are meeting applicable FDA requirements.\n\nIn the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA announced that it was temporarily postponing all domestic and foreign routine surveillance facility inspections. Similarly, routine surveillance inspections in support of the Bioresearch Monitoring (BIMO) program were postponed.\n\nBeginning the week of July 20, 2020, FDA resumed prioritized domestic inspections, as described in the FDA statement ""Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA prepares for resumption of domestic inspections with new risk assessment system"" issued on July 10, 2020.4 As explained in this statement, FDA uses its COVID-19 Advisory Rating system to determine what categories of regulatory activity can take place in a given geographic region. Based on this determination, FDA is either continuing, on a case-by-case basis, to conduct only ""mission-critical"" inspections,5 or, where possible to do so safely, resuming prioritized domestic inspections, which generally include preapproval, pre-license, surveillance, and for-cause inspections. For the foreseeable future, prioritized domestic inspections will be pre-announced to FDA-regulated businesses.6 This helps ensure the safety of the investigator and the firm\'s employees, providing the safest possible environment to accomplish FDA\'s regulatory activities, while also ensuring the appropriate staff are on-site to assist FDA staff with inspection activities.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCurrently, certain inspections (e.g., foreign preapproval, surveillance, and for-cause inspections that are not deemed mission-critical) remain temporarily postponed.\n\nWhile inspections that can be conducted by FDA during the public health emergency are limited due to factors including travel restrictions, FDA intends to continue using alternative tools, when appropriate, to evaluate facilities. This includes requesting existing inspection reports from other trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements,7 requesting information from applicants, requesting records and other information directly from facilities and other inspected entities, and conducting remote interactive evaluations8 where appropriate.\n\nFootnote 7: For existing FDA mutual recognition agreements with the European Union and the United Kingdom, this includes the use of official inspection reports issued by a recognized authority for manufacturing facilities located inside and outside the territory of the issuing authority. For more information visit: https://www.fda.gov/international-programs/international-arrangements/mutual-recognition-agreement-mra.\n\nFootnote 8: See FDA guidance for industry Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (April 2021).\n\n2.2.2 What types of inspections would be deemed ""mission-critical""?\n\nA2: FDA\'s assessment of whether an inspection is mission-critical considers many factors related to the public health benefit of U.S. patients having access to the product subject to inspection. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether the product has received breakthrough therapy designation, orphan-drug designation, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation; is included in the Drug Shortage or CBER-Regulated Products Shortage list; is used for critical care or as a medical countermeasure; is used to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a serious disease or medical condition, including COVID-19, for which there is no other appropriate and available treatment. Therefore, for-cause (including follow-up and where a specific drug quality problem or facility issues come to FDA\'s attention), preapproval, and pre-license inspections can be deemed mission-critical. When determining whether to conduct a mission-critical inspection, FDA also takes into account concerns about the safety of its investigators, employees at a site or facility, and where applicable, clinical trial participants and other patients at investigator sites.\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'

If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nOn July 9, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) (Public Law 112-144) was signed into law. Section 707 of FDASIA adds 501(j) to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to deem adulterated a drug that ""has been manufactured, processed, packed, or held in any factory, warehouse, or establishment and the owner, operator, or agent of such factory, warehouse, or establishment delays, denies, or limits an inspection, or refuses to permit entry or inspection."" Section 707(b) of FDASIA requires the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue guidance that defines the circumstances that would constitute delaying, denying, or limiting inspection, or refusing to permit entry or inspection, for purposes of section 501(j).\n\nThis guidance covers facilities that are subject to inspection under section 704 of the FD&C Act.2 This guidance defines the types of actions, inaction, and circumstances that the FDA considers to constitute delaying, denying, or limiting inspection, or refusing to permit entry or inspection for the purposes of section 501(j).3 The examples used in this guidance are not intended to serve as an exhaustive list; rather, they illustrate the most common situations that FDA has encountered in preparing for and conducting inspections as well as situations that FDA anticipates may occur. FDA does not interpret the four terms describing prohibited behavior (delay, deny, limit, refuse) necessarily to be mutually exclusive. Therefore, the behaviorsdescribed in the following scenarios may be examples of more than one type of prohibited behavior. Also note that, for purposes of this guidance, the term facility is intended to include all establishments, factories, and warehouses covered by section 501(j).\n\nSection 704 of the FD&C Act authorizes FDA to conduct inspections at reasonable times, within reasonable limits, and in a reasonable manner. Although the FD&C Act does not specifically define ""reasonable,"" FDA has long maintained that the inspection authority under Section 704 of the FD&C Act ""extends to what is reasonably necessary to achieve the objective of the inspection.""4 FDA intends to work with facilities to conduct inspections and procure the information necessary to achieve the objective of the inspection. FDA will consider reasonable explanations for behavior that may otherwise be considered to be delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing an inspection.\n\nFootnote 4: FDA, Investigations Operations Manual, Section 2.2.1.1, Authority to Enter and Inspect (2014).\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nSection 704(a) of the FD&C Act provides FDA authority for inspections, specifically providing authority for duly designated officers or employees of the FDA to enter, at reasonable times, and inspect, at reasonable times and within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, facilities subject to regulation under the FD&C Act.5 An FDA inspection is a ""careful, critical, official examination of a facility to determine its compliance with certain laws and regulations administered by the FDA.""6 Section 706 of FDASIA amended section 704(a) of the FD&C Actby adding 704(a)(4), which allows FDA to request, in advance of or in lieu of an inspection, within a reasonable timeframe, within reasonable limits, and in a reasonable manner, records or information that FDA may inspect under section 704(a).\n\nFacilities that are required to register under section 510 of the FD&C Act7 and that voluntarily register as outsourcing facilities under section 503B of the FD&C Act8 are required to submit certain information to FDA. FDA uses registration information for many purposes, including scheduling inspections. It is imperative that drug facilities register under section 510 when required, and that all registered facilities provide the information required by statute and our regulations to avoid creating confusion or complicating the scheduling and conduct of inspections. We also strongly encourage facilities to update point of contact e-mail information submitted to the Agency promptly if a change occurs after an annual registration submission.9\n\nFootnote 7: See also 21 C.F.R. 207. For additional information, see Guidance for Industry, Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format – Drug Establishment Registration and Drug Listing.\n\nFootnote 8: In December 2013, FDA issued draft Guidance for Industry, Registration for Human Drug Compounding\n\nFootnote 9: Some facilities subject to inspection under section 704 of the FD&C Act, such as compounding pharmacies, may not be required to register under section 510 because they fall within an exception in section 510(g) and may not have elected to register as outsourcing facilities. Such facilities are not required to provide a point of contact e-mail address to FDA, but the Agency may refer to a point of contact designated in a state license in preparing for inspections or for other purposes, and we therefore encourage such firms to ensure that any point of contact provided in a state license is valid.\n\nIt is a prohibited act under sections 301(e) and 301(f) of the FD&C Act to refuse to permit entry or inspection or refuse to permit access to or copying of certain specified records.10 New section 501(j) of the FD&C Act, as added by FDASIA section 707, now deems a drug to be adulterated if ""...it has been manufactured, processed, packed, or held in any factory, warehouse, or establishment and the owner, operator, or agent of such factory, warehouse, or establishment delays, denies, or limits an inspection, or refuses to permit entry or inspection.""\n\nFootnote 10: Section 301 (21 U.S.C. 331) provides in pertinent part: “The following acts and the causing thereof are hereby prohibited:... (e) The refusal to permit access to or copying of any record as required by section... 704(a).... (f) The refusal to permit entry or inspection as authorized by section 704.” Section 303 (21 U.S.C 333) provides penalties for violations of Section 301.\n\n3 Delay of Inspections\n\nDelays may occur for many reasons, some of which are beyond the control of the facility. However, where an owner, operator, or agent causes the delay of an inspection, this may cause the drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act.\n\n4 Delay Scheduling Pre-announced Inspections\n\nThe FD&C Act does not require FDA to pre-announce its inspections. Therefore, FDA usually does not pre-announce for-cause and routine surveillance inspections. It is, however, FDA\'sgeneral practice to contact the firm before an investigator arrives at the inspection site for pre-approval and pre-license inspections, and most inspections of foreign facilities of drug products. This pre-announcement, although not required, is intended to facilitate the inspection process and ensure that appropriate records and personnel will be made available.\n\nFDA\'s efforts to schedule pre-announced inspections include sending correspondence to the facility\'s point of contact e-mail address, including the facility\'s U.S. agent if the facility is a foreign facility. FDA will make reasonable accommodations for local conditions, such as weather or security situations, holidays, and other non-work days, and, where appropriate, scheduled manufacturing campaigns. Examples of delay in scheduling a pre-announced inspection that may cause drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n--------------------\nContext title: Circumstances that Constitute Delaying, Denying, Limiting, or Refusing a Drug Inspection Guidance for Industry'

FDA uses these inspections to ensure that any facility named or referenced in support of an application can perform the proposed manufacturing operations in conformance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements, to verify conformance with the application, and to confirm that data submitted in the application are accurate and complete.\n\nPost-Approval Inspections (PoAIs): PoAIs focus on a specific drug and changes to its manufacturing operations, the evaluation of process validation, any changes submitted to the application, and the execution of supporting activities according to application commitments and CGMP requirements.\n\nSurveillance Inspections: Surveillance drug quality inspections examine overall operations, including controls that ensure manufacturing processes produce quality drugs, thereby reducing the risk of adulterated or misbranded drugs reaching consumers and patients. FDA uses surveillance inspections to evaluate the CGMP compliance of manufacturing operations. Surveillance inspections are performed at active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product manufacturing facilities, as well as outsourcing facilities that have registered with FDA under section 503B of the FD&C Act.\n\nFollow-Up and Compliance Inspections: When a specific drug quality problem or facility issue comes to FDA\'s attention, we may initiate a follow-up or compliance drug quality inspection. For example, FDA may conduct an inspection to investigate: (1) product safety, effectiveness, or quality concerns arising from defect reports; (2) information provided by an informant about a facility; (3) violata facility that were discovered during the inspection of another facility; or (4) corrective actions undertaken by a facility in response to, for example, a warning letter or regulatory meeting.\n\nBioresearch Monitoring (BIMO) Inspections: The BIMO program is a comprehensive, Agency-wide program of inspections and data audits designed to monitor all aspects of the conduct and reporting of FDA-regulated research. The goals of the BIMO program are to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of research subjects; to verify the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of clinical and nonclinical trial data submitted to FDA; and to assess compliance with FDA\'s regulations governing the conduct of clinical and nonclinical trials, including regulations for informed consent and ethical review, and certain postmarketing requirements.\n\nAppendix A Selecting and Notifying the Facility\n\nFDA will apply risk management methods and tools to determine when to request a facility\'s participation in a remote interactive evaluation. In some cases, FDA may request records or request that a facility participate in a remote interactive evaluation prior to an inspection; this approach could minimize risk associated with conducting inspections during the pandemic by reducing the number of FDA staff who have to travel and by reducing time spent on-site for the inspection. We will not accept requests from applicants or facilities for FDA to perform a remote interactive evaluation. Such decisions depend on many factors and information not always known to applicants or facilities, and it would be too burdensome on all parties to establish a request-based program.\n\nOnce FDA determines that a remote interactive evaluation is appropriate for a particular facility or drug, we will notify the facility and applicant (when appropriate) by electronic correspondence or phone call. We will use the facility\'s registration or application information to identify the facility point of contact or U.S. agent. Correspondence or phone contact will include a request for confirmation of the facility\'s willingness and ability to participate in a remote interactive evaluation, including the use of teleconference, livestream video, and screen sharing of data and documents. The request will indicate the name and address of the facility to be evaluated, the reason for the use of a remote interactive evaluation, and the names of FDA participants, if known.\n\nFollowing a facility\'s agreement to be evaluated remotely, FDA will contact the facility to confirm the point of contact for the remote interactive evaluation, facilitate planning, and determine a facility\'s ability to transfer records and perform remote interactions with FDA staff. FDA will identify the FDA lead for the remote interactive evaluation. FDA will also work with facilities to procure information necessary to plan and coordinate the activities for a remote interactive evaluation. The facility should meet these requests or inform FDA of any challenges in meeting these requests as soon as possible.\n\nDeclining FDA\'s request to perform a remote interactive evaluation could impede our ability to make a timely regulatory decision (e.g., regarding adequacy of a clinical trial used in support of a pending application or adequacy of a drug manufacturing operation described in the application).\n\n1.1.1 Specific Considerations for Pre-Approval and Pre-License Inspections\n\nWhen FDA cannot perform a PAI or PLI, or when we determine it would be useful to supplement a planned inspection, we will consider using tools other than inspection, selecting the most appropriate method to address the specific risks that justify the need for the PAI or PLI. FDA may request a remote interactive evaluation to support an application action if we determine that: (1) remote interaction with the facility will help us assess risks identified during application review; and (2) there are no data integrity or other issues that FDA determines require an inspection.\n\nGenerally, FDA intends to request records and other information under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, before initiating a remote interactive evaluation.\n\n1.1.2 Specific Considerations for Post-Approval Inspections\n\nWhen FDA cannot perform a PoAI, or when we determine it would be useful to supplement a planned inspection, we will consider using tools other than inspection to address the specific risks that justify the need for the PoAI; we may determine that requesting a remote interactive evaluation is an appropriate alternative to conducting an inspection. FDA may request a remote interactive evaluation for PoAIs when: (1) a facility has an acceptable inspection history with no data integrity or other concerns that FDA determines require an inspection; and (2) specific application considerations and CGMP manufacturing risks that warrant a PoAI can be sufficiently assessed through a remote interactive evaluation.\n\n1.1.3 Specific Considerations for Surveillance Inspections\n\nThe prioritization of facilities, domestic and foreign, for remote interactive evaluations will follow the same risk-based approach currently used by FDA for surveillance inspections.8\n\nFootnote 8: See, for example, the risk-based approach described in MAPP 5014.1 Understanding CDER’s Risk-Based Site Selection Model, _available at_https://www.fda.gov/media/118214/download.\n\nA remote interactive evaluation does not constitute an inspection for purposes of section 510(h)(3) of the FD&C Act. However, FDA will use information gathered via a remote interactive evaluation to determine the scope, depth, and timing of a future inspection.\n\n1.1.4 Specific Considerations for Follow-Up and Compliance Inspections\n\nA follow-up or compliance inspection examines operations, records, and other information that relate to the specific issue being addressed (e.g., drug quality control, facility, or manufacturing problem). FDA will determine whether a remote interactive evaluation is appropriate, such as when an inspection cannot be performed due to travel restrictions or to supplement a planned inspection. The use of a remote interactive evaluation will depend on the nature of the facility and the reason for the assignment, including, but not limited to, inspection history and any data integrity concerns.\n\n3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAfter issuance of a warning letter, holding a regulatory meeting, or following an enforcement action (e.g., seizure or injunction), FDA usually will conduct an inspection to confirm that corrective actions have been implemented.\n\nTo evaluate defect reports (e.g., Field Alert Reports or Biological Product Deviation Reports), FDA may request a remote interactive evaluation and/or make a request under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\n3.1.5 Specific Considerations for Bioresearch Monitoring Inspections\n\nSelection of facilities for BIMO inspections is risk based. While some facility selection factors such as inspection history and time since last inspection may be common across BIMO programs, other factors are unique to each BIMO program.\n\nFDA will consider BIMO facilities for remote interactive evaluation according to existing risk-based facility selection methodologies when there are no data integrity or other concerns that FDA determines require an inspection, and information to be evaluated can be accessed remotely. Generally, the information obtained from a remote interactive evaluation will be used to assess the facility\'s conduct, including data reliability and human subject protections to determine the acceptability of BIMO studies for FDA\'s application decision-making.\n\nAppendix B Preparing for a Remote Interactive Evaluation\n\nOnce the facility confirms its willingness and ability to participate in a remote interactive evaluation, FDA will schedule a brief virtual meeting to discuss logistics, responsibilities, and expectations. Discussion topics may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nObjectives and scope of the remote interactive evaluation.\n\nIntroduction of the FDA remote interactive evaluation team and the remote interactive evaluation lead.\n--------------------\nContext title: Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, What types of inspections would be deemed ""mission-critical""?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 81: See 21 CFR 312.57, 312.62, and 812.140.\n\nQ27. Certain clinical trial protocols have an exclusion criterion for receipt of another ""investigational medical product."" If a participant receives a vaccine or other medical product for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 authorized under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), would FDA consider this receipt of an investigational medical product?\n\nWhen a medical product is being used under an EUA, it is an authorized (though not an approved or cleared) medical product for use in clinical care that has met the statutory criteria under section 564 of the FD&C Act. The product is not being studied under an IND or IDE when used pursuant to an EUA, and FDA therefore does not consider receipt under an EUA as receipt of an investigational product.82 In contrast, when the same product is used in a clinical investigation under an IND or IDE, the product\'s safety and/or effectiveness is being studied for investigational uses, and FDA would consider receipt in this situation to be receipt of an investigational product.\n\nAs always in the design of a clinical investigation, there may be valid scientific reasons to have an exclusion (and even a discontinuation) criterion for a medical product--a monoclonal antibody or vaccine, for example--whether that product was used under an EUA or not. These scientific reasons may include risks to an individual if they enroll or continue to participate in a clinical trial after receiving (or having received) the excluded product, or the potential impact of the use of the excluded product on trial objectives, such as confounding the determination of effectiveness of the product under investigation.\n\nQ28.: During the COVID-19 public health emergency some sponsors have used remote monitoring to oversee study conduct at clinical trial sites, including remote review of source data. Should data that have been remotely monitored be re-monitored during an on-site monitoring visit once pandemic-related restrictions that prevented on-site monitoring visits have been lifted?\n\nFDA regulations require sponsors to monitor the conduct and progress of their clinical investigations.83 These regulations are not specific about how sponsors must conduct such monitoring and are therefore compatible with a range of approaches that may vary depending on multiple factors. FDA\'s guidance for industry Oversight of Clinical Investigations - A Risk-Based Approach to Monitoring(August 2013) clarifies that sponsors can use a variety of approaches to fulfill their responsibilities for monitoring clinical investigations; the guidance also describes monitoring activities that reflect modern, risk-based approaches, including remote monitoring when appropriate.\n\nFootnote 83: See 21 CFR 312.50, 312.53(d), 312.56(a), 812.40, 812.43(d), and 812.46.\n\nThe decision as to whether remote monitoring conducted for a given site or clinical investigation was adequate or should be followed up with additional on-site monitoring visits should be based on the sponsor\'s ongoing risk assessment. The sponsor may determine that on-site follow-up of remote monitoring activities is appropriate based on a risk assessment (e.g., sites with certain data anomalies or a higher frequency of errors, important protocol violations, or dropouts relative to other sites). As with on-site monitoring, remote monitoring should be focused on critical data and processes for human subject protection and trial integrity, such as the site\'s conduct of key study procedures and documentation related to important efficacy endpoints and safety assessments.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Institutional Review Boards']","[""FDA's assessment of whether an inspection is mission-critical considers many factors related to the public health benefit of U.S. patients having access to the product subject to inspection. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether the product has received breakthrough therapy designation, orphan-drug designation, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation; is included in the Drug Shortage or CBER-Regulated Products Shortage list; is used for critical care or as a medical countermeasure; is used to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a serious disease or medical condition, including COVID-19, for which there is no other appropriate and available treatment. Therefore, for-cause (including follow-up and where a specific drug quality problem or facility issues come to FDA's attention), preapproval, and pre-license inspections can be deemed mission-critical. When determining whether to conduct a mission-critical inspection, FDA also takes into account concerns about the safety of its investigators, employees at a site or facility, and where applicable, clinical trial participants and other patients at investigator sites.""]",0.94999999997625,0.0

Reference to data published in the literature is not considered sufficient. Validation of storage periods should be performed on QCs that have been stored for a time that is equal to or longer than the study sample storage periods.\n\nStability of the analyte in the studied matrix should be evaluated using low and high concentration QCs. Aliquots of the low and high QCs are analysed at time zero and after the applied storage conditions that are to be evaluated. One bulk QC should be prepared at each concentration level. For each concentration tested, the bulk sample should be divided into a minimum of three aliquots that will be stored, stressed and analysed.\n\nThe QCs are analysed against a calibration curve, obtained from freshly spiked calibration standards in a run with its corresponding freshly spiked QCs or QCs for which stability has been proven. While the use of freshly prepared calibration standards and QCs is the preferred approach, it is recognised that in some cases, for macromolecules, it may be necessary to freeze them overnight. In such cases, valid justification should be provided and freeze-thaw stability demonstrated. QCs should be kept frozen for at least 12 hours between the thawing cycles. The mean concentration at each QC level should be within (\\pm)20% of the nominal concentration.\n\nSince sample dilution may be required for many LBA methods due to a narrow calibration range, the concentrations of the study samples may be consistently higher than the ULOQ of the calibration curve. If this is the case, the concentration of the QCs should be adjusted, considering the applied sample dilution, to represent the actual sample concentration range.\n\nFor fixed dose combination products and specifically labelled drug regimens, the freeze-thaw, bench-top and long-term stability tests of an analyte in matrix should be conducted with the matrix spiked with all of the dosed compounds, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAs mentioned in Section 3.2.8, the investigation of stability should cover bench top (short-term) stability at room temperature or sample preparation temperature and freeze-thaw stability. In addition, long-term stability should be studied.\n--------------------\nContext title: M10_Guideline_Step4_2022_0524'

The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: This guidance intends to facilitate development of drugs in accordance with the principles of the 3Rs (Reduce, Refine, Replace) for animal studies, where valid.\n\n3 Scope (1.3)\n\nThis guidance describes the validation of bioanalytical methods and study sample analysis that are expected to support regulatory decisions. The guidance is applicable to the bioanalytical methods used to measure concentrations of chemical and biological drug(s) and their metabolite(s) in biological samples (e.g., blood, plasma, serum, other body fluids or tissues) obtained in nonclinical toxicokinetic (TK) studies conducted according to the principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), nonclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies conducted as surrogates for clinical studies, and all phases of clinical trials, including comparative bioavailability/bioequivalence (BA/BE) studies, in regulatory submissions. Full method validation is recommended for the primary matrix intended to support regulatory submissions. Additional matrices should be validated as necessary.\n\nFor studies that are not submitted for regulatory approval or not considered for regulatory decisions regarding safety, efficacy, or labeling (e.g., exploratory investigations), applicants may decide on the level of qualification that supports their own internal decision-making.\n\nThe information in this guidance applies to the quantitative analysis by ligand binding assays (LBAs) and chromatographic methods such as liquid chromatography (LC) or gas chromatography (GC), which are typically used in combination with mass spectrometry (MS) detection.\n\nFor studies that are subject to GLP or Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements, the bioanalysis of study samples must conform to those requirements. The bioanalysis of biomarkers and bioanalytical methods used for the assessment of immunogenicity are not within the scope of this guidance.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.\n\nInstead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII General Principles (2)\n\nMethod Development (2.1)\n\nThe purpose of bioanalytical method development is to define the design, operating conditions, limitations, and suitability of the method for its intended purpose and to ensure that the method is ready for validation.\n\nBefore or during the development of a bioanalytical method, the applicant is encouraged to, if feasible, understand the analyte of interest (e.g., the physicochemical properties of the drug, in vitro and in vivo metabolism, preferential distribution between red blood cells and plasma, and protein binding) and consider aspects of any prior analytical methods that may be applicable.\n\nMethod development involves identifying the procedures and conditions involved with quantifying the analyte. Method development can include the characterization of the following bioanalytical elements: reference standards, critical reagents, calibration curve, quality control samples (QCs), selectivity and specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, precision, recovery, stability of the analyte, and minimum required dilution (MRD).\n\nBioanalytical method development does not require extensive record keeping or notation. Once the method has been developed, bioanalytical method validation proves that the method is suited to the analysis of the study samples.\n\nIf a problem is encountered with the method during the analysis of nonclinical or clinical study samples that requires that the analysis be stopped, any changes to the method and the rationale should be documented.\n\nMethod Validation (2.2)\n\nii.2.1 Full Validation (2.2.1)\n\nBioanalytical method validation is important to ensure the acceptability of assay performance and the reliability of analytical results. A bioanalytical method is defined as a set of procedures used for measuring analyte concentrations in biological samples. A full validation of a bioanalytical method should be performed when establishing a bioanalytical method for the quantification of an analyte in clinical and in applicable nonclinical studies. Full validation should also be performed when implementing an analytical method that is reported in the literature and when a commercial kit is repurposed for bioanalytical use in drug development. Usually, one analyte has to be determined, but on occasion it may be appropriate to measure more than one analyte. This may involve two different drugs, a parent drug with its metabolites or the enantiomers or isomers of a drug. In these cases, the principles of validation and analysis apply to all analytes of interest. For chromatographic methods, a full validation should include the following elements, unless otherwise justified: selectivity, specificity, matrix effect, calibration curve (response function), range (lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) to upper limitof quantification (ULOQ)), accuracy, precision, carryover, dilution integrity, stability, and reinjection reproducibility.\n\nFor LBAs, the following elements should be evaluated, unless otherwise justified: specificity, selectivity, calibration curve (response function), range (LLOQ to ULOQ), accuracy, precision, carryover, dilution linearity, and stability. If necessary, parallelism can be conducted when appropriate study samples are available.\n\nThe assessments that are performed during validation should be relevant to the sample analysis workflow. The matrix used for bioanalytical method validation should be the same as the matrix of the study samples, including anticoagulants and additives. In cases in which it may be difficult to obtain an identical matrix to that of the study samples (e.g., rare matrices such as tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, bile or in cases where free drug is measured), surrogate matrices may be acceptable for analytical method validation.\n\nThe choice of surrogate matrix should be scientifically justified. Matrix differences within species (e.g., age, ethnicity, gender) are generally not considered different when validating a method.\n\nA specific, detailed, written description of the bioanalytical method and validation procedure should be established a priori. This description may be in the form of a protocol, study plan, report, notebook, or Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).\n\nii.1.2 Partial Validation (2.2.2)\n\nModifications to a fully validated analytical method may be evaluated by partial validation.\n\nPartial validation can range from as little as one accuracy and precision determination to a nearly full validation (refer to section VI.A (6.1)). The items in a partial validation should be determined according to the extent and nature of the changes made to the method.\n\nii.1.3 Cross Validation (2.2.3)\n\nCross validation is required to demonstrate how the reported data are related when multiple bioanalytical methods and/or multiple bioanalytical laboratories are involved (refer to section VI.B (6.2)).\n\nIII Chromatography (3)\n\nReference Standards (3.1)\n\nDuring method validation and the analysis of study samples, a blank biological matrix is spiked with the analyte(s) of interest using solutions of reference standard(s) to prepare calibration standards and QCs. Calibration standards and QCs should be prepared from separate stock solutions. However, calibration standards and QCs may be prepared from the same stock solution provided the accurate preparation and stability of the stock solution should have been verified.\n\nA suitable internal standard (IS) should be added to all calibration standards, QCs, and study samples during sample processing. The absence of an IS should be justified.\n\nIt is important that the reference standard is well characterized and the quality (e.g., purity, identity) of the reference standard and the suitability of the IS is ensured, as the quality will affect the outcome of the analysis and, therefore, the study data. The reference standard used during validation and study sample analysis should be obtained from an authentic and traceable source. The reference standard should be identical to the analyte. If this is not possible, an established form (e.g., salt or hydrate) of known quality should be used.\n\nSuitable reference standards include compendial standards, commercially available standards or sufficiently characterized standards prepared in-house or by an external organization. A certificate of analysis (CoA) or an equivalent alternative is recommended to ensure quality and to provide information on the purity, storage conditions, retest/expiration date and batch number of the reference standard.\n\nA CoA is not required for the IS as long as the suitability for use is demonstrated, e.g., a lack of analytical interference is shown for the substance itself or any impurities thereof.\n\nWhen MS detection is used, the use of the stable isotope-labeled analyte as the IS is recommended whenever possible. However, it is important that the labeled standard is of high isotope purity and that no isotope exchange reaction occurs. The presence of unlabeled analyte should be checked and if unlabeled analyte is detected, the potential influence should be evaluated during method validation.\n\nStock and working solutions should only be prepared from reference standards that are within the stability period as documented in the CoA (either expiration date or the retest date).\n\nValidation (3.2)\n\nSelectivity (3.2.1)\n\nSelectivity is the ability of an analytical method to differentiate and measure the analyte in the presence of potential interfering substances in the blank biological matrix.\n--------------------\nContext title: M10 Bioanalytical Method Validation and Study Sample Analysis""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: No, heroic measures need not be taken. Storage conditions should be consistent with the knowledge of the stability of the mixture under conditions of use and reasonable so as not to permit accelerated decomposition.\n\nWhat are the details of the Agency\'s reserve sample retention policy?\n\nWith regard to reserve sample retention, the GLPs provide as follows:\n\nReserve samples are to be retained from each batch of test and control article prepared in accord with section 58.105(a) for all nonclinical laboratory studies lasting more than 4 weeks. For the purposes of these sections, the 4-week period includes initial dosing to the final in vivo observations. Only sufficient sample need be retained to permit meaningful reanalysis. The samples need be retained either for the terms specified in section 58.105 or for the useful life of the sample (dependent on the stability or the quality of the sample) whichever is shorter. Storage conditions should be those commonly accepted as minimizing the deterioration of sample quality and need not require exhaustive study to determine those which maximize stability. All batches of test and control article mixtures are to be retained even if they are prepared daily.\n\nFor medical devices, how can stability be demonstrated any more effectively than by the continued functioning of a device within specifications during an in vivo nonclinical study?\n\nThe stated procedure is acceptable.\n\nThe cost of chemical assay development and assay of dosage forms prior to conducting acute studies far exceeds the cost of doing the experiment. Will data confirming the weighing, mixing and administration of the test article be considered sufficient?\n\nNo. The test article must be sufficiently characterized to ensure that the same article is used in any further studies.\n\nDoes FDA expect a firm to conduct long-term stability tests on test article-carrier mixtures, which are used within a day of preparation?\n\nThe firm must determine the stability of the mixtures over the period of their use. The GLPs require retention of samples of all batches of test article-carrier mixtures for studies that last longer than 4 weeks. The regulations do not require stability studies on such samples. Samples placed in storage may be analyzed periodically to determine their useful storage life.\n\nAm I correct in assuming that the chemical testing done by the sponsor to characterize the test article is not covered by the GLPs when the test article is subsequently submitted to a contract laboratory as a blind sample for safety testing?\n\nThe GLPs do not cover the basic exploratory chemical tests done to derive the specifications of the test article. They do cover those chemical tests done on discrete batches of test article to determine identity, strength, purity and composition.\n\nDoes the phrase ""mixtures of articles and carriers"" also refer to solutions and suspensions, e.g., a solution of a test article in distilled water?\n\nYes.\n\nFor acute studies, is it necessary for the laboratory to analyze each batch of test article-carrier mixture prior to dosing the test system?\n\nNo. Uniformity of the mixture must be known and periodic batch analyses need to be done.\n\nWill dialogues such as this and recent inspectional experience bring about substantive changes in the final regulations through FDA initiated proposed amendments? Whatchanges are anticipated in the reserve sample retention requirements?\n\nThe Agency does not believe the initiative to change the GLPs rests with FDA. Petitions for change may be submitted to the Agency in accord with the 21 CFR 10.30. As was mentioned at the meeting, the Agency recognizes that the reserve sample retention requirements are extensive and expensive and a petition for change would be considered.\n10. What guidelines can be used by a laboratory or sponsor in deciding how frequently concentration analyses should be made?\n\nThe Agency has not established guidelines with regard to the frequency of periodic reanalysis of test article-carrier mixtures. Enough batches should be analyzed to assure that the test systems are being exposed to the quantities of test article in the specified protocol.\n11. How long must one retain samples of feed used in nonclinical laboratory studies and should they be frozen?\n\nThe sample retention period differs for the various regulated products and the periods are listed in section 58.195. Feed samples need not be frozen for storage.\n12. What is the definition of carrier?\n\nCarrier is the material with which the test article is mixed for administration to the test system. It can be feed, water, solvents and excipients depending on dosage form and route of administration.\n13. Once stability of a given concentration of a test article-carrier mixture is substantiated, is it necessary to establish a stability profile for each batch at that concentration?\n\nNo. Stability need be determined only on a single batch of test article-carrier mixture; however, periodic reanalysis to determine concentration must be done.\n14. In the course of a 14-C tissue residue study in the target animal, is it necessary to retain:\n\nAll samples listed in a - d and f above should be retained for the term listed in section 58.195.\n\na. sample of the 14-C labeled drug,\n\nb. samples of the diet fed control and experimental animals,\n\nc. samples of urine and feces after completion of the analyses,d. samples of collected tissues after completion of the analyses, e. if they must be retained, for how long? f. is similar sample retention necessary when doing ""cold"" tissue residue studies in target animals?\n15. If a battery of different tests on a substance is being conducted by different contractors, is it necessary to run replicate stability analyses from each and every contractor especially when long-term stability has been documented for the substance?\n\nNo. Once stability has been determined in accord with good science, it is not necessary to continually replicate the stability determination.\n\n58.120 Protocol\n\n58.130 Conduct of a Nonclinical Laboratory Study\n\nIn as much as only wet tissues, blocks and slides are necessary to reconstruct the histopathologic aspects of a study by a third party, are written notes, tapes, etc. of the histopathological\'s thought process in arriving at a final report legitimately considered ""raw data"" in the presence of a signed and dated final report? Does the Agency have the right to inspect the written notes from the pathologist?\n\nRaw data in this case, refers only to the signed and dated final report of the pathologist. Agency investigators may wish to examine the interim notes and reports in an attempt to reconstruct the study but not to second-guess the scientific process used to arrive at the final report. The GLPs do not require that these interim reports and notes be retained.\n2. What is considered to be raw data in computer systems when the data is generated from dictated results?\n\nTranscribed dictation, which has been proofread and corrected for typographical -and transcription errors, is raw data.\n3. Do the GLPs require that the protocol be amended to reflect the actual starting date of the study?\n\nYes, this is a critical piece of information, which should be supplied by way of a formal protocol amendment.\n\nIt is said that raw data may be any verified exact copy of the original data. In a computerized data system where data is put directly on disc thence to tape, what documentation of the program performing this transfer is required to assure that the tape copy is exact? The standard operating procedures, which cover computer operations, should describe the computer program and the procedure used to assure the production of an exact tape copy.\n\nIf reformatting of data is done as part of the transfer described in question 4 above, is the new file not raw data even if all data is transferred intact although in a different organization? The Agency can not precisely answer this question without further details of the new data format.\n\nAre initials and dates on data printouts (e.g., scintillation counters, gas chromatographs), when these printouts include standards, sufficient documentation for standardization? Yes.\n\nIs there a time limit for submission of the final report of a nonclinical laboratory study after its conclusion? Generally no. On occasion, for marketed products, the Agency may establish time frames for study conduct. Of course alarming findings on marketed products should be reported as soon as possible.\n\nIs it permissible to list changes in a final report on a page, which is appended, to the original final report? Yes.\n\nDoes ""studies in progress on June 20, 1979"" refer to the phase of dosing of the test system or the phase post-dosing but not yet reported? The quotation pertains to all studies for which the final report has not yet been completed. Included are all post-dosing phases.\n\nThe final report requires a list of participants. Should this include technicians as well as people who perform support functions?The final report should include the name of the study director, the names of other scientists or professionals, and the names of all supervisory personnel involved in the study.\n\nWhen an analysis protocol is developed for the first time by using standard scientific technique, who shall validate the protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: Minimum Required Dilution\n\nMRD is a dilution factor employed in samples that are diluted with buffer solution to reduce the background signal or matrix interference on the analysis using LBA. The MRD should be identical for all samples including calibration standards and the QCs and it should be determined during method development. If MRD is changed after establishment of the method, partial validation is necessary. MRD should be defined in the Validation Report of the analytical method.\n\nCommercial and Diagnostic Kits\n\nCommercial or diagnostic kits (referred to as kits) are sometimes co-developed with new chemical or biological drugs for point-of-care patient diagnosis. The recommendations in this section of the guideline do not apply to the development of kits that are intended for point-of-care patient diagnosis (e.g., companion or complimentary diagnostic kits). Refer to the appropriate guideline documents regarding regulatory expectations for the development of these kits.\n\nIf an applicant repurposes a kit (instead of developing a new method) or utilises ""research use only"" kits to measure chemical or biological drug concentrations during the development of a novel drug, the applicant should assess the kit validation to ensure that it conforms to the drug development standards described in this guideline.\n\nValidation considerations for kit assays include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nIf the reference standard in the kit differs from that of the study samples, testing should evaluate differences in assay performance of the kit reagents. The specificity, accuracy, precision and stability of the kit assay should be demonstrated under actual conditions ofuse in the facility conducting the sample analysis. Modifications from kit processing instructions should be completely validated.\n\nKits that use sparse calibration standards (e.g., one- or two-point calibration curves) should include in-house validation experiments to establish the calibration curve with a sufficient number of standards across the calibration range.\n\nActual QC concentrations should be known. Concentrations of QCs expressed as ranges are not sufficient for quantitative applications. In such cases QCs with known concentrations should be prepared and used, independent of the kit-supplied QCs.\n\nCalibration standards and QCs should be prepared in the same matrix as the study samples. Kits with calibration standards and QCs prepared in a matrix different from the study samples should be justified and appropriate experiments should be performed.\n\nIf multiple kit assay lots are used within a study, lot-to-lot variability and comparability should be addressed for any critical reagents included in the kits.\n\nIf a kit using multiple assay plates is employed, sufficient replicate QCs should be used on each plate to monitor the accuracy of the assay. Acceptance criteria should be established for the individual plates and for the overall analytical run.\n--------------------\nContext title: M10_Guideline_Step4_2022_0524'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: When the tonicity of a product is declared in its labeling, the manufacturing process should be appropriately controlled to assure that the osmolality of every batch will conform to labeled osmolality. Osmolality determined during development and validation might be sufficient to justify not performing testing of every batch. This data should be submitted in the application.\nQ60: When is it necessary to dilute final product to meet the concentration specification? Is there a preference to use sterile water, normal saline, or half normal saline?\n\nNormal saline is the most commonly used agent to maintain the isotonicity of the final drug product. However, you may use any of the three named diluents. Justification should be provided if an isotonic product cannot be formulated. In addition, for ANDA products, the diluent used should be the same as the diluent used in the RLD for which the ANDA is being submitted.\nQ61: What are FDA\'s expectations on handling invalid tests and sample size for repeat testing?\n\nUnder 21 CFR part 212, it is acceptable to repeat a test that failed the first time if a mistake or error was made in the first attempt to test (i.e., the test was truly invalid). It is not acceptable to simply retest with a new sample because of a failing result; true out-of-specification results must be investigated to determine the cause of the failure to meet the specifications, and corrections must be implemented as appropriate. If a repeat test is appropriate, the sample size depends on what parameter is being tested and should be chosen to ensure the test results are representative of the characteristics of the batch.\nQ62: Does FDA have current information about drug master files (DMFs) that might apply to PET?\n\nPET producers should contact their suppliers to determine whether they have a DMF on file with the FDA. FDA does not provide a list of DMFs that are available for reference. For further information about DMFs, see FDA Manual of Policies and Procedures (MAPPs) on DMF files, available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ManualofPoliciesProcedures/ucm079564.pdf. You can also direct any specific DMF questions to\n\ndmfquestion@cder.fda.gov.\n\nApplicants that plan to rely on one or more DMFs should provide a letter of authorization from the DMF holder that gives the ANDA or NDA applicant the right to reference the DMF and for FDA to refer to the DMF in its review of the application in the ANDA or NDA.\nQ63: Is notification to the FDA required for replacement of quality control equipment (e.g., gas chromatography (GC), HPLC, or dose calibrator)Replacement of quality control equipment is managed under the facility\'s quality system and should be qualified for installation, operation, and performance; therefore, notification is not necessary. However, any change in the analytical method should be reported in accordance with 21 CFR 314.70.\n* Does a change in precursor require submission of a supplement? Yes. The submission should be made under 21 CFR 314.70(b).\n* Does a change in container closure system require submission of a supplement? Yes. The submission should be made under 21 CFR 314.70.\n* Does a change in the vendor of inactive ingredients or other auxiliary materials require submission of a supplement? No, these are reported in the annual report.\n\nv.2.2 Stability Testing\n\nContent and Format for NDAs and ANDAs (the PET drug applications guidance) states that quality control needs to be done for three qualification batches at the highest concentration allowed. Upon how many batches are we required to perform stability testing?_** You should conduct stability testing of three batches. For more information, see Attachment I of the PET drug applications guidance titled ""Sample Formats\n\nChemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) Section.""5 Footnote 5: Available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM078740.pdf.\n\nDoes stability testing need to be performed on each vial size, for example, 30 mL and 50 mL, if the components are identical? We recommend that you choose the highest vial size (i.e., the 50 mL size in the example). In some cases, multiple presentations might need to be tested (e.g., if the headspace oxygen-to-surface ratio differs significantly).\n\nAre we required to perform forced degradation studies with these short shelf life drugs?For the commonly used PET drugs (e.g., FDG, Ammonia N13, Sodium Fluoride F18), where the storage and other molecular stability characteristics under different conditions have been well defined in the scientific literature, forced degradation studies are not needed when an NDA or ANDA is submitted.\n\nFor new PET drugs, the molecular stability and storage conditions under certain stress conditions (e.g., photo-stability, pH dependant stability) might need to be evaluated and described in the application. The need for this testing should be discussed with the review division during product development (e.g., at the End of Phase-2 meeting). During inspection, the inspector may inspect the source data.\nQ70: Assuming that product stability is demonstrated, is there any limit to expiry of the product?\n\nThe stability data should support the proposed expiration dating period. These data are submitted in the application for which the expiration dating period is approved. The individual batch used may expire earlier than the approved expiration dating period. It is expected that the product will be used before its specified expiry.\n\nv.2.3 Sterility Testing\n\nQ71: With respect to sterility testing, what are the requirements for the sample hold time validation and expected storage conditions during hold time?\n\nSterility testing can begin 30 hours after manufacture without further justification.\n\nDelays beyond this time need to be justified and shown to be valid (i.e., that contamination, if present, would result in growth). Samples are to be stored appropriately during the extended hold time; the hot cell might be appropriate for storage.\nQ72: Would the air quality requirement still hold if the sterility inoculations were performed in Hungate tubes, which is generally performed within the hot cell environment, not a laminar flow environment?\n\nWe recommend that sterility tests be performed in a Class 100 environment so there is no risk of environmental contamination. However, we do understand if the sterility testing has to be performed in a hot cell because of the nature of the product.\n\nC. Current Good Manufacturing Practices\n\nQ73: Are there specific guidances for the qualification of vendors that would guide us in selecting components and establishing standards for vendor compliance?No guidance on this topic is presently available.\n\nQ74: FDA recently issued the guidance PET Drugs - Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) (Small Entity Compliance Guide) that appears to be identical to the guidance issued in December 2009. Is there a definition of small entity? Does the August 2011 version differ from the version dated December 2009?_\n\nThere are no substantive differences between the Small Entity Compliance Guide and the guidance published in December 2009. The Small Entity Compliance Guide on Drug CGMPs was prepared to comply with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121). The Act states the following:\n\nFor each rule or group of related rules for which an agency is required to prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis under section 605(b) of title 5, United States Code, the agency shall publish 1 or more guides to assist small entities in complying with the rule and shall entitle such publications ""small entity compliance guides.""\n\nA definition for small entity can be found in section 211 of the Act.\nQ75: Is identity testing on mannose triflate required? If required, does it need to be a specific identity test?\n\nAlthough an identity test on incoming components is required to be performed, a specific identity test is not needed under certain conditions (see 21 CFR 212.40(c). When the finished-product testing of a PET drug product includes testing to ensure that the correct components have been used, the PET drug producer need only determine that each lot of incoming components complies with written specifications by examining a certificate of analysis provided by the supplier (21 CFR 212.40(c)(1)(i)). We believe that the use of this type of finished-product testing makes specific identity testing of components redundant and unnecessary. For example, when identity of the F18 radionuclide is established as part of the finished-product testing and the method of production used is well-documented and understood, it can be reasonably argued that the component that yields this radionuclide is likely to be O 18 water. In this case, a specific identity test for O 18 water is not necessary before the lot is used in production. Similarly, a specific identity test before using a lot of mannose triflate might be redundant and unnecessary when (1) a well-understood method of synthesis of FDG is used, (2) a test to confirm the radiochemical identity is performed in the finished drug product, and (3) the mannose triflate was obtained from a reliable supplier with whom a relationship has been previously established and is accompanied by a certificate of analysis.\n\nWhat is FDA\'s current thinking on conditional final release testing if there was a problem or malfunction? Under the CGMP regulations at 21 CFR 212.70, you may not release another batch of the PET product until you have corrected the problem concerning the malfunction of analytical equipment. A reserve sample is needed to complete the finished product testing.\n\n*Which analytical techniques, if any, require validation?\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Oversight of PET Drug Products -- Questions and Answers'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: When several analytes are assayed simultaneously, there should be one calibration curve for each analyte studied. If an analytical run is acceptable for one analyte but has to be rejected for another analyte, the data for the accepted analyte should be used. The determination of the rejected analyte requires re-extraction and analysis only for the analyte that is reanalysed. Only data for this reanalysed analyte needs to be reported.\n\nThe back-calculated concentrations of the calibration standards and QCs of passed and accepted runs should be reported. The overall (between-run) accuracy and precision of the QCs of all accepted runs should be calculated at each concentration level and reported in the analytical report (Refer to Section 8 Documentation and Table 1). If the overall mean accuracy and/or precision fails the 15% criterion, an investigation to determine the cause of the deviation should be conducted. In the case of comparative BA/BE studies, it may result in the rejection of the data.\n\n3.3.3 Calibration Range\n\nIf a narrow range of analyte concentrations of the study samples is known or anticipated before the start of study sample analysis, it is recommended to either narrow the calibration curve range, adapt the concentrations of the QCs, or add new QCs at different concentration levels as appropriate, to adequately reflect the concentrations of the study samples.\n\nAt the intended therapeutic dose(s), if an unanticipated clustering of study samples at one end of the calibration curve is encountered after the start of sample analysis, the analysis should be stopped and either the standard calibration range narrowed (i.e., partial validation), existing QC concentrations revised, or QCs at additional concentrations added to the original curve within the observed range before continuing with study sample analysis. It is not necessary to reanalyse samples analysed before optimising the calibration curve range or QC concentrations.\n\nThe same applies if a large number of the analyte concentrations of the study samples are above the ULOQ. The calibration curve range should be changed, if possible, and QC(s) added or their concentrations modified. If it is not possible to change the calibration curve range or the number of samples with a concentration above the ULOQ is not large, samples should be diluted according to the validated dilution method.\n\nAt least 2 QC levels should fall within the range of concentrations measured in study samples. If the calibration curve range is changed, the bioanalytical method should be revalidated (partial validation) to verify the response function and to ensure accuracy and precision.\n\n3.3.4 Reanalysis of Study Samples\n--------------------\nContext title: M10_Guideline_Step4_2022_0524']","['The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.']",0.99999999995,0.3333333333333333
23,"Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel?","['--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: The ""Supplement Facts"" nutrition information (referred to as a panel) must be enclosed in a box by using hairlines. The title, ""Supplement Facts,"" must be larger than all other print in the panel and, unless impractical, must be set full width of the panel. The title and all headings must be bolded to distinguish them from other information.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n36. How must I present the information in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n\nYou must present all information using the following:\n\na. A single easy-to-read type style;\n\nb. All black or one color type, printed on a white or neutral contrasting background, whenever practical;3. Upper- and lowercase letters, except that you may use all uppercase lettering on small packages (i.e., packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches); d. At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text); and e. Letters that do not touch.\n37. What are the type size requirements for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n\nExcept as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must set information other than the title, headings, and footnotes in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. You also must use a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label for the title ""Supplement Facts."" You may set the column headings and footnotes in type no smaller than 6 point type. See the section on ""Special Labeling Provisions"" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nMust I use hairlines in the Supplement Facts panel?\n\nExcept for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must use a hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text to separate each dietary ingredient from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it. FDA has provided an exception for certain packages with space constraints. See the section on ""Special Labeling Provisions"" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nHow closely must I follow the ""Examples of graphic enhancements used by the FDA"" in appendix B to Part 101?\n\nYou are not required to follow Appendix B to Part 101. Appendix B and its specifications are a model, which FDA has suggested in the interest of uniformity of presentation. For example, 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(i) requires the use of an ""easy-to-read"" type style, not specifically Helvetica type, as suggested in Appendix B.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)(9)\n\nHow do I provide nutrition labeling when my product contains two or more packets of supplements (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening)?\n\nYou may present the information for each packet (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening) in an individual nutrition label or you may use an aggregate nutrition label. For two packets, this would consist of five columns. List all of the dietary ingredients in the first column. List the amounts and percents of the morning packet in the second and third columns and similar information for the evening packet in the fourth and fifth columns (see the illustration of aggregate nutrition labeling in 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iii)).\n\nCompliance\n\nWhat kind of samples will FDA collect to determine compliance with 21 CFR 101.36?\n\nFDA will collect a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller. FDA will randomly select these packages.\n\nWhat if it is not technically feasible for me to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements?\n\nFDA may permit you to use an alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9). If your firm needs such special allowances, you must make your request in writing to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(f)(2)\n\nMust dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?\n\nFor dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value.\n\nExemptions\n\nWhat are the circumstances in which my dietary supplement products would be exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements? Your dietary supplement product is not required to have a ""Supplement Facts"" panel if: a. Your firm is a small business that has not more than $50,000 gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers or not more than $500,000 per year from total sales in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1); b. You sell less than 100,000 units of the product annually, your firm has fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(2) andyou file an annual notification with FDA as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(18)(iv); or c. You ship the product in bulk form, do not distribute it to consumers in such form, and you supply it for use in the manufacture of other dietary supplements in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(3). The two exemptions for small businesses and low-volume products (a. and b. above) are available to you only if your products\' labels bear no claims or other nutrition information.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(h)(1) - (3)\n\nSpecial Labeling Provisions\n\nWhat are small packages?\n\nSmall packages are those packages having less than 12 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)\n\nWhat is the telephone provision for small packages?\n\nIn lieu of a ""Supplement Facts"" panel, you may print labels for small packages with a telephone number or address that consumers can use to obtain nutrition information. You may use a telephone number or an address in place of the ""Supplement Facts"" panel only if you place no claims or other nutrition information on the product label.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size that I may use for small packages?\n\nYou may use a type size no smaller than 4-5 point for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on the labels of small packages.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(i)\n\nMay I use a tabular or linear format for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on a small package?\n\nYes. You may use a tabular format on small packages. You also may present ""Supplement Facts"" information in a linear (i.e., string) fashion if the label will not accommodate the ""Supplement Facts"" panel in a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j) (13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display.)\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n\nWhat are intermediate-sized packages?\n\nIntermediate-sized packages are those packages having from 12 to 40 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(ii)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size for intermediate-sized packages?The ""Supplement Facts"" panel on the labels of intermediate-sized packages must use type size no smaller than 6 point, except that type no smaller than 4-5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches that list more than 16 dietary ingredients. Also, 4-5 point type may be used on packages with less than 20 square inches that list more than 8 dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the type size used in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on an inner container may be as small as needed to accommodate all required information if the ""Supplement Facts"" on the outer container meets these type size requirements.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv)\n51. May I use a tabular or linear format for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on an intermediate-sized package? You may use a tabular format on an intermediate-sized package if the package shape or size cannot accommodate vertical columns. You may use a linear format if the label will not accommodate a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n52. May I abbreviate on the labels of intermediate- sized packages? You may use the abbreviations in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B) in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel for small and intermediate-sized packages, e.g, ""Serv size"" for ""Serving Size"" and ""Servings"" for ""Servings Per Container.""\n\n21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B)\n53. Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016 (81 FR 33742), FDA (we) published a final rule entitled ""Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels"" (""the final rule""). The final rule amends the labeling regulations for conventional foods and dietary supplements to provide updated nutrition information on the label to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices and set a compliance date of July 26, 2018, for manufacturers with $10 million or more in annual food sales, and July 26, 2019, for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales. We subsequently extended the compliance dates to January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021, respectively (83 FR 19619). We have prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28). This guidance document restates in plain language the revisions made in the final rule and is intended to help small entities comply with the requirements established in 21 CFR 101.9, 101.30, and 101.36.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in our guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nIn the remainder of this guidance, ""you"" and ""I"" refer to food manufacturers that are subject to the rule. Many answers in this guidance are followed by citations to show where a specific requirement can be found in either the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) or Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nII Who Is Subject to the Rule?\n\nYou are subject to the rule if you manufacture food that is subject to our nutrition labeling requirements. The nutrition labeling requirements apply to both conventional foods under 21 CFR 101.9(a) and dietary supplements under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(6).\n\nIII What Foods Are Covered by the Rule?\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for the General Food Supply?\n\nYes. Foods for the general food supply are foods eaten by persons 4 years of age and older.\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for Infants and Young Children 1 Through 3 Years of Age?\n\nYes. Foods, other than infant formula, represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age are subject to nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(j)(5)(i)). Manufacturers of foods represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months and/or children 1 through 3 years of age must use the Reference Daily Intakes (RDIs) and Daily Reference Values (DRVs) that are specified for this intended group when calculating percent Daily Values (DVs) for labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)). The previous categories of ""infants"" (or ""infants 7 to 12 months"") and ""children less than 4 years"" have been changed to ""infants through 12 months"" and ""children 1 through 3 years of age"" throughout 21 CFR 101.9.\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for Pregnant Women and Lactating Women?\n\nYes. Manufacturers of foods represented or purported to be specifically for pregnant women and lactating women must use the RDIs and DRVs that are specified for this intended group when calculating percent DVs for labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)).\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Dietary Supplements?\n\nYes. Section 201(f) of the FD&C Act defines ""food"" as: ""(1) articles used for food or drink for man or other animals, (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article."" Further, section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act explains that dietary supplements are deemed to be foods within the meaning of the FD&C Act except for the purposes of sections 201(g) (definition of ""drug"") and 417 (reportable food registry) of the FD&C Act. Nutrition labeling information for food must be provided for all products intended for human consumption and offered for sale, unless an exemption is provided (21 CFR 101.9(a)). As dietary supplements fall under the definition of ""food,"" they are therefore subject to nutrition labeling. Specific nutrition labeling requirements and guidelines for dietary supplements can be found in 21 CFR 101.36.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNaturally-occurring sugars found in whole fruits and vegetables or dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them.\n\nThe amount of added sugars declared on the label should never exceed the amount of total sugars on the label.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(i) Do Honey, Maple Syrup, and Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n\nIn the Federal Register of June 20, 2019 (84 FR 28726), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled ""The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products,"" which provides clarity on the labeling of added sugars for such products (Ref. 1). In that guidance, we discuss section 12516 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (""the Farm Bill""), which states that the food labeling requirements cannot require the declaration ""Includes Xg Added Sugars"" in a serving of these single-ingredient products. While these products are not required to have this declaration of the gram amount of added sugars, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet, so the percent DV for added sugars must still be included consistent with 21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii). We stated that we intend to exercise enforcement discretion by permitting the use of the ""+"" symbol immediately following the percent DV declaration for added sugars on packages and containers of single-ingredient sugars and syrups. This symbol would lead to a footnote inside the Nutrition Facts label, explaining the amount of added sugars that one serving of the product contributes to the diet, as well as the contribution of a serving of the product toward the percent DV for added sugars. This symbol and footnote are not required; however, we encourage you to use them.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(ii) Do Added Sugars in Dried Cranberry Products and Cranberry Beverage Products Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: When determining whether labels need to be in compliance with the new requirements, should the determination as to whether my company has $10 million or more in annual food sales be based on domestic food sales or total food sales, including international sales, and how many years of sales should I consider? To determine whether a company has $10 million or more in annual food sales, a firm can either take the smallest sales volume from the previous three years (e.g., 2013, 2014, and 2015), or alternately the firm can take the average of the previous three years sales volume. A firm\'s total (domestic plus international) food sales best reflects the firm\'s resources and, thus, ability to comply with the final rules by the applicable compliance date.\n\nAre there certain approved companies or nutrition databases that manufacturers can use to get the nutrition values for their products? FDA does not approve nutrition databases. However, the United States Department of Agriculture provides nutrition information for a number of foods, and there are also several commercially available nutrition databases you can use to determine nutrition values for your products.\n\nWho is responsible for the accuracy of the Nutrition Facts label on a food product\'s label? Who is responsible for maintaining the records needed to verify the accuracy of certain nutrient declarations, including where a firm may perform operations that include those of an ingredient supplier, a manufacturer of a finished food sold under their own brand name, and/or a labeler that labels the product under the firm\'s or another firm\'s brand name? The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits a person from introducing or delivering for introduction, or causing the delivery or introduction, into interstate commerce a misbranded food (21 U.S.C. 331(a)). For example, a supplier has responsibility to ensure that the information about the amount of a nutrient in an ingredient it sells to a manufacturer is accurate, where there is no suitable analytical method available that the manufacturer can use to measure the nutrient\'s quantity. The manufacturer has responsibility for the accuracy of the nutrient declarations on the label of its food and a manufacturer generally would receive information from its supplier about the amount of the nutrient in the ingredient to ensure the accuracy of the nutrient declaration on the finished food. A distributor that purchases a finished food and then labels the product under its own brand name has responsibility for the accuracy of its food label. Such a distributor also generally would receive information from its supplier (the manufacturer) about the amount of the nutrient in the finished food product to ensure the accuracy of the nutrient declaration on the finished food. Food manufacturers must make and keep records to support certain nutrient declarations on their product labels (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). The recordkeeping requirements specified in 21 CFR 101.9(g), are only for foods for which Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) International or other reliable and appropriate analytical methods are not available (81 FR 33742 at 33775). The manufacturer of a finished food must make and keep records to support nutrient declarations, as required by 21 CFR 101.9(g)(10) and to make the recordsavailable during an inspection. The manufacturer would be expected to have information from its ingredient supplier if an ingredient contains a nutrient added by the supplier for which there is no suitable analytical method available that the manufacturer can use to measure the nutrient\'s quantity. In such a case, the amount of the nutrient added may be known only to the supplier. In situations where we inspect a distributor that distributes a product labeled under its own brand name, and that product includes a nutrient for which there is no suitable analytical method available to measure the nutrient\'s quantity, we intend to ask the distributor to provide information from the manufacturer that supports the nutrient declaration on the distributor\'s label for product the distributor introduced, or delivered for introduction, into interstate commerce. Without such information, it is not clear how a distributor could ensure its labeled nutrient declarations do not misbrand its product.\n\nHow does FDA intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to mandatory nutrition labeling for bottled water products and coffee beans (whole or ground), tea leaves, plain unsweetened coffee and tea, commitment-type dehydrated vegetables, flavor extracts, and food colors that would have been exempt under SS 101.9(j)(4) prior to the effective date of the Nutrition Facts label final rule? FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion (i.e., we intend to refrain from taking regulatory or compliance actions) against bottled water products and coffee beans (whole or ground), tea leaves, plain unsweetened coffee and tea, commitment-type dehydrated vegetables, flavor extracts, and food colors that would have been exempt under SS 101.9(j)(4) with respect to mandatory labeling prior to the effective date of the Nutrition Facts label final rule if these products do not meet the new requirements. We intend to engage in future rulemaking to address issues of mandatory nutrition labeling of these products.\n\nIV Questions and Answers on Added Sugars\n\nWhat is the definition of added sugars? We defined added sugars in the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33980) as sugars that are either added during the processing of foods, or are packaged as such. (e.g., a bag of sugar). Added sugars include sugars (free, mono- and disaccharides), sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. Added sugars do not include fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers, e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate. In addition, added sugars do not include fruit or vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under SS 101.30 or for Brix standardization under SS 102.33(g)(2) of this chapter (refers to SS 101). We also do not include fruit juice concentrates which are used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, or preserves in accordance with the standard of identities set forth in SSS 150.140 and 150.160 of this chapter, or the fruit component of fruit spreads as added sugars.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n2. How do I determine how much added sugars are in a serving of my product? Is there a formula or calculator that I can use?\n\nThe amount of added sugars in a serving of a product can be determined by a number of different methods. It is up to the manufacturer to determine which ingredients provide sugars that meet the definition of added sugars. Manufacturers are in the best position, given their knowledge of their supply chain and production practices, to determine what method is most suitable for determining the added sugars declaration. We do not have a specific formula or calculator that must be used for determining the amount of added sugars in a finished food product.\n\nGenerally, the amount of added sugars in a serving of a product can be determined by examining the ingredients used to formulate the product. Some ingredients themselves (e.g., sugar, corn syrup, or honey) meet the definition of ""added sugars."" Other ingredients may contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars that must also be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration (e.g. semi-sweet chocolate chips, sweetened dried fruit, or flavorings). Manufacturers may need to work with their suppliers to determine the amount of free mono- and disaccharides in ingredients used in a food\'s formulation. Once all sources of sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are determined, the amount of those sugars from each ingredient should be added or calculated based on processing steps for the finished food (e.g., as a result of dilution of a concentrated fruit or vegetable juice or fermentation) to determine the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product containing the ingredients.\n\n3. Do I need to take into consideration sugars from ingredients that are used in formulating my product when determining the added sugars declaration for a serving of my product?\n\nIngredients containing free mono- and disaccharides that meet our definition of added sugars need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (e.g. sugars from cane sugar and concentrated fruit juice added to sweeten an apple sauce). Manufacturers may need to work with ingredient suppliers to determine the amount of added sugars provided by ingredients used in formulating food products.\n\n4. Do the sugars in dried fruits meet the definition of added sugars?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we responded to comments on dried fruits (see response to comment 212, 81 FR 33742 at 33837). We said that dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them should not be considered to contain added sugars because they are essentially a dehydrated whole fruit and still retain the nutrients and other components of a whole fruit (e.g. diced dried apples). However, if additional sugar is added to a dried fruit, the sugar added to the dried fruit must be declared on the label as added sugars (81 FR 33742 at 33837).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended for conventional food and dietary supplement manufacturers. It provides questions and answers on topics related to compliance with our final rules issued on May 27, 2016, entitled ""Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels"" (81 FR 33742; the ""Nutrition Facts label final rule"") and ""Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments"" (81 FR 34000; the ""serving size final rule"") (codified at title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 101 (21 CFR part 101)). This guidance also discusses labeling of added sugars, as well as formatting for lines (e.g. thickness of lines) and leading (e.g. space between lines) in the examples of graphics used by FDA on the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nIn this guidance, ""you"" (or ""I"") refers to a manufacturer of conventional food or dietary supplements.\n\nII Background\n\nOn May 27, 2016, we published the Nutrition Facts label and the serving size final rules related to the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels, which amended our labeling regulations for foods to provide updated nutrition information to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices.\n\nBelow is a summary of the combined major provisions of the Nutrition Facts label final rule and serving size final rule.\n\nThe final rules revise the Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts labels by:\n\nRemoving the declaration of ""Calories from fat"";\n\nRequiring the declaration of the gram (g) amount of ""added sugars"" in a serving of a product, establishing a Daily Reference Value (DRV) for added sugars, and requiring the percent Daily Value (DV) declaration for added sugars;\n\nChanging ""Sugars"" to ""Total Sugars"" and requiring that ""Includes \'X\' g Added Sugars"" be indented and declared directly below ""Total Sugars"";\n\nUpdating the list of vitamins and minerals of public health significance;\n\nUpdating certain reference values used in the declaration of percent DVs of nutrients on the Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts labels;\n\nRevising the format of the Nutrition Facts labels to increase the prominence of the declaration of ""Calories"";\n\nRemoving the requirement for the footnote table listing the reference values for certain nutrients for 2,000 and 2,500 calorie diets;\n\nRequiring the maintenance of records to support the declarations of certain nutrients under specified circumstances;\n\nAmending the definition of a single-serving container;\n\nRequiring dual-column labeling for certain packages;\n\nAmending several reference amounts customarily consumed that are used by manufacturers to determine their label serving size; and * Establishing an effective date of July 26, 2016, and a compliance date of January 1, 2020, for manufacturers with more than $10 million in food sales (originally scheduled to be July 26, 2018) and January 1, 2021, for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales (originally scheduled to be July 26, 2019).2 Footnote 2: On October 2, 2017, FDA issued a proposed rule that would extend the compliance dates to January 1, 2020 (i.e., for manufacturers with more than $10 million in food sales) and January 1, 2021 (i.e., for manufacturers with less than $10 million in food sales) (82 FR 45753). We finalized the changes to the compliance date in the Federal Register of May 4, 2018 (83 FR 19619).\n\nIII. Questions and Answers on Compliance Issues\n\nMust the updated Nutrition or Supplement Facts label appear on all foods sold by the applicable compliance date? After publication of the final rule, we included a frequently asked question on our website asking ""When must the label be displayed on food packages?"" In our response, we stated that the revised labels were to be displayed on food products that are initially introduced into interstate commerce on or after the compliance date, and said we would address the issue further in guidance. We received a number of questions about products at various points in the distribution chain and whether the product would need to bear the new version of the Nutrition or Supplement Facts label. After further consideration, we are providing the following guidance. Products that are labeled (i.e., when the label is placed on the product) on or after the applicable compliance date must bear a nutrition label that meets our new nutrition labeling requirements in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36. Products that are labeled before the applicable compliance date do not need to be in compliance with the new labeling requirements, and therefore, do not need to bear the new nutrition label. We consider the date the food product was labeled for purposes of determining whether the product must bear a nutrition label that meets the new requirements. We would not consider the location of the food in the distribution chain to determine whether a food product must bear a nutrition label that meets our new nutrition labeling requirements. For example, the food product, whether labeled before or after the compliance date, may be at the manufacturing facility awaiting distribution, at a warehouse awaiting further distribution, in transit to the United States to be offered for import, or on the store shelf of a U.S. retail establishment. We do not object to the use of a sticker for providing a revised nutrition label that meets our new requirements in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 before new packaging is printed. The sticker label should not cover any other mandatory information and should adhere to the package during normal handling.\n\nWhen determining whether labels need to be in compliance with the new requirements, should the determination as to whether my company has $10 million or more in annual food sales be based on domestic food sales or total food sales, including international sales, and how many years of sales should I consider? To determine whether a company has $10 million or more in annual food sales, a firm can either take the smallest sales volume from the previous three years (e.g., 2013, 2014, and 2015), or alternately the firm can take the average of the previous three years sales volume. A firm\'s total (domestic plus international) food sales best reflects the firm\'s resources and, thus, ability to comply with the final rules by the applicable compliance date.\n\nAre there certain approved companies or nutrition databases that manufacturers can use to get the nutrition values for their products? FDA does not approve nutrition databases. However, the United States Department of Agriculture provides nutrition information for a number of foods, and there are also several commercially available nutrition databases you can use to determine nutrition values for your products.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: Products in the general food supply that contain insignificant amounts of eight or more of calories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium are eligible to provide a simplified declaration of nutrition information (21 CFR 101.9(f)). Products that qualify for the simplified declaration that bear nutrition claims are required to bear the statement ""Not a significant source of ____"" (with the blank filled in with the name(s) of any nutrient(s) identified in 21 CFR 101.9(f) that are present in insignificant amounts) and included at the bottom of the nutrition label). However, some products are sold in small packages (e.g., certain sugar-free chewing gums) for which the package size may render it impracticable for the label to display a substantial amount of information. Under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9), when ""circumstance[s] make it impracticable for firms to comply"" with Nutrition Facts labeling requirements, ""FDA may permit alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions to deal with the situation.""\n\nGiven the small package size of certain products and the potentially long statement that would be required if the label had to identify each nutrient that is present in insignificant amounts (see 21 CFR 101.9(f)), we consider 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9) to permit an alternative means of compliance with respect to the nutrition labeling for certain products sold in small packages for which the addition of such statement would be impracticable. In lieu of providing the ""Not a significant source of ____"" statement as required in 21 CFR 101.9(f)(4), we recommend that the label for such packages bear a statement such as ""Not a significant source of other nutrients"" at the bottom of the simplified Nutrition Facts label on such products sold in small packages.\n\nWhat are the requirements relating to multiunit retail food packages?\n\nWe recognize that many retail food products contain multiple, individually packaged items within the larger container (i.e., multiunit retail food packages). FDA\'s labeling requirements provide flexibility for such products, and manufacturers of such products generally have two options. The individual units within the multiunit retail food packages may be ""packaged and sold individually,"" meaning that each individually packaged item bears a Nutrition Facts label (81 FR 34000 at 34005). Note that, when individual units are packaged and sold individually, the Nutrition Facts label must still be visible at point of sale (see 21 CFR 101.9(h)). FDA regulations provide different requirements for unit containers in a multiunit retail food package when the individual unit containers are securely enclosed within and not intended to be separated from the retail package under conditions of retail sale and each unit container is labeled with the statement ""This Unit Not Labeled For Retail Sale"" or ""This Unit Not Labeled for Individual Sale"" in type size not less than 1/16-inch in height, except that this statement shall not be required when the inner unit containers bear no labeling at all (see 21 CFR 101.9(j)(15)(iii)). When this option is used, the multiunit retail food package must bear nutrition information in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9.\n\nCan Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels be placed on the bottom of a food package?\n\nGenerally not. The bottom of the package (such as the bottom of boxes, cans, and bottles, which generally cannot be viewed by the consumer at the point of sale) is not a permissible location for a Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels, unless it is visible during normal retail display and consumer handling (as with some frozen food packages or containers of mints and gum). The Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels must be placed either on the principal display panel or on the information panel (21 CFR 101.2(b)). The ""principal display panel"" means the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale (21 CFR 101.1). The ""information panel"" means the part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the principal display panel as observed by an individual facing the principal display panel, subject to a few exceptions (see 21 CFR 101.2(a)).\n\nWill the increase in RACCs for certain beverages, combined with recent changes to daily values (DVs) and the mandatory declaration of potassium--as updated in the Nutrition Facts label final rule--require products such as coffee, tea, and bottled water to bear mandatory nutrition labeling when such products were previously exempt under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(4)?\n\nNo. As explained in the serving size final rule, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to mandatory nutrition labeling on any products currently on the market, or that come on the market in the future, that would have been exempt under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(4) before the effective date of the serving size final rule, until such time as we have the opportunity to consider this issue in a future rulemaking (81 FR 34000 at 34026-34027). Examples of such products include coffee beans (whole or ground), tea leaves, commitment-type dehydrated vegetables, flavor extracts, food colors, and certain bottled water products.\n\nDoes FDA have recommendations or requirements relating to how nutrition information should be formatted if I use the tabular display for small packages as provided in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)? Specifically, are there limitations on the number of columns I can use in the tabular display?\n\nManufacturers using the tabular display must comply with all applicable requirements in 21 CFR 101.9. With respect to specific requirements that could impact the display of nutrition information using the tabular format, we note that 21 CFR 101.9 includes requirements for which nutrients must be indented under other nutrients (e.g., under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)(A), ""Soluble fiber content shall be indented under dietary fiber""). Attempting to divide the required nutrition information into more than two columns could result in a violation of such formatting requirements. We recommend that manufacturers follow the sample tabular display for small packages provided in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii), which uses two columns of nutrition information.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Size-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics'

In principle, nonclinical BD studies that are not conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) are acceptable. However, when BD evaluation is performed as part of a GLP-compliant toxicology study, it is important that all in-life evaluations and sample collection procedures remain in compliance with GLP. Sample analysis for BD can be conducted in non-GLP manner.\n\nConsiderations specific to ex vivo genetically modified cell products are addressed in Section 5.4.\n\nTest Article\n\nThe test article administered in the nonclinical BD studies should be representative of the intended clinical GT product, taking into consideration the manufacturing process, important product characteristics (e.g., titre), and the final clinical formulation. In some situations, nonclinical BD data generated with a GT product consisting of the same vector intended for clinical use and a different therapeutic transgene or an expression marker gene (e.g., adeno-associated virus vector of the same serotype and promoter that directs expression of a fluorescent marker protein transgene) can be leveraged to support the BD profile (see Section 5.7).\n\nAnimal Species or Model\n\nBD assessment should be conducted in a biologically relevant animal species or model that supports transfer and expression of the genetic material (Note 1). Selection factors can include species differences in tissue tropism of the GT product, gene transfer efficiency, and transgene expression in target and non-target tissues/cells. If working with a replication competent viral vector, it is important that the animal species or model be permissive to vector replication.\n\nThe influence of species, sex, age, physiologic condition (e.g., healthy animal vs. animal disease model) on the BD profile can also be important. In addition, the potential for the animal species to mount an immune response against the administered vector and/or expression product should be considered (see Section 5.3).\n\nGroup Size and Sex of Animals\n\nAn appropriate number of animals per sex (as applicable) should be evaluated at each predetermined sampling time point to generate sufficient data that support comprehensive BD assessment (see Note 2). In keeping with the principles of the 3Rs, the total number of animals can be an aggregate from several studies. Justification should be provided for the number of animals evaluated at each time point, as well as the use of combined data from multiple studies, as applicable. Justification should also be provided when only one sex is evaluated.\n\nRoute of Administration and Dose Level Selection\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_S12_Step4_Guideline_2023_0314_WithCorrection_0""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: From what I\'ve read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Questions and Answers\n\nTHE GLP REGULATIONS - GENERAL\n\nDo the GLPs require the establishment of Technical Operation Manuals?\n\nNo.\n\nIf a laboratory is accredited by AAALAC (American Association for Accreditation of\n\nLaboratory Animal Care), does this serve as assurance of meeting the GLP\n\nrequirements for animal care and facilities?\n\nAAALAC accreditation does not substitute for Agency inspection nor does it guarantee\n\nautomatic compliance with the applicable GLP sections. It is of value, however, in that\n\nit demonstrates that the facility has favorably passed a peer group review.\n\nResults of the quality assurance unit inspections are not routinely available to an\n\nAgency investigator. However, the conforming amendments require that GLP\n\ndeviations are to be reported in detail with each submission to the FDA. Are we\n\nrequired to send the contents of the quality assurance unit inspection report to the\n\nFDA?\n\nNo. The GLP compliance statement in the conforming amendments to the GLPs was\n\nincluded for several reasons:\n\n(a) to provide an orderly transition across the effective date of the regulations. It was\n\nunderstood that applications for research and marketing permits submitted to the\n\nAgency for some period of time after the GLP effective date of June 20, 1979, would\n\ncontain final reports of nonclinical studies begun and completed prior to the effective date, begun prior to the effective date and completed thereafter, and begun and completed after the effective date. Studies begun and completed prior to the effective date are not required to comply with the GLPs and accordingly, the conforming amendments require that differences be noted. Similar considerations apply to studies begun prior to and completed after the effective date, although in these studies, those portions underway as of the effective date are required to comply.\n\n(b) to provide for the submission of final reports of studies, which were not required to comply with the GLPs but which otherwise, contribute to safety evaluation. The GLPs do not apply to safety studies conducted by independent investigators studying regulated products. Such studies are not sponsored by the product manufacturer, nor is there any intention to submit the results to the Agency. The study results are published in the open literature. The sponsor is required red to submit the study to the Agency but could in no way control the research. If the sponsor wishes to use the data in support of the application, the conforming amendments provide a mechanism by which the sponsor can prove that the study was not compromised. A similar situation exists for preliminary exploratory safety studies done by the sponsor.\n\n(c) to foster GLP compliance attitudes by management. The conforming amendment causes management to act responsively to all cases of GLP non-compliance and to take prompt corrective actions.\n\nWith these purposes in mind, the conforming amendments require a brief statement of overall GLP compliance and need not contain the Quality Assurance Unit findings. The Quality Assurance Unit findings should cover short-term GLP deviations, which are promptly corrected. The conforming amendments statement should cover those systematic GLP deviations which have occurred throughout the study.\n\nWho provides the GLP compliance statement required by the conforming amendments?\n\nThis statement is provided by the applicant for the research or marketing permit.\n\nWhat is the degree of compliance with GLPs, which the FDA will require for INDs submitted after June 20, 1979, but which include toxicology studies initiated before June 20, 1979, and completed after June 20, 1979?\n\nThose portions of the studies underway as of the effective date will have to be done in accord with the applicable provisions of the GLPs.\n\nDo nonclinical laboratory studies completed *prior to June 20, 1979 but submitted as part of an IND or NDA subsequent to that date fall under the conforming amendments?\n\nThese studies would not have to have been conducted under the GLPs but the conforming amendment statement of compliance is required.\n\nHow many members of the National Association of Life Science Industries (NALSI) come under the GLPs? How can the membership list be obtained?The Agency has not compiled such a list. A membership list is available from NALSI, 1747 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 2oOo6. All members who conduct nonclinical laboratory studies are subject to the GLPs.\n\nShould a contract laboratory ask a sponsor if the article they are testing is subject to FDA regulations? Should these studies then be listed as a separate master list of studies to comply with the GLP regulations? Contract laboratories should ask sponsors to identify studies which are associated with FDA regulated products, although the GLPs place this responsibility on the sponsor. A separate listing of such studies, apart from the firm\'s master list of all studies undertaken by the firm will satisfy the requirements of the GLPs.\n\nWhat impact have the GLP regulations had on the cost of performing toxicology studies? The president of a large contracting laboratory has stated that three years ago a chronic rat study could be done for about $8o,0oo; and that the current cost is closer $250,000. He estimated that half of the increased cost is due to GLPs, 30% to larger numbers of test animals per study on present day protocols and 20% to inflation. The Agency has not developed cost estimates.\n\n58.1 Scope\n\n58.3 Definitionsapplicability to Studies Performed Under Grants and Contracts\n\n58.15 Inspection of a Testing Facility\n\nAre short-term microbiological screening tests and microbiological preservative stability research and development covered by the GLPs? Microbiological preservative stability research, development and quality control tests are not covered by the GLPs. However, microbiological tests conducted to establish the toxicological profile of an article are covered.\n\nDoes the Agency intend to audit analytical data collected on a test article? Yes, insofar as it contributes to the evaluation of a nonclinical laboratory study.\n\nDoes the Agency intend to audit draft final protocols and draft final reports? The regulations do not require that such materials be retained, however, if draft reports are available, they may be audited in order to help the Agency follow the process from raw data to final report.\n\nExplain why the GLPs apply to ""microorganisms or subparts thereof."" How are microorganisms currently used by FDA in assessment of safety? For certain products, FDA does request that microbial tests be done for the purpose of obtaining information on potential neoplastic and mutagenic activity. Likewise, microsomal preparations (subparts thereof) are used as activating systems for certain in vitro tests. When this happens, the tests should be done in accord with the GLPs.\n\nDo the GLPs apply to engineering/electronic testing laboratories that perform functionality tests on medical devices? No.\n\nIs a licensed manufacturer of human biological products subject to continuing GLP inspection? The GLPs apply to safety studies submitted to the Agency in order to obtain the license. They do not apply to such studies conducted for the purpose of obtaining batch release of licensed biologicals.\n\nWill nonclinical studies in support of medical devices which do not come in contact with man (e.g., stopcocks, a gas machine, a urine bag) be subject to the GLP regulations? If the medical device application for a research or marketing permit does not require the submission of safety data for approval, then the GLPs do not apply.\n\nIf a test article is produced by microbial fermentation, are tests run on the bacteria, such as pathogenicity or virulence covered by the GLPs? No.\n\nAre studies performed for label purposes as required by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act considered to be nonclinical laboratory studies under the GLPs? No.\n\nWhen an application for Premarket Approval for a Class III Device is scrutinized, would a GLP audit by FDA become a criterion for premarket approval? Safety data are required for Class III Devices and such data are to be collected under the GLPs, but an FDA audit will not automatically become part of the premarket approval mechanisms.\n\nAre Class I, II and III Devices regulated products within the meaning of the GLPs? Yes.\n\nAre data contained in a 510(k) notification subject to the GLPs? No.\n\nHow do the GLPs apply to the testing of electromechanical medical devices (non-animal work)?It is presumed that the question refers to engineering tests and in vitro tests of such devices conducted to assess functionality. In these cases, the GLPs do not apply.\n\nPlease elaborate on the preamble statement (43 FR 59989) that studies involving ""diagnostic products"" and ""medical devices, which do not come in contact with or are implanted in man"" are not within the scope of the GLPs. Failure of diagnostic products or medical devices, which do not come in contact with man or are not implanted does pose a safety hazard. This is also true for implantable devices. Tests to establish the reliability of these articles are functionality tests, not safety tests. The GLPs cover implantable devices, which may cause adverse tissue reactions or may have components, which leach into the tissues and cause a toxic response.\n\nIs an in vitro study to quantitate the amounts of residual proteolytic enzyme on a soft contact lens (the enzyme is used to clean the lens) a safety study which is covered by the GLPs? No, the enzyme is part of the lens manufacturing process and its analysis would be covered by the GMPs and not the GLPs. If, however, the proteolytic enzyme is sold as a means of cleaning lenses after purchase by a person, the enzyme is an accessory to a medical device and the safety studies supporting the use of the enzyme would be subject to the GLPs.\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: From what I\'ve read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Certain contracts specify that a series of nonclinical laboratory studies be done on a single test article. Do the GLPs permit the designation of different study directors for each study under the contract?\n\nYes.\n\nDo the GLPs require that a sponsor approve the study director for a contracted study?\n\nNo. Testing facility management designates the study director.\n\nA firm functions as a primary contractor for nonclinical laboratory studies. The actual studies are then subcontracted to nonclinical laboratories. Is the firm considered to be a ""sponsor?""\n\nThe GLPs define ""sponsor"" as a person who initiates and supports a nonclinical laboratory study. Sponsorship in the cited example would be determined by the specific provisions of the contract.\n\nWho is responsible for test article characterization - the sponsor or the contractor?\n\nThe GLPs do not assign the responsibility in this area. The matter is a subject of the specific contractual arrangement between the sponsor and the contractor.\n\nDo contract laboratories have to show the sponsor\'s name on the Master Schedule Sheet or can this information be coded?\n\nThe information can be coded but the code must be revealed to the FDA investigator on request.\n\nA sponsor desires to contract for a nonclinical laboratory study to be conducted in a foreign laboratory. Must the sponsor notify the foreign laboratory that compliance with the U.S. GLPs is required?\n\nYes.\n\nMust a contractor include in the final report information on test article characterization and stability when such information has been collected by the sponsor?\n\nNo. The contractor should identify in its final report which information will be subsequently supplied by the sponsor.\n\nMust a sponsor reveal toxicology data already collected on a test article to a contract laboratory?\n\nNo. If use of the test article involves a potential danger to laboratory personnel, the contract laboratory should be advised so that appropriate precautions can be taken.\n\nSection 58.15 Inspection of a testing facility.\n\nWhat is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n\nThe FD-483 is the written notice of objectionable\n\npractices or deviations from the regulations that is prepared by the FDA investigator at the end of the inspection. The items listed on the form serve as the basis for the exit discussion with laboratory management at which time management can either agree or disagree with the items and can offer possible corrective actions to be taken.\n\nManagement may also respond to the district office in writing after it has had sufficient time to properly study the FD-483.\n\nWill a laboratory subsequently be notified of GLP deviations not listed on the FD-483?\n\nThis does happen. The FDA investigator prepares an establishment\n\ninspection report (EIR) which summarizes the observations made at the\n\nlaboratory and which contains exhibits concerning the studies audited\n\n(Protocols, SOPs, CV\'s, etc.). The EIR is then reviewed by District\n\npersonnel as well as headquarters personnel. This review may reveal\n\nadditional GLP deviations that should be and are communicated to\n\nlaboratory management.\n\nWhat kinds of domestic toxicology laboratory inspections does FDA\n\nperform and how frequently are they done?\n\nFDA performs four kinds of inspections related to the GLPs and\n\nnonclinical laboratory studies. These include: A GLP inspection -\n\nan inspection undertaken as a periodic, routine determination of a\n\nlaboratory\'s compliance with the GLPs, it includes examination of an\n\nongoing study as well as a completed study; A data audit - an\n\ninspection made to verify that the information contained in a final\n\nreport submitted to FDA is accurate and reflected by the raw data; A\n\ndirected inspection - any of a series of inspections conducted for\n\nvarious compelling reasons (questionable data in a final report, tips\n\nfrom informers, etc.); A followup inspection - an inspection made\n\nsometime after a GLP inspection which revealed objectionable\n\npractices and conditions. The purpose of the followup inspection is\n\nto assure that proper corrective actions have been taken. GLP\n\ninspections are scheduled once every two years whereas the other\n\nkinds of inspections are scheduled as needed.\n\nShould GLP investigators comment on the scientific merits of a protocol or the scientific interpretation given in the final report? No. Their function is strictly a noting of observations and verification. Scientific judgments are made by the respective headquarters review units that deal with the test article.\n\nCan a GLP EIR be reviewed by laboratory, management prior to issuance? No. The GLP EIR is an internal agency document which reflects the observations and findings of the FDA investigator. It can not be released to anyone outside the agency until agency action has been completed and the released copy is purged of all trade secret information. Laboratories that disagree with portions of the EIR should write a letter which contains the areas of disagreement to the local FDA District Office. The laboratories can ask that their letters accompany the EIR whenever it is requested under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nCan FDA investigators take photographs of objectionable practices and conditions? It is the agency position that photographs can be taken as a part of the inspection and this position has been sustained by a District Court decision.\n\nThe GLP Compliance Program requires the FDA investigator to select an ongoing study in order to inspect current laboratory operations. What criteria are used to select the study? The studies are selected in accord with agency priorities, i.e. the longest term study on the most significant product.\n\nDoes FDA inspect international nonclinical laboratories once every two years? No. Overseas laboratories are scheduled for inspection on the basis of having submitted to FDA the results of significant studies on important products.\n\nWhat background materials are used by agency investigators to prepare for a GLP inspection? Prior to an inspection, the following materials are usually reviewed:(a) The GLP regulations; (b) The Management Briefings Post-Conference Report; (c) Assorted memoranda and policy issuances; (d) The GLP Compliance Program; (e) The protocol of an ongoing study, if available; (f) The final report of a completed study, if available; (g) The inspection report of the most recent inspection.\n\nHow long does FDA allow a laboratory to effect corrective actions after an inspection has been made? If the results of an inspection reveal that significant deviations from the GLPs exist, the laboratory will be sent a regulatory letter that lists the major deviations and that requests a response within 10 days. The response should describe those actions that the laboratory has taken or plans to take to effect correction. The response should also encompass items that were listed on the FD-483 and those that were discussed during the exit discussion with laboratory management. A specific time table should be given for accomplishing the planned actions. The reasonableness of the time table will be determined by FDA compliance staff, based on the needs of the particular situation. For less significant deviations, the laboratory will be sent a Notice of Adverse Findings letter that also lists the deviations but that requests a response within 30 days. Again, the reasonableness of the response will be determined by FDA staff.\n\nDoes a laboratory\'s responsibility for corrective action listed on a FD-483 begin at the conclusion of an inspection or upon receipt of correspondence from the originating bureau in which corrective action is requested? The FD-483 lists observations of violative conditions that have the capability to adversely affect nonclinical laboratory studies. Corrective actions should be instituted as soon as possible.\n\nDoes FDA preannounce all GLP inspections? Laboratory management is informed of all routine GLP inspections prior to the inspection, but special compliance or investigative inspections need not be preannounced.\n\nSUSPART B ORGANIZATION AND PERSONNEL\n\nSection 58.29 Personnel.\n\nFor what sequence in the supervisory chain should position descriptions be available?\n\nPosition descriptions should be available for each individual engaged in or supervising the conduct of the study.\n\nShould current summaries of training and experience list attendance at scientific and technical meetings?\n\nYes. The agency considers such attendance as a valuable adjunct to the other kinds of training received by laboratory personnel.\n\nIf certain specialists (pathologists, statisticians, ophthalmologists, etc.) are contracted to conduct certain aspects of a study, need they be identified in the final report?\n\nYes.\n\nDoes the QAU have to be composed of technical personnel?\n\nNo. Management is, however, responsible for assuring that ""personnel clearly understand the functions they are to perform"" (Section 58.31(f)) and that each individual engaged in the study has the appropriate combination of education, training and experience (Section 58.29(a)).\n\nSection 58.31 Testing Facility Management.\n\nCan the study director be the chief executive of a nonclinical laboratory?\n\nNo. The GLPs require that there be a separation of function between the study director and the QAU director. In the example, the QAU director would be reporting to the study director.\n\nSection 58.33 Study director.\n\nThe GLPs permit the designation of an ""acting"" or ""deputy"" study director to be responsible for a study when the study director is on leave. Should study records identify the designated ""deputy"" or ""acting"" study director?\n\nYes.\n\nIs the study director responsible for adherence to the GLPs? Yes.\n\nSection 58.35 Quality Assurance Unit.\n\nAs a QAU person, I have no expertise in the field of pathology. How do I audit pathology findings?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Questions and Answers'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 4: We support the principles of the 3Rs (reduce/refine/replace) for animal use in testing when feasible. FDA encourages sponsors to consult with review divisions when considering a nonanimal testing method believed to be suitable, adequate, validated, and feasible. FDA will consider if the alternative method could be assessed for equivalency to an animal test method.\n\nFor chronic studies where nonhuman primates are the only relevant species based on pharmacology, the sponsor should ensure when assessing reproductive toxicity that male animals have attained sexual maturity by the end of the study. However, this is not always feasible. If impaired spermatogenesis is observed in maturing males, the sponsor may need to further investigate potential effects in fully mature males, on a case-by-case basis. FDA encourages sponsors to discuss with the review division appropriately designed reproductive toxicity assessments in nonhuman primates.\n\nFDA considers histopathological evaluation of the reproductive organs of sexually mature animals to be an appropriately sensitive endpoint for evaluating testicular injury in animals. Toxicology studies should include an examination of the histopathology of the testes, seminal vesicle, epididymis, and prostate with appropriate fixation and staining of the testes.5 If adverse findings in gonadal tissues were observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies, histopathology assessment of the reproductive tissues in the nonclinical male fertility study/studies may provide additional evidence for the human risk assessment. The persistence versus the reversibility of adverse effects in a group sacrificed after a specified period of drug withdrawal (sufficient to allow reconstitution/recovery of spermatogenesis) on the reproductive system is an important consideration in the risk assessment.\n\n3 Nonclinical Findings That Raise Concern for Male Fertility\n\nIn general, reproductive toxicity findings in male animals that raise concern for impaired fertility include, but are not limited to, atrophy, degeneration, necrosis, or hypocellularity of testes; increased seminiferous tubule degeneration or necrosis; germ cell depletion; or other pathology that may suggest impaired reproductive function. In addition, findings in other associated male reproductive organs (e.g., prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymis) may be suggestive of testicular toxicity. The sponsor should consider clinical evaluation of testicular function for direct-acting testicular toxicants that are associated with decreased reproductive function and/or adverse histopathology.\n\nThe significance of adverse findings in the toxicology and fertility studies increases if:\n\nThe incidence and/or severity of the findings increase with dose and/or duration of treatment\n\nThe reproductive findings occur in multiple species\n\nThe reproductive findings occur in tissues bilaterally\n\nThe adverse histopathology correlates with effects on reproductive organ weight\n\nA finding does not resolve after a period of one or two spermatogenic cycles or after five half-lives following the last drug dose\n\nThe adverse findings occur at clinically relevant exposures\n\nThe adverse findings are seen at pharmacokinetic exposures that result in a safety margin comparable to clinical exposure\n\nAlthough histology is the most sensitive way to detect testicular and sperm quality toxicities, findings of reduced fertility, impaired mating behavior, and reduced capacity to mate in male fertility studies are concerns in and of themselves. These findings are especially concerning if they are corroborated by histopathological evidence of adverse effects on reproductive tissues in repeat dose toxicity studies. Findings that are suggestive of perturbations of the endocrine system are also a concern because changes in hormone homeostasis may adversely affect male (and female) reproductive physiology and performance. For example, drug-induced alterations in endocrine function can affect testicular weight, gamete maturation and release, sperm count, and/or fertility.\n\nTable 1 summarizes findings in nonclinical studies that may increase the level of concern for impaired fertility.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAppendix D Confounding Factors\n\nNumerous factors can confound apparent male reproductive toxicities. The use of drugs that cause a reduction in body weight or impair neuromuscular/neurological function may result in signals consistent with impaired reproductive function. When decreased spermatogenesis is detected in testicular histopathology examinations, it is important to document the reproductive age of the nonclinical model and to determine if the drug can have temporary or permanent effects on testicular development and spermatogenesis. Drugs that cause adverse effects on sperm quality in rats, without an effect on mating outcome, may still represent a risk to human males because these findings may indicate undesirable effects on testicular function, independent of mating outcome. For testicular toxicants where the mechanism of action is based on changes in hormone levels, the sponsor should clinically monitor hormones.\n\nAppendix E Follow-Up Investigations\n\nBased upon an assessment of the findings from the nonclinical toxicology studies and any additional findings, the sponsor should consider additional nonclinical studies to characterize an observed male reproductive toxicity on a case-by-case basis. Follow-up studies could contain some of the following assessments:\n\nA demonstration of the potential for recovery from the adverse finding after cessation of dosing, if not available from the initial toxicology studies\n\nA reproductive hormone analysis, recognizing that hormone concentrations can vary significantly between animals and over the course of a day and over the course of the study\n\nA determination of the target cell type (e.g., germ cell, Leydig cell, Sertoli cell)\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|} \\hline\nGeneral Nonclinical Findings to Consider in Male Fertility Risk Assessment \\ \\hline Finding occurs at clinically relevant exposures or small multiples of the clinical exposure \\ \\hline Finding occurs in multiple species \\ \\hline Finding increases in incidence and severity with increasing duration of exposure \\ \\hline Finding does not resolve, or at least show partial recovery, after one or two spermatogenic cycles or after five \\ half-lives following the last drug dose \\ \\hline Finding occurs bilaterally in paired organs \\ \\hline Finding is rare in healthy untreated animals \\ \\hline Reproductive organ weight change (increased or decreased weight) correlates with adverse histology \\ \\hline Decreased male fertility and impaired mating behavior \\ \\hline Sperm quality adversely affected (count, motility, or morphology) \\ \\hline Signs of hormonal perturbation: \\ (\\bullet) Anti-androgenic signs — decreased weight and maturation of male sexual organs, including seminal \\ vesicles and ventral prostate when weighed with their secretions, clinical signs suggestive of reduced \\ aggressiveness (e.g., lethergic or reduced mating behavior, feminization of males) \\ (\\bullet) Androgenic signs — masculinization of females (decreased fertility, female sexual organ pathology, or \\ (\\text{\\em estrus cyclicity})), decreased testes size, and impaired spermatogenesis \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Nonclinical Findings That May Increase the Level of Concern for Impaired Fertility in MenIn selected cases, adding fertility and/or sperm quality analysis to repeat-dose toxicity or fertility studies may be appropriate. The length of dosing in the premating period of the male fertility study could be increased to cover an entire spermatogenic cycle and epididymal transit (for example, approximately 63 days in rats) to determine the extent of expected or observed toxicities in previous studies. A confirmatory study in a second species may be useful in cases where the finding is suspected to be species dependent (e.g., when effects are caused by a species-specific metabolite).\n\nFDA does not intend for these nonclinical discussions to be comprehensive but rather to serve as a starting point for evaluating the risk of testicular injury in humans.\n\nIV Monitoring of the testes during clinical trials\n\nWhether an evaluation of testicular toxicity in men is needed depends on various factors, including the mechanism of action of the testicular toxicity, if known, duration of therapeutic use, exposure multiples for the expected clinical exposure, intended target population, and indication of use.\n\nA plan to minimize and monitor for the risk of human testicular injury should be in place early in clinical development for drugs that have a potential to cause human testicular toxicity based on nonclinical findings at anticipated clinically relevant exposures, taking into account the other aforementioned factors. The sponsor can discuss this plan with the appropriate review division as part of a pre-investigational new drug application (pre-IND) meeting or develop the plan and provide it with the original IND or at other time points in the IND phase, as appropriate. The sponsor can also discuss these issues at milestone or other meetings.\n--------------------\nContext title: Testicular Toxicity- Evaluation During Drug Development""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.10.2 Studies During Clinical Development\n\nAdditional studies may be warranted to clarify observed or suspected adverse effects in animals and humans during clinical development.\n\n2.10.3 Studies Before Approval\n\nSafety pharmacology effects on systems listed in section 2.8 should be assessed prior to product approval, unless not warranted, in which case this should be justified. Available information from toxicology studies adequately designed and conducted to address safety pharmacology endpoints, or information from clinical studies, can support this assessment and replace safety pharmacology studies.\n\nApplication of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)\n\nIt is important to ensure the quality and reliability of non-clinical safety studies. This is normally accomplished through the conduct of the studies in compliance with GLP. Due to the unique design of, and practical considerations for, some safety pharmacology studies, it may not be feasible to conduct these in compliance with GLP. It has to be emphasized that data quality and integrity in safety pharmacology studies should be ensured even in the absence of formal adherence to the principles of GLP. When studies are not conducted in compliance with GLP, study reconstruction should be ensured through adequate documentation of study conduct and archiving of data. Any study or study component not conducted in compliance with GLP should be adequately justified, and the potential impact on evaluation of the safety pharmacology endpoints should be explained.\n\nThe safety pharmacology core battery should ordinarily be conducted in compliance with GLP. Follow-up and supplemental studies should be conducted in compliance with GLP to the greatest extent feasible. Safety pharmacology investigations can be part of toxicology studies; in such cases, these studies would be conducted in compliance with GLP.\n\nPrimary pharmacodynamic studies do not need to be conducted in compliance with GLP.\n\nGenerally, secondary pharmacodynamic studies do not need to be conducted in compliance with GLP. Results from secondary pharmacodynamic studies conducted during the compound selection process may contribute to the safety pharmacology evaluation; when there is no cause for concern (e.g., there are no findings for the safety pharmacological endpoint or the chemical or therapeutic class), these studies need not be repeated in compliance with GLP. In some circumstances, results of secondary pharmacodynamic studies may make a pivotal contribution to the safety evaluation for potential adverse effects in humans, and these are normally conducted in compliance with GLP.\n\n3 Notes\n--------------------\nContext title: S7A_Guideline""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: From what I\'ve read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: V Non-clinical Information\n\nYou must submit adequate information about pharmacological and toxicological studies of the LBP in laboratory animals, or in vitro, to support a proposed clinical trial evaluating the investigational LBP (21 CFR 312.23(a)(8)). We recommend that you summarize available information and that you include studies you conduct as well as those reported in the relevant literature. Conclusions based on data obtained from animal studies and/or in vitro studies evaluating the clinical formulation or individual ingredients in the clinical formulation, as opposed to similar or unknown formulations, are generally most supportive of a proposed clinical trial. Depending on the product and as appropriate for the proposed clinical study, we recommend that you address: general toxicity; target organs or systems of toxicity; teratogenic, carcinogenic, or mutagenic potential of any ingredient in the product; and relationship of dosage and duration to toxic response and pharmacological activity. Additional FDA guidance documents, prepared under the auspices of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) are available at http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm122049.htm (Refs. 9 and 10).\n\nAs discussed above, we encourage you to consult the applicable CBER review division, preferably in a pre-IND meeting, regarding the extent and type of non-clinical data necessary to support the proposed clinical investigation (Ref. 2).\n\nVI Clinical Information\n\nPrevious Human Experience\n\nPrevious human experience varies from prospectively designed, randomized, controlled clinical trials to case reports. Similarly, varying degrees of product characterization may be reported for the products used in the respective study or studies. Drawing conclusionsor making assumptions as to the relevance of previous studies may be difficult or impossible without adequate available CMC information.\n\nIn general, the relevance of previous human experience to support a proposed study is based upon the similarity of the product(s) under study, as well as study design, objectives and endpoints, the number of individuals exposed, the level and duration of exposure, the type and duration of active monitoring and passive surveillance, and the integrity of study conduct, data collection and subsequent analyses. If you wish to reference a study submitted to the Agency by a person other than you (the sponsor), you must obtain and include in your submission, a signed letter of cross-reference stating that FDA has permission to access this information (21 CFR 312.23(b)). Also, an accounting of the final disposition of all randomized or enrolled study subjects is important in order to provide a context for the study data, since a large number of dropouts, withdrawals, or protocol violations make data analysis and conclusions less convincing. Multiple statistical analyses without appropriate correction and post hoc analyses, including analyses of population subsets, can be useful to generate hypotheses in designing subsequent studies; however, conclusions based solely upon multiple statistical analyses without appropriate correction may be misleading. Finally, safety data based on active adverse event monitoring provides a more meaningful safety profile of a product than data based on passive monitoring and/or reporting of only those events that an individual investigator deems ""related"" based upon an individual investigator\'s judgment.\n\nAppendix B Proposed Initial Studies\n\nSafety data obtained from the administration of an investigational product to healthy volunteers can be important in identifying common product-associated adverse events before proceeding to studies in more vulnerable populations, e.g., children or those with the disease of interest. Proposed studies evaluating treatment effects should include disease definitions and criteria for worsening, improvement, relapse, etc., applicable to the disease and population studied. For useful sources of information on clinical investigations generally, and clinical studies in pediatric or geriatric populations specifically, you should refer to the appropriate FDA guidance documents, including those prepared under the auspices of ICH at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm122049.htm (Refs. 11 through 15).\n\nVII References\n\n[1] Guidance for Industry: Content and Format of Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Information and Establishment Description Information for a Vaccine or Related Product, January 1999. http://www.fda.gov/BiologicalShoodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Vaccines/ucm076612.htm\n\n[2] Guidance for Industry: Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants, May 2009. http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM079744.htm (Note: The document entitled ""Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products; Guidance for Industry,"" dated March 2015, when finalized will supersede this May 2009 guidance. http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidance/UCM437431.pdf.)\n\n[3] Guidance for Industry: Providing Regulatory Submissions to CBER in Electronic Format -- Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs), March 2002. http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicalShoodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/General/UCM150028.htm\n\n[4] Guidance for Industry: CGMP for Phase 1 Investigational Drugs, July 2008. http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM070273.htm\n\n[5] Guidance for Industry: Content and Format of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-derived Products, November 1995. http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM071597.htm\n\n[6] US Pharmacopeia (39 USP <61>) Microbiological Examination of Nonsterile Products: Microbial Enumeration Tests\n\n[7] US Pharmacopeia (39 USP <788>) Particulate Matter in Injections\n\n[8] US Pharmacopeia (39 USP <151>) Pyrogen Test\n\n[9] Guidance for Industry: S6 Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals, July 1997, ICH. http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidance/UCM074957.pdf* 10.

Approaches other than those listed below may be acceptable.\n\nBased on Visual Evaluation (7.1)\n\nVisual evaluation may be used for noninstrumental methods but may also be used with instrumental methods.\n\nThe quantitation limit is generally determined by the analysis of samples with known concentrations of analyte and by establishing the minimum level at which the analyte can be quantified with acceptable accuracy and precision.\n\nBased on Signal-to-Noise (7.2)\n\nThis approach can only be applied to analytical procedures that exhibit baseline noise. Determination of the signal-to-noise ratio is performed by comparing measured signals from samples with known low concentrations of analyte with those of blank samples and by establishing the minimum concentration at which the analyte can be reliably quantified.

Robustness (8)\n\nThe evaluation of robustness should be considered during the development phase and depends on the type of procedure under study. It should show the reliability of an analysis with respect to deliberate variations in method parameters.\n\nIf measurements are susceptible to variations in analytical conditions, the analytical conditions should be suitably controlled or a precautionary statement should be included in the procedure. One consequence of the evaluation of robustness should be that a series of system suitability parameters (e.g., resolution test) is established to ensure that the validity of the analytical procedure is maintained whenever used.\n\nExamples of typical variations are:\n\n(\\bullet) Stability of analytical solutions\n\n(\\bullet) Extraction time\n\nIn the case of liquid chromatography, examples of typical variations are:\n\n(\\bullet) Influence of variations of pH in a mobile phase\n\n(\\bullet) Influence of variations in mobile phase composition\n\n(\\bullet) Different columns (different lots and/or suppliers)\n\n(\\bullet) Temperature\n\n(\\bullet) Flow rate\n\nIn the case of gas-chromatography, examples of typical variations are:\n\n(\\bullet) Different columns (different lots and/or suppliers)\n\n(\\bullet) Temperature\n\n(\\bullet) Flow rate\n\nX System Sutability Testing (9)\n\nSystem suitability testing is an integral part of many analytical procedures.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., ""outliers"")?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.2.2 Outlier Tests\n\nThe CGMP regulations require that statistically valid quality control criteria include appropriate acceptance and/or rejection levels (SS 211.165(d)). On rare occasions, a value may be obtained that is markedly different from the others in a series obtained using a validated method. Such a value may qualify as a statistical outlier. An outlier may result from a deviation from prescribed test methods, or it may be the result of variability in the sample. It should never be assumed that the reason for an outlier is error in the testing procedure, rather than inherent variability in the sample being tested.\n\nOutlier testing is a statistical procedure for identifying from an array those data that are extreme. The possible use of outlier tests should be determined in advance. This should be written into SOPs for data interpretation and be well documented. The SOPs should include the specific outlier test to be applied with relevant parameters specified in advance. The SOPs should specify the minimum number of results required to obtain a statistically significant assessment from the specified outlier test.\n\nFor biological assays having a high variability, an outlier test may be an appropriate statistical analysis to identify those results that are statistically extreme observations. The USP describes outlier tests in the general chapter on Design and Analysis of Biological Assays (USP(<)111(>)). In these cases, the outlier observation is omitted from calculations. The USP also states that ""arbitrary rejection or retention of an apparently aberrant response can be a serious source of bias...the rejection of observations solely on the basis of their relative magnitudes, without investigation as to cause, is a procedure to be used sparingly"" (USP (<)111(>)).\n\nFor validated chemical tests with relatively small variance, and if the sample being tested can be considered homogeneous (for example, an assay of a composite of a dosage form drug to determine strength), an outlier test is only a statistical analysis of the data obtained from testing and retesting. It will not identify the cause of an extreme observation and, therefore, should not be used to invalidate the suspect result. Occasionally, an outlier test may be of some value in understanding how discordant from a data set a result is, but can be used solely in an informational capacity in the course of an investigation to determine the distance of a result from the mean.15\n\nFootnote 15: Outlier testing should not be used to invalidate chemical assays. See United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, U.S.A. v. Barr Laboratories, Inc., et al. Civil Action Number 92-1744, OPINION, February 4, 1993.\n\nOutlier tests have no applicability in cases where the variability in the product is what is being assessed, such as for content uniformity, dissolution, or release rate determinations. In these applications, a value perceived to be an outlier may in fact be an accurate result of a nonuniform product.\n\nWhen using these practices during the additional testing performed in an OOS investigation, the laboratory will obtain multiple results. It is again critical for the laboratory to provide all test results for evaluation and consideration by the QU in itsfinal disposition decision. In addition, when investigation by a contract laboratory16 does not determine an assignable cause, all test results should be reported to the customer on the certificate of analysis.\n\nFootnote 16: The Agency also recommends that OOS investigation reports be provided to the customer.\n\nV Concluding the Investigation\n\nTo conclude the investigation, the results should be evaluated, the batch quality should be determined, and a release decision should be made by the QU. The relevant SOPs should be followed in arriving at this point. Once a batch has been rejected, there is no limit to further testing to determine the cause of the failure so that a corrective action can be taken.\n\nInterpretation of Investigation Results\n\nThe QU is responsible for interpreting the results of the investigation. An initial OOS result does not necessarily mean the subject batch fails and must be rejected. The OOS result should be investigated, and the findings of the investigation, including retest results, should be interpreted to evaluate the batch and reach a decision regarding release or rejection (SS 211.165).\n\nIn those instances where an investigation has revealed a cause, and the suspect result is invalidated, the result should not be used to evaluate the quality of the batch or lot. Invalidation of a discrete test result may be done only upon the observation and documentation of a test event that can reasonably be determined to have caused the OOS result.\n\nIn those cases where the investigation indicates an OOS result is caused by a factor affecting the batch quality (i.e., an OOS result is confirmed), the result should be used in evaluating the quality of the batch or lot. A confirmed OOS result indicates that the batch does not meet established standards or specifications and should result in the batch\'s rejection, in accordance with SS 211.165(f), and proper disposition. For inconclusive investigations -- in cases where an investigation (1) does not reveal a cause for the OOS test result and (2) does not confirm the OOS result -- the OOS result should be given full consideration in the batch or lot disposition decision.\n\nIn the first case (OOS confirmed), the investigation changes from an OOS investigation into a batch failure investigation, which must be extended to other batches or products that may have been associated with the specific failure (SS 211.192).\n\nIn the second case (inconclusive), the QU might still ultimately decide to release the batch. For example, a firm might consider release of the product under the following scenario:\n\nA product has an acceptable composite assay range of 90.0 to 110.0 percent. The initial (OOS) assay result is 89.5 percent. Subsequent sample preparations from the original sample yield the following retest results: 99.0, 98.9, 99.0, 99.1, 98.8, 99.1, and 99.0 percent. A comprehensive laboratory investigation (Phase 1) fails to reveal any laboratory error. Review of events during production of the batch reveals no aberrations or indication of unusual process variation.17\n\nFootnote 17: As an example, evaluation of process variation would determine if established equipment, facility, and process control limits were met.\n\nReview of the manufacturing process and product history demonstrates that the process is robust. The seven passing retest results are all well within the known limits of variability of the method used. Batch results from in-process monitoring, content uniformity, dissolution, and other tests are consistent with the passing retest results. After a thorough investigation, a firm\'s QU might conclude that the initial OOS result did not reflect the true quality of the batch.\n\nIt is noteworthy in this scenario that the original, thorough laboratory investigation failed to find any assignable cause. However, if subsequent investigation nonetheless concludes that the source of the OOS result was a cause unrelated to the manufacturing process, in response to this atypical failure to detect the laboratory deviation, it is essential that the investigation include appropriate follow-up and scrutiny to prevent recurrence of the laboratory error(s) that could have led to the OOS result.\n\nAs the above example illustrates, any decision to release a batch, in spite of an initial OOS result that has not been invalidated, should come only after a full investigation has shown that the OOS result does not reflect the quality of the batch. In making such a decision, the QU should always err on the side of caution.\n\nCautious\n\nc.2.1 Averaging results from multiple sample preparations from the original sample\n\nIn cases where a series of assay results (intended to produce a single reportable result) are required by the test procedure and some of the individual results are OOS, some are within specification, and all are within the known variability of the method, the passing results are no more likely to represent the true value for the sample than the OOS results. For this reason, a firm should err on the side of caution and treat the average of these values as an OOS result, even if that average is within specification. This approach is consistent with the principle outlined in the USP General Notices that an official article shall comply with the compential standard any time a compential test is applied.18 Thus, every individual application of the official test should be expected to produce a result that meets specifications.\n\nFootnote 18: USP, General Notices, Section 7.10, “Test Results, Statistics, and Standards” states “Analytical results observed in the laboratory (or calculated from experimental measurements) are compared with stated acceptance criteria to determine whether the article conforms to compential requirements.”\n\nc.2.2 Averaging results from same final sample preparation\n\nAs noted in the Averaging section (IV.C.1.), there may be cases where the test method specifies appropriate acceptance criteria for variability and a pre-defined number of replicates from the final diluted sample solution to arrive at a result. For example, an HPLC test method may specify both acceptance criteria for variability and that a single reportable result be determined by averaging the peak response from a number of consecutive, replicate injections from the same test vial. In these cases, and given the acceptance criteria for variability are met, the result of any individual replicate in and of itself should not cause the reportable result to be OOS.\n\niv.2.3 Borderline results that are within specification\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigating Out-of-Specification (OOS) Test Results for Pharmaceutical Production - Level 2 revision Guidance for Industry'

More recently, capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and capillary electrochromatography (CEC) had been shown to be alternatives to chromatographic methods. Besides meeting the desired performance characteristics, further practical criteria were considered in the technology selection for development, based on general technical knowledge, operational needs, availability of equipment and capabilities in the company at the time:\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_Q14_Document_Step2_Guideline_2022_0324'

Other approaches may be acceptable if justified.\n\n411 4.3.3.1 Recommended Data\n\n412 If a combined performance criterion is chosen, results should be reported as combined value to provide appropriate overall knowledge of the suitability of the analytical procedure. If relevant, the individual results for accuracy and precision should be provided as supplemental information. The approach used should be described.\n\n416 4.4 Robustness\n\n417 The evaluation of the analytical procedure\'s suitability within the intended operational environment should be considered during the development phase and depends on the type of procedure under study. Robustness testing should show the reliability of an analytical procedure with respect to deliberate variations in parameters.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., ""outliers"")?\n--------------------\nContext: This approach can only be applied to analytical procedures which exhibit baseline noise.\n\nDetermination of the signal-to-noise ratio is performed by comparing measured signals from samples with known low concentrations of analyte with those of blank samples and establishing the minimum concentration at which the analyte can be reliably detected. A signal-to-noise ratio between 3 or 2:1 is generally considered acceptable for estimating the detection limit.\n\nBased on the Standard Deviation of the Response and the Slope\n\nThe detection limit (DL) may be expressed as:\n\n[\\text{DL}=\\quad\\frac{3.3\\ \\sigma}{\\text{S}}]\n\nwhere (\\sigma=) the standard deviation of the response\n\n(\\text{S}=) the slope of the calibration curve\n\nThe slope S may be estimated from the calibration curve of the analyte. The estimate of (\\sigma) may be carried out in a variety of ways, for example:\n\n6.3.1 Based on the Standard Deviation of the Blank\n\nMeasurement of the magnitude of analytical background response is performed by analyzing an appropriate number of blank samples and calculating the standard deviation of these responses.\n\n6.3.2 Based on the Calibration Curve\n\nA specific calibration curve should be studied using samples containing an analyte in the range of DL. The residual standard deviation of a regression line or the standard deviation of y-intercepts of regression lines may be used as the standard deviation.\n\nRecommended Data\n\nThe detection limit and the method used for determining the detection limit should be presented. If DL is determined based on visual evaluation or based on signal-to-noise ratio, the presentation of the relevant chromatograms is considered acceptable for justification.\n\nIn cases where an estimated value for the detection limit is obtained by calculation or extrapolation, this estimate may subsequently be validated by the independent analysis of a suitable number of samples known to be near or prepared at the detection limit.\n\n7 Quantitation Limit\n\nSeveral approaches for determining the quantitation limit are possible, depending on whether the procedure is non-instrumental or instrumental. Approaches other than those listed below may be acceptable.\n\nBased on Visual Evaluation\n\nVisual evaluation may be used for non-instrumental methods but may also be used with instrumental methods.\n\nThe quantitation limit is generally determined by the analysis of samples with known concentrations of analyte and by establishing the minimum level at which the analyte can be quantified with acceptable accuracy and precision.\n\nBased on Signal-to-Noise Approach\n\nThis approach can only be applied to analytical procedures that exhibit baseline noise.\n\nDetermination of the signal-to-noise ratio is performed by comparing measured signals from samples with known low concentrations of analyte with those of blank samples and by establishing the minimum concentration at which the analyte can be reliably quantified. A typical signal-to-noise ratio is 10:1.\n\nBased on the Standard Deviation of the Response and the Slope\n\nThe quantitation limit (QL) may be expressed as:\n\n[\\begin{array}{ll}\\mbox{QL}=&\\frac{10\\ \\sigma}{\\mbox{S}}\\end{array}]\n\nwhere (\\sigma=) the standard deviation of the response\n\nS = the slope of the calibration curve\n\nThe slope S may be estimated from the calibration curve of the analyte. The estimate of (\\sigma) may be carried out in a variety of ways for example:\nMeasurement of the magnitude of analytical background response is performed by analyzing an appropriate number of blank samples and calculating the standard deviation of these responses.\n\n7.3.2 Based on the Calibration Curve\n\nA specific calibration curve should be studied using samples, containing an analyte in the range of QL. The residual standard deviation of a regression line or the standard deviation of y-intercepts of regression lines may be used as the standard deviation.\n\nRecommended Data\n\nThe quantitation limit and the method used for determining the quantitation limit should be presented.\n\nThe limit should be subsequently validated by the analysis of a suitable number of samples known to be near or prepared at the quantitation limit.\n\n8 Robustness\n\nThe evaluation of robustness should be considered during the development phase and depends on the type of procedure under study. It should show the reliability of an analysis with respect to deliberate variations in method parameters.\n\nIf measurements are susceptible to variations in analytical conditions, the analytical conditions should be suitably controlled or a precautionary statement should be included in the procedure. One consequence of the evaluation of robustness should be that a series of system suitability parameters (e.g., resolution test) is established to ensure that the validity of the analytical procedure is maintained whenever used.\n\nExamples of typical variations are:\n\nstability of analytical solutions,\n\nextraction time\n\nIn the case of liquid chromatography, examples of typical variations are:\n\ninfluence of variations of pH in a mobile phase,\n\ninfluence of variations in mobile phase composition,\n\ndifferent columns (different lots and/or suppliers),\n\ntemperature,flow rate.\n\nIn the case of gas-chromatography, examples of typical variations are:\n\ndifferent columns (different lots and/or suppliers),\n\ntemperature,\n\nflow rate.\n\n9 System Suitability Testing\n\nSystem suitability testing is an integral part of many analytical procedures. The tests are based on the concept that the equipment, electronics, analytical operations and samples to be analyzed constitute an integral system that can be evaluated as such. System suitability test parameters to be established for a particular procedure depend on the type of procedure being validated.

26,"Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?","['--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: The product labeling;\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:32]\n\nshould also conduct continuing review of the HUD. For continuing review, an IRB may use an expedited review procedure in which a chairperson or one or more experienced reviewers carries out the review, similar to the expedited review procedure described at 21 CFR 56.110(b). When an IRB conducts the initial review, a facility may decide to utilize an appropriate local committee to conduct continuing review of the use of the HUD in clinical care.\n\nAppropriate local committees may develop their own policies and procedures for continuing review of a HUD and should determine what type of review procedure is appropriate for each HUD. An expedited procedure, such as that described under 21 CFR 56.110, may be appropriate for continuing review because a HUD marketed under an HDE is a legally marketed device, and its use in clinical care does not constitute ""research."" An expedited review does not mean a less-than-substantive review. The individual(s) conducting an expedited review for use of a HUD at a facility should thoughtfully consider the risk and benefit information available and any MDRs.\n\nIn addition, FDA does not require that the IRB or appropriate local committee serve as a Data Monitoring Committee. The IRB or appropriate local committee may, however, ask the HDE holder for copies of the safety information submitted to FDA in the periodic reports required by 21 CFR 814.126(b)(1). In this way, information that could have a bearing on human safety would be considered at the time of continuing review.\n\nWhen an IRB or appropriate local committee is deciding whether to approve the use of a HUD for clinical care of patients at a facility, it does not make a Significant Risk/Non-Significant Risk (SR/NSR) determination. As noted above, use of a legally marketed HUD within its HDE-approved indication at a facility to treat or diagnose patients is not a clinical investigation of a device under 21 CFR part 812.\n\nAppendix F Review and Approval for Clinical Testing of HUDs\n\nA clinical investigation of a HUD that requires submission of an IDE application to FDA or is conducted under the abbreviated requirements for NSR devices at 21 CFR 812.2(b) must be approved and supervised by an IRB.109 Data may be collected in a clinical investigation for the HDE-approved indication(s) without an IDE. An approved IDE permits a device to be shipped lawfully for the purposes of conducting investigations of the device without complying with certain other requirements of the FD&C Act that would apply to devices in commercial distribution.110 As long as the HUD is being studied for the indication(s) in its approved labeling, the HUD is not subject to IDE requirements because the HUD is a legally marketed device and therefore can be lawfully shipped without an IDE. However, regardless of the applicability of the IDE regulation at 21 CFR part 812, other FDA regulatory requirements may still apply, includingrequirements for IRB review and approval, financial disclosure, informed consent111 and, if applicable, additional safeguards for children.112\n\nFootnote 111: Specific requirements for obtaining informed consent from human subjects apply to FDA-regulated clinical investigations. See 21 CFR part 50, subpart B. Note that, in some cases, facilities may have specific requirements for obtaining informed consent for the use of the HDE-approved HUD in the routine clinical care of patients, but these would not be FDA regulatory requirements.\n\nFootnote 112: See 21 CFR part 56 for IRB requirements; see 21 CFR part 54 for requirements for financial disclosure by clinical investigators; and see 21 CFR part 50 for requirements for the protection of human subjects, including additional safeguards for children.\n\nIf the IRB receives a request to review an investigation to determine safety or effectiveness of the HUD for a different indication than the HDE-approved indication(s), then the IRB should be aware that this type of clinical investigation is subject to the IDE regulations at 21 CFR part 812. If the device is a SR device, the sponsor of the investigation must submit an IDE application to FDA and obtain FDA approval of that application before starting the clinical investigation.113 A physician who wants to study a HUD may be the sponsor, investigator, or both for the study. In sum, the investigational use of a HUD under these circumstances must be conducted in accordance with 21 CFR parts 812, 50, 54, and 56.114\n\nFootnote 113: 21 CFR 812.20(a).\n\nFootnote 114: Note that 45 CFR part 46 may be applicable to research involving HUDs under certain circumstances. The applicability of those regulations is outside the scope of this guidance.\n\nFootnote 115: See 21 CFR 812.66.\n\nSignificant Risk/Non-Significant Risk Determinations\n\nAn IRB does not have to make a SR/NSR determination when it receives a request to review a clinical investigation of a HUD (e.g., collection of safety and effectiveness data) when that clinical investigation concerns the HDE-approved indication(s) only. As noted above, FDA does not consider such investigations to require an IDE under 21 CFR part 812.\n\nFor an investigation of the HUD for indications other than the HDE-approved indication(s), the IRB would need to make a SR/NSR determination if that determination has not already been made by FDA.115 In practice, most sponsors have submitted and obtained FDA approval of an IDE application before submitting such investigations of HUDs to IRBs for review, so IRBs have not needed to make the SR/NSR determination (i.e., FDA had already determined the device was a SR device). However, in the event that a sponsor seeks IRB approval for investigational use of a HUD for an indication other than its approved indication(s) without first obtaining a determination from FDA regarding whether the study is a SR or NSR study, then the IRB should make the SR/NSR determination as required in 21 CFR 812.66.\n\nFootnote 115: See 21 CFR 812.66.\n\nAppendix G Emergency Use of HUDs\n\nIf a physician in an emergency situation determines that IRB or appropriate local committee approval for the use of the HUD at the facility cannot be obtained in time to prevent serious harm or death to a patient, a HUD may be used without prior approval. In this situation, the HDEholder may ship the HUD, based on the physician\'s certification of the emergent need and representation that the physician will follow the requirements regarding reporting such use to the chairperson of the IRB or appropriate local committee. The physician must provide notification of the use to the chairperson of the IRB or appropriate local committee, and the notification must include the identification of the patient involved, the date of the use, and the reason for the use.116 FDA regulations require that physicians provide such notification to the chairperson of an IRB in writing within 5 days of the emergency use of the device.117 For facilities at which an appropriate local committee reviews the use of HUDs instead of an IRB, FDA recommends that physicians provide the same required notification of the emergency use to the committee in writing and within 5 days.\n\nFootnote 116: See section 520(m)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFDA further recommends that the physician submit a follow-up report on the patient\'s condition to the HDE holder. The HDE holder is required under 21 CFR 814.126(b) to submit periodic reports, including the applicant\'s clinical experience with the device and the number of devices shipped or sold in the US.\n\nIX Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n\nThis guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).\n\nThe time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average 100 hours per response, including the time to review instructions, search existing data sources, gather the data needed, and complete and review the information collection.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: Research interactions that involve no more than minimal risk to subjects (e.g., quality of life surveys); and\n\nCollection of follow-up data from procedures or interventions that would have been done as part of routine clinical practice to monitor a subject for disease progression or recurrence, regardless of whether the procedures or interventions are described in the research protocol.\n\nIn contrast, FDA interprets ""long-term follow-up"" to exclude:\n\nResearch interventions that would not have been performed for clinical purposes, even if the research interventions involve no more than minimal risk.\n\nOf note, some studies that are not eligible for expedited review under category (8)(a) at the time of continuing review may be eligible for expedited review under one of the other expedited review categories. For example, if a study\'s only remaining activity involves long-term follow-up of subjects by drawing 15 ml of blood once annually for a test that is not part of routine clinical practice, such research would not be eligible for expedited review under category (8)(a), but might be eligible for expedited review under category (2).\n\nExpedited review category (8)(b)\n\nIRBs conducting continuing review should be aware that if a study previously received expedited continuing review under category (8)(b), but has now begun enrolling subjects, the study may need to be referred for review by the IRB at a convened meeting. The criterion that ""no additional risks have been identified"" is interpreted by FDA to mean that neither the investigator nor the IRB has identified any additional risks in the research from any relevant source20 since the IRB\'s most recent prior review.\n\nFootnote 20: For example, “any relevant source” would include a review of scientific literature or adverse event reports by the IRB or investigator, as well as communication with FDA or the sponsor.\n\nExpedited review category (8)(c)\n\nFDA notes that the process for conducting continuing review of research eligible under expedited review category (8)(c) can be accomplished through a simple, abbreviated process. For example, if the study is no longer enrolling subjects, all subjects have completed all protocol required visits, and no new data is being collected, and the investigator\'s sole activity is data analysis, the investigator, as part of the continuing review process, could provide to the IRB the following statement regarding the research: ""The study only involves data analysis, which is proceeding in accordance with the IRB-approved research protocol, and there are no problems to report."" This statement could be provided by email or as part of a standard continuing review application form. Upon receipt of such a statement from the investigator, the IRB chairperson, or other member(s) designated by the chairperson, under the expedited review procedure, may approve continuation of the research project for another year without further deliberation or review.\n\nOnce the data collection from all trial sites is complete and the overall study results database has been locked and the only remaining activity is analysis of the aggregate data by the study sponsor, further continuing review of the research is generally no longer required.\n\n4.4.2 Expedited Review Category (9)\n\nSimilar to review category (1)21 for initial review, under category (9), an expedited review procedure may be used for the continuing review of research previously approved by the IRB at a convened meeting that meets the following conditions:\n\nFootnote 21: Category 1 research addresses “(1) Clinical studies of drugs and medical devices only when condition (a) or (b) is met: (a) Research on drugs for which an investigational new drug application (21 CFR Part 312) is not required. (Note: Research on marketed drugs that significantly increases the risks or decreases the acceptability of the risks associated with the use of the product is not eligible for expedited review.)\n\nThe research is not conducted under an investigational new drug (IND) application or an investigational device exemption (IDE);\n\nExpedited review categories (2) through (8) do not apply to the research;\n\nThe IRB has documented at a convened meeting that the research involves no greater than minimal risk to the subjects; and\n\nNo additional risks have been identified.\n\nWith regard to the third condition, the IRB at a convened meeting must have determined that either (a) the research project as a whole involved no more than minimal risk, or (b) the remaining research activities present no more than minimal risk to human subjects. With regard to multi-site studies, the fourth condition, that no additional risks have been identified, is interpreted to mean that neither the investigator nor the IRB at a particular institution has identified any additional risks of the research based on information from any other institution engaged in the research project or from any other relevant source since the IRB\'s most recent prior review.\n\nFrequency of Continuing Review\n\nUnder 21 CFR 56.108(a)(2) and 56.109(f), the IRB must determine the frequency of continuing review for each clinical investigation to ensure the continued protection of the rights and welfare of research subjects. FDA regulations at 21 CFR 56.109(f) require an IRB to conduct continuing review of research at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk posed to the subjects, but not less than once a year.\n\nMore frequent review (i.e., more frequently than once per year) is appropriate, for example, when the risks to subjects require close monitoring. The IRB should consider the factors set forth below when deciding on an appropriate interval for continuing review. These factors should be outlined in the IRB\'s written procedures for deciding on the frequency of continuing review:\n\nThe nature of and any risks posed by the clinical investigation;\n\nThe degree of uncertainty regarding the risks involved;\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe vulnerability of the subject population;\n\nThe experience of the clinical investigator in conducting clinical research;\n\nThe IRB\'s previous experience with that investigator and/or sponsor (e.g., compliance history, previous problems with the investigator obtaining informed consent, prior complaints from subjects about the investigator);\n\nThe projected rate of enrollment; and\n\nWhether the study involve novel therapies.\n\nAt the time of initial approval of the study, FDA recommends that the IRB notify the investigator of the interval at which continuing review will occur (at least annually) and the date by which continuing review must occur. Similarly, at the time of continuing review, the IRB should consider whether the current frequency of continuing review for the study is adequate or should be adjusted. In addition to specifying a time interval, the IRB may also specify a subject enrollment number as a threshold for determining when continuing review is to occur. For example, at the time of initial review and approval of a high-risk clinical trial, the IRB might require that continuing review occur either in 6 months or after 5 subjects have been enrolled, whichever occurs first. However, if the continuing review interval is described in relation to a subject enrollment number, it must at a minimum also provide for continuing review annually, regardless of the number of subjects enrolled at that time; it is therefore not acceptable to describe the review interval solely in relation to a number of subjects enrolled. The minutes of IRB meetings should clearly document the approval period (continuing review interval).\n\nThe IRB\'s determinations regarding the approval of research must be communicated to the investigator in writing (21 CFR 56.109(e)). This written determination should also notify the investigator of the required interval for, and expected date of, continuing review.\n\nDetermining the Effective Date of Initial IRB Approval and the Dates for Continuing Review\n\nContinuing review must occur at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less frequently than once per year (21 CFR 56.109(f)). IRBs should establish written procedures for informing investigators of the FDA\'s regulations and the IRB\'s own policies and procedures on continuing review requirements. (See 21 CFR 56.108(a)(1) & (2).) This applies whether a study is reviewed by the convened IRB or through an expedited process.\n\nThe IRB\'s written procedures should describe how the IRB determines the effective date of approval for the study and how the date and period of approval will be communicated to the clinical investigator.\n\nWhen the IRB Reviews and Initially Approves Research Without Conditions at a\n\nConvened Meeting\n\nWhen the IRB conducts the initial review of a study at a convened meeting and approves the research for one year without requiring either (a) changes to the protocol or informed consent document(s), or (b) submission of clarifications or additional documents, the effective date of the initial approval is the date of that IRB meeting. In such circumstances, the expiration date of theinitial approval period and the date by which the first continuing review must occur may be as late as one year after the date of the IRB meeting at which the research initially was approved (21 CFR 56.109(f)).\n\nWhen the IRB Reviews and Initially Approves Research With Conditions at a Convened IRB Meeting Without Requiring Further Review at a Subsequent Convened Meeting\n\nA much more common scenario is when an IRB conducting the initial review of a research project at a convened meeting takes the following set of actions:\n\nApproves the project for one year;\n--------------------\nContext title: IRB Continuing Review After Clinical Investigation Approval Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: This formal review of the research effort, as required under 21 CFR 56.109(f), is the subject of this guidance. An IRB must review previously approved research at least once a year (21 CFR 56.109(f)). Review must be conducted at convened meetings at which a majority of the IRB members are present, including at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas, unless the research qualifies for review through an expedited process (21 CFR 56.108(c) and 56.110). See Section III.D. of this guidance for more information on the application of expedited review procedures to continuing review.\n\nIRBs involved in multi-site studies may find it difficult to conduct a thorough review with data solely from the site(s) under their purview and may need to obtain study-wide information. Sponsors are in the unique position of having information for the entire study6 and may provide it to investigators, who in turn provide it to the IRBs. FDA's regulations do not prohibit sponsors from providing study-wide information directly to IRBs.7 FDA encourages efforts by investigators and sponsors to ensure that IRBs receive meaningful study-wide information, particularly when doing so may assist IRBs in reviewing the studies and protecting subjects.\n\nFootnote 6: See FDA’s Guidance for Industry, “Adverse Event Reporting to IRBs – Improving Human Subject Protection,” http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126572.pdf.\n\nFootnote 7: Note that FDA’s regulations for device studies specifically assign general responsibility to sponsors “...for ensuring IRB review and approval are obtained and ensuring that any reviewing IRB and FDA are promptly informed of significant new information about an investigation...” 21 CFR 812.40.\n\nOne way to enable a useful continuing review of multi-site studies while reducing or eliminating duplication of effort is through the use of cooperative review agreements or other mechanisms (e.g., using a centralized IRB review process), in accordance with 21 CFR 56.114. Cooperative agreements may vary with respect to how continuing review will be carried out. For example, some agreements may designate a specific IRB as having primary responsibility for continuing review of an investigation.8 Other agreements may assign responsibility for local issues to the institution's IRB, but assign the remaining aspects of continuing review to a central IRB.\n\nFootnote 8: See FDA’s Guidance for Industry, “Using a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials,” http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm080606.pdf.\n\nWhatever the arrangement, the IRB(s) responsible for continuing review of multi-site studies may find it helpful to obtain and review information across the entire study. For additional discussion, see Section III.B. of this guidance.\n\nAppendix A Criteria for Approving Research During Continuing Review\n\nFDA regulations set forth the criteria for IRB approval of research (21 CFR 56.111). These criteria apply to both initial review and continuing review. In order to approve research, the IRB must determine that all of following requirements are satisfied:\n\nRisks to subjects are minimized;\n\nRisks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may be expected to result;\n\nSelection of subjects is equitable;\n\nInformed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and appropriately documented;\n\nWhere appropriate, the research plan adequately provides for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects;\n\nWhere appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data;\n\nAppropriate additional safeguards are included to protect vulnerable subjects; and\n\nWhere the study involves children, the research complies with 21 CFR part 50, Subpart D.\n\nThe IRB makes its continuing review determination by considering whether any new information is available that would affect the IRB's prior finding that the research meets the criteria in 21 CFR 56.111. IRBs have authority to disapprove or require modifications in (to secure re- approval of) a research activity that does not meet any of the above criteria (e.g., the full study or any part thereof, such as changes to the protocol, advertisements; 21 CFR 56.109(a))\n\nAppendix B Process for Conducting Continuing Review\n\nContinuing review takes place at a convened meeting of the IRB, unless it meets the criteria for expedited review under 21 CFR 56.110. (See 21 CFR 56.108(c) and Section III.D. of this guidance.) The IRB is required to review the research (21 CFR 56.109(f)) and must maintain records of its continuing review activities, including minutes of meetings at which such activities are undertaken (21 CFR 56.115(a)(2) and (3)). The minutes must be in sufficient detail to show actions taken by the IRB, and the vote on these actions, and to summarize the discussion of controverted issues and their resolution (21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)). For research to be approved, a majority of IRB members present at a meeting must approve it (21 CFR 56.108(c)).\n\nThe IRB must ensure that a member does not participate in the IRB's continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB (21 CFR 56.107(e)). Meeting minutes must reflect meeting attendance, the votes taken, and a summary of the discussion and resolution of controverted issues, and should provide confirmation that conflicted members did not participate in the IRB's continuing review of their studies (21 CFR 56.115((a)(2)). FDA recommends that IRB members with a conflicting interest in a project recuse themselves by leaving the meeting room when the IRB conducts continuing review of that project, except when requested by the IRB to be present to provide information.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThis IRB member recusal should be noted in the minutes of the IRB meeting when recording votes on IRB actions.\n\nAn IRB must maintain and follow written procedures for the continuing review of research (21 CFR 56.108(a)(1) and 56.115(a)(6)). In developing procedures for continuing review, the IRB should consider the use of templates, checklists, or other tools to standardize the request for information or list of materials to be provided to the IRB at the time of continuing review.\n\nInvestigators are responsible for ensuring that studies they conduct comply with applicable regulatory requirements.9 To ensure that the reviewing IRB can carry out its review prior to the expiration date of the current IRB approval, investigators should follow the IRB's policies and procedures for continuing IRB review of research (procedures required by 21 CFR 56.108(a)(1)), in particular by submitting materials and information required by the IRB. FDA encourages IRBs to make investigators aware of the IRB's procedures, for example, by enclosing a copy in correspondence informing the investigator of the IRB's decisions, or posting the information on a website.\n\nFootnote 9: See 21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vii), 312.60, 312.66, 812.36(c)(viii), 812.100, 812.110(b), 812.40, and 812.43(c)(4)(i).\n\nFDA recommends that the IRB's written procedures call for submission of the following information for consideration by the IRB in continuing review, if not already available to the IRB as part of the existing IRB records for the research10:\n\nFootnote 10: Some of this information may come from the sponsor, who would have access to data across all study sites. Sponsors may provide information directly to IRBs or to the clinical investigators who in turn would share it with the IRBs.\n\nA written progress report/brief project summary that includes the following or references other documents made available to the IRB:\n\nThe number of subjects accrued; (For multi-site studies, the number of subjects accrued at the local site and the number accrued study-wide, if available, should be provided.)\n\nA brief summary of any amendments to the research approved by the IRB since the IRB's initial review or the last continuing review;\n\nAny new and relevant information, published or unpublished, since the last IRB review, especially information about risks associated with the research; (Note that FDA does not expect the IRB to perform an independent review of the relevant scientific literature related to a particular research project undergoing continuing review.)\n\nA summary of any unanticipated problems.11 In many cases, such a summary could be a brief statement that there have been no unanticipated problems (i.e., adverse events have occurred at the expected frequency and level of severity as documented in the research protocol, the informed consent document, and Investigator's Brochure (if applicable)); *\n(\\circ) A summary of any subject withdrawals from the research since the last IRB review, and the reasons for withdrawal, if known; and (\\circ) A summary of any complaints about the research from subjects enrolled at the local site since the last IRB review;\n\nThe latest version of the protocol and sample informed consent document(s) in use at the site;\n\nAny proposed modifications to the informed consent document or protocol;\n\nThe current Investigator's Brochure, if any, including any modifications;\n--------------------\nContext title: IRB Continuing Review After Clinical Investigation Approval Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nInstitutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/institutional-review-boards-frequently-asked-questions)\n\nOffice of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nThe following is a compilation of answers to questions asked of FDA regarding the protection of human subjects of research. For ease of reference, the numbers assigned to the questions are consecutive throughout this section. These questions and answers are organized as follows.\n\nI. IRB Organization\n\nII. IRB Membership\n\nIII. IRB Procedures\n\nIV. IRB Records\n\nV. Informed Consent Process\n\nVI. Informed Consent Document Content\n\nVII. Clinical Investigations\n\nVIII. General Questions\n\nI. IRB Organization\n\nWhat is an Institutional Review Board (IRB)?\n\nUnder FDA regulations, an IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects. In accordance with FDA regulations, an IRB has the authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove research. This group review serves an important role in the protection of the rights and welfare of human research subjects.\n\nThe purpose of IRB review is to assure, both in advance and by periodic review, that appropriate steps are taken to protect the rights and welfare of humans participating as subjects in the research. To accomplish this purpose, IRBs use a group process to review research protocols and related materials (e.g., informed consent documents and investigator brochures) to ensure protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects of research.\n\n2 Do IRBs have to be formally called by that name?\n\nNo, ""IRB"" is a generic term used by FDA (and HHS) to refer to a group whose function is to review research to assure the protection of the rights and welfare of the human subjects. Each institution may use whatever name it chooses. Regardless of the name chosen, the IRB is subject to the Agency\'s IRB regulations when studies of FDA regulated products are reviewed and approved.\n\n3 Does an IRB need to register with FDA before approving studies?\n\nAs published in the Federal Register on January 15, 2009, (74 FR 2358), 21 CFR Part 56, Institutional Review Boards, was amended with regard to IRB registration (21 CFR 56.106). This amendment requires each IRB in the United States (U.S.) that reviews FDA-regulated studies to register. IRB registration information is entered into an Internet-based registration system maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). (See Guidance for Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) Frequently Asked Questions - IRB Registration (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/frequently-asked-questions-irb-registration)).\n\n4 What is an ""assurance"" or a ""multiple project assurance?""\n\nAn ""assurance,"" is a document negotiated between an institution and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in accordance with HHS regulations. For research involving human subjects conducted by HHS or supported in whole or in part by HHS, the HHS regulations require a written assurance from the performance-site institution that the institution will comply with the HHS protection of human subjects regulations [45 CFR part 46]. The assurance mechanism is described in 45 CFR 46.103. Once an institution\'s assurance has been approved by HHS, a number is assigned to the assurance. The assurance may be for a single grant or contract (a ""single project assurance""); for multiple grants (""multiple project assurances"" - formerly called ""general assurances""); or for certain types of studies such as oncology group studies and AIDS research group studies (""cooperative project assurances""). The Office for Human Research Protection (OHRP) is responsible for implementing the HHS regulations. The address and telephone number for OHRP are: 1101 Wootton Parkway, The Tower Building, Suite 200, Rockville, MD 20852; Toll-Free Telephone within the U.S.: (866) 447-4777, Telephone: (240) 453-6900, FAX: (240) 453-6909.\nCurrently, FDA regulations do not require an assurance. FDA regulations [21 CFR parts 50 and 56] apply to research involving products regulated by FDA - federal funds and/or support do not need to be involved for the FDA regulations to apply. When research studies involving products regulated by FDA are funded/supported by HHS, the research institution must comply with both the HHS and FDA regulations. [A table of significant differences between 45 CFR Part 46, Subpart A and 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 (/science-research/good-clinical-practice-educational-materials/comparison-fda-and-hhs-human-subject-protection-regulations) is available on the FDA website.]\n\n6 Must an institution establish its own IRB?\n\nNo. Although institutions engaged in research involving human subjects will usually have their own IRBs to oversee research conducted within the institution or by the staff of the institution, FDA regulations permit an institution without an IRB to arrange for an ""outside"" IRB to be responsible for initial and continuing review of studies conducted at the non-IRB institution. Such arrangements should be documented in writing. Individuals conducting research in a non-institutional setting often use established IRBs (independent or institutional) rather than form their own IRBs. Also see the information sheets entitled ""Non-local IRB Review"" and ""Cooperative Research.""\n\n7 May a hospital IRB review a study that will be conducted outside of the hospital?\n\nYes. IRBs may agree to review research from affiliated or unaffiliated investigators, however, FDA does not require IRBs to assume this responsibility. If the IRB routinely conducts these reviews, the IRB policies should authorize such reviews and the process should be described in the IRB\'s written procedures. A hospital IRB may review outside studies on an individual basis when the minutes clearly show the members are aware of where the study is to be conducted and when the IRB possesses appropriate knowledge about the study site(s).\n\n8 May IRB members be paid for their services?\n\nThe FDA regulations do not preclude a member from being compensated for services rendered. Payment to IRB members should not be related to or dependent upon a favorable decision. Expenses, such as travel costs, may also be reimbursed.\n\n9 What is the FDA role in IRB liability in malpractice suits?\n\nFDA regulations do not address the question of IRB or institutional liability in the case of malpractice suits. FDA does not have authority to limit liability of IRBs or their members. Compliance with FDA regulations may help minimize an IRB\'s exposure to liability.\nThe fundamental purpose of IRB review of informed consent is to assure that the rights and welfare of subjects are protected. A signed informed consent document is evidence that the document has been provided to a prospective subject (and presumably, explained) and that the subject has agreed to participate in the research. IRB review of informed consent documents also ensures that the institution has complied with applicable regulations.\n\n11. Does an IRB or institution have to compensate subjects if injury occurs as a result of participation in a research study?\n\nInstitutional policy, not FDA regulation, determines whether compensation and medical treatment(s) will be offered and the conditions that might be placed on subject eligibility for compensation or treatment(s). The FDA informed consent regulation on compensation [21] CFR 50.25(a)(6)] requires that, for research involving more than minimal risk, the subject must be told whether any compensation and any medical treatment(s) are available if injury occurs and, if so, what they are, or where further information may be obtained. Any statement that compensation is not offered must avoid waiving or appearing to waive any of the subject\'s rights or releasing or appearing to release the investigator, sponsor, or institution from liability for negligence [21] CFR 50.20].\n\nII IRB Membership\n\n12. May a clinical investigator be an IRB member?\n\nYes, however, the IRB regulations [21] CFR 56.107(e)] prohibit any member from participating in the IRB\'s initial or continuing review of any study in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB. When selecting IRB members, the potential for conflicts of interest should be considered. When members frequently have conflicts and must absent themselves from deliberation and abstain from voting, their contributions to the group review process may be diminished and could hinder the review procedure. Even greater disruptions may result if this person is chairperson of the IRB.\n\n13. The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n\nYes. For example, one member could be otherwise unaffiliated with the institution and have a primary concern in a non-scientific area. This individual would satisfy two of the membership requirements of the regulations. IRBs should strive, however, for a membership that has a diversity of representative capacities and disciplines. In fact, the FDA regulations [21] CFR 56.107(a)] require that, as part of being qualified as an IRB, the IRB must have ""... diversity of members, including consideration of race, gender, cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes....""\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators'

When there is a problem that justifies a recall, firms generally recall such food products from the marketplace voluntarily.\n\nAppendix B Types of Foods That Fall Under the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the FD&C Act\n\nWhat types of foods do the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act apply to?\n\nAll packaged foods, including dietary supplements, in the United States or its territories and subject to FDA regulations, that are domestically manufactured or imported into the United States, are covered by the allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act (except most meat, poultry, catfish, and certain processed egg products2). (See section on dietary supplements below.)\n\nFootnote 2: Most meat (Federal Meat Inspection Act Public law 91-201, 21 U.S.C. 601-624), poultry (Poultry Products Inspection Act Public Law 90-492, 21 U.S.C. 451-471), catfish (Federal Meat Inspection Act Public law 91-201, 21 U.S.C. 601-624), and certain processed egg products (Egg Products Inspection Act Public Law 91-597, 21 U.S.C. 1031-1056) are regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Please see USDA\'s website for information about labeling of allergens in these foods.\n\nAre molluscan shellfish considered a major food allergen under the FD&C Act?\n\nNo. Under section 201(qq) of the FD&C Act, Crustacean shellfish (such as crab, lobster, or shrimp) and ingredients that contain protein derived from Crustacean shellfish are major food allergens, but molluscan shellfish (such as oysters, clams, mussels, or scallops) are not.\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance ""Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).""\n\nAre raw agricultural commodities, such as fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state, subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n\nNo. Raw agricultural commodities, such as fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state, are not subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act.\n\nAre packaged meat, poultry, catfish, and processed egg products regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and alcohol products regulated by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n\nNo. The food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act apply only to those foods regulated by FDA under the FD&C Act. We recommend that producers of meat, poultry, catfish, processed egg, and alcohol products regulated by USDA and TTB contact the appropriate agency regarding the labeling of such products.3\n\nFootnote 3: For information regarding jurisdiction of alcoholic beverages please see the FDA’s beer labeling guidance https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-labeling-certain-beers-subject-labeling-jurisdiction-food-and-drug-administration and the 1974 Memorandum of Understanding Between The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and The Food and Drug Administration regarding the Promulgation and Enforcement of the Labeling Regulations Promulgated under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act: https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/domestic-mous/distilled-spirits\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance ""Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).""- See the draft guidance ""Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergens Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).""\n* See the draft guidance ""Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).""\n\nAppendix C Food Sources\n\nThe questions in this section give additional information on the terms that must be used to declare major food allergens on the label. The FD&C Act requires that the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived be declared on the label as follows:\n\nMilk\n\nEgg\n\nThe specific species of fish (e.g., bass, flounder, tilapia, salmon or cod)\n\nThe specific species of Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, or shrimp)\n\nThe specific type of tree nut (e.g., almond, pecans, or walnuts)\n\nWheat\n\nPeanuts\n\nSoybeans\n\nSesame (effective date January 1, 2023)\n\nSee the draft guidance ""Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergens and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).""\n\nDo the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act provide any specific direction for declaring the presence of ingredients from the three food groups that are designated as major food allergens (i.e., tree nuts, fish, and Crustacean shellfish)?\n\nYes. Section 403(w) of the FD&C Act requires that the specific type of tree nut be declared (e.g., almonds, pecans, or walnuts). It also requires that the species must be declared for fish (e.g., bass, flounder, or cod) and Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, or shrimp) (section 403(w)(2) of the FD&C Act). This means the ingredient list or the ""Contains"" statement cannot broadly declare ""tree nuts,"" ""fish,"" or ""Crustacean shellfish"" as the major food allergen.\n\nFor the purposes of the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act, what is the ""species"" of fish or Crustacean shellfish?For the ingredient list, manufacturers should declare the acceptable market name or the common name provided in FDA\'s Seafood List as the ""species"" of fish or Crustacean shellfish. Both names may alternatively be used as the statement of identity. However, for the ""Contains"" statement, in addition to one of these names being used, manufacturers may use the generic name, e.g., Salmon for Chum Salmon or Flounder for Peacock or Tropical Flounder. FDA\'s Seafood List of acceptable market names for imported and domestically available seafood is available at https://www.cfsanappsexternal.fda.gov/scripts/fdcc/?set=SeafoodList\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance ""Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).""\n\nFor the purposes of complying with the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act, what is ""wheat""?\n\nIs it acceptable to use a singular term to satisfy the food allergen labeling requirements if the FD&C Act identifies a major food allergen using a plural term?\n\nYes. FDA considers it acceptable to use a singular term even if the FD&C Act identifies the major food allergen using a plural term. For example, it is acceptable to use ""peanut"" rather than ""peanuts"" or ""almond, pecan, or walnut"" rather than ""almonds, pecans, or walnuts,"" respectively.\n\nAre there synonyms for the common or usual name ""soybeans"" for the purpose of satisfying the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act in some circumstances?\n\nYes. ""Soybean,"" ""soy,"" and ""soya"" are reasonable synonyms for the common or usual name ""soybeans,"" and any one of these terms may be used to identify the food source of the major food allergen ""soybeans"" as appropriate.\n\nAppendix D The Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the FD&C Act\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance ""Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).""Are single ingredient foods required to comply with the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n\nYes. Single ingredient foods must comply with the food allergen labeling requirements in section 403(w)(1) of the FD&C Act. A single ingredient food that is, or contains, protein derived from milk, egg, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, or soybeans, may identify the food source in the Statement of Identity, i.e., name of the food (e.g., ""All-purpose wheat flour""), or use the ""Contains"" statement format. Because a single-ingredient food does not require an ingredient list, FDA recommends that if a ""Contains"" statement format is used for a retail package, the statement be placed immediately above the manufacturer, packer, or distributor statement. For single ingredient foods intended for further manufacturing where the ""Contains"" statement format is used, we recommend that the Contains statement be placed on the front of the package of the food near the statement of identity. See Figure 5 below.\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance ""Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).""\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance ""Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).""\n\nFigure 1: Example of a single ingredient food intended for further manufacturing where the “Contains” statement is on the front of the food package.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergen Labeling (Edition 5)'

The use of the word should in FDA guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. Statutory Authority\n\nThe Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) (Title II of Public Law 108-282) amended the FD&C Act by defining the term ""major food allergen"" and stating that foods regulated under the FD&C Act are misbranded unless they declare the presence of each major food allergen on the product label using the common or usual name of that major food allergen. Section 201(qq) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(qq)) now defines a major food allergen as ""[m]ilk, egg, fish (e.g., bass, flounder, or cod), Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, or shrimp), tree nuts (e.g., almonds, pecans, or walnuts), wheat, peanuts, and soybeans"" and also as a food ingredient that contains protein derived from these foods. The definition excludes any highly refined oil derived from a major food allergen and any ingredient derived from such highly refined oil.\n\nIn some cases, the production of an ingredient derived from a major food allergen may alter or eliminate the allergenic proteins in that derived ingredient to such an extent that it does not contain allergenic protein. In addition, a major food allergen may be used as an ingredient or as a component of an ingredient such that the level of allergenic protein in finished food products does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health. Therefore, FALCPA provides two mechanisms through which such ingredients may become exempt from the labeling requirement of section 403(w)(1) of the FD&C Act. An ingredient may obtain an exemption through submission and approval of a petition containing scientific evidence that demonstrates that the ingredient ""does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health"" (section 403(w)(6) of the FD&C Act). This section also states that ""the burden shall be on the petitioner to provide scientific evidence (including the analytical method used to produce the evidence) that demonstrates that such food ingredient, as derived by the method specified in the petition, does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health."" Alternately, an ingredient may become exempt through submission of a notification containing scientific evidence showing that the ingredient ""does not contain allergenic protein"" or that there has been a previous determination through a premarket approval process under section 409 of the FD&C Act that the ingredient ""does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health"" (section 403(w)(7) of the FD&C Act).\n\nTo evaluate these petitions and notifications, we will consider scientific evidence that describes:\n\nThe identity or composition of the ingredient;\n\nThe methods used to produce the ingredient;\n\nThe methods used to characterize the ingredient;\n\nThe intended use of the ingredient in food; and\n\nFor a petition, data and information, including the expected level of consumer exposure to the ingredient, that demonstrate that the ingredient when manufactured and used as described does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health; or 5b. For a notification, data and information that demonstrate that the ingredient when manufactured as described does not contain allergenic protein, or documentation of a previous determination under a process pursuant to section 409 of the FD&C Act that the ingredient does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health.\n\nWe will evaluate this scientific evidence only for the specific ingredient and specific use(s) identified in the submission.\n\nFDA recognizes that there are several methods that can be used to demonstrate that an ingredient meets the standards in 403(w)(6) and 403(w)(7) of the FD&C Act. Each submitter may determine which approach is most appropriate for the specific ingredient and specific use(s) identified in the submission.\n\n3 Recommendations for Preparing Submissions\n\nDetermining Need for Submission\n\nThe following points should be considered in determining whether to submit a petition or notification:\n\nAn ingredient derived from a major food allergen that does not contain protein is not subject to the labeling requirements described in section 403(w)(1) of the FD&C Act. We are aware that there are some technologies (e.g., distillation) that may be able to produce protein-free ingredients because of the nature of the process and fundamental biochemical properties of proteins, peptides, and amino acids. When other technologies are used to produce an ingredient, information and expertise available to the manufacturer should make it possible to identify and apply the appropriate analytic methods to ensure that the ingredient does not contain protein. The methods used should be shown to be sufficiently accurate and sensitive under the conditions of use, including consideration of extraction efficiencies and possible interferences, should be scientifically appropriate, and sufficiently sensitive to demonstrate that no proteins or peptide fragments are present in the ingredient. Manufacturers should also consider potential batch to batch variation in the composition of the ingredient. Manufacturers may discuss methodological issues with us.\n\nA petition should be used to demonstrate that an ingredient derived from a major food allergen that may contain allergenic proteins, or derivatives of allergenic proteins such as peptide fragments, does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health in food allergic individuals.\n\nA notification should be used to demonstrate that an ingredient that may contain proteins or protein fragments derived from a major food allergen does not contain allergenic protein.\n\nGeneral\n\nEach submission should contain information identifying the organization and individual primarily responsible for the submission. This should include the name of the individual and organization, a complete mailing address, a physical address if this differs from the mailing address, phone and fax numbers, and an electronic mail (email) address for the organization and for a primary contact. A joint submission from several organizations should include complete information for each organization.\n\nIngredient Description\n\nFor the purposes of this guidance document, ingredients include substances that are-\n\nDerived (e.g., through chemical, biochemical, mechanical, fermentation or bioengineering processes) from a major food allergen and that contain proteins or peptides\n\nA submission should provide a complete description of the ingredient including-\n\nBoth the common or usual name and any scientific name(s) of the ingredient;\n\nThe major food allergen source of the ingredient, if this is not obvious from the name, or the major food allergen sources used in the manufacture or engineering of the ingredient;\n\nThe chemical and biological properties or characteristics of the ingredient including molecular structure, sequence, etc., as appropriate;\n\nAny existing food standards of identity or specifications for the ingredient, such as from the FDA\'s food standards of identity regulations, Food Chemicals Codex, or Codex Alimentarius; and\n\nThe composition of the ingredient, including the methods used to determine composition, and batch-to-batch variation in composition should be described. If the ingredient contains more than one component, all components, including non-allergens, (including carriers or diluents), as well as the relative proportion of each in the ingredient should be described.\n\nIngredient Preparation or Manufacture\n\nThe method(s) or procedure(s) used to prepare or manufacture the ingredient should be described completely, particularly those steps that alter the amount, relative composition, or biochemical state of the proteins present. This description should include, for example-\n\nsuch as grinding, pressing, filtration;\n\nsuch as heating, cooking, baking, retorting;\n\nsuch as solvent extraction, hydrolysis (both enzymatic and non-enzymatic), cross-linking;\n\nsuch as the composition of the growth or nutrient media used in the manufacture of enzymes or organisms; and/or\n\nsuch as details of the construct, transformation event, and DNA and amino acid sequences.\n\nThe description of the manufacturing or preparation process should include-\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications'

Examples of manufacturing/processing activities include: Baking, boiling, bottling, canning, cooking, cooling, cutting, distilling, drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating grapes to produce raisins), evaporating, eviscerating, extracting juice, extruding, formulating, freezing, grinding, homogenizing, irradiating, labeling, milling, mixing, packaging (including modified atmosphere packaging), pasteurizing, peeling, pelleting, rendering, treating to manipulate ripening, trimming, washing, or waxing. For farms and farm mixed-type facilities, manufacturing/processing does not include activities that are part of harvesting, packing, or holding.\n\nMicroorganisms means yeasts, molds, bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and microscopic parasites and includes species that are pathogens. The term ""undesirable microorganisms"" includes those microorganisms that are pathogens, that subject animal food to decomposition, that indicate that animal food is contaminated with filth, or that otherwise may cause animal food to be adulterated.\n\nMonitor means to conduct a planned sequence of observations or measurements to assess whether control measures are operating as intended.\n\nPacking means placing animal food into a container other than packaging the animal food and also includes repacking and activities performed incidental to packing or repacking an animal food (e.g., activities performed for the safe or effective packing or repacking of that animal food (such as sorting, culling, grading, and weighing or conveying incidental to packing or repacking)), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n\nPathogen means a microorganism of public (human or animal) health significance.\n\nPest refers to any objectionable animals or insects including birds, rodents, flies, and larvae.\n\nPlant means the building or structure, or parts thereof, used for or in connection with the manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding of animal food.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPreventive controls means those risk-based, reasonably appropriate procedures, practices, and processes that a person knowledgeable about the safe manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding of animal food would employ to significantly minimize or prevent the hazards identified under the hazard analysis that are consistent with the current scientific understanding of safe food manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding at the time of the analysis.\n\nQualified individual means a person who has the education, training, or experience (or a combination thereof) necessary to manufacture, process, pack, or hold safe animal food as appropriate to the individual\'s assigned duties. A qualified individual may be, but is not required to be, an employee of the establishment.\n\nRework means clean, unadulterated animal food that has been removed from processing for reasons other than insanitary conditions or that has been successfully reconditioned by reprocessing and that is suitable for use as animal food.\n\nSanitize means to adequately treat cleaned surfaces by a process that is effective in destroying vegetative cells of pathogens, and in substantially reducing numbers of other undesirable microorganisms, but without adversely affecting the product or its safety for animals or humans.\n\nSignificantly minimize means to reduce to an acceptable level, including to eliminate.\n\nSmall business means, for purposes of 21 CFR part 507, a business (including any subsidiaries and affiliates) employing fewer than 500 full-time equivalent employees.\n\nVery small business means, for purposes of 21 CFR part 507, a business (including any subsidiaries and affiliates) averaging less than $2,500,000, adjusted for inflation, per year, during the 3-year period preceding the applicable calendar year in sales of animal food plus the market value of animal food manufactured, processed, packed, or held without sale (e.g., held for a fee or supplied to a farm without sale).\n\nWater activity ((\\mathrm{a_{w}})) means a measure of the free moisture in an animal food and is the quotient of the water vapor pressure of the substance divided by the vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:38]\n\nPersonnel Qualification, Training, Responsibility Requirements\n\nNotes\n\nIndividuals who superviser or perform manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding activities for animal food must:\n\nbe a qualified individual (i.e., have the education, training, or experience (or a combination thereof) necessary to manufacture, process, pack, or hold safe animal food as appropriate to the individual\'s assigned duties) (507.4(b)(1); and\n\nreceive training in the principles of animal food hygiene and animal food safety. (507.4b)(2)\n\nThese requirements must be met even if the individual only works on a temporary or seasonal basis (507.4(b)).\n\nTraining in the principles of animal food hygiene and animal food safety must include information on the importance of employee health and personal hygiene, but the appropriate scope of the training depends on the animal food, facility and assigned duties (507.4(b)(2)). Facilities are required to keep records that document this training (507.4(d)).\n\nPersonnel Hygienic Practice Requirements\n\nNotes\n\nManagement of the establishment must take reasonable measures and precautions to ensure that all persons working in direct contact with animal food, animal food-contact surfaces, and animal food-packaging materials conform to hygienic practices as necessary to protect against the contamination of animal food (507.14(a)).

You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nAs originally enacted in 1938, section 403(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) requires that the label of a food that is fabricated from two or more ingredients declare each ingredient by its common or usual name (except that spices, flavorings, and noncertified colors can be declared as such) (21 U.S.C. 343(i)). However, consumers may be unfamiliar with the common or usual name of an ingredient and may not recognize that certain ingredients contain or are derived from a food allergen. The Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) (Public Law 108-282) was enacted in August 2004, and, in part, amended the FD&C Act by defining the term ""major food allergen"" (21 U.S.C. 321(qq)) and stating that foods regulated under the FD&C Act are misbranded unless they declare the presence of each major food allergen on the product label using the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived. Section 403(w)(1) of the FD&C Act sets forth the requirements for declaring the presence of each major food allergen on the product label. In addition, the Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education, and Research Act of 2021 (FASTER Act) (Public Law 117-11) was enacted in April 2021 and, in part, amended thedefinition of major food allergens in section 201(qq) of the FD&C Act to include sesame, effective January 1, 2023.\n\nThis is a revision of the fourth edition of a guidance document originally entitled ""Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004."" This revision contains questions and answers from the fourth edition that constitute final guidance, but with editorial changes, such as renumbering and organization. FDA expects to continue to issue subsequent editions of this guidance document by revising existing questions and answers and by adding new questions and answers.\n\nThis final guidance document accompanies the draft guidance document, Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5). In this pair of guidance documents, FDA is issuing the new or revised questions and answers in the draft guidance document, will receive comments on the draft questions and answers, and, as appropriate, will move the questions and answers to this final guidance document, after reviewing comments and incorporating suggested changes to the question and answer, when appropriate. Note that a question and answer that is in the final guidance document may be withdrawn and moved to a new or revised draft guidance document if FDA determines that the question and answer should be revised and reissued in draft for comment. A question and answer also may be withdrawn and removed from the guidance documents if, for instance, the issue addressed in the question and answer is addressed elsewhere. For ease of reference, a question and answer retains the same number when it moves from the draft guidance document to the final guidance document and we use the term ""RESFVED"" after each numbered question and answer, where appropriate, to facilitate this process.\n\nFor more information related to allergens, please see\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/Allergens/default.htm.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. Questions and Answers\n\nGeneral Information\n\nSee the draft guidance ""Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).""**\nAre there foods or food groups that are allergens, other than those designated as ""major food allergens"" under the FD&C Act?\n\nYes. FALCPA stated that the eight foods or food groups designated by FALCPA account for 90 percent of all food allergies in the United States at the time of its passage, but there are over 160 foods that have been reported to cause allergic reactions. Although sensitive individuals may react to other foods, the labels of packaged foods containing allergens from foods other than the major food allergens are not required to list the food source of those allergens in the way required by the FD&C Act.\n\nDo the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act require FDA to set so-called ""thresholds"" for any food allergen?\n\nNo, the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act do not require FDA to establish a threshold level for any food allergen. See https://www.fda.gov/food/food-labeling-nutrition/approaches-establish-thresholds-major-food-allergens-and-gluten-food.\n\nAs a manufacturer, is it possible to request that my food ingredient be exempt from food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n\nYes. Under section 403(w)(6) and (7) of the FD&C Act, any person can ask FDA for a labeling exemption for an ingredient derived from a major food allergen when it does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health or when it does not contain allergenic protein. A request for an exemption from food allergen labeling can be made either through a petition process or a notification process. See http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/ucm395494.htm\n\nThe petition process requires scientific evidence (including the analytical method used to produce the evidence) that demonstrates that the food ingredient described in the petition does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health. The notification process must include scientific evidence (including the analytical method used to produce the evidence) that demonstrates that the food ingredient described in the notification does not contain an allergenic protein or is the subject of a premarket approval or notification program under section 409 of the FD&C Act. If FDA grants the petition or does not object to the notification, then the ingredient is not considered a major food allergen and is not subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act.\n\nFor a list of petition and notification requests, see Inventory of Petitions Received under 21 U.S.C. 343(w)(6) for Exemptions from Food Allergen Labeling and Inventory of Notifications Received under 21 U.S.C. 343(w)(7) for Exemptions from Food Allergen Labeling.\n\nIs there a penalty for failure to comply with the food allergen labeling requirements under section 403(w) of the FD&C Act?\n\nYes. FDA can carry out a number of regulatory actions if a food label fails to comply with the food allergen labeling requirements under the FD&C Act. Such products are misbranded and subject to enforcement actions such as recalls, import refusal, and seizure by FDA. Food facilities making such food may be issued warning letters or put on FDA\'s import alerts. When there is a problem that justifies a recall, firms generally recall such food products from the marketplace voluntarily.\n\nAppendix B Types of Foods That Fall Under the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the FD&C Act\n\nWhat types of foods do the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act apply to?\n\nAll packaged foods, including dietary supplements, in the United States or its territories and subject to FDA regulations, that are domestically manufactured or imported into the United States, are covered by the allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act (except most meat, poultry, catfish, and certain processed egg products2). (See section on dietary supplements below.)\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergen Labeling (Edition 5)'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications , Are raw agricultural commodities, such as fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state, subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Person in Charge, the person in charge shall ensure that employees of the food establishment are properly trained in food safety, including food allergy awareness, as it relates to their assigned duties (Subparagraph 2.103.11(M)). This allows industry to develop and implement operational-specific training programs for food employees.\n\nFood Labels, label information for food that is packaged at the retail level includes the food allergen labeling provisions of the FD&C Act (Subparagraph 3-602.11(B)(5)).\n\nEquipment Food-Contact Surfaces and Utensils, cleaning and sanitizing frequency for food contact surfaces or utensils that are in contact with a raw animal food that is a major food allergen such as fish, followed by other types of raw animal foods are specified (Subparagraph 4-602.11).\n\nAdditional background information on food allergens in Annex 4, including common characteristics of a food allergic response and detailed information regarding the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act.\n\nDo the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act apply regardless of whether a jurisdiction has adopted the 2017 FDA Food Code?\n\nYes. FALCPA and the FASTER Act are federal laws that amended the FD&C Act. Thus, regardless of whether a jurisdiction has adopted the 2017 Food Code, the requirements of these laws apply to domestically manufactured or imported packaged foods regulated under the FD&C Act (see question B.1). FDA regulates all packaged foods except most meat, poultry, catfish, and certain processed egg products. These laws also preempt State and local laws, which means that other governmental entities (such as those at the state or local level) may not adopt labeling requirements that are not identical to those in section 403(w) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAppendix E Dietary Supplements\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance ""Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).""\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance ""Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).""\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance ""Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).""\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance ""Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).""\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance ""Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).""\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance ""Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).""\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance ""Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).""\n\nAppendix III Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n\nThis guidance document refers to previously approved collections of information found in federal laws.

28,"After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?","[""--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Yes, with two exceptions. The first is that the FDA requirements for IRBs under 21 CFR Part 56 are slightly different with respect to membership and function. To address this issue, as described in #12 above, FDA can provide a specific waiver from the Part 56 IRB requirements, allowing an IEC that complies with good clinical practice to substitute for the IRB.4 The second exception is that the requirements for informed consent under 21 CFR Part 50 for particular clinical trials (e.g., emergency research under 21 CFR 50.24, clinical investigations involving pediatric subjects under Subpart D) are more extensive with respect to IRB responsibilities. Because these types of trials are uncommon, our experience has not revealed that this has caused a conflict; but in the event of one, we would be willing to discuss a resolution with the sponsor on a case-by-case basis. If the investigator or sponsor believes that there are other conflicting requirements, the sponsor may request a waiver from FDA from the specific requirement under 21 CFR 312.10.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n14.  Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n\nNo. A multinational study may include domestic sites under the IND and foreign sites not under the IND.  Investigation drug and biologics studies conducted in the U.S. must be conducted in compliance with the IND requirements contained in 21 CFR 312, which includes the requirement that investigators sign the 1572.  If a study also involves foreign clinical sites, the sponsor may choose, but is not required, to include the foreign clinical sites under the IND.  The investigators from the U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND would be required to sign the 1572.  The investigators from the foreign sites that are not included under the IND are not required to sign the 1572.\n\nIf the sponsor chooses to conduct a multinational study with U.S. and some foreign sites under the IND, and other foreign sites not under the IND, the sponsor can submit a single protocol to the IND and all sites would follow this protocol.  Alternatively, the sponsor can conduct a multinational study with one protocol for sites under the IND (U.S. sites and some foreign sites) and a different protocol(s) for foreign sites not under the IND.  If the intent is to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites, the protocols would ordinarily be very similar or identical.  The U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND must follow the protocol that was submitted to the IND.  For foreign sites that are not included under the IND, the protocol(s) does not need to be submitted to the IND.  In general, if the sponsor intends to submit the data in an application for marketing approval, we recommend that the sponsor identify the foreign sites that will not be conducted under the IND and discuss plans to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites with the appropriate FDA review division.\n\nNote, however, that 21 CFR 312.32(b) requires sponsors to promptly review information about the safety of the investigational drug obtained or otherwise received by the sponsor from any source, foreign or domestic.  Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), sponsors must also notify FDA and all participating investigators in an IND safety report of any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected.  This means that FDA and all participating investigators under the IND would be informed of such an adverse experience, even if it occurred in a foreign study not conducted under the IND.\n\n15.  How does a sponsor submit information to FDA about a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND?\n\nUnder 21 CFR 312.120, the sponsor can submit information to FDA from a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND to support clinical investigations in the United States and/or marketing approval.  When submitting information about a foreign clinical study, it is helpful to clearly identify in the cover letter that the material is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120.  The submission requirements for supporting documentation can be found at 21 CFR 312.120(b).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n16. Should a new form be prepared and signed when the OMB expiration date is reached?\n\nNo. There is no need to prepare and sign a new 1572 when the OMB expiration date has been reached.\n\n17. Does FDA expect a double-sided 1572, or is a two-page document printed from the FDA website acceptable?\n\nEither is acceptable; however, FDA recommends that a two-page document be stapled so that there is no question about what form the investigator signed.\n\n18. How should the 1572 be completed?\n\nThe 1572 on FDA's website may be completed by typing the information directly into the fillable form and printing the completed form. Alternatively, it is acceptable to print the blank form from FDA's website and hand-write or type the information onto the form. Typed forms are preferable because they are usually more legible. The completed form must be signed and dated by the investigator (either by hand or using an acceptable electronic method).\n\nII. SECTION #1: NAME AND ADDRESS OF INVESTIGATOR\n\n19. How should an investigator's name appear on the 1572?\n\nSection #1 should contain the investigator's full legal name (e.g., name on the investigator's birth certificate or marriage certificate). Titles, degrees, and/or professional qualifications may follow the investigator's legal name, if desired.\n\n20. What address should be entered into Section #1?\n\nThe address where the investigator can be reached by mail or in person should be entered in Section #1 of the 1572. Usually, this corresponds to the investigator's work or business address.\n\n21. Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n\nThe term co-investigator is not defined in FDA regulations. As commonly used, the term is meant to indicate that each co-investigator is fully responsible for fulfilling all of the obligations of an investigator as identified in 21 CFR 312.60. Thus under 21 CFR 312.3(b), each co-investigator is an investigator, and as such must sign a separate 1572.\n\nIn some situations, it is preferable to have more than one investigator responsible for a clinical investigation. For example, when a study is conducted at multiple research facilities that are not in close proximity, FDA expects an investigator who has signed a 1572 to be available at each location to either personally conduct or supervise the study. This responsibility cannot be delegated to a subinvestigator.\n\nAlthough not necessary, it is acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site. For example, the conduct and supervision of a large investigation with many subjects or complicated procedures might be shared among several investigators, each of whom has signed a 1572 when the investigation is conducted under an IND. This is distinct from a subinvestigator (see #31) whose role in the clinical investigation is more limited.\n\nIII. SECTION #2: EDUCATION, TRAINING, AND EXPERIENCE THAT QUALIFY THE INVESTIGATOR AS AN EXERT IN THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION\n\n22. What is the purpose of Section #2?\n\nSection #2 requires the investigator to attach a curriculum vitae (CV) or other statement of qualifications, showing the education, training and experience that qualifies the investigator as an expert in the clinical investigation of the drug/biologic for the use under investigation. Information identified in this section and attached to the 1572 enables the sponsor to assess an investigator's qualifications.\n\n23. Does the CV or other statement of qualifications need to be updated during a clinical study?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV or other statement of qualifications to be updated during a clinical study.\n\n24. Are CVs required to be signed and dated?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV to be signed and dated. The investigator's dated signature on the 1572 is sufficient to attest to the accuracy of the CV or other statement of qualifications submitted with the 1572.\n\nIV. SECTION #3: NAME AND ADDRESS OF ANY MEDICAL SCHOOL. HOSPITAL, OR OTHER RESEARCH FACILITY WHERE THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION(S) WILL BE CONDUCTED\n\n25. What address(es) should be entered in Section #3?\n\nThe address(es) of the location(s) where the investigation will be conducted and to where the test articles will be shipped, if different from the investigator's address of record, should be entered in Section #3.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n26. What qualifies as a research facility for Section #3?\n\nSection #3 is intended to identify facilities where study activities will be conducted and clinical data will be generated or collected. This includes facilities where subjects will be seen and study procedures performed. For example, this might include locations such as health care facilities where the test article will be administered, or where physical exams will be performed. Facilities where other important clinical investigation functions are performed may also be identified in Section #3. For example, a research laboratory where the test article is prepared, a special storage facility where the test article will be kept, or a location where tissue specimens are collected should be listed in this section.\n\n27. If an investigator sees study subjects at more than one site, should the investigator list all sites on the 1572?\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions – Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572) Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Although FDA will not accept as support for an IND or application for marketing approval any study that does not meet the conditions of 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will examine the data from such a study because the data may have a bearing on the safe use of the product.9 Sponsors and applicants are reminded that they must submit all studies and other information as required under the applicable regulations for drugs,10 including studies that do not comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nFootnote 9: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(2); 73 Fed. Reg. at 22807.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nA sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived.11 When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with the requirements in 21 CFR 312.120 in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Under 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and if FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary.12 Note that marketing approval of a new drug based solely on foreign clinical data is governed by 21 CFR 314.106.\n\nFootnote 10: See, for example, 21 CFR 314.50, 314.80, 600.80, and 601.2.\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR part 312.\n\nThe GCP requirements at 21 CFR 312.120 help protect human subjects and enhance the quality and integrity of the resulting clinical data.13 They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.14 Many of the requirements at 21 CFR 312.120 are already incorporated into the IND regulations at 21 CFR part 312, as well as 21 CFR parts 50 and 56,15 and are consistent with certain international ethical and policy standards for clinical trials (e.g., International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) ""GoodClinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline"" (ICH E6), which FDA adopted for use as guidance for industry in 1997).16\n\nFootnote 16: ICH E6 and other FDA guidance documents adopted from the ICH are available electronically at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\n1 Acceptance of Studies (21 Cfr 312.120(a))\n\nFDA regulations define GCP as ""a standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials in a way that provides assurance that the data are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects are protected.""17\n\nFootnote 17: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(1)(i).\n\nGCP includes review and approval (or provision of a favorable opinion) by an independent ethics committee (IEC) before initiating a study, continuing review of an ongoing study by an IEC, and obtaining and documenting the freely given informed consent of the subject (or a subject\'s legally authorized representative, if the subject is unable to provide informed consent) before initiating a study.\n\nAs defined at 21 CFR 312.3(b), an IEC is ""a review panel that is responsible for ensuring the protection of the rights, safety, and well-being of human subjects involved in a clinical investigation, and is adequately constituted to provide assurance of that protection."" We consider an IEC to be ""adequately constituted"" if it includes a reasonable number of members with the qualifications and experience to perform the IEC\'s functions. One type of IEC is an institutional review board (IRB) as defined in 21 CFR 56.102(g) and subject to the requirements of 21 CFR part 56. Another type of IEC is one that adheres to section 3.2.1 of ICH E6. Compliance with 21 CFR part 56 or ICH E6 is not required, however, for an IEC to be considered ""adequately constituted"" under 21 CFR 312.120. We have expressly allowed for flexibility in how to meet the requirements of this regulation in recognition that the organization and membership of IECs may differ among countries because of local needs.18 For more information on IEC membership, see Section 3.2.6 of this guidance document, below.\n\nFootnote 18: 73 Fed. Reg. at 22805.\n\nICH E6 defines informed consent as ""a process by which a subject voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to participate in a particular trial, after having been informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to the subject\'s decision to participate.""19 Informed consent is ""documented by means of a written, signed, and dated informed consent form.""20 In obtaining and documenting informed consent, an investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) and should adhere to principles of GCP.21 Prior to the beginning of the trial, the investigator should obtain the IEC\'s written approval of the informed consent form and any additional written information that will be provided to study subjects.22\n\nFootnote 19: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM073122.pdf.\n\nAppendix B Supporting Information (21 CFR 312.120(b))\n\nA sponsor or applicant submitting non-IND foreign data in support of an IND or an application for marketing approval for a drug must include a description of the actions the sponsor or applicant took to ensure that the research conformed to GCP. Because the description is not required to duplicate information already submitted in the IND or the application for marketing approval, the sponsor or applicant may indicate the location of the required information by providing cross-references (and/or hyperlinks) to relevant sections of the IND application, to relevant sections of an application for marketing approval, or to relevant sections of previously submitted materials.\n\nThe location of all information required by 21 CFR 312.120 should be clearly delineated in the submission. FDA recommends that the sponsor or applicant clearly indicate the following:\n\nwhether each clinical study was conducted at both foreign and domestic sites or only foreign sites;\n\nwhether each foreign site was under an IND or was subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120; and\n\nfor each clinical study subject to 21 CFR 312.120, where in the submission or in previously submitted materials the following information can be found: 1. each of the elements required under 21 CFR 312.120(b) (e.g., ""Information showing that the study is adequate and well controlled, 21 CFR 312.120(b)(5) -- See IND Application, Section X.1, pp. y-z""); and 2. any waiver requests as applicable under 21 CFR 312.120(c) (e.g., ""Waiver request for certain requirements applicable to Study [X] -- see IND Application, Section X.6, pp. y-z"").\n\nClearly delineating where the required information can be found will facilitate FDA\'s review of the IND or marketing application by enabling Agency confirmation of the sponsor\'s/applicant\'s compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nWithin an eCTD format of an application (for marketing approval or an IND), FDA recommends that a sponsor or applicant list the studies subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120 in Section 5.2 of Module 5. The listing can be part of an overall tabular listing or be constructed as an accompanying table and appropriately identified as such. A sponsor or applicant might also use a submission\'s cover letter, particularly in the case of an IND, to indicate whether the submission contains studies subject to 21 CFR 312.120. Whether in Module 5 or in a cover letter, the submission should contain page references and/or links to the respective individual full Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) for the identified studies.\n\nWithin a CSR of a study, using an ICH E3 format as an example, FDA recommends that a sponsor or applicant identify on the Title Page that the study is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120. The Title Page should contain a reference and/or alink to a section or an appendix which specifically addresses the sponsor\'s compliance with 21 CFR 312.120. (In ICH E3 format, such an Appendix would be in addition to the kind of Appendices already listed in the ICH E3 Guidance, e.g. 16.5). FDA further recommends identifying specific foreign non-IND clinical sites using Appendix 16.1.4 (""List and Description of Investigators"") in ICH E3 format or a similarly designated section.\n\nThe section or appendix specifically intended to address compliance with 21 CFR 312.120 should include a brief statement describing actions the sponsor has taken and should provide supporting information in accordance with all the required elements as listed in the regulations (see below). FDA anticipates that for each such element the sponsor would provide the necessary information or provide reference and/or links to other sections of the study report which contain the information. FDA strongly advises against duplicating information provided elsewhere in the application.\n\nThe regulation allows for flexibility in how the requirements are to be met. For example, a full CSR prepared in accordance with ICH E3 ""Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports""23 may meet many of the requirements under 21 CFR 312.120, but adherence to ICH E3 is not required. The same holds for ICH E6: a sponsor or applicant may choose but is not required to meet many of the requirements of this rule through adherence to ICH E6. Note, however, that even if studies are submitted according to ICH E3 or E6, in some cases it may be necessary to provide additional information to FDA to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120, as well as other applicable requirements in 21 CFR parts 312, 314, or 601.24\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsor\n\nFor studies conducted under an IND, 21 CFR part 312 provides that a sponsor is responsible for obtaining a commitment from each investigator that he or she will ensure that requirements in part 56 relating to IRB review and approval are met with respect to the research conducted by the investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d)). Sponsors can also initiate plans for use of a centralized IRB review process and facilitate agreements and other necessary communications among the parties involved.\n\n3.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.1.2 Investigator\n\nUnder 21 CFR part 312, an investigator is responsible for ensuring that there will be initial and continuing review by a qualified IRB of research conducted by that investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d); 312.66). If the investigator is conducting clinical research as part of a multicenter study at an institution with its own IRB and is subject to the policies of that institution, those policies would dictate how the investigator will ensure IRB review. Those policies may provide that the investigator\'s responsibility can be met by ensuring review through a centralized IRB review, through the institution\'s IRB, or through apportionment of IRB review responsibilities between a centralized IRB and the institution\'s IRB.\n\nCentral IRB\n\nFor multicenter studies, the central IRB is the IRB that conducts reviews on behalf of all study sites that agree to participate in the centralized review process. For sites at institutions that have an IRB that would ordinarily review research conducted at the site, the central IRB should reach agreement with the individual institutions participating in centralized review and those institutions\' IRBs about how to apportion the review responsibilities between local IRBs and the central IRB (21 CFR 56.114).\n\nIV Addressing Local Aspects of IRB Review\n\nThe implementation of a centralized IRB review process involves addressing a number of issues related to the communities where the research will take place. The requirements for IRB membership in 21 CFR 56.107(a) specify that the membership of an IRB must have sufficient experience, expertise, and diversity to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. This requirement was intended to implement a recommendation of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research that IRB members be ""men and women of diverse backgrounds and sufficient maturity, experience, and competence to assure that the Board will be able to discharge its responsibilities and that its determinations will be accorded respect by investigators and the community served by the institution or in which it is located.""1 In addition, IRB members must ""be able to ascertain the acceptability of the proposed research in terms of institutional commitments and regulations, applicable law, and standards or professional conduct and practice"" (21 CFR 56.107(a)). Thus, IRB review, through its membership, is intended to provide meaningful consideration of various local factors in assessing research activities, including the cultural backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, educational level, religious affiliations) of the population from which research subjects will be drawn, community attitudes10 about the nature\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nof the proposed research, and the capacity of the institution to conduct or support the proposed research. Inter-community differences could influence, among other things, assessments of whether mechanisms of subject selection will be equitable, whether adequate provision is made to minimize risks to vulnerable populations, and the adequacy of the informed consent process.\n\nThe preamble to the final rule indicates that where a centralized IRB review process is used (21 CFR 56.114), the review should consider the ethical standards of the local community.11 Therefore, a centralized IRB review process should include mechanisms to ensure meaningful consideration of these relevant local factors. Possible mechanisms include:\n\nFootnote 11: Federal Register, Vol. 46, p. 8966, January 27, 1981\n\nProvision of relevant local information to the central IRB in writing by individuals or organizations familiar with the local community, institution, and/or clinical research\n\nParticipation of consultants with relevant expertise, or IRB members from the institution\'s own IRB, in the deliberations of the central IRB\n\nLimited review of a central IRB-reviewed study by the institution\'s own IRB, with that limited review focusing on issues that are of concern to the local community\n\nOther mechanisms may also be appropriate.12 IRB meeting minutes or other records should document how relevant community issues were considered in the review (21 CFR 56.115(a)) (see section 5).\n\nFootnote 12: Guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) (IRB Knowledge of Local Research Context) discusses mechanisms for ensuring adequate consideration of local factors by IRBs in review of clinical research that is supported by DHHS funding. Although the guidance applies only to DHHS funded research, it may be also helpful to off-site IRBs seeking to provide meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for non-DHHS funded clinical research.\n\n5 IRB Records -- Documenting Agreements and Procedures\n\nIRBs and institutions are required to prepare and maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities (21 CFR 56.115(a)). IRBs are also required to follow written procedures for the conduct of initial and continuing review of clinical research and for reporting their findings and actions to the investigator and the institution (21 CFR section 56.108(a), 56.115(a)(6)). The following recommendations should help IRBs fulfill these requirements.\n\nDocumenting Agreements\n\nIf an institution, its IRB, and a central IRB agree (under 21 CFR 56.114) to participate in a centralized IRB review process, they should document that action in an agreement signed by the parties. IRBs should report this action to the investigator and the institution, for example, by providing copies of the agreement to the investigator, and the institution.13 If the agreement\n\n3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApportions IRB review responsibilities between a central IRB and the institution\'s IRB, the agreement should delineate the specific responsibilities of the central IRB and the institution\'s IRB for the initial and continuing review of the study.\n\nWritten Procedures\n\nWhen an institution and an institution\'s IRB rely on review by a central IRB, both IRBs must have written procedures in place to implement the centralized IRB review process (21 CFR 56.108, 56.114). For example, procedures should address the following:\n\nHow the institution\'s IRB determines that the central IRB is qualified to review research conducted at the institution\n\nHow the central IRB intends to communicate with relevant institutions, the institutions\' IRBs, and investigators regarding its review\n\nHow the central IRB ensures that it provides meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for communities from which research subjects will be drawn (see Section 4)\n\nHow the central IRB assesses the ability of a geographically remote site to participate in a study (e.g., whether the site has medical services appropriate to the complexity of the study)\n\nWhen an institution, an institution\'s IRB, and a central IRB agree to apportion IRB review responsibilities between the two IRBs, each IRB must have written procedures describing how it implements its responsibilities under the agreement (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)).\n\nVI Using a Central IRB at Unaffiliated Sites\n\nAt clinical sites that are not already affiliated with an IRB, investigators and sponsors typically rely on the review and oversight of a central IRB. In this situation, the central IRB should document in meeting minutes or other records how it considered relevant local factors for the various communities from which research subjects are to be drawn (see Section 4). The central IRB must also document its action in agreeing to conduct IRB review for the site (21 CFR 56.115) and must have written procedures in place that describe how it will perform its initial and continuing review responsibilities at remote sites (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)) (see Section 5).\n\nVII Examples of Cooperative IRB Review Models\n\nThere are a variety of mechanisms that have been used to distribute IRB review responsibilities between an institution\'s IRB and a central IRB. This guidance is not intended to endorse any particular mechanism. These examples are provided only to illustrate possible mechanisms.\n\nTrial in Which Multiple Sites Rely on a Central IRB\n\nThe primary model contemplated by this guidance is a centralized IRB review process used for a single multicenter trial performed by a commercial or publicly funded sponsor. Under 21 CFR 56.114, IRBs affiliated with the study sites could enter into agreements with a central IRB to rely on all or some of the review findings of the central IRB, or could decline to participate in a centralized IRB review (i.e., do their own complete review). Study sites not already affiliated with an IRB would rely on a central IRB for all IRB review responsibilities.\n\nCentral IRB Formed to Review Multicenter Trials in a Therapeutic Category\n--------------------\nContext title: Using a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: There is no such requirement. CBER evaluates trials conducted outside the U.S. to determine if the vaccine is safe and effective for use as proposed in labeling. As part of this evaluation, CBER considers factors such as disease epidemiology, the study population, and the environmental and medical care conditions. If studies to support vaccine licensure are conducted outside the U.S., CBER may request a smaller U.S. study that bridges immunogenicity and/or safety to the U.S. population. The need to conduct such a study will depend on a number of factors and we encourage sponsors to discuss with CBER early in clinical development whether there is a need to conduct a study to bridge immunogenicity and/or safety to the U.S. population.\n\n10 Does CBER require all foreign studies to be conducted under an IND to support approval of a BLA?\n\nUnder 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will accept as support for an IND or to support an application for marketing approval a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND, if certain conditions are met, including that the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and including review and approval by an independent ethics committee.\n\nIs a sponsor who submits a BLA required to pay an application user fee even if the sponsor does not intend to market the product in the United States?\n\nYes. The sponsor is required to pay a user fee regardless of whether the sponsor intends to market the licensed product in the U.S. However, sponsors may have the application user fee waived if they meet certain criteria, such as being a small business entity or having an orphan designation for their product. For more information on user fees and waivers, see: http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/UserFees/default.htm\n\nAre vaccines to protect against global infectious diseases that are not endemic or that have not been reported to occur in the United States eligible for orphan designation?\n\nYes. A sponsor may apply for designation of its vaccine as an ""orphan drug"" if the vaccine is intended for use against a rare disease or condition. Orphan drug designation is based on the disease prevalence in the U.S. and qualifies a sponsor to receive certain benefits from the government in exchange for developing the vaccine for a rare disease or condition. For example, a BLA for a vaccine that has been granted orphan designation is not subject to an FDA user fee unless the vaccine application includes an indication other than for a rare disease or condition. Orphan designation also qualifies the sponsor or applicant for a tax credit and marketing incentives under the Orphan Drug Act (Public Law 97-414) dated January 4, 1983. In addition, a sponsor of a vaccine against a rare disease or condition may apply for grant support for clinical trials of the vaccine under the Office of Orphan Products Development Grant Program. Designation as an orphan drug is not a requirement for consideration for support under this grant program. Please note that a vaccine designated as an orphan product must be evaluated for safety and efficacy like any other vaccine (21 CFR 601.2(d)). For more information, please contact the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development at 301-827-3666 or see: http://www.fda.gov/orphan/index.htm.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Guidance for Industry: E8: General Considerations for Clinical Trials, December 1997, ICH.\n\n[2] Guidance for Industry: E9: Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials, September 1998, ICH.\n\n[3] Guidance for Industry: E10: Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials, May 2001, ICH.\n\n[4] World Health Organization.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Q: What if the sponsor changes during the course of the study or within one year of completion of the study, for example, through purchase or merger?\n\nA:: Agency regulations require that an IND/IDE sponsor collect financial information from all clinical investigators and that clinical investigators promptly update this information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the investigation and for one year following completion of the study (21 CFR SSS 54.4, 312.53(c)(4), 312.64(d), 812.43(c)(5) and 812.110(d)). Therefore, if the study spons changes during the course of the study, the clinical investigators will need to update their financial disclosure information relevant to the new sponsor. The new sponsor is responsible for collecting this information, and to ensure that the new sponsor has complete financial disclosure information, the new sponsor should seek this information from the original sponsor, and the agency encourages the original sponsor to share their records with the new sponsor.\n\nWith respect to covered clinical studies conducted outside the United States not pursuant to an IND or IDE (such as studies submitted pursuant to SS 312.120 or SS 814.15), the agency expects applicants to take affirmative action, at the earliest opportunity, to see that this information is collected and available to make a complete disclosure and/or certification under part 54.\n\nAppendix D Clinical Investigator\n\n0.1 Q: Who is included in the definition of ""clinical investigator""?\n\nUnder part 54, ""clinical investigator means only a listed or identified investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects"" (21 CFR SS 54.2(d)). This definition is intended to identify the individuals for whom reporting under this regulation is required. Generally, these individuals are considered to be the investigators and subinvestigators taking responsibility for the study at a given study site. The definition also includes the spouse and each dependent child of such an investigator or subinvestigator. It should be noted that hospital staff, including nurses, residents, fellows, and office staff who provide ancillary or intermittent care but who do not make direct and significant contribution to the data are not meant to be included under the definition of clinical investigator. Additionally, individuals who only collect specimens or perform routine tests (such as blood pressure, EKG, x-ray) are not meant to be included under the definition of clinical investigator for purposes of financial disclosure.\n\n2 Q: How does the definition of ""clinical investigator"" in the financial disclosure regulation (21 CFR part 54) relate to the definition in the IND regulations (21 CFR part 312)?\n\nFor drugs and biological products, an investigator under 21 CFR part 312 is defined as ""an individual who actually conducts a clinical investigation (i.e., under whose immediate direction the drug is administered or dispensed to a subject). In the event an investigation is conducted by a team of individuals, the investigator is the responsible leader of the team. \'Subinvestigator\' includes any other individual member of that team."" (21 CFR SS 312.3(b).) For purposes of the financial disclosure regulation, a clinical investigator is an investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects (21 CFR SS 54.2(d)). Therefore, the term clinical investigator in this context would generally include anyone who fits any of the following criteria: signs the FORM FDA 1572 (Statement of Investigator), is identified as an investigator in initial submissions or protocol amendments under an IND, or is identified as an investigator in the marketing application. This could include individuals identified as subinvestigatorson a FORM FDA 1572.14 For studies not conducted under an IND, the sponsor will need to identify the investigators and subinvestigators they consider covered by the regulation and provide FORMS FDA 3454 and/or 3455 as appropriate. FDA expects that there will be at least one such person at each clinical site. If other individuals are responsible for a study at a site, those persons should also be included as clinical investigators. Footnote 14: For guidance on who should be listed as an investigator or subinvestigator on Form FDA 1572, please see FDA’s Information Sheet Guidance, “Frequently Asked Questions – Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572)” available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM214282.pdf.\n\nQ: How does the definition of ""clinical investigator"" in the financial disclosure regulation (21 CFR part 54) relate to the definition in the medical device regulations (21 CFR part 812)?\n\nFor medical devices, investigator is defined under 21 CFR part 812 as an individual under whose immediate direction the subject is treated and the investigational device is administered, including follow-up evaluations and treatments. Where an investigation is conducted by a team of individuals, the investigator is the responsible leader of the team. (21 CFR SS 812.3(i).)\n\nIn general, investigators and subinvestigators sign ""investigator agreements"" in accordance with 21 CFR SS 812.43(c), and it is these individuals whose financial interests and arrangements should be reported as they would fall under the definition at 21 CFR SS 54.2(d). For studies not conducted under an FDA-approved IDE (that is, a non-significant risk IDE or an exempt study), the sponsor would need to identify the investigators and subinvestigators they consider covered by the regulation and provide FORMS FDA 3454 and/or 3455, as appropriate. We expect that there will be at least one such person at each clinical site.\n\nQ: Is it necessary to collect financial information on spouses and dependent children of clinical investigators?\n\nYes. The definition of clinical investigator in 21 CFR part 54 includes the spouse and dependent children of the investigators and subinvestigators who are required to report. Therefore, the financial interests and arrangements of the spouse and each dependent child of each investigator and subinvestigator are to be included in the disclosure (21 CFR SS 54.2(d)). The dollar amount that triggers reporting is the total of the financial interests of the investigator, spouse, and dependent children (21 CFR SS 54.2(d)). If a spouse or dependent child is an employee of the sponsor, the clinical investigator should be identified as an employee of the sponsor and no further disclosure is required. (See 21 CFR SS 54.4.)\n\nQ: Who is considered a ""dependent child""?\n\nFor purposes of clinical investigator financial disclosure under part 54, a dependent child is the investigator\'s child (whether by blood or adoption), stepchild or foster child who is unmarried, and for whom the investigator provides more than one-half of the child\'s support. This would include a child who, at any time during the course of the study and for one year following completion of the study, is under the age of 19, under the age of 24 if a full-time student, or who is permanently and totally disabled. Such a child would generally have the same principal residence as the investigator.\n\n*Q: What obligations does the clinical investigator have under the financial disclosure regulations?\n\nClinical investigators are to provide sponsors sufficient accurate financial information to allow the applicant to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements (see 21 CFR SSS 54.4, 312.53(c)(4), 312.64(d), 812.43(c)(5) and 812.110(d)). Clinical investigators must provide this information to sponsors and also promptly update the information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the investigation and for one year following the completion of the study (see 21 CFR SSS 54.4(b), 312.53(c)(4), 312.64(d), 812.43(c)(5) and 812.110(d)). See also Question C.2.\n\n*Q: May a clinical investigator rely on the information he/she provided to comply with his/her institution\'s policies and procedures pertaining to financial conflicts of interest to comply with the investigator obligations for financial disclosure under FDA\'s regulations?\n\nThe financial information a clinical investigator provides to his/her institution is based on the institution\'s requirements, which may not be sufficient to meet FDA\'s regulations. FDA\'s regulations require the clinical investigator to provide sufficient and accurate financial information to the sponsor to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements under FDA\'s clinical investigator financial disclosure regulations (21 CFR SSS 54.4(b)). However, if an investigator determines that the financial information he/she provided to his/her institution adequately fulfills the disclosure requirements in FDA\'s regulations, a clinical investigator could provide the same information to the sponsor. The clinical investigator would still need to commit to promptly updating the financial information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the study and for one year following completion of the study (21 CFR SSS 54.4(b)).\n\n*Q: How does the definition of ""sponsor"" in the financial disclosure regulation (21 CFR part 54) relate to the definition in the IND/IDE regulations (21 CFR parts 312 and 812)?\n--------------------\nContext title: Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Industry,and FDA Staff'

If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nOn April 28, 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) amended its regulations on the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application (IND) (""non-IND foreign clinical studies"") as support for an IND or a new drug application (NDA), abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or a biologics license application (BLA) (collectively known as ""marketing applications"" or ""applications for marketing approval"").2 The final rule requires that such studies be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP), including review and approval by an independent ethics committee (IEC) and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. This final rule, which took effect on October 27, 2008, is codified at 21 CFR 312.120. It is intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data.\n\nFootnote 2: 73 Fed. Reg. 22800 (April 28, 2008).\n\nThis guidance is applicable to all applications submitted under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and\n\nCosmetic Act (FD& C Act) (21 U.S.C. 355) or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262).\n\nThis guidance document is intended to clarify for sponsors and applicants how they can\n\ndemonstrate compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.3 It provides\n\nrecommendations for the submission of information, whether in an IND or application for\n\nmarketing approval for a drug or biological drug product,4 to demonstrate that a non-IND foreign clinical study was conducted in accordance with GCP.\n\nFootnote 4: For the purposes of this guidance, all references to drugs, drug products, and drug substances include both human\n\ndrug products and biological drug products regulated by CDER and CBER, unless otherwise specified.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nClinical research is becoming increasingly global, as detailed in reports by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (""OIG Reports"").5 FDA recognizes that sponsors may choose to conduct multinational clinical studies under a variety of scenarios. Multinational studies may include domestic sites conducted under an IND, foreign sites conducted under an IND, and/or foreign sites not conducted under an IND.6 Sponsors may decide to use the data that is obtained from non-IND foreign sites to support clinical investigations and/or marketing approval(s) in the United States. Some sponsors may even seek to rely solely on foreign clinical data as support for an IND or application for marketing approval in the U.S.7 Indeed, the number of INDs and applications for marketing approval supported by foreign clinical trials has increased in recent years and will likely continue to increase in the future.\n\nFootnote 5: See HHS OIG Report, Challenges to FDA’s Ability to Monitor and Inspect Foreign Clinical Trials (June 2010), OEI-01-08-00510, available at http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-08-00510.pdf; HHS OIG Report, The Globalization of Clinical Trials: A Growing Challenge in Protecting Human Subjects (September 2001), OEI-01-00-00190, available at http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-00-00190.pdf.\n\nFootnote 6: For information on how conducting both IND and non-IND studies affects the requirement for investigators to sign the Form FDA 1572, see FDA’s Guidance, Information Sheet Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs: Frequently Asked Questions – Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572), available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM214282.pdf.\n\nThis increasing globalization of clinical trials presents challenges to both U.S. and foreign regulators, many of which are detailed in the OIG reports. Among other challenges, resource constraints limit the number of foreign clinical site inspections that can be conducted. To address these challenges, FDA has sought to leverage its resources more efficiently by: (1) encouraging sponsors to utilize data standardization in their INDs and applications for marketing approval, in order to improve review and analysis of data and facilitate implementation of a site selection model to prioritize sites for inspection; (2) engaging in collaboration and outreach with international regulatory authorities; and (3) considering alternative mechanisms of clinical trial oversight both by sponsors and FDA, such as a quality management system approach which emphasizes building quality into the research process.\n\nThis guidance document is part of FDA\'s overall efforts to strengthen oversight of foreign clinical trials.8 Specifically, FDA is issuing this guidance as part of its efforts to encourage sponsors and applicants to standardize information relating to foreign clinical trials in their INDs and applications for marketing approval (see (1), above). This guidance should help sponsorsand applicants submit information in a consistent and standardized manner to demonstrate compliance with the requirements in 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nMuch of the information in this guidance comes from the preamble to the final rule, 73 Fed. Reg. 22800 (April 28, 2008). It is organized in a question and answer format that tracks the regulatory provisions. In addition to addressing the substantive requirements of the final rule, this guidance addresses organization and submission procedures. Specifically, as described in Section III.B, when sponsors or applicants submit information about a non-IND foreign clinical study, they should clearly identify in the cover letter (a) that the material is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120, and (b) where in the submission the information required by 21 CFR 312.120(b) can be located.\n\nAlthough FDA will not accept as support for an IND or application for marketing approval any study that does not meet the conditions of 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will examine the data from such a study because the data may have a bearing on the safe use of the product.9 Sponsors and applicants are reminded that they must submit all studies and other information as required under the applicable regulations for drugs,10 including studies that do not comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nFootnote 9: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(2); 73 Fed. Reg. at 22807.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nA sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived.11 When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with the requirements in 21 CFR 312.120 in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Under 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and if FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary.12 Note that marketing approval of a new drug based solely on foreign clinical data is governed by 21 CFR 314.106.\n\nFootnote 10: See, for example, 21 CFR 314.50, 314.80, 600.80, and 601.2.\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR part 312.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff']","['No. A multinational study may include domestic sites under the IND and foreign sites not under the IND.  Investigation drug and biologics studies conducted in the U.S. must be conducted in compliance with the IND requirements contained in 21 CFR 312, which includes the requirement that investigators sign the 1572.  If a study also involves foreign clinical sites, the sponsor may choose, but is not required, to include the foreign clinical sites under the IND.  The investigators from the U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND would be required to sign the 1572.  The investigators from the foreign sites that are not included under the IND are not required to sign the 1572.\n\nIf the sponsor chooses to conduct a multinational study with U.S. and some foreign sites under the IND, and other foreign sites not under the IND, the sponsor can submit a single protocol to the IND and all sites would follow this protocol.  Alternatively, the sponsor can conduct a multinational study with one protocol for sites under the IND (U.S. sites and some foreign sites) and a different protocol(s) for foreign sites not under the IND.  If the intent is to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites, the protocols would ordinarily be very similar or identical.  The U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND must follow the protocol that was submitted to the IND.  For foreign sites that are not included under the IND, the protocol(s) does not need to be submitted to the IND.  In general, if the sponsor intends to submit the data in an application for marketing approval, we recommend that the sponsor identify the foreign sites that will not be conducted under the IND and discuss plans to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites with the appropriate FDA review division.\n\nNote, however, that 21 CFR 312.32(b) requires sponsors to promptly review information about the safety of the investigational drug obtained or otherwise received by the sponsor from any source, foreign or domestic.  Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), sponsors must also notify FDA and all participating investigators in an IND safety report of any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected.  This means that FDA and all participating investigators under the IND would be informed of such an adverse experience, even if it occurred in a foreign study not conducted under the IND.']",0.8541666666453125,1.0

Filing Documentation Prior approval supplement (all information including accelerated stability data); annual report (long-term stability data).\n\n4 Components and Composition -- Release Controlling Excipient\n\nThis section of the guidance focuses on changes in release controlling excipients in the drug product. For modified release solid oral dosage forms, consideration should be given as to whether or not the excipient is critical to drug release. The sponsor should provide appropriate justifications (i.e., mechanism of drug release and manufacturing process) for claiming any excipient(s) as a release controlling excipient in the formulation of the modified release solid oral dosage form. The functionality of each excipient should be identified. Changes in the amount of the drug substance are not addressed by this guidance. Changes exceeding the ranges defined in each of the levels below may be allowed if considered to be within normal batch-to-batch variation and contained within an approved original application. In such situations, sponsors should contact the appropriate CDER review division for further guidance.\n\nA. Level 1 Change\n\nDefinition of Level\n\nLevel 1 changes are those that are unlikely to have any detectable impact on formulation quality and performance.\n\nExample:\n\nChanges in the release controlling excipient(s), expressed as percentage (w/w) of total release controlling excipient(s) in the formulation less than or equal to 5% w/w of total release controlling excipient content in the modified release solid oral dosage form.\n\nThe drug substance in the product is formulated to 100% of label/potency. The total additive effect of all release controlling excipient changes should not be more than 5% w/w of the total release controlling excipients in the original approved formulation.4 The total weight of the dosage form should still be within the approved original application range.\n\nFootnote 4: Example: In a product consisting of active ingredient A, ethylcellulose and a plasticizer, the ethylcellulose and plasticizer content should not vary by more than an absolute total of 5% w/w of the total release controlling excipients (e.g., ethylcellulose content increases by 2.5% and plasticizer content increases by 2.5%) relative to the original approved total release controlling excipient content weight in the modified release solid oral dosage form if it is to stay within the given range allowed for level 1.\n\nThe components (active and excipients) in the formulation should have numerical targets that represent the nominal composition of the product on which any future changes in the composition of the product are to be based. Allowable changes in the composition should be based on the original approved target composition and not on previous level 1 changes in the composition. For products approved with only a range for excipients, the target value may be assumed to be the midpoint of the original approved application range.\n\nTest Documentation\n\na. Chemistry documentation\n\nApplication/compendial product release requirements.\n\nStability: First production batch on long-term stability data reported in annual report.\n\nb. Dissolution documentation\n\nNone beyond application/compendial requirements.\n\nc. Bioequivalence documentation\n\nNone.\n\nFiling Documentation\n\nAnnual report (all information including long-term stability data).\n\nB. Level 2 Change\n\nDefinition of Level\n\nLevel 2 changes are those that could have a significant impact on formulation quality and performance. Test documentation for a level 2 change would vary depending on whether the product could be considered to have a narrow therapeutic range.5\n\nFootnote 5: At present, there is no official CDER list of narrow therapeutic range drugs. A list was developed earlier in a preliminary attempt to identify drugs where there was greater concern that deviation from the specifications and potential changes in bioavailability could raise clinical issues. This preliminary list was not based solely on 21 CFR 320.33(c) which is contained in a section of the regulations related to criteria and evidence to assess actual or potential bioequivalence problems, nor does it accurately reflect the Agency’s opinion on narrow therapeutic range drugs. Currently, the issue of narrow therapeutic range drugs is under discussion within CDER. If unsure about the classification of a drug as a narrow therapeutic range drug, sponsors should contact the appropriate CDER review division.\n\nExamples:\n\nChange in the technical grade and/or specifications of the release controlling excipient(s).6 Footnote 6: Example: Eudragit RS-100 vs. Eudragit RL-100.\n\nChanges in the release controlling excipient(s), expressed as percentage (w/w) of total release controlling excipient(s) in the formulation, greater than those listed above for a level 1 change, but less than or equal to 10% w/w of total release controlling excipient content in the modified release solid oral dosage form.\n\nThe drug substance in the drug product is formulated to 100% of label/potency. The total additive effect of all release controlling excipient changes should not be more than 10% w/w of the total release controlling excipient(s) in the original approved formulation. The total weight of the dosage form could still be within or outside the approved original application range.\n\nThe components (active and excipients) in the formulation should have numerical targets that represent the nominal composition of the product on which any future changes in the composition of the product are to be based. Allowable changes in the composition are based on the original approved target composition and not on the composition based on previous level 1 or level 2 changes. For products approved with only a range for excipients, the target value may be assumed to be the midpoint of the original approved application range.\n* Test Documentation\n* Chemistry documentation Application/compential product release requirements and updated executed batch records.\n\nStability:\n\nNonnarrow therapeutic range drugs: One batch with three months' accelerated stability data reported in prior approval supplement and long-term stability data of first production batch reported in annual report.\n\nNarrow therapeutic range drugs: Three batches with three months' accelerated stability data reported in prior approval supplement and long-term stability data of first three production batches reported in annual report.\n\nDissolution documentation\n\nNonnarrow therapeutic range drugs\n\nExtended release: In addition to application/compendial release requirements, multipoint dissolution profiles should be obtained in three other media, for example, in water, 0.1N HCl, and USP buffer media at pH 4.5, and 6.8 for the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product). Adequate sampling should be performed, for example, at 1, 2, and 4 hours and every two hours thereafter until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached. A surfactant may be used with appropriate justification.\n\nDelayed release: In addition to application/compendial release requirements, dissolution tests should be performed in 0.1 N HCl for 2 hours (acid stage) followed by testing in USP buffer media in the range of pH 4.5-7.5 (buffer stage) under standard (application/compendial) test conditions and two additional agitation speeds using the application/compendial test apparatus (three additional test conditions). If the application/compendial test apparatus is the rotating basket method (Apparatus 1), a rotation speed of 50, 100, and 150 rpm may be used, and if the application/compendial test apparatus is the rotating paddle method (Apparatus 2), a rotation speed of 50, 75, and 100 rpm may be used. Multipoint dissolution profiles should be obtained during the buffer stage of testing. Adequate sampling should be performed, for example, at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 minutes (following the time from which the dosage form is placed in the buffer) until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached. The above dissolution testing should be performed using the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product).\n--------------------\nContext title: SUPAC-MR- Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes- Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Dissolution Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation Guidance for Industry""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: Control of Drug Product\n\nA detailed listing of all the tests performed on the drug product and the tentative acceptance criteria should be provided in an information amendment. A summary table of test results and analytical data (e.g., chromatograms) from batch release of representative clinical trial materials should be provided in an information amendment initially and when any changes are made in the specification. Data on the particle size distribution and/or polymorphic form of the drug substance used in clinical trial materials should be included, when appropriate (e.g., inhalation, suspension, modified release solid dosage forms), so that relevant correlations can be established between data generated during early and late drug development and in vivo product performance.\n\nA general description of the analytical procedures used should be provided in an annual report that includes a citation to an official compendium, other FDA-recognized standard reference, or the sponsor's standard test procedure number, as appropriate. A description of the analytical procedure with appropriate validation information should be provided for analytical procedures that are not from an FDA-recognized standard reference (e.g., official compendium, AOAC International Book of Methods).\n\nData updates on the degradation profile should be provided in an information amendment so safety assessments can be made. Degradation products should be identified, qualified, quantified, and reported, as appropriate. Evaluation procedures to support an NDA's degradants (e.g., recommended identification levels) may not be practical at this point in drug development. Suitable limits should be established based on manufacturing experience, stability data, and safety considerations.\n\nFor sterile-preserved products in multiple-dose containers or nonsterile-preserved products, a citation to the USP Antimicrobial Preservative-Effectiveness Test (APET) or a description of an equivalent procedure with the associated test validation information should be provided in an information amendment. This test should be performed at the lowest specified concentration of antimicrobial preservative specified for the drug product at release or at the end of the expiration dating period, whichever is less. The efficacy of preservative systems is evaluated based on their effect on inoculated microorganisms.\n\nA dissolution testing program for oral immediate release dosage forms (e.g., tablets, capsules, suspensions) and a drug release program for modified release dosage forms (e.g., modified release tablets, capsules, suspensions, transdermal drug delivery systems) should be developed. Dissolution or drug release characteristics of a drug product, particularly the selection of the medium, are generally based on the pH solubility profile and pKa of the drug substance. Dissolution or drug release profiling should be performed in physiologically relevant media with reasonable speeds of rotation (e.g., basket at 50 or 100 rotations per minute (rpm), paddle at 50 rpm). The dissolution or drug release program at phase 3 should bring commonality to both the methodology and the proposed acceptance criteria by taking into consideration the results of dissolution or drug release testing of clinical, bioavailability, and bioequivalence batches (e.g., clinically studied formulations versus the to-be-marketed formulation) and relevant stability batches. The overall aim is to set in vitro dissolution or drug release acceptance criteria that ensure batch-to-batch and unit-to-unit consistency, post-NDA approval. The sponsor is encouraged to obtain concurrence on choice of apparatus, medium, rotation speed, and sampling time points from the Agency before the primary stability studies are initiated. Discussions with the Agency (e.g., at the end-of phase-2 meeting) can also include plans for establishing an in vivo-in vitro correlation (IVIVC) and characterizing the drug substance using the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS).\n\n5.2.5 Container Closure System\n\nAn update of the description of the container closure system should be provided in an information amendment if it differs from that reported during phase 2. When changes are made in the container closure system during phase 3 studies, information should be submitted in an information amendment if there can be an effect on product quality. Otherwise, the changes can be reported in an annual report.\n\nFor packaging components with compendial standards (e.g., glass, polyethylene containers), compliance with the appropriate compendial standards should be stated. If the sponsor refers to information in a Type III DMF, an authorization letter from the DMF holder should be provided. Additional information may be requested for atypical delivery systems (e.g., MDIs, disposable injection devices). The container closure system of certain drug products delivered by devices (e.g., MDIs, DPIs, nasal sprays) should be similar to that intended for the marketed drug product. A sponsor can consult with the appropriate CMC review team for additional guidance if it has any questions.\n\n5.2.6 Stability\n\nA stability program should be designed to monitor the chemical, physical, biological, or microbiological (if applicable) stability of the drug product throughout the clinical testing program. Changes in the drug product stability program from that described for phase 2 (see section III.B.7) should be provided in an information amendment. A brief description should be provided in an information amendment for each of the attributes being investigated in the stability program (i.e., long-term and accelerated), demonstrating that the appropriate controls and storage conditions are in place to ensure the quality of the product used in clinical trials. Furthermore, tests unique to the drug product stability program (i.e., tests not included in section IV.B.4) should be adequately defined and described.\n\nAny stability data for the clinical material used in the phase 2 studies that were not reported during phase 2 should be provided in an information amendment. Stability data for representative clinical material used in phase 3 should be provided in annual reports in tabular format as the data become available. The submitted information should include the batch number, manufacturing site, date of manufacture of the drug product, and relevant information on the drug substance (e.g., lot number, manufacturer) used to manufacture the drug product. The analytical results for each test should be reported. Representative chromatograms should be provided in the annual report, if applicable.\n\nFor certain drug products, one-time stress testing can be warranted to assess the potential for changes in the physical (e.g., phase separation, precipitation, aggregation, changes in particular size distribution) and/or chemical (e.g., degradation and/or interaction of components) characteristics of the drug product. The studies could include testing to assess the effect of high temperature, humidity, oxidation, photolysis and/or thermal cycling. The relevant data should be provided in an annual report.\n\nTo ensure appropriate stability data are generated for filing at the NDA stage, a stability protocol that will be used for the formal stability studies should be developed.11 The analytical procedures should be referenced to the control of drug product section of the IND or an official compendium, if possible. Tests unique to the stability protocol should be defined and described. It is helpful if the stability protocol is submitted in an information amendment before or during phase 3 studies and is discussed at the end-of-phase-2 meeting, especially for those protocols including bracketing and matrixing approaches.\n\nFootnote 11: Applicants should refer to the forthcoming guidance Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Drug Products, when finalized, for information on stability protocols for formal stability studies. In June 1998 (63 FR 31224), the Agency made available a draft version of this guidance.\n\nV Placebo\n\nA brief, general description of the composition, manufacture, and control of the placebo provided during phase 1 should be updated or provided for phase 2 and/or phase 3 if the placebo is being used for the first time. This information and any updates to this information should be provided in an information amendment. When placebos are used in clinical trials, the placebo clinical study materials should be tested to demonstrate the absence of the drug substance. The results from the placebo testing should be submitted in an annual report.\n\nVI Labeling\n\nUpdates of the information provided for phase 1 should be submitted in information amendments during phase 2 and phase 3.\n\nVII Environmental Assesssments\n\nUpdates on information already submitted and on whether a claim for a previous categorical exclusion has changed should be provided in information amendments for phase 2 and phase 3 (see FDA guidance for industry on Environmental Assessment of Human Drug and Biologics Applications).\n\nResources\n\nFDA continues to update existing and publish new guidance documents. An applicant should ensure that it is using current guidance when preparing a submission. CDER guidances are available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm.\n\nICH Guidances\n\nAlthough not intended to be applicable to IND applications, the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) documents below can serve as valuable resources in guiding the course of product development.\n\nICH Q1A Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products\n\nICH Q1B Photostability Testing of New Substances and Products\n\nICH Q1C Stability Testing for New Dosage Forms\n\nICH Q2A Validation of Analytical Procedures\n\nICH Q2B Validation of Analytical Procedures: Methodology\n\nICH Q3A Impurities in New Drug Substances\n\nICH Q3B Impurities in New Drug Products\n\nICH Q3C Impurities: Residual Solvents\n--------------------\nContext title: INDs for Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information Guidance for Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: For modified release dosage forms, changes in release controlling excipients in the formulation should be within the range of release controlling excipients of the established correlation. In the presence of an established in vitro/in vivo correlation (6), only application/ compential dissolution testing need be performed. Also, an established in vitro/in vivo correlation can be used for any level of changes described in this guidance.\n\nJustification: Reports containing scientific data and expert professional judgment to substantiate decisions.\n\nLot: A batch or a specific identified portion of a batch, having uniform character and quality within specified limits or, in the case of a drug product produced by continuous process, a specific identified amount produced in a unit of time or quantity in a manner that assures its having uniform character and quality within specified limits (21 CFR 210.3(b)(10)).\n\nModified Release Dosage Forms: Dosage forms whose drug-release characteristics of time course and/or location are chosen to accomplish therapeutic or convenience objectives not offered by conventional dosage forms such as a solution or an immediate release dosage form. Modified release solid oral dosage forms include both delayed and extended release drug products.\n\nNonrelease Controlling Excipient (Non-Critical Composition Variable): An excipient in the final dosage form whose primary function does not include modifying the duration of release of the active drug substance from the dosage form.\n\nOperating Principles: Rules or concepts governing the operation of the system.\n\nPilot Scale: The manufacture of either drug substance or drug product by a procedure fully representative of and simulating that used for full manufacturing scale. For solid oral dosage forms this is generally taken to be, at a minimum, one tenth that of full production, or 100,000 tablets or capsules, whichever is larger (4).\n\nProcess: A series of operations, actions and controls used to manufacture a drug product.\n\nRanges: The extent to which or the limits between which acceptable variation exists.\n\nRelease Controlling Excipient (Critical Composition Variable): An excipient in the final dosage form whose primary function is to modify the duration of release of the active drug substance from the dosage form.\n\nRelease Mechanism: The process by which the drug substance is released from the dosage form. Typically the definition contains the energy source or pictorially describes the way the drug is released.\n\nRepresentative: Corresponding to or replacing some other species or the like; exemplifying a group or kind; typical.\n\nSame: Agreeing in kind, amount; unchanged in character or condition.\n\nSatisfactory Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) Inspection: A satisfactory cGMP inspection is one during which (1) no objectionable conditions or practices were found during an inspection or (2) objectionable conditions were found, however, corrective action is left to the firm to take voluntarily and the objectionable conditions do not justify further administrative or regulatory actions.\n\nScale-up: The process of increasing the batch size.\nScale-down: The process of decreasing the batch size.\nSignificant Body of Information:\n\nImmediate Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms: A significant body of information on the stability of the drug product is likely to exist after five years of commercial experience for new molecular entities, or three years of commercial experience for new dosage forms.\n\nModified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms: A significant body of information should include, for ""Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms,"" a product-specific body of information. This product-specific body of information is likely to exist after five years of commercial experience for the original modified release solid oral drug product, or three years of commercial experience for any subsequent modified release solid oral drug product utilizing similar drug release mechanism.\nSimilar: Having a general likeness.\n\nTechnical Grade: Technical grades of excipients may differ in (1) specifications and/or functionality, (2) impurities, and (3) impurity profiles.\n\nValidation: Establishing through documented evidence a high degree of assurance that a specific process will consistently produce a product that meets its predetermined specifications and quality attributes. A validated manufacturing process is one that has been proven to do what it purports or is represented to do. The proof of validation is obtained through collection and evaluation of data, preferably beginning from the process development phase and continuing through into the production phase. Validation necessarily includes process qualification (the qualification of materials, equipment, systems, buildings, and personnel), but it also includes the control of entire processes for repeated batches or runs.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nFDA, Guideline for Submitting Documentation for the Manufacture of and Controls for Drug Products, February 1987.\n\nFDA, ""Interim Policy on Exceptions to the Batch-Size and Production Condition Requirements for Non-Antibiotic, Solid, Oral-Dosage Form Drug Products Supporting Proposed ANDA\'s"" Policy and Procedure Guide #22-90, September 13, 1990.

Filing Documentation Prior approval supplement (all information including accelerated stability data); annual report (long-term stability data).\n\nGlossary of Terms\n\nThe following terms and their definitions (9) are being provided to assist the reader in using this guidance document.\n\nBatch: A specific quantity of a drug or other material produced according to a single manufacturing order during the same cycle of manufacture and intended to have uniform character and quality, within specified limits (21 CFR 210.3(b)(2)).\n\nBatch formula (Composition): A complete list of the ingredients and their amounts to be used for the manufacture of a representative batch of the drug product. All ingredients should be included in the batch formula whether or not they remain in the finished product (1).\n\nBiobatch: The lot of drug product formulated for purposes of pharmacokinetic evaluation in a bioavailability/bioequivalency study. For modified release solid oral, this batch should be 10% or greater than the proposed commercial production batch or at least 100,000 units, whichever is greater.\n\nBioequivalence Studies For Modified Release Drug Product: Refer to the OGD Guidance (3). The bioequivalence study should be conducted using the reference listed drug (RLD) product and/or the innovator drug product as the reference and the test product should be the product (generic or innovator) which has undergone postapproval change.\n\nContiguous Campus: Continuous or unbroken site or a set of buildings in adjacent city blocks.\n\nCritical Equipment Variable: A specific design, operating principle, or automation of equipment that can affect a specific performance variable critical to the ultimate and predictable performance of the dosage form and its drug.\n\nCritical Manufacturing Variable: Includes those manufacturing materials (critical composition variable), methods, equipment, and processes that significantly affect drug release, from the formulation (e.g., coating thickness, particle size, crystal form, excipient type, concentrations and distribution, and tablet hardness).\n\nCritical Processing Variable: A specific step, unit process, or condition of a unit process that can affect a specific performance variable critical to the ultimate and predictable performance of the dosage form and its drug.\n\nDelayed Release: Release of a drug (or drugs) at a time other than immediately following oral administration.\n\nDissolution Testing: Extended release: Dissolution testing should be conducted on 12 individual dosage units for the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch(unchanged drug product). The potential for pH dependence of drug release from a modified release drug product is well recognized. Multipoint dissolution profiles should be obtained using discriminating agitation speed and medium. A surfactant may be used with appropriate justification. Early sampling times of 1, 2, and 4 hours should be included in the sampling schedule to provide assurance against premature release of the drug (dose dumping) from the formulation. Differing sampling times should be justified to prevent premature drug release. See current USP 23 NF 18, sections <711> and <724>, for general dissolution requirements. The general dissolution conditions to be followed are shown below:\n\nApparatus: USP 23 Apparatus 1 (rotating basket)  USP 23 Apparatus 2 (rotating paddle)  USP 23 Apparatus 3 (reciprocating cylinder)({}^{})  USP 23 Apparatus 4 (flow-through cell)({}^{})  USP 23 Apparatus 7 (reciprocating disk)({}^{*})\n\nRotation Speed: 50, 100, and 150 rpm (basket) 50, 75 and 100 rpm (paddle)\n\nTemperature: 37(\\pm)0.5({}^{\\circ})C\n\nUnits To Be Tested: 12\n\nDissolution Volume: 500-1000 mL\n\nDissolution Medium: Aqueous media of various pH.\n\nSampling Schedule: Adequate sampling should be performed, for example at 1, 2, and 4 hours, and every two hours thereafter until either 80% of the drug is released or an asymptote is reached.\n\nTolerances: As established.\n--------------------\nContext title: SUPAC-MR- Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes- Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Dissolution Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation Guidance for Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.3.2.1 Solid Oral Medicinal Products:The following tests are applicable to tablets (coated and uncoated) and hard capsules. One or more of these tests may also be applicable to soft capsules, powders, and granules.\n\na) Dissolution:The specification for solid oral dosage forms normally includes a test to measure release of drug substance from the medicinal product. Single-point measurements are normally considered to be suitable for immediate-release dosage forms. For modified-release dosage forms, appropriate test conditions and sampling procedures should be established. For example, multiple time point sampling should be performed for extended-release dosage forms, and two-stage testing (using different media in succession or in parallel, as appropriate) may be appropriate for delayed-release dosage forms. In some cases (see 3.3.2.1 b) Disintegration) dissolution testing may be replaced by disintegration testing (see Decision Tree #7 (1)).\n\nFor immediate-release medicinal products where changes in dissolution rate have been demonstrated to significantly affect bioavailability, it is desirable to develop test conditions which can distinguish batches with poor bioavailability. If changes in formulation or process variables significantly affect dissolution and such changes are not controlled by another aspect of the specification, it may also be appropriate to adopt dissolution test conditions which can distinguish these changes (see Decision Tree #7(2)).\n\nWhere dissolution significantly affects bioavailability, the acceptance criteria should be set to reject batches with unacceptable bioavailability. Otherwise, test conditions and acceptance criteria should be established which pass clinically acceptable batches (see Decision Tree #7(2)).\n\nFor extended-release medicinal products, in vitro/in vivo correlation may be used to establish acceptance criteria when bioavailability data are available for formulations exhibiting different release rates. Where such data are not available, and drug release cannot be shown to be independent of in vitro test conditions, then acceptance criteria should be established on the basis of available batch data. Normally, the permitted variability in mean release rate at any given time point should not exceed a total numerical difference of +/-10% of the labeled content of drug substance (i.e., a total variability of 20%: a requirement of 50 +/- 10% thus means an acceptable range from 40% to 60%), unless a wider range is supported by a bioequivalency study (see Decision Tree #7(3)).\n\nb) Disintegration:For rapidly dissolving (dissolution >80% in 15 minutes at pH 1.2, 4.0 and 6.8, or as appropriate for specific veterinary species) products containing drugs which are highly soluble throughout the physiological range (dose/solubility volume < 250 mL from pH 1.2 to 6.8, or as appropriate for specific veterinary species), disintegration may be substituted for dissolution. Disintegration testing is most appropriate when a relationship to dissolution has been established or when disintegration is shown to be more discriminating than dissolution. In such cases dissolution testing may not be appropriate. Development information should be provided to support the robustness of the formulationand manufacturing process with respect to the selection of dissolution vs. disintegration testing (see Decision Tree #7(1)).\n\nc) Hardness/triability: It is normally appropriate to perform hardness and/or friability testing as an in-process control (see section 2.3). Under these circumstances, it is normally not important to include these attributes in the specification. If the characteristics of hardness and friability have a critical impact on medicinal product quality (e.g., chewable tablets), acceptance criteria should be included in the specification.\n\nd) Uniformity of dosage units: This term includes both the mass of the dosage form and the content of the active substance in the dosage form; a pharmacopoeial procedure should be used. In general, the specification should include one or the other but not both. If appropriate, these tests may be performed in-process; the acceptance criteria should be included in the specification. When weight variation is applied for new medicinal products exceeding the threshold value to allow testing uniformity by weight variation, applicants should verify during drug development that the homogeneity of the product is adequate.\n\ne) Water content: A test for water content should be included when appropriate. The acceptance criteria may be justified with data on the effects of hydration or water absorption on the medicinal product. In some cases, a Loss on Drying procedure may be considered adequate; however, a detection procedure which is specific for water (e.g., Karl Fischer titration) is preferred.\n\nf) Microbial limits: Microbial limit testing is seen as an attribute of Good Manufacturing Practice (21 CFR 211.165(b)), as well as of quality assurance. In general, it is advisable to test the medicinal product unless its components are tested before manufacture and the manufacturing process is known, through validation studies, not to carry a significant risk of microbial contamination or proliferation. It should be noted that, whereas this guidance does not directly address excipients, the principles discussed here may be applicable to excipients as well as to new medicinal products. Skip testing may be an appropriate approach in both cases where permissible. (See Decision Tree #6 for microbial testing of excipients.)\n\nAcceptance criteria should be set for the total count of aerobic microorganisms, the total count of yeasts and molds, and the absence of specific objectionable bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli and Salmonella; testing of additional organisms may be appropriate according to the U.S. Pharmacopoeial (USP)). These should be determined by suitable procedures, using pharmacopoeial procedures, and at a sampling frequency or time point in manufacture which is justified by data and experience. The type of microbial test(s) and acceptance criteria should be based on the nature of the drug substance, method of manufacture, and the intended use of the medicinal product. With acceptable scientific justification, it should be possible to propose no microbial limit testing for solid oral dosage forms.\n\nDecision tree #8 provides additional guidance on the use of microbial limits testing.\n\n3.3.2.2 Oral liquids: One or more of the following specific tests will normally be applicable to oral liquids and to powders intended for reconstitution as oral liquids.\n\na) Uniformity of dosage units: This term includes both the mass of the dosage form and the content of the active substance in the dosage form; a pharmacopoeial procedure should be used. In general, the specification should include one or the other but not both. When weight variation is applied for new medicinal products exceeding the threshold value to allow testing uniformity by weight variation, applicants should verify during drug development that the homogeneity of the product is adequate.\n\n4.2.1 Contains Non-Binding Recommendations\n\nIf appropriate, tests may be performed in-process; however, the acceptance criteria should be included in the specification. This concept may be applied to both single-dose and multiple-dose packages.\n\nThe dosage unit is considered to be a representative dose that would be administered to an animal. If the actual unit dose is controlled, it may either be measured directly or calculated, based on the total measured weight or volume of drug divided by the total number of doses expected. If dispensing equipment (such as medicine droppers or dropper tips for bottles) is an integral part of the packaging, this equipment should be used to measure the dose. Otherwise, a standard volume measure should be used. The dispensing equipment to be used is normally determined during development.\n\nFor powders for reconstitution, uniformity of mass testing is generally considered acceptable.\n\nb) pH: Acceptance criteria for pH should be provided where applicable and the proposed range justified.\n\nc) Microbial limits: Microbial limit testing is seen as an attribute of Good Manufacturing Practice (21 CFR 211.165(b)), as well as of quality assurance. In general, it is advisable to test the medicinal product unless its components are tested before manufacture and the manufacturing process is known, through validation studies, not to carry a significant risk of microbial contamination or proliferation. It should be noted that, whereas this Guidance does not directly address excipients, the principles discussed here may be applicable to excipients as well as to new medicinal products. Skip testing may be an appropriate approach in both cases where permissible. With acceptable scientific justification, it may be possible to propose no microbial limit testing for powders intended for reconstitution as oral liquids.\n\nAcceptance criteria should be set for the total count of aerobic microorganisms, total count of yeasts and molds, and the absence of specific objectionable bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli and Salmonella.; testing of additional organisms may be appropriate according to the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP)). These should be determined by suitable procedures, using pharmacopoeial procedures, and at a sampling frequency or time point in manufacture which is justified by data and experience.\n\nDecision tree #8 provides additional guidance on the use of microbial limits testing.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #176 (VICH GL39) Specifications- Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Veterinary Drug Substances and New Medicinal Products- Chemical Substances'

When you make a claim about calories from saturated fat, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated fat, sugar alcohol, monounsaturated fat, other carbohydrate, and soluble fiber, you must list that nutrient.\nYes. Dietary ingredients for which no daily values have been established must be listed by their common or usual names when they are present in a dietary supplement. They must be identified as having no Daily Values by use of a symbol in the column for ""% Daily Value"" that refers to the footnote ""Daily Value Not Established.""\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(F) and (b)(3)\n\nIf I use a magnesium salt as a binder, where must I declare it?\n\nYou must list the specific magnesium salt in the ingredient statement below the ""Supplement Facts"" panel, not in the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel.

You must list the dietary ingredients that have Daily Values in the same order as for the labels of conventional foods, except that vitamins, minerals and electrolytes are grouped together. This results in the following order for vitamins and minerals:\n\nVitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, calcium, iron, phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, and potassium.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)\n\nMay I use synonyms for my dietary ingredients?\n\nYes. You may use the following synonyms in parentheses after your dietary ingredients: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), thiamin (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folate (folacin or folic acid), and calories (energy). Alternatively, you may list ""folic acid"" or ""folacin"" without parentheses in place of ""folate.""

 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: The ""Supplement Facts"" nutrition information (referred to as a panel) must be enclosed in a box by using hairlines. The title, ""Supplement Facts,"" must be larger than all other print in the panel and, unless impractical, must be set full width of the panel. The title and all headings must be bolded to distinguish them from other information.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n36. How must I present the information in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n\nYou must present all information using the following:\n\na. A single easy-to-read type style;\n\nb. All black or one color type, printed on a white or neutral contrasting background, whenever practical;3. Upper- and lowercase letters, except that you may use all uppercase lettering on small packages (i.e., packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches); d. At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text); and e. Letters that do not touch.\n37. What are the type size requirements for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n\nExcept as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must set information other than the title, headings, and footnotes in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. You also must use a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label for the title ""Supplement Facts."" You may set the column headings and footnotes in type no smaller than 6 point type. See the section on ""Special Labeling Provisions"" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nMust I use hairlines in the Supplement Facts panel?\n\nExcept for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must use a hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text to separate each dietary ingredient from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it. FDA has provided an exception for certain packages with space constraints. See the section on ""Special Labeling Provisions"" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nHow closely must I follow the ""Examples of graphic enhancements used by the FDA"" in appendix B to Part 101?\n\nYou are not required to follow Appendix B to Part 101. Appendix B and its specifications are a model, which FDA has suggested in the interest of uniformity of presentation. For example, 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(i) requires the use of an ""easy-to-read"" type style, not specifically Helvetica type, as suggested in Appendix B.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)(9)\n\nHow do I provide nutrition labeling when my product contains two or more packets of supplements (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening)?\n\nYou may present the information for each packet (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening) in an individual nutrition label or you may use an aggregate nutrition label. For two packets, this would consist of five columns. List all of the dietary ingredients in the first column. List the amounts and percents of the morning packet in the second and third columns and similar information for the evening packet in the fourth and fifth columns (see the illustration of aggregate nutrition labeling in 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iii)).\n\nCompliance\n\nWhat kind of samples will FDA collect to determine compliance with 21 CFR 101.36?\n\nFDA will collect a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller. FDA will randomly select these packages.\n\nWhat if it is not technically feasible for me to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements?\n\nFDA may permit you to use an alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9). If your firm needs such special allowances, you must make your request in writing to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(f)(2)\n\nMust dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?\n\nFor dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value.\n\nExemptions\n\nWhat are the circumstances in which my dietary supplement products would be exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements? Your dietary supplement product is not required to have a ""Supplement Facts"" panel if: a. Your firm is a small business that has not more than $50,000 gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers or not more than $500,000 per year from total sales in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1); b. You sell less than 100,000 units of the product annually, your firm has fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(2) andyou file an annual notification with FDA as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(18)(iv); or c. You ship the product in bulk form, do not distribute it to consumers in such form, and you supply it for use in the manufacture of other dietary supplements in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(3). The two exemptions for small businesses and low-volume products (a. and b. above) are available to you only if your products\' labels bear no claims or other nutrition information.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(h)(1) - (3)\n\nSpecial Labeling Provisions\n\nWhat are small packages?\n\nSmall packages are those packages having less than 12 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)\n\nWhat is the telephone provision for small packages?\n\nIn lieu of a ""Supplement Facts"" panel, you may print labels for small packages with a telephone number or address that consumers can use to obtain nutrition information. You may use a telephone number or an address in place of the ""Supplement Facts"" panel only if you place no claims or other nutrition information on the product label.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size that I may use for small packages?\n\nYou may use a type size no smaller than 4-5 point for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on the labels of small packages.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(i)\n\nMay I use a tabular or linear format for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on a small package?\n\nYes. You may use a tabular format on small packages. You also may present ""Supplement Facts"" information in a linear (i.e., string) fashion if the label will not accommodate the ""Supplement Facts"" panel in a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j) (13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display.)\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n\nWhat are intermediate-sized packages?\n\nIntermediate-sized packages are those packages having from 12 to 40 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(ii)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size for intermediate-sized packages?The ""Supplement Facts"" panel on the labels of intermediate-sized packages must use type size no smaller than 6 point, except that type no smaller than 4-5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches that list more than 16 dietary ingredients. Also, 4-5 point type may be used on packages with less than 20 square inches that list more than 8 dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the type size used in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on an inner container may be as small as needed to accommodate all required information if the ""Supplement Facts"" on the outer container meets these type size requirements.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv)\n51. May I use a tabular or linear format for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on an intermediate-sized package? You may use a tabular format on an intermediate-sized package if the package shape or size cannot accommodate vertical columns. You may use a linear format if the label will not accommodate a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n52. May I abbreviate on the labels of intermediate- sized packages? You may use the abbreviations in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B) in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel for small and intermediate-sized packages, e.g, ""Serv size"" for ""Serving Size"" and ""Servings"" for ""Servings Per Container.""\n\n21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B)\n53. Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV. Nutrition Labeling'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: How Do the Nutrient Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels Differ?\n\nBoth the content and format of the Supplement Facts label have been updated to correspond to the Nutrition Facts label, wherever possible. However, there are still some differences between the two. On the Supplement Facts label, information on calories and serving size was not made more prominent through increased type size, as it has been on the Nutrition Facts label. While the percentage of the RDI for protein for foods purported to be for infants through 12 months of age is allowed on Nutrition Facts labels, this declaration must be omitted for Supplement Facts labels (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)).\n\nIn addition, the new ordering for vitamins and minerals on the Supplement Facts label is as follows: vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate and folic acid, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, choline, calcium, iron,phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, potassium, and fluoride (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(B)).\n\nHas Nutrient Compliance or the Level of Variance Allowed Changed?\n\nThere are still two classes of nutrients for compliance purposes. Class I covers those added nutrients in fortified or fabricated foods (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(i)), and Class II nutrients are those that are naturally occurring, or indigenous, nutrients (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(ii)). For compliance purposes, if both Class I and Class II nutrients are present in the final food product, then the total amount of the nutrient (both indigenous and exogenous) is subject to class I requirements.\n\nThe updated rule does not change the level of variances allowed in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and 101.9(g)(5), but the rule also now includes soluble fiber and insoluble fiber in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and added sugars in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Therefore, 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) now states that a food with a label declaration of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat will be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the FD&C Act, unless the nutrient content of the composite is formulated to be at least equal to the declared value for the vitamin, mineral, protein, or dietary fiber meeting the definition of a Class I nutrient (potassium has been removed), or the nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to 80 percent of the declared value for the vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber meeting the definition of a Class II nutrient (potassium and ""other carbohydrate"" have been removed). Our regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5), state that a food with a label declaration of calories, sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium will be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the FD&C Act if the nutrient content of the composite is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label. Reasonable excesses of soluble fiber, insoluble fiber and sugar alcohols, and reasonable deficiencies of added sugars are also now acceptable within current good manufacturing practices.\n\nWhich Version of the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International Should be Used?\n\nThe final rule now incorporates by reference the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International, 19th edition (2012) (21 CFR 101.9(l)(1)(i)).\n\nVIII. How Do I Comply with the Formatting Requirements?\n\nThere are required formats for Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels. We strongly recommend that the nutrition information be presented using the graphic specifications below (see also Appendix B to 21 CFR part 101 and Ref. 8).\n\nVIII.1 How Do I Comply with the Standard Version of the Nutrition Facts Label?\n\nFigures 3 through 5 reflect what a standard vertical Nutrition Facts label must look like (see 21 CFR 101.9(d)(12)). This format is to be used except on foods where the tabular display is\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]\n\n11 How Has the Formatting Changed for the ""Nutrition Facts"" Header on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe ""Nutrition Facts"" heading must be in a type size no smaller than all other print size in the nutrition label, except for the numerical information for ""Calories,"" which according to 21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii) must be in a type size no smaller than 22 point for the standard label (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)). It must be set the full width of the nutrient information, unless impractical (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)). It is not required to be set the full width of the nutrient information for labels presented according to the following formats: tabular display, aggregate display, tabular dual column display, tabular display for small or intermediate-sized packages, and linear display for small or intermediate-sized packages (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)).\n\nA thin horizontal line (i.e., a hairline rule) is to be inserted directly beneath the Nutrition Facts heading, before the servings per container statement (except on the linear display discussed below) (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(v)).\n\nFigure 5: Standard Vertical, Mandatory and Voluntary Nutrients\n\n11.2 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declaration of Calories on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe type size has increased for ""Calories"" and the numeric value of ""Calories."" On the standard vertical display of the Nutrition Facts label, the numeric value of ""Calories"" must be listed in a type size no smaller than 22 point, as well as in bold or extra bold type highlighting (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). The word ""Calories"" must be listed in a type size no smaller than 16 point, as well as in bold or extra bold type highlighting (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 3 through 5.\n\n3 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declarations of Serving Size and Servings Per Container on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe "" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container"" declaration now immediately follows the ""Nutrition Facts"" heading and must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i)).\n\nBelow "" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container"" is the declaration of ""Serving size."" ""Serving size"" is to be highlighted in bold or extra bold and in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(ii)). While the ""Serving size"" declaration is still left-justified, the corresponding numerical value is now right-justified on Nutrition Facts labels only (not on Supplement Facts labels), provided that adequate space is available (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(ii)). If the ""Serving size"" declaration does not fit in the allocated space, then a type size no smaller than 8 point may be used on packages of any size.\n\nFor further information on the updates made to the Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed and Serving Size regulations, please reference the Small Entity Compliance Guide entitled ""Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments: Guidance for Industry"" (Ref. 9), as well as the final guidance entitled ""Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Size-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics"" (Ref. 10).\n\n4 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declaration of Vitamins and Minerals on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nNutrient information for vitamins and minerals (except sodium) are to be separated from information regarding other nutrients by a bar (21 CFR 101.9(d)(8)). They may be listed vertically (Figures 3 and 5) or horizontally (Figure 4). If listed horizontally in two columns, then vitamin D and calcium should be listed on the first line, and iron and potassium should be listed on the second line (21 CFR 101.9(d)(8)). Nutrient information must be in a type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)).\n\n11.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhile ""Calories from fat"" can no longer be declared, ""Calories from saturated fat"" is still allowed (21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(ii)). When declared, it is to be indented under the statement of calories and must be in a type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(5)).\n\n11.4 Where, and How, Do I Declare ""Added Sugars"" on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe statement ""Includes \'X\' g Added Sugars"" must be used to declare added sugars content (except on packages of single ingredient sugars), and this statement must be indented directly beneath the listing for ""Total Sugars"" on the Nutrition Facts label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The \'X\' will be filled in with the respective added sugar content (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). In Appendix B to 21 CFR 101, we illustrate our recommendation to shorten the length of the hairline requirement between total sugars and added sugars to help denote that ""added sugars"" are a subcomponent of ""total sugars."" As mentioned above, a DRV has been established for added sugars for most population groups, and the % Daily Value declaration is required as well (21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii)). Added sugars must also be declared on the Supplement Facts label (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAdded sugars content must be expressed to the nearest gram, except in the following circumstances:\n\nThe statement ""Contains less than 1 gram"" or, alternatively, ""less than 1 gram"" may be used if a serving contains less than 1 gram added sugars; or\n\nThe added sugars content may be expressed as zero if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram.\n\nSee 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels'

What is an ""ingredient""?\n\nThe Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act uses the term ""ingredient"" to refer to the compounds used in the manufacture of a dietary supplement. For instance, when calcium carbonate is used to provide calcium, calcium carbonate is an ""ingredient"" and calcium is a ""dietary ingredient."" The term ""ingredient"" also refers to substances such as binders, colors, excipients, fillers, flavors, and sweeteners.\n\nPublic Law 103-417, 60 Federal Register 67194 at 67199 (December 28, 1995)\n\n2. What is unique about the ingredient labeling of dietary supplements?Top 0Ingredients that are sources of dietary ingredients may be listed within the ""Supplement Facts"" panel, e.g., ""Calcium (as calcium carbonate)."" When ingredients are listed in this way, they do not have to be listed again in the ingredient statement (also called an ingredient list).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(d)\n\nDo I need an ingredient statement when all of my ingredients are listed in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n\nNo. If you place all source ingredients in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel and you have no other ingredients, such as excipients or fillers, you do not need an ingredient statement.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(a)(1)\n\nHow must I identify the ingredient list?\n\nYou must precede the ingredient list by the word ""Ingredients,"" except that you must use the words ""Other Ingredients"" when you have identified some ingredients (i.e., as sources) within the nutrition label.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(g)\n\nWhere must I place the ingredient list on the label?\n\nWhen present, you must place the ingredient list on dietary supplements immediately below the nutrition label, or if there is insufficient space below the nutrition label, immediately contiguous and to the right of the nutrition label.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(g)\n\nWhat type size must I use for the ingredient list?\n\nYou must display this information prominently and conspicuously, but in no case may the types size be less that 1/16 inch in height as measured by the lower case ""0"", or its equivalent, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.105(h)(2).\n\n21 CFR 101.2(c), 21 CFR 101.15, and 21 CFR 101.105(h)(1) and (2)\n\nMust I list the ingredients in a specified order?\n\nYes. You must list the ingredients in descending order of predominance by weight. This means that the ingredient that weighs the most is first and the ingredient that weighs the least is last.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(a)\n\nHow must I declare spices, natural flavors, or artificial flavors?\n\nYou must declare these ingredients in ingredient lists by using either specific common or usual names or by using the declarations ""spice,"" ""natural flavor"" or ""artificial flavor,"" or any combination thereof.\n\n21 CFR 101.22(h)(1) and 21 CFR 101.4(a)(1)\n\nCan I indicate that a spice is also a coloring?\n\nTop 0Yes. Paprika, turmeric, saffron and other spices that are also colorings, may be declared either by name or the term ""spice and coloring."" For example, paprika may be listed as ""paprika"" or as ""spice and coloring.""\n\n21 CFR 101.22(a)(2)\n\n10. How must I declare artificial colors?\n\nIt depends on whether or not the artificial color is certified. List a certified color by its specific or abbreviated name, e.g., ""FD&C Red No. 40"" or ""Red 40.""\n\nA color that is not certified may be listed as an ""Artificial Color,"" ""Artificial Color\n\nAdded,"" ""Color Added,""or by its specific common or usual name.\n\n21 CFR 101.22(k)(1) and (k)(2)\n\n11. May I use ""and/or"" labeling for fats and oils?\n\nYes. When a blend of fats and/or oils is not the predominant ingredient of your product and you vary the makeup of the blend you may use ""and/or"" labeling or language such as:\n\nINGREDIENTS:...vegetable oil shortening (contains one or more of the following:\n\ncottonseed oil, palm oil, soybean oil).""\n\n21 CFR 101.4(b)(14)\n\n12. Do I need to list water?\n\nYes. You must identify the added water in the list of ingredients in descending order of\n\npredominance by weight. For example:\n\n""Ingredients: Cod liver oil, gelatin, water, and glycerin""\n\n21 CFR 101.4(a) and (c) and 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iv)\n\n13. How do I list a chemical preservative?\n\nYou must list the common or usual name of the preservative followed by a description\n\nthat explains its function e.g., ""preservative,"" ""to retard spoilage,"" ""a mold inhibitor,""\n\n""to help protect flavor,"" or ""to promote color retention.""\n\n21 CFR 101.22(j)\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter V. Ingredient Labeling'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: 21 CFR 101.13(h)(4)(iii)\n* 14._When may I make a ""high"" or ""good source"" claim? You may make a ""high"" claim when your dietary supplement contains at least 20% of the Daily Value (DV) (i.e. the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) or Daily Reference Value (DRV)) of the nutrient that is the subject of the claim per reference amount customarily consumed. You may make a ""good source"" claim when your dietary supplement contains 10 to 19% of DV. 21 CFR 101.54(b)(i) and (c)(i)\n* 15._Is there any way that I can let consumers know that my product contains nutrients without DVs, such as phosphatidylserine? You may make a statement about a nutrient for which there is no established Daily Value (DV) so long as the claim specifies only the amount of the nutrient per serving and does not imply that there is a lot or a little of that nutrient in the product (e.g., ""x grams of phosphatidylserine""). You must list the dietary ingredient for which there is no DV and the quantitative amount of that dietary ingredient in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel in the section below the nutrients with DVs. These dietary ingredients must be identified as having no DVs by the use of the footnote ""Daily Value Not Established."" 21 CFR 101.13(i)(3) and 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)\n* 16._May I make statements using the words ""contains"" and ""provides"" for nutrients without DVs? Yes. You may use such statements if, and only if, you include the specific amount of the nutrient (e.g., ""Contains x grams of phosphatidylserine per serving"" or ""Provides x g of phosphatidylserine""). 21 CFR 101.13(i)(3) and 101.54(c)(1)\n* 17._Is a statement outside of the ""Supplement Facts"" panel that describes the percentage of the RDI of a vitamin or mineral in my dietary supplement product a nutrient content claim? Yes. These claims are considered nutrient content claims and are not exempt from bearing a disclosure statement when required. 21 CFR 101.13(b)(1), (c) and (i) back to top\n* 18._Am I permitted to make a ""low"" or ""free"" claim when my dietary supplement product is specially processed? Yes. If a similar dietary supplement is normally expected to contain a nutrient and your dietary supplement is specially processed, altered, formulated, or reformulated as to lower the amount of the nutrient in the food, remove the nutrient in the food, or not include the nutrient, then you are permitted to make a ""low"" or ""free"" claim as applicable.\n\n21 CFR 101.13(e)(1)\n* 19. May I make a ""low"" or ""free"" claim for my dietary supplement product if it is normally low in or free of a nutrient, and I use an appropriate disclaimer? No. However, a claim may be used if you indicate that it refers to all products of that type and not merely to that particular brand. 21 CFR 101.13(e)(2)\n* 20. Are claims such as ""100 percent milk free"" and ""contains no preservatives"" subject to the nutrient content claim requirements? No. Such statements are not nutrient content claims so long as they are not used in a nutrient context that would make them an implied claim under 21 CFR 101.13(b)(2). The statement ""100 percent milk free"" is generally a claim to facilitate avoidance of milk products. ""Contains no preservatives"" is a claim about a substance that does not have a nutritive function. 21 CFR 101.65(b)(1) and (b)(2)\n* 21. Is a ""no sugar"" claim subject to the nutrient content claim requirements? Yes. Sugar content claims are subject to the nutrient content claim requirements. 21 CFR 101.60(c)(1)\n* 22. When can the nutrient content claim ""no added sugar"" be used? To avoid misleading consumers, the term ""no added sugar"" should be limited to dietary supplements containing no added sugars that are normally expected to contain them. 21 CFR 101.60(c)(2)(iv)\n* 23. Must a dietary supplement bearing a ""sugar free"" claim be labeled ""low calorie""? No. A ""low calorie"" claim may not be made on dietary supplements, except when an equivalent amount of a dietary supplement that the labeled dietary supplement resembles and for which it substitutes (e.g., another protein supplement), normally exceeds the definition for ""low calorie."" 21 CFR 101.60(c)(1)(iii)(A)\n\nback to top\n\nAntioxidant Claims\n\nWhat is a nutrient content claim for antioxidants? It is a nutrient content claim that characterizes the level of one or more antioxidant nutrients present in a dietary supplement. 21 CFR 101.54(g)23.8.25.3.723\n\nMust the nutrient or dietary ingredient have an RDI to qualify for an antioxidant claim?\n\nYes, except as noted in question #28 below.\n\n21 CFR 101.54(g)(1)\n\nAre there any other requirements for a dietary supplement to qualify for an antioxidant nutrient content claim?\n\nYes. The nutrients that are the subject of the claim must have recognized antioxidant activity. In addition, the level of each nutrient that is the subject of the claim must be sufficient to qualify for either ""high"" claims in 21 CFR 101.54(b), ""good source"" claims in 21 CFR 101.54(c), or ""more"" claims in 21 CFR 101.54(e). For example, for a product to qualify for a ""high in antioxidant vitamin C"" claim, it must contain 20 percent or more of the RDI for vitamin C. That is, it must meet the level for ""high"" defined in $101.54(b). For a product to qualify for a ""good source of antioxidant vitamin C"" claim it must contain 10 to 19 percent of the RDI for vitamin C.\n\n21 CFR 101.54(g)(2) and (g)(3)\n\nWhat do you mean by ""recognized antioxidant activity""?\n\nRecognized antioxidant activity means that there is scientific evidence that, following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, the substance participates in physiological, biochemical, or cellular processes that inactivate free radicals or prevent free radical-initiated chemical reactions.\n\n21 CFR 101.54(g)(2)\n\nMay beta-carotene, which does not have an RDI, be the subject of an antioxidant claim?\n\nYes. You may make a claim for beta-carotene when the level of vitamin A present as beta-carotene is sufficient to qualify for the claim. For example, you may make the claim ""good source of antioxidant beta-carotene"" when 10% or more of the RDI for vitamin A is present as beta-carotene.\n\n21 CFR 101.54(g)(3)\n\nMust I list all antioxidants present in my product when making an antioxidant nutrient content claim?\n\nYes. The names of the nutrients that are the subject of the claim must be included as part of the claim (e.g., ""high in antioxidant vitamins C and E""). Alternatively, you may link the term ""antioxidant"" or ""antioxidants"" in a nutrient content claim (as in ""high in antioxidants"") by a symbol (e.g., an asterisk) that refers to the same symbol that appears elsewhere on the same panel followed by the name or names of the nutrients with recognized antioxidant activity. This list should be in letters at least 1/16 of an inch in height or no smaller than half the type size of the largest nutrient content claim, whichever is larger.\n\n23.8.25.5.723\n\nCan I make other claims that describe the antioxidant properties of my product?Yes. You may craft a statement, subject to section 403(a) of the act (the false and misleading provisions), that describes how a dietary ingredient that does not have an RDI participates in antioxidant processes. Likewise, structure/function claims may be made about antioxidants as long as such claims are not false or misleading and, if appropriate, are made in accordance with section 403(r)(6) of the act (the provisions for statements of nutritional support). For example, a claim that reads "", involved in antioxidant processes"" would be acceptable as long as it is:\n\n1) truthful and not misleading; and\n\n2) meets the requirements of section 403(r)(6) of the act (see questions #44 through #51 of this chapter).\n\n62 FR 49868 at 49873 (September 23, 1997)\n\nHigh Potency Claims31. Can I use the term ""high potency"" to describe an individual nutrient?Yes. You may use the term ""high potency"" on your dietary supplement labels to describe individual vitamins or minerals that are present at 100 percent or more of the RDI per reference amount customarily consumed.\n\n21 CFR 101.54(f)(1)(i)\n\nCan the term ""high potency"" be used for combination products, such as botanicals with vitamins?Yes. However, when you use the term ""high potency"" to describe individual vitamins or minerals in your product that contains other nutrients or dietary ingredients, you must clearly identify which vitamin or mineral you are describing by the term ""high potency"" (e.g., ""Botanical \'X\' with high potency vitamin E"").\n\n21 CFR 101.54(f)(1)(ii)\n\nHow many nutrients must be present at 100% of the DV for a multinutrient product to qualify for the term ""high potency?""You may use the term ""high potency"" on your multinutrient product to describe the product if it contains 100 percent or more of the RDI for at least two-thirds of the vitamins and minerals that are listed in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv), and that are present in the product at 2 percent or more of the RDI (e.g., ""High potency multivitamin, multimineral dietary supplement tablets"").\n\n21 CFR 101.54(f)(2)\n\nPercentage Claims34. What is a percentage claim?It is a statement that characterizes the percentage level of a dietary ingredient for which a reference daily intake (RDI) or daily reference value (DRV) has not been established. You may make a percentage claim on your products without a regulation that specifically defines such a statement. These statements must be accompanied by any disclosure statement required under 21 CFR 101.13(h). There are simple percentage claims and comparative percentage claims.\n\n21 CFR 101.13(q)(3)(ii)\n35.What is a simple percentage claim?\n\nIt is a statement that characterizes the percentage level of a dietary ingredient for which there is no RDI or DRV (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids, amino acids, phytochemicals). The statement of the actual amount of the dietary ingredient per serving must be declared next to the percentage statement (e.g., ""4o percent omega-3 fatty acids, 10 mg per capsule"").\n\n21 CFR 101.13(q)(3)(ii)(A)\n36.What is a comparative percentage claim?\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter VI.

Harmonisation in relation to medicines for geriatric populations is an important issue because the total population of the elderly will increase significantly in the coming years in Europe, Japan and the USA. The use of drugs in this population requires special consideration due to the frequent occurrence of underlying diseases, concomitant drug therapy and the consequent risk of drug interaction.\nII.: General Principle\n\nDrugs should be studied in all age groups, including the elderly, for which they will have significant utility. Patients entering clinical trials should be reasonably representative of the population that will be later treated by the drug.\nIII.: Scope of Guideline\n--------------------\nContext title: E7_Guideline'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n--------------------\nContext: Scope and Direction\n\nThe focus of this guidance is on statistical principles. It does not address the use of specific statistical procedures or methods. Specific procedural steps to ensure that principles are implemented properly are the responsibility of the sponsor. Integration of data across clinical trials is discussed, but is not a primary focus of this guidance. Selected principles and procedures related to data management or clinical trial monitoring activities are covered in other ICH guidelines and are not addressed here.\n\nThis guidance should be of interest to individuals from a broad range of scientific disciplines. However, it is assumed that the actual responsibility for all statistical work associated with clinical trials will lie with an appropriately qualified and experienced statistician, as indicated in ICH E6. The role and responsibility of the trial statistician (see Glossary), in collaboration with other clinical trial professionals, is to ensure that statistical principles are applied appropriately in clinical trials supporting drug development. Thus, the trial statistician should have a combination of education/training and experience sufficient to implement the principles articulated in this guidance.\n\nFor each clinical trial contributing to a marketing application, all important details of its design and conduct and the principal features of its proposed statistical analysis should be clearly specified in a protocol written before the trial begins. The extent to which the procedures in the protocol are followed and the primary analysis is planned a priori will contribute to the degree of confidence in the final results and conclusions of the trial. The protocol and subsequent amendments should be approved by the responsible personnel, including the trial statistician. The trial statistician should ensure that the protocol and any amendments cover all relevant statistical issues clearly and accurately, using technical terminology as appropriate.\n\nThe principles outlined in this guidance are primarily relevant to clinical trials conducted in the later phases of development, many of which are confirmatory trials of efficacy. In addition to efficacy, confirmatory trials may have as their primary variable a safety variable (e.g. an adverse event, a clinical laboratory variable or an electrocardiographic measure), a pharmacodynamic or a pharmacokinetic variable (as in a confirmatory bioequivalence trial). Furthermore, some confirmatory findings may be derived from data integrated across trials, and selected principles in this guidance are applicable in this situation. Finally, although the early phases of drug development consist mainly of clinical trials that are exploratory in nature, statistical principles are also relevant to these clinical trials. Hence, the substance of this document should be applied as far as possible to all phases of clinical development.\n--------------------\nContext title: E9_Guideline'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n--------------------\nContext: It is important to ensure that the experiences, perspectives, needs, and priorities of relevant stakeholders relating to the development and evaluation of the drug throughout its lifecycle are captured and meaningfully incorporated into drug development planning.\n\nClinical development may also feature requirements for co-development of validated biomarkers, diagnostic testing, or devices that facilitate the safe and effective use of a drug.\n\nThe types of studies that can contribute to drug development are described in subsections IV.2 (4.2) and IV.3 (4.3) and summarized in the Annex.\n\nQuality of Investigational Medicinal Product (4.1)\n\nEnsuring adequate quality and characterization of physicochemical properties of investigational medicinal product is an important element in planning a drug development program and is addressed in ICH and regional quality guidances. More extensive characterization may be required for complex or biological products. Formulations should be well characterized in the drug development plan, including information on bioavailability, wherever feasible, and should be appropriate for the stage of drug development and the targeted patient population. Age-appropriate formulation development may be a consideration when clinical studies are planned in pediatric populations (ICH guidances for industry E11 Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population (December 2000) and E11(R1) Addendum: Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population (April 2018)).\n\nEvaluation of the quality of a drug may extend to devices required for its administration or a companion diagnostic to identify the targeted population.\n\nChanges in a product during development should be supported by comparability data to ensure the ability to interpret study results across the development program. This includes establishing links between formulations through bioequivalence studies or other means.\n\nNonclinical Studies (4.2)\n\nGuidance on nonclinical safety studies is provided in the ICH guidance for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals (January 2010), in ICH Safety (S) Guidances and related question-and-answer documents, as well as in regional guidance. The nonclinical assessment usually includes toxicology, carcinogenicity, immunogenicity, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and other evaluations to support clinical studies (and may encompass evidence generated in in vivo and in vitro models, and by modelling and simulation). The scope of nonclinical studies, and their timing with respect to clinical studies, depend on a variety of factors that inform further development, such as the drug's chemical or molecular properties; pharmacological basis of principal effects (mechanism of action); route(s) of administration; absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; physiological effects on organ systems; dose/concentration-response relationships; metabolites; and duration of action and use. Use of the drug in special populations (e.g., pregnant or breast-feeding people, children) may require additional nonclinical assessments. Guidance for nonclinical safety studies to support human clinical studies in special populations should be reviewed (see, e.g., the ICH guidances for industry S5(R3) Detection of Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity for Human Pharmaceuticals (May 2021), S11 Nonclinical Safety Testing in Support of Development of Pediatric Pharmaceuticals (May 2021), and M3(R2).\n\nAssessment of the preclinical characteristics, including physiological and toxicological effects of the drug, serves to inform clinical study design and planned use in humans. Before proceeding to studies in humans, there should be sufficient nonclinical information to support initial human doses and duration of exposure.\n\nClinical Studies (4.3)\n\nClinical drug development, defined as studying the drug in humans, is conducted in a sequence that builds on knowledge accumulated from nonclinical and previous clinical studies. The structure of the drug development program is shaped by many considerations and comprised of studies with different objectives, designs, and dependencies. The Annex provides an illustrative list of example studies and their objectives. Although clinical drug development is often described as consisting of four temporal phases (phases 1 through 4), it is important to appreciate that the phase concept is a description and not a requirement, and that the phases of drug development may overlap or be combined.\n\nTo develop new drugs efficiently, it is essential to identify their characteristics in the early stages of development and to plan an appropriate development program based on this profile. Initial clinical studies may be more limited in size and duration to provide an early evaluation of short-term safety and tolerability, as well as proof of concept of efficacy. These studies may provide pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and other information needed to choose a suitable dosage range and/or administration schedule to inform further clinical studies. As more information is known about the drug, clinical studies may expand in size and duration, may include more diverse study populations, and may include more secondary endpoints in addition to the primary measures of efficacy. Throughout development, new data may suggest the need for additional studies.\n\nThe use of biomarkers has the potential to facilitate the availability of safer and more effective drugs, to guide dose selection, and to enhance a drug's benefit-risk profile (see the ICH guidance for industry E16 Biomarkers Related to Drug or Biotechnology Product Development: Context, Structure, and Format of Qualification Submissions (August 2011)) and can be considered throughout drug development. Clinical studies may evaluate the use of biomarkers to better target patients more likely to benefit and less likely to experience adverse reactions, or as intermediate endpoints that could predict clinical response.\n\nThe following subsections describe the types of studies that typically span clinical development from the first studies in humans through late development and post-approval.\n\n1.1.1 Human Pharmacology (4.3.1)\n\nThe protection of study participants should always be the first priority when designing early clinical studies, especially for the initial administration of an investigational product to humans (usually referred to as phase 1). These studies may be conducted in healthy volunteer participants or in a selected population of patients who have the condition or the disease, depending on drug properties and the objectives of the development program.\n\nThese studies typically address one or a combination of the following aspects:\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nEstimation of Initial Safety and Tolerability (4.3.1.1)\n\nThe initial and subsequent administration of a drug to humans is usually intended to determine the tolerability of the dose range expected to be evaluated in later clinical studies and to determine the nature of adverse reactions that can be expected. These studies typically include both single- and multiple-dose administration.\n\nPharmacokinetics (4.3.1.2)\n\nCharacterization of a drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion continues throughout the development program, but the preliminary characterization is an essential early goal. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies are particularly important to assess the clearance of the drug and to anticipate possible accumulation of parent drug or metabolites, interactions with metabolic enzymes and transporters, and potential drug-drug interactions. Some PK studies are commonly conducted in later phases to answer more specialized questions. For orally administered drugs, the study of food effects on bioavailability is important to inform the dosing instructions in relation to food. Obtaining PK information in subpopulations with potentially different metabolism or excretion, such as patients with renal or hepatic impairment, geriatric patients, children, and ethnic subgroups, should be considered (ICH guidances for industry E4 Dose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration (November 1994), E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations: Geriatrics (August 1994), E11 and E11(R1) Addendum, and E5, respectively).\n\nPharmacodynamics and Early Measurement of Drug Activity (4.3.1.3)\n\nDepending on the drug and the endpoint of interest, pharmacodynamic (PD) studies and studies relating drug levels to response (PK/PD studies) may be conducted in healthy volunteer participants or in patients with the condition or disease. If there is an appropriate measure, PD data can provide early estimates of activity and efficacy and may guide the dosage and dose regimen in later studies.\n\nExploratory and Confirmatory Safety and Efficacy Studies (4.3.2)\n\nAfter initial clinical studies provide sufficient information on safety, clinical pharmacology, and dose, exploratory and confirmatory studies (usually referred to as phases 2 and 3, respectively) are conducted to further evaluate both the safety and efficacy of the drug. Depending on the nature of the drug and the patient population, this objective may be combined in a single or small number of studies. Exploratory and confirmatory studies may use a variety of study designs depending on the objective of the study.\n--------------------\nContext title: E8(R1) General Considerations for Clinical Studies""

The Q&As in this document have been endorsed by the ICH Steering Committee at Step 4 of the ICH process, July 2010. At Step 4 of the process, the final draft is recommended for adoption to the regulatory bodies of the European Union, Japan, and the United States.\n\nE7 Studies in Support of Special Populations: Geriatrics\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration\'s (FDA\'s) current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe ICH guidance E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations:__Geriatrics provides recommendations on special considerations that apply in the design and conduct of clinical trials of medicines that are likely to have significant use in the elderly. Since the E7 guidance was made final, experiences implementing the guidance in the ICH regions have given rise to requests for clarification. This question and answer (Q&A) document is intended to clarify key issues. FDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Questions and Answers\n\nQ1: Why do we need an adequate representation of geriatric patients in the clinical database?\n\nA1: Geriatric patients can respond differently from younger patients to drug therapy in a number of ways, and such differences can be greater in patients 75 years and older: (a) The geriatric population has age-related physiological changes that can affect the pharmacokinetics of the drug and the pharmacodynamic response to the drug, both of which can influence the drug-response and the dose response relationship. (b) Geriatric patients are more prone to adverse effects since they often have comorbidities and are taking concomitant therapies that could interact with the investigational drug. The adverse effects can be more severe, or less tolerated, and have more serious consequences than in the nongeriatric population. With the increasing size of the geriatric population (including patients 75 and older) and in view of the recent advances in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics since the ICH E7 guidance was established in 1993, the importance of geriatric data (from the entire spectrum of the geriatric patient population) in a drug evaluation program has increased. Not all potential differences in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, disease-drug interactions, drug-drug interactions, and clinical response that can occur in the geriatric population can be predicted from nongeriatric populations, as the geriatric patients are far more likely to have multiple illnesses and to be receiving multiple drugs. Therefore, to assess the benefit/risk balance of a drug that will be used in the geriatric population, these patients should be appropriately represented in clinical trials. Q2: What should be taken into account when estimating an adequate representation of geriatric patients to be included in the clinical database?\n\nA2: It is very important to ensure, to the extent possible, that the population included in the clinical development program is representative of the target patient population. As stated in the current ICH E7 guidance, estimates of the prevalence of the disease to be treated by age or examination of the age distribution of usage for other drugs of the same class or for the same indication should be provided by the applicant. This will indicate the expected use of the drug and should influence the number of geriatric patients to be included in the marketing application. The current guidance states, ""for drugs used in diseases not unique to, but present in, the elderly, a minimum of 100 patients would usually allow detection of clinically important differences."" Given the increasing prevalence and the growing recognition of thecomplexity of the geriatric population, including concomitant therapies and co-morbidities, it would usually be appropriate to include more than 100 geriatric patients in the phase 2 and 3 databases and include patients over the entire spectrum of the geriatric patient population. In the marketing application, depending on the numbers of patients, data should be presented for various age groups (for example (<)65, 65-74, 75-84, and (\\geq) 85) to assess the consistency of the treatment effect and safety profile in these patients with the nongeriatric patient population. As single trials may not have sufficient numbers of geriatric patients to allow such analyses, these will often need to be carried out on pooled data. Any such analyses will need to consider consistency across studies.\n\nQ3: Are there any special patient populations or characteristics that are particularly important to address in the planning of the clinical development program?\n\nA3: Geriatric patients often have co-morbidities and concomitant therapies that could interact with the investigational drug and make patients more likely to have undesirable effects and interactions. Therefore, it is important to assess the safety and efficacy of a drug in such patients and to design a study with inclusion/exclusion criteria that allow their participation. There may exist a reluctance to include vulnerable geriatric patients at high risk of adverse outcomes (so-called ""frail"" geriatric patients). However, care in randomization should allow the appropriate attribution of findings either to the investigational drug or to other factors. This applies both to drugs intended for the geriatric patient population and for drugs used in diseases present in, but not unique to, the geriatric population.\n\nQ4: What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n\nA4: An appropriate representation of the geriatric population (including patients with concomitant therapies and co-morbidities) should be enrolled in the clinical development program to adequately characterize efficacy and safety in the geriatric population and allow for comparisons with the nongeriatric population. This information would ordinarily be expected in a marketing application. In general, it is preferable to include both nongeriatric and geriatric patients in the same study(ies), which can facilitate observation of age-related differences. In some cases, a separate study in the geriatric population can be preferable. Every effort should be made to include geriatric patients using concomitant therapies and with co-morbidities in the premarketing clinical development program. In some cases, enrollment of these patients can be challenging and it could be appropriate to collect data postmarketing. However, the adequacy of, and the need for, data in these patients should be considered during drug development and discussed in the marketing application submission. Where enrollment of geriatric patients has been insufficient despite the efforts of the applicant, a specific plan to collect data postmarketing should be discussed during development and presented in the marketing application. Information relevant to the geriatric patient population, including any limitations, should be reflected in the product labeling.\n\nQ5: Are there concerns related to the data specific to the geriatric population that could be considered in the planning of the clinical studies?\n--------------------\nContext title: E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations; Geriatrics; Questions and Answers'

Often, higher risk subgroups and patients with concomitant illnesses that require use of other drugs are excluded from clinical trials, and long-term treatment data are limited. Moreover, patients in trials are closely monitored for evidence of adverse events. In clinical practice, monitoring is less intensive, a broader range of patients are treated (age, co-morbidities, drugs, genetic abnormalities), and events too rare to occur in clinical trials may be observed (e.g., severe liver injury). These factors underlie the need for continuing analysis of relevant safety, efficacy,1 and effectiveness1 information throughout the lifecycle of a medicinal product - promptly, as important findings occur - and periodically - to allow an overall assessment of the accumulating data. Although the majority of new information will be safety-related, new information about effectiveness, limitations of use, alternative treatments, and many other aspects of the drug's place in therapy may be pertinent to its benefit-risk assessment.\n\nFootnote 1: The terms efficacy and effectiveness are not standardised, and have different meanings across some regions. See Section 2.6\n\nThe ICH Guideline E2C, Clinical Safety Data Management: Periodic Safety Update Reports for Marketed Drugs, achieved Step 4 in 1996, and was intended to harmonise the periodic reporting requirements to regulatory authorities and to provide, in a common format, the worldwide interval safety experience of a medicinal product at defined times post-approval. At that time, the focus of the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) was on relevant new safety information in the context of patient exposure, to determine if changes were needed to the Reference Safety Information* (RSI) in order to optimise the continued safe use of the product. The Guideline was revised in 2003, to provide needed clarification, guidance and flexibility.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline""]","['An appropriate representation of the geriatric population (including patients with concomitant therapies and co-morbidities) should be enrolled in the clinical development program to adequately characterize efficacy and safety in the geriatric population and allow for comparisons with the nongeriatric population.

[Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n--------------------\nContext: Yes, with two exceptions. The first is that the FDA requirements for IRBs under 21 CFR Part 56 are slightly different with respect to membership and function. To address this issue, as described in #12 above, FDA can provide a specific waiver from the Part 56 IRB requirements, allowing an IEC that complies with good clinical practice to substitute for the IRB.4 The second exception is that the requirements for informed consent under 21 CFR Part 50 for particular clinical trials (e.g., emergency research under 21 CFR 50.24, clinical investigations involving pediatric subjects under Subpart D) are more extensive with respect to IRB responsibilities. Because these types of trials are uncommon, our experience has not revealed that this has caused a conflict; but in the event of one, we would be willing to discuss a resolution with the sponsor on a case-by-case basis. If the investigator or sponsor believes that there are other conflicting requirements, the sponsor may request a waiver from FDA from the specific requirement under 21 CFR 312.10.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n14.  Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n\nNo. A multinational study may include domestic sites under the IND and foreign sites not under the IND.  Investigation drug and biologics studies conducted in the U.S. must be conducted in compliance with the IND requirements contained in 21 CFR 312, which includes the requirement that investigators sign the 1572.  If a study also involves foreign clinical sites, the sponsor may choose, but is not required, to include the foreign clinical sites under the IND.  The investigators from the U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND would be required to sign the 1572.  The investigators from the foreign sites that are not included under the IND are not required to sign the 1572.\n\nIf the sponsor chooses to conduct a multinational study with U.S. and some foreign sites under the IND, and other foreign sites not under the IND, the sponsor can submit a single protocol to the IND and all sites would follow this protocol.  Alternatively, the sponsor can conduct a multinational study with one protocol for sites under the IND (U.S. sites and some foreign sites) and a different protocol(s) for foreign sites not under the IND.  If the intent is to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites, the protocols would ordinarily be very similar or identical.  The U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND must follow the protocol that was submitted to the IND.  For foreign sites that are not included under the IND, the protocol(s) does not need to be submitted to the IND.  In general, if the sponsor intends to submit the data in an application for marketing approval, we recommend that the sponsor identify the foreign sites that will not be conducted under the IND and discuss plans to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites with the appropriate FDA review division.\n\nNote, however, that 21 CFR 312.32(b) requires sponsors to promptly review information about the safety of the investigational drug obtained or otherwise received by the sponsor from any source, foreign or domestic.  Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), sponsors must also notify FDA and all participating investigators in an IND safety report of any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected.  This means that FDA and all participating investigators under the IND would be informed of such an adverse experience, even if it occurred in a foreign study not conducted under the IND.\n\n15.  How does a sponsor submit information to FDA about a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND?\n\nUnder 21 CFR 312.120, the sponsor can submit information to FDA from a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND to support clinical investigations in the United States and/or marketing approval.  When submitting information about a foreign clinical study, it is helpful to clearly identify in the cover letter that the material is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120.  The submission requirements for supporting documentation can be found at 21 CFR 312.120(b).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n16. Should a new form be prepared and signed when the OMB expiration date is reached?\n\nNo. There is no need to prepare and sign a new 1572 when the OMB expiration date has been reached.\n\n17. Does FDA expect a double-sided 1572, or is a two-page document printed from the FDA website acceptable?\n\nEither is acceptable; however, FDA recommends that a two-page document be stapled so that there is no question about what form the investigator signed.\n\n18. How should the 1572 be completed?\n\nThe 1572 on FDA's website may be completed by typing the information directly into the fillable form and printing the completed form. Alternatively, it is acceptable to print the blank form from FDA's website and hand-write or type the information onto the form. Typed forms are preferable because they are usually more legible. The completed form must be signed and dated by the investigator (either by hand or using an acceptable electronic method).\n\nII. SECTION #1: NAME AND ADDRESS OF INVESTIGATOR\n\n19. How should an investigator's name appear on the 1572?\n\nSection #1 should contain the investigator's full legal name (e.g., name on the investigator's birth certificate or marriage certificate). Titles, degrees, and/or professional qualifications may follow the investigator's legal name, if desired.\n\n20. What address should be entered into Section #1?\n\nThe address where the investigator can be reached by mail or in person should be entered in Section #1 of the 1572. Usually, this corresponds to the investigator's work or business address.\n\n21. Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n\nThe term co-investigator is not defined in FDA regulations. As commonly used, the term is meant to indicate that each co-investigator is fully responsible for fulfilling all of the obligations of an investigator as identified in 21 CFR 312.60. Thus under 21 CFR 312.3(b), each co-investigator is an investigator, and as such must sign a separate 1572.\n\nIn some situations, it is preferable to have more than one investigator responsible for a clinical investigation. For example, when a study is conducted at multiple research facilities that are not in close proximity, FDA expects an investigator who has signed a 1572 to be available at each location to either personally conduct or supervise the study. This responsibility cannot be delegated to a subinvestigator.\n\nAlthough not necessary, it is acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site. For example, the conduct and supervision of a large investigation with many subjects or complicated procedures might be shared among several investigators, each of whom has signed a 1572 when the investigation is conducted under an IND. This is distinct from a subinvestigator (see #31) whose role in the clinical investigation is more limited.\n\nIII. SECTION #2: EDUCATION, TRAINING, AND EXPERIENCE THAT QUALIFY THE INVESTIGATOR AS AN EXERT IN THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION\n\n22. What is the purpose of Section #2?\n\nSection #2 requires the investigator to attach a curriculum vitae (CV) or other statement of qualifications, showing the education, training and experience that qualifies the investigator as an expert in the clinical investigation of the drug/biologic for the use under investigation. Information identified in this section and attached to the 1572 enables the sponsor to assess an investigator's qualifications.\n\n23. Does the CV or other statement of qualifications need to be updated during a clinical study?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV or other statement of qualifications to be updated during a clinical study.\n\n24. Are CVs required to be signed and dated?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV to be signed and dated. The investigator's dated signature on the 1572 is sufficient to attest to the accuracy of the CV or other statement of qualifications submitted with the 1572.\n\nIV. SECTION #3: NAME AND ADDRESS OF ANY MEDICAL SCHOOL. HOSPITAL, OR OTHER RESEARCH FACILITY WHERE THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION(S) WILL BE CONDUCTED\n\n25. What address(es) should be entered in Section #3?\n\nThe address(es) of the location(s) where the investigation will be conducted and to where the test articles will be shipped, if different from the investigator's address of record, should be entered in Section #3.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n26. What qualifies as a research facility for Section #3?\n\nSection #3 is intended to identify facilities where study activities will be conducted and clinical data will be generated or collected. This includes facilities where subjects will be seen and study procedures performed. For example, this might include locations such as health care facilities where the test article will be administered, or where physical exams will be performed. Facilities where other important clinical investigation functions are performed may also be identified in Section #3. For example, a research laboratory where the test article is prepared, a special storage facility where the test article will be kept, or a location where tissue specimens are collected should be listed in this section.\n\n27. If an investigator sees study subjects at more than one site, should the investigator list all sites on the 1572?\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions – Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572) Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n--------------------\nContext: To support a demonstration of interchangeability, section 351(k)(4)(A) of the PHS Act provides, among other things, that a sponsor must show that the proposed interchangeable product ""is biosimilar to the reference product."" Where a product is first licensed as a biosimilar, that licensure may be referenced to support a showing for this statutory criterion for demonstrating interchangeability.\n\nIn addition, section 351(k)(4)(A) of the PHS Act provides that an application for an interchangeable product must include information sufficient to show that the proposed interchangeable product ""can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient."" FDA expects that sponsors will submit data and information to support a showing that the proposed interchangeable product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in all of the reference product\'s licensed conditions of use.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\non the nature of the proposed interchangeable product, and not all factors will necessarily be relevant to a given scientific justification. The data and information may also include a scientific rationale for extrapolation of data and information to support a demonstration of interchangeability. Extrapolation is further described in section VI.B of this guidance.\n\nGenerally, the data and information to support a showing under the ""can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient"" standard will likely not involve additional clinical studies other than those necessary to support other elements of demonstrating interchangeability, which are described in section VI. We note that although a sponsor may seek licensure for a proposed interchangeable product for fewer than all conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed, we recommend that a sponsor seek licensure for all of the reference product\'s licensed conditions of use when possible.\n\nFurther, for biological products administered more than once to a patient, section 351(k)(4)(B) of the PHS Act provides that another of the criteria for FDA to make a determination of interchangeability is a finding that information in the application is sufficient to show that ""the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch."" FDA expects that applications generally will include data from a switching study or studies12 in one or more appropriate conditions of use. FDA anticipates that data and information acquired from a switching study or studies will be useful in assessing the risk, in terms of safety and diminished efficacy, of alternating or switching between the products. Considerations for the design of a switching study, including study endpoints, study design and analysis, study population, condition(s) of use, and routes of administration to be studied, are discussed in detail in section VI.A of this guidance.\n\nFootnote 12: The term switching study or studies as used throughout this guidance refers to a clinical study or studies used to determine the impact of alternating or switching between the proposed interchangeable product and the reference product.\n\nV Factors impacting the type and amount of data and information needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability\n\nThe data and information needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability, beyond that needed to demonstrate biosimilarity,13 may be dependent on and influenced by multiple factors, which are discussed in this section.\n\nA.: Product-Dependent Factors That May Impact the Data Needed to Support a Demonstration of Interchangeability\n\n1. Product Complexity and the Extent of Comparative and Functional Characterization\n\nThis section provides general, prospective considerations for evaluating the types and extent of data needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability. These considerations may affect the study design and aid in the justification of a development program for a proposed interchangeable product. Consistent with the guidance for industry Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product (April 2015),14 the Agency recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to generating data and information, which may allow the sponsor to address any uncertainty about demonstrating interchangeability that may arise at each stage of product development. At each stage, the sponsor should evaluate the extent to which there is uncertainty about the interchangeability of the proposed product with the reference product and identify a strategy to address that uncertainty.\n\nFootnote 14: We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nSection 351(k)(4)(A)(i) of the PHS Act provides that one of the criteria for FDA to make a determination of interchangeability is a finding that information in the application is sufficient to show that the proposed interchangeable product is biosimilar to the reference product. Such information would include, in part, a showing that the proposed interchangeable product meets the highly similar standard for demonstrating biosimilarity.15 The ""highly similar"" standard applies to both interchangeable and biosimilar products.\n\nFootnote 15: Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act defines biosimilarity, in part, to mean “that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components.”\n\nThe product\'s degree of structural and functional complexity may influence the extent of clinical data needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability. For example, clinical data needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability of a product expected to have a single target (e.g., a receptor) may be more limited than the clinical data that may be needed for a product acting on multiple targets or less-defined biological pathways. In addition, the extent of clinical data needed may be affected by the presence of structural features that specifically impact interchangeability (e.g., features that influence patient response to one product after exposure to another product).\n\nFDA acknowledges that there is a range of comparative analytical data that may be submitted to support licensure under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.16 Data sets that include highly sensitive analytics and/or sequential analytical methods that can identify molecules with different combinations of attributes (e.g., charge variants and glycoforms), as well as a comprehensive assessment of the relationships between attributes, may provide information that reduces theuncertainty about interchangeability. These approaches could be of greater importance for more complex products because these products would have a larger number of attributes and thus a potential for greater uncertainty regarding interchangeability. Advances in analytics may allow for extended analytical characterization that affect the extent of other data and information needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability and may in certain circumstances lead to a more selective and targeted approach to clinical studies intended to support a demonstration of interchangeability.\n\nii.1.2 Product-Specific Immunogenicity Risk\n\nClinical experience with the reference product and comprehensive product risk assessments (e.g., regarding immunogenicity)17 may also affect the data and information needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability. For example, products with a documented history of inducing detrimental immune responses may require more data to support a demonstration of interchangeability than products with an extensive documented history that immunogenicity does not impact clinical outcomes.\n\nFootnote 17: Section VII.D.2 in the guidance for industry Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product (April 2015) provides a discussion on clinical immunogenicity assessment.\n\nii.1.3 Totality of Factors to Consider in Assessing the Data and Information Needed to Support a Demonstration of Interchangeability\n\nThe factors discussed in sections V.A.1 and V.A.2 of this guidance need to be considered together to inform the data and information needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability in a particular context. Consider the following illustrative examples:\n\nProduct A and its associated reference product have relatively low structural complexity and the reference product has no history of inducing severe immune responses related to immunogenicity. Product A also has a low incidence of serious adverse events related to immunogenicity, similar in nature and frequency to those observed with the reference product, as demonstrated in clinical studies conducted as part of the development program for Product A. Here, sufficiently extensive comparative analytical data supporting a demonstration that the proposed interchangeable product (Product A) is highly similar to the reference product, in addition to data derived from an appropriately designed dedicated switching or integrated study (see section VI.A), may be sufficient to support a demonstration of interchangeability.\n--------------------\nContext title: Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference Product Guidance for Industry'

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if that approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist sponsors in deciding whether a study of marketed drugs or biological products for treating cancer falls within the exemption under SS 312.2(b)(1) (21 CFR 312.2(b)(1)) from the general requirement to submit an investigational new drug application (IND). The guidance discusses the Agency\'s current thinking on when studies of marketed cancer products are exempt from IND regulation based on a risk assessment. The Agency hopes that clarifying its policy will help sponsors identify which studies are exempt, thus saving them from submitting unnecessary IND applications.\n\nThis guidance revises the guidance of the same title published in September 2003. In the September 2003 version, the Agency\'s final statement was that it believed that most randomized studies of a size that could support a labeling supplement would likely not be exempt from IND regulation under SS 312.2(b)(1)(i), (ii). This is because they would be intended to support approval of a new indication, a significant change in the product labeling, or a significant change in advertising. Experience has shown that this interpretation was formulated too broadly and inappropriately referred to size alone. The Agency has decided to revise this guidance by removing that statement (the last sentence in section V.B). Whether a study could support a change in labeling is a complex determination, based on study design, size, and other factors.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements arecited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nGenerally, regulations in part 312 (21 CFR part 312) require sponsors who wish to study a drug or biological product in humans to submit an IND to the Agency.2 However, these regulations also provide for the exemption of some studies from the requirement to submit an IND if they meet certain criteria. Each year, many INDs for cancer drugs are submitted that contain studies that the Agency determines are exempt. This guidance is intended to help applicants identify which studies may be exempt.\n\nFootnote 2: Part 312 applies to all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) or to the licensing provisions of the Public Health Service Act (58 Stat. 632, as amended (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.)).\n\nRegulations\n\nRegulations in SS 312.2(b)(1) provide for the exemption of some studies for some drugs from IND regulations if the studies meet the following five criteria:\n\nThe study is not intended to support FDA approval of a new indication or a significant change in the product labeling.\n\nThe study is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the product.\n\nThe investigation does not involve a route of administration or dosage level or use in a patient population or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug product.\n\nThe study is conducted in compliance with institutional review board (IRB) and informed consent regulations set forth in parts 56 and 50 (21 CFR parts 56 and 50).\n\nThe study is conducted in compliance with SS 312.7 (promotion and charging for investigational drugs).\n\nRequirements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are not directly related to the specific protocol submitted, and their interpretation is similar for oncologic and nononcologic therapies. Requirement 3 is protocol related and has special meaning in the oncology therapy setting, particularly with respect to doses above the labeled dose, use with other treatments, and use in different populations.\n\nIn the preamble to the IND regulations, which published in the Federal Register on March 19, 1987, the Agency explained that the exemption was not necessarily intended to tie the investigator to the doses and routes of administration and patient population described in the approved labeling, but to permit deviations from the approved labeling to the extent that such changes are supported by the scientific literature and generally known clinical experience. The Agency recognizes that a considerable amount of professional judgment is exercised in determining whether the planned investigation significantly increases the risk associated with the use of the drug. FDA maintains that ""because the assessment of risks involved in a therapeutic procedure is an everyday part of the practice of medicine, the individual investigator should usually be able to determine the applicability of the exemption.""3\n\nFootnote 3: New Drug, Antibiotic, and Biologic Drug Product Regulations, Federal Register, March 19, 1987, Vol. 52, Nr. 53, p. 8802.\n\n1996 Agency Cancer Initiative\n\nIn 1996, as part of the President\'s National Performance Review, the Agency launched its Reinventing the Regulation of Cancer Drugs initiative with the goal of accelerating the approval of and expanding patient access to cancer drugs.4 As part of this initiative, the Agency explained that many sponsor-investigators were submitting INDs for exploratory studies for so-called off-label indications for two reasons: (1) IRBs incorrectly believe an IND is required, or (2) the pharmaceutical manufacturer agrees to provide a drug free of charge, but mistakenly concludes that the FDA will view this as promotional activity. With the intent of clarifying the Agency\'s policy and decreasing the number of unnecessary submissions, the Agency emphasized that it would no longer accept INDs considered exempt under SS 312.2(b)(1). (See SS 312.2(b)(4).) Furthermore, FDA stated that providing a drug for study would not, in and of itself, be viewed as a promotional activity if the manufacturer or distributor provides the product for a physician-initiated, bona fide clinical investigation. The Agency explained that it is the responsibility of the investigator to determine whether an IND is necessary.\n\nFootnote 4: Reinventing the Regulation of Cancer Drugs – Accelerating Approval and Expanding Access (March 1996), CBER, Office of Communication, Training, and Manufacturer Assistance, Voice Information System at 1-800-835-4709 or 301-827-1800, document ID number 0281. Available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cber/genadmin/reincanc.htm\n\nDespite the Agency\'s attempts to clarify its policy on IND exemptions, many cancer drug IND applications that the Agency determines are exempt from IND regulation are still being submitted unnecessarily. From 1997 to 1999, a majority of investigator IND submissions for marketed cancer drugs were considered exempt (204, 205, and 140 applications in 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively).\n\nIII Risk/Benefit analysis in the practice of oncology\n\nAs noted above, a critical question in determining whether a study is exempt involves criterion 3 in the exemption regulations (SS 312.2(b)(1)(iii)): The investigation may not significantly increase the risk associated with use of a drug product. The question of increased risk is determined by assessing the deviation in the planned investigation from the use described in the approved label. In oncology, modifications of labeled dosing recommendations are common and occur as part of oncologists\' clinical practice. As outlined below, oncologists are familiar with evaluating the risk of off-label dosing regimens for cancer drug and biological products.\n\nTreatment with cancer drugs may be associated with significant risk from known toxicity. Because effectiveness is often related to dose, a dose close to the maximal tolerated dose is often selected for studies of cancer drugs. This same dose usually becomes the recommended dose in labeling when the new cancer drug is approved with the knowledge that the dose may be altered if it is not tolerated by a patient. Because it is not generally possible to have maximal efficacy in a population without inducing toxicity in some patients, it is not uncommon to observe severe or even lethal side effects from cancer drugs in some patients. In general, these circumstances mean that the toxicity, even potentially lethal toxicity, of cancer drugs is described in approved labeling.\n--------------------\nContext title: IND Exemptions for Studies of Lawfully Marketed Drug or Biological Products for the Treatment of Cancer Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n--------------------\nContext: Although FDA will not accept as support for an IND or application for marketing approval any study that does not meet the conditions of 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will examine the data from such a study because the data may have a bearing on the safe use of the product.9 Sponsors and applicants are reminded that they must submit all studies and other information as required under the applicable regulations for drugs,10 including studies that do not comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nFootnote 9: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(2); 73 Fed. Reg. at 22807.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nA sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived.11 When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with the requirements in 21 CFR 312.120 in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Under 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and if FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary.12 Note that marketing approval of a new drug based solely on foreign clinical data is governed by 21 CFR 314.106.\n\nFootnote 10: See, for example, 21 CFR 314.50, 314.80, 600.80, and 601.2.\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR part 312.\n\nThe GCP requirements at 21 CFR 312.120 help protect human subjects and enhance the quality and integrity of the resulting clinical data.13 They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.14 Many of the requirements at 21 CFR 312.120 are already incorporated into the IND regulations at 21 CFR part 312, as well as 21 CFR parts 50 and 56,15 and are consistent with certain international ethical and policy standards for clinical trials (e.g., International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) ""GoodClinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline"" (ICH E6), which FDA adopted for use as guidance for industry in 1997).16\n\nFootnote 16: ICH E6 and other FDA guidance documents adopted from the ICH are available electronically at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\n1 Acceptance of Studies (21 Cfr 312.120(a))\n\nFDA regulations define GCP as ""a standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials in a way that provides assurance that the data are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects are protected.""17\n\nFootnote 17: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(1)(i).\n\nGCP includes review and approval (or provision of a favorable opinion) by an independent ethics committee (IEC) before initiating a study, continuing review of an ongoing study by an IEC, and obtaining and documenting the freely given informed consent of the subject (or a subject\'s legally authorized representative, if the subject is unable to provide informed consent) before initiating a study.\n\nAs defined at 21 CFR 312.3(b), an IEC is ""a review panel that is responsible for ensuring the protection of the rights, safety, and well-being of human subjects involved in a clinical investigation, and is adequately constituted to provide assurance of that protection."" We consider an IEC to be ""adequately constituted"" if it includes a reasonable number of members with the qualifications and experience to perform the IEC\'s functions. One type of IEC is an institutional review board (IRB) as defined in 21 CFR 56.102(g) and subject to the requirements of 21 CFR part 56. Another type of IEC is one that adheres to section 3.2.1 of ICH E6. Compliance with 21 CFR part 56 or ICH E6 is not required, however, for an IEC to be considered ""adequately constituted"" under 21 CFR 312.120. We have expressly allowed for flexibility in how to meet the requirements of this regulation in recognition that the organization and membership of IECs may differ among countries because of local needs.18 For more information on IEC membership, see Section 3.2.6 of this guidance document, below.\n\nFootnote 18: 73 Fed. Reg. at 22805.\n\nICH E6 defines informed consent as ""a process by which a subject voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to participate in a particular trial, after having been informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to the subject\'s decision to participate.""19 Informed consent is ""documented by means of a written, signed, and dated informed consent form.""20 In obtaining and documenting informed consent, an investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) and should adhere to principles of GCP.21 Prior to the beginning of the trial, the investigator should obtain the IEC\'s written approval of the informed consent form and any additional written information that will be provided to study subjects.22\n\nFootnote 19: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM073122.pdf.\n\nAppendix B Supporting Information (21 CFR 312.120(b))\n\nA sponsor or applicant submitting non-IND foreign data in support of an IND or an application for marketing approval for a drug must include a description of the actions the sponsor or applicant took to ensure that the research conformed to GCP. Because the description is not required to duplicate information already submitted in the IND or the application for marketing approval, the sponsor or applicant may indicate the location of the required information by providing cross-references (and/or hyperlinks) to relevant sections of the IND application, to relevant sections of an application for marketing approval, or to relevant sections of previously submitted materials.\n\nThe location of all information required by 21 CFR 312.120 should be clearly delineated in the submission. FDA recommends that the sponsor or applicant clearly indicate the following:\n\nwhether each clinical study was conducted at both foreign and domestic sites or only foreign sites;\n\nwhether each foreign site was under an IND or was subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120; and\n\nfor each clinical study subject to 21 CFR 312.120, where in the submission or in previously submitted materials the following information can be found: 1. each of the elements required under 21 CFR 312.120(b) (e.g., ""Information showing that the study is adequate and well controlled, 21 CFR 312.120(b)(5) -- See IND Application, Section X.1, pp. y-z""); and 2. any waiver requests as applicable under 21 CFR 312.120(c) (e.g., ""Waiver request for certain requirements applicable to Study [X] -- see IND Application, Section X.6, pp. y-z"").\n\nClearly delineating where the required information can be found will facilitate FDA\'s review of the IND or marketing application by enabling Agency confirmation of the sponsor\'s/applicant\'s compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nWithin an eCTD format of an application (for marketing approval or an IND), FDA recommends that a sponsor or applicant list the studies subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120 in Section 5.2 of Module 5. The listing can be part of an overall tabular listing or be constructed as an accompanying table and appropriately identified as such. A sponsor or applicant might also use a submission\'s cover letter, particularly in the case of an IND, to indicate whether the submission contains studies subject to 21 CFR 312.120. Whether in Module 5 or in a cover letter, the submission should contain page references and/or links to the respective individual full Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) for the identified studies.\n\nWithin a CSR of a study, using an ICH E3 format as an example, FDA recommends that a sponsor or applicant identify on the Title Page that the study is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120. The Title Page should contain a reference and/or alink to a section or an appendix which specifically addresses the sponsor\'s compliance with 21 CFR 312.120. (In ICH E3 format, such an Appendix would be in addition to the kind of Appendices already listed in the ICH E3 Guidance, e.g. 16.5). FDA further recommends identifying specific foreign non-IND clinical sites using Appendix 16.1.4 (""List and Description of Investigators"") in ICH E3 format or a similarly designated section.\n\nThe section or appendix specifically intended to address compliance with 21 CFR 312.120 should include a brief statement describing actions the sponsor has taken and should provide supporting information in accordance with all the required elements as listed in the regulations (see below). FDA anticipates that for each such element the sponsor would provide the necessary information or provide reference and/or links to other sections of the study report which contain the information. FDA strongly advises against duplicating information provided elsewhere in the application.\n\nThe regulation allows for flexibility in how the requirements are to be met. For example, a full CSR prepared in accordance with ICH E3 ""Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports""23 may meet many of the requirements under 21 CFR 312.120, but adherence to ICH E3 is not required. The same holds for ICH E6: a sponsor or applicant may choose but is not required to meet many of the requirements of this rule through adherence to ICH E6. Note, however, that even if studies are submitted according to ICH E3 or E6, in some cases it may be necessary to provide additional information to FDA to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120, as well as other applicable requirements in 21 CFR parts 312, 314, or 601.24\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n--------------------\nContext: Live Organisms\n\nAn IND is required for challenge studies in which a live organism (e.g., virus, bacteria, or fungi, whether modified or wild-type) is administered to subjects to study the pathogenesis of disease or the host response to the organism (see part 312). Although the challenge organism is not intended to have a therapeutic purpose, there is intent to affect the structure or function of the body. Thus, the organism is both a biological product (see 21 CFR 600.3(h)(1)) and a drug, and an IND is required for the clinical investigation, unless the criteria for exemption in 21 CFR 312.2 are met or the product meets the definition of a dietary supplement14 or is an article used for food or drink (i.e., primarily for taste, aroma, or nutritive value, rather than for some other effect on the structure or function of the body) in the study. Similarly, an IND is required for a clinical investigation designed to evaluate whether colonization with a strain of bacteria can treat or prevent disease in patients with a chronic immune disorder.\n\nFootnote 14: Section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act does not specifically mention live organisms in the definition of a dietary supplement (21 U.S.C. 321(ff)), but does include more general language that results in some products containing live organisms falling within the dietary supplement definition, depending on the specific facts related to the product. The relevant language is found in section 201(ff)(1), which lists the substances that may be used as “dietary ingredients” in dietary supplements. Section 201(ff)(1)(E) provides that “dietary substance[s] for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake” are dietary ingredients; section 201(ff)(1)(F) further defines dietary ingredient to include “a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination” of any other dietary ingredient. Taken together, these two provisions indicate that a live organism that is a constituent of an article that is commonly used as human food or drink (e.g., a probiotic in yogurt) may be used as a dietary ingredient in a dietary supplement.\nSection 201(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(i)) defines a cosmetic as ""(1) articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body or any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance, and (2) articles intended for use as a component of any such articles; except that such term shall not include soap."" With the exception of color additives and a few prohibited ingredients, a cosmetic manufacturer may use almost any raw material as a cosmetic ingredient and market the product without an approval from FDA.\n\nAs a general matter, studies of ingredients or products marketed as cosmetics require an IND if the ingredient is being studied for use to affect the structure or function of the body or to prevent, treat, mitigate, cure, or diagnose a disease (see 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1); 21 CFR 312.2). This is true even if the study is intended to support a cosmetic claim about the ingredient or product\'s ability to cleanse, beautify, promote attractiveness, or alter the appearance, rather than a structure/function claim. For example, a study of the effect of a cosmetic product containing human or animal biological material (such as placenta) on skin repair mechanisms would require an IND, even if the study is intended only to support a claim of younger looking skin.\n\nFoods\n\nThose who are evaluating published clinical literature or sponsoring new clinical studies while conducting safety assessments for dietary ingredients, food additives (including food contact substances), and GRAS substances, as well as those who conduct or sponsor research intended to support labeling claims for conventional foods or dietary supplements, should be aware of two provisions of the FD&C Act that, depending on the circumstances, may restrict the marketing of products containing substances that have been the subject of ""substantial clinical investigations"" whose existence has been made public. Section 301(l) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(ll)) prohibits the marketing of any food to which has been added a drug or biologic for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, unless the drug or biologic was marketed in food before any substantial clinical investigations involving the drug or biologic were instituted or one of the other exceptions in section 301(ll) applies. Section 201(ff)(3)(B)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(ii)) excludes from the dietary supplement definition any article authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, unless the article was marketed as a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the IND became effective.15 FDA interprets ""authorized for investigation"" to mean that the article is the subject of an IND that has gone into effect (see 21 CFR 312.40). Marketing the substance of interest ""as a dietary supplement or as a food"" (under section 201(ff)) or ""in food"" (under section 301(ll)) before seeking an IND or beginning any clinical investigations preserves the option to continue to market the substance in those forms after substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and their existence has been made public.\n\nFootnote 15: FDA can create an exception to the exclusion by regulation, but only if the Agency finds that the use of the article in dietary supplements would be lawful. To date, no such regulations have been issued. The appropriate mechanism to request such a regulation is to file a citizen petition under 21 CFR 10.30.\n\n.4.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n.4.2 Dietary Supplements\n\nUnder the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), a dietary supplement is defined, in part, as a product taken by mouth that is intended to supplement the diet and that contains one or more dietary ingredients.16 The dietary ingredients in these products can include vitamins, minerals, herbs and other botanicals, amino acids, other dietary substances intended to supplement the diet, and concentrates, metabolites, constituents, extracts, or combinations of the preceding types of ingredients. Dietary supplements can be found in many forms such as tablets, capsules, softgels, liquids, or powders.\n\nFootnote 16: See section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(ff)).\n\nUnder DSHEA, a dietary supplement is not considered a drug and is not subject to the premarket approval requirements for drugs if the intended use for which it is marketed is only to affect the structure or any function of the body (i.e., not intended to be used for a therapeutic purpose). Similarly, whether an IND is needed for a clinical investigation evaluating a dietary supplement is determined by the intent of the clinical investigation. If the clinical investigation is intended only to evaluate the dietary supplement\'s effect on the structure or function of the body, an IND is not required.\n\nHowever, if the clinical investigation is intended to evaluate the dietary supplement\'s ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease,17 an IND is required under part 312. For example, a clinical investigation designed to study the relationship between a dietary supplement\'s effect on normal structure or function in humans (e.g., guarana and maximal oxygen uptake) or to characterize the mechanism by which a dietary supplement acts to maintain such structure or function (e.g., fiber and bowel regularity) would not need to be conducted under an IND. However, a clinical investigation designed to evaluate a dietary supplement\'s ability to prevent osteoporosis or to treat chronic diarrhea or constipation would need to be conducted under an IND.\n\nFootnote 17: For purposes of the dietary supplement labeling requirements, a “disease’ is damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition” (21 CFR 101.93(g)(1)).\n\n.4.3 Conventional Food\n\nSection 201(f) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(f)) defines a food as ""(1) articles used for food or drink for man or other animals, (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article."" For studies intended to evaluate the effects of a food, the analysis for whether an IND is needed turns on the intent of the clinical investigation.\n\nAs is the case for a dietary supplement, a food is considered to be a drug if it is ""intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease,""18 except that a food may bear an authorized health claim about reducing the risk of a disease without becoming a drug (see section VI.4.3). Therefore, a clinical investigation intended to evaluate the effect of a foodon a disease would require an IND under part 312. For example, a clinical investigation intended to evaluate the effect of a food on the signs and symptoms of Crohn\'s disease would require an IND.\n\nThe following paragraph in brackets [ ] is STAYED.\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n--------------------\nContext: As noted in sections I and II of this guidance, the purpose of this guidance is to recommend a more efficient and flexible model to evaluate multiple versions of an investigational product that would otherwise be evaluated in separate clinical studies. For a single clinical study of different versions of an investigational product where each version is submitted in a separate IND, it may be challenging to determine how to structure and organize the INDs, and how to submit changes or new information as the study progresses. The framework described here is intended to provide clarity on these topics and, as feasible, to minimize submission of the same information to multiple INDs by facilitating cross-referencing to shared information in the INDs. Sponsors may discuss their specific clinical study and planned submission approach with OTAT, CBER prior to submitting an IND (e.g., by requesting an INitial Targeted Engagement for Regulatory Advice on CBER producTs (INTERACT)3 or pre-IND meeting4).\n\nFootnote 3: For additional information about INTERACT meetings, please see https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/industry-biologics/interact-meetings.\n\nFootnote 4: See Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products, Draft Guidance for Industry, December 2017, https://www.fda.gov/media/109951/download. When finalized, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nOverview\n\nFor purposes of the framework outlined in this guidance, we refer to INDs either as ""Primary"" or ""Secondary"". The purpose of this nomenclature is to distinguish which INDs will include clinical information about the umbrella trial (Primary INDs) and which INDs will not include clinical information about the umbrella trial (Secondary INDs). For example, an IND amendment that contains only clinical information about the umbrella trial (e.g., no CMC or P/T information) would only need to be submitted to the Primary IND.\n\nFor a clinical study with two different versions of the investigational product (Product A and Product B), we recommend that the sponsor submit two separate INDs, IND A and IND B. One of the INDs, IND A, will be considered the ""Primary"" IND, and should include CMC and P/T information for Product A. IND B will be considered a ""Secondary"" IND, and will include CMC and P/T information for Product B. Primary IND A should also include complete clinical information for the umbrella\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]\n\nbetween the product versions may be submitted solely to the Primary IND and incorporated into the Secondary IND(s) by cross-reference.\n* In some cases, sponsors may decide to develop additional versions of a product after an IND has already been submitted. If the sponsor wishes to evaluate the original and additional versions of a product together in an umbrella trial, we recommend that sponsors submit an amendment to the existing IND specifying that it is a Primary IND and follow the steps in the section IV.B of this guidance to submit Secondary IND(s) and add arm(s) to the study.\n\nAppendix B Adding Arms to the Study\n\nIf the arm to be added includes a new version of the investigational cellular or gene therapy product, (e.g., Product C), we recommend that the sponsor submit:\n\nIND C with CMC and P/T information for Product C. IND C will be considered a Secondary IND. We recommend that the cover letter for a Secondary IND clearly state that the IND is a Secondary IND and specify the Primary IND number. The Secondary IND should cross-reference the Primary IND for clinical information.\n\nAn amendment to IND A with the updated clinical protocol, which now includes an arm for Product C. We recommend that the cover letter for the amendment to IND A clearly state that the IND is a Primary IND and specify the Secondary IND number(s), including IND C. We recommend that the Primary IND also be updated to include a cross-reference to the Secondary IND for CMC and P/T information related to Product C. It should be noted that the new Secondary IND C cannot go into effect until 30 days after FDA receives the new IND (21 CFR 312.40(b)(1)), unless FDA provides earlier notification that the clinical investigations in the IND may begin (21 CFR 312.40(b)(2)). Administration of Product C cannot begin until IND C goes into effect and IRB approval of the modified protocol has been granted (21 CFR 56.103).\n\nIf the arm to be added does not include a new version of the investigational cellular or gene therapy (e.g., a new arm that will study Product B in combination with a marketed product, or a new arm that will study investigational Products A and B together), then we recommend that the sponsor submit:\n\nAn amendment to the Primary IND with the updated clinical protocol (i.e., with the new arm); and\n\nAny additional P/T information supporting the new arm, if applicable, submitted to the relevant IND(s).\n\nSubmitting Other Types of Changes or New Information\n\nFor revisions to the umbrella trial clinical protocol that do not add a new arm or for other types of new clinical information, the sponsor should submit the revised protocol or new clinical information to the Primary IND. The sponsor does not need to submit any information to the Secondary INDs.\n\nFor new CMC or P/T information (e.g., changes to the CMC information, new P/T study report): if the new information is specific to one product (e.g., Product B), then that information should be submitted to IND B only. If the new information is for multiple products (e.g., Products A and B), then the new information should be submitted to INDs A and B (or submitted to IND A and cross-referenced by IND B, as mentioned previously). For new P/T information, the sponsor should also submit an updated investigator brochure to the Primary IND.\n\nClinical Holds and Responses to Hold\n\nIf only one arm (e.g., arm studying Product B) will be placed on hold, then the Primary IND would be placed on partial hold and the relevant Secondary IND would be placed on hold (or partial hold, if appropriate).\n\nIn the event that FDA issues an order placing the entire study on clinical hold (e.g., due to a safety issue that applies to all product versions), then all Primary and Secondary INDs would be placed on hold (or partial hold, if appropriate). 21 CFR 312.42(a).\n\nTo respond to a clinical hold, the sponsor will need to submit a response to each IND that was placed on hold. However, detailed information responding to each hold comment does not need to be submitted to multiple INDs. For example, if the Primary IND was placed on partial hold due to CMC concerns with a product in a Secondary IND, the sponsor should submit the CMC information responding to the hold comments to the Secondary IND. The response to hold for the Primary IND can refer to the Secondary IND for detailed information.\n\nReporting\n\nIND safety reporting must be performed in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32.7 The sponsor must submit safety reports for an investigational product to all of the sponsor\'s INDs that are relevant to that product. At a minimum, safety reports must be submitted to both the Primary IND and any Secondary IND that contains the CMC and P/T information for that product. In cases where a safety report for one product is relevant to the safety of multiple related products, the safety report must be submitted to all of the relevant INDs (21 CFR 312.32(c)). The report submitted to the\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Studying Multiple Versions of a Cellular or Gene Therapy Product in an Early-Phase Clinical Trial Guidance for Industry']","['A sponsor may submit a single IND application for a development program that is intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act and includes use of a non-U.S.-licensed product. The sponsor should submit information supporting the proposed clinical investigation with the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product under the IND application. This scenario may occur, for example, if a sponsor seeks to use data from a clinical study comparingits proposed biosimilar product to a non-U.S.-licensed product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act, and proposes to conduct a clinical PK study, with PD data, as appropriate, in the United States with all three products (i.e., the proposed biosimilar product, the U.S.-licensed reference product, and the non-U.S.-licensed product) to support establishment of a bridge between all three products and scientific justification for the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity to the U.S.-licensed reference product.\n\nA non-U.S.-licensed comparator product is considered an investigational new drug in the United States, and thus would require an IND application for importation and use in the United States (see 21 CFR 312.110(a)). If a sponsor intends to conduct a clinical investigation in the United States using a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product, the IND requirements in 21 CFR part 312 also would apply to this product (see, e.g., 21 CFR 312.2).\n\nWith respect to chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) information, a sponsor should submit to the IND application as much of the CMC information required by 21 CFR 312.23(a)(7) as is available. However, FDA recognizes that a sponsor may not be able to obtain all of the CMC information required by 21 CFR 312.23(a)(7) for a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product for which it is not the manufacturer. In these circumstances, the sponsor can request in an IND submission that FDA waive the regulatory requirements related to CMC information on the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product (21 CFR 312.10). The waiver request must include at least one of the following:\n\n* An explanation why compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.23(a)(7) is unnecessary or cannot be achieved\n* Information that will satisfy the purpose of the requirement by helping to ensure that the investigational new drug will have the proper identity, strength, quality, and purity\n* Other information justifying a waiver15 Footnote 15: See 21 CFR 312.10(a).\n\nInformation that is relevant to whether the investigational new drug will have the proper identity, strength, quality, and purity may include, for example, information indicating whether the investigational new drug has been licensed by a regulatory authority that has similar scientific and regulatory standards as FDA (e.g., ICH countries). This should include, to the greatest extent possible, summary approval information and current product labeling made public by the foreign regulatory authority. In addition, a sponsor should also provide information on the conditions and containers that will be used to transport the drug product to the U.S. clinical site(s) and information on the relabeling and repackaging operations that will be used to relabel the drug product vials for investigational use. This should include information on how exposure of the product to light and temperature conditions outside of the recommended storage conditions will be prevented. A risk assessment on the impact the relabeling operations may have on drug product stability should also be included.\n\nThe sponsor should consult with the appropriate FDA review division regarding the CMC information necessary to support the proposed clinical study.']",0.249999999975,0.3396226415094339

Although this guidance does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the industry, it does represent the agency’s current thinking on sterilization process validation documentation. For additional copies of this guidance, contact the Division of Communications Management, HFD-210, CDER, FDA, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857 (Phone: 301-594-1012) Send one self-addressed adhesive label to assist the office in processing your request. An electronic version of this guidance is also available via Internet via World Wide Web (WWW) (connect to the FDA Home Page at WWW.FDA.GOV/CDER and go to the ""Regulatory Guidance"" section).\n\nFOR THE SUBMISSION OF\n\nDOCUMENTATION FOR STERILIZATION PROCESS VALIDATION IN APPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN AND VETERINARY DRUG PRODUCTS\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nA. Purpose\n\nThis document is intended to provide guidance for the submission of information and data in support of the efficacy of sterilization processes in drug applications for both human and veterinary drugs. The recommendations in the guidance apply to applications for sterile drug products (new drug applications, new animal drug applications, abbreviated new drug applications, abbreviated antibiotic applications, and abbreviated new animal drug applications). These recommendations also apply to previously approved applications when supplements associated with the sterile processing of approved drugs are submitted. Information and data in support of sterility assurance may also be necessary in investigational new drug and investigational new animal drug applications.\n\nIn the FEDERAL REGISTER of October 11, 1991 (56 FR 51354), the agency published a proposed rule entitled ""Use of Aseptic Processing and Terminal Sterilization in the Preparation of Sterile Pharmaceuticalsfor Human and Veterinary Use."" This guidance is not a substitution for or a supplement to that proposed rule. Regardless of whether the applicant uses terminal sterilization or aseptic processing to manufacture a drug product that is purported to be sterile, certain information about the validation of that process should be submitted for both of those types of sterilization.\n\nAppendix B Documenting Sterilization Process Validation\n\nThe efficacy of a given sterilization process for a specific drug product is evaluated on the basis of a series of protocols and scientific experiments designed to demonstrate that the sterilization process and associated control procedures can reproducibly deliver a sterile product. Data derived from experiments and control procedures allow conclusions to be drawn about the probability of nonsterile product units (sterility assurance level). Based on the scientific validity of the protocols and methods, as well as on the scientific validity of the results and conclusions, the agency concludes that the efficacy of the sterilization process is validated.\n\nWhether a drug product is sterilized by a terminal sterilization process or by an aseptic filling process, the efficacy of the sterilization process may be validated without the manufacture of three production batches.\n\nSterilization process validation data, however, should be generated using procedures and conditions that are fully representative and descriptive of the procedures and conditions proposed for manufacture of the product in the application.\n\nThe Center for Drug Evaluation and Research\'s (CDER\'s) and the Center for Veterinary Medicine\'s (CVM\'s) review of the validation of the sterilization process consists of a scientific evaluation of the studies submitted in the applications. This review is conducted by FDA\'s review staff, and is part of a cooperative effort between the review staff, compliance staff, and field investigators to ensure the overall state of control of the sterile processing of human and veterinary drug products. Information and data in support of sterility assurance may be provided directly to the application or by specific reference to a drug master file (DMF), a veterinary master file (VMF), or another application. Letters of authorization to refer to the referenced files should be included.\n\nAppendix C Remarks\n\nThis guidance is intended to provide recommendations for the types of information applicants should include in human and animal drug applications. Regulatory requirements for the submission of information and data in various applications are specified in the sections listed below:Human Drugs:\n\nInvestigational new drug applications\n\nNew drug applications\n\nAbbreviated new drug and abbreviated\n\nantibiotic drug applications\n\nSupplements to NDA\'s and ANDA\'s\n\nAnimal Drugs:\n\nInvestigational new animal drug applications\n\nNew animal drug applications\n\nSupplements to NADA\'s\n\n21 CFR 312.23(a)(7)\n\n21 CFR 314.50\n\n21 CFR 314.94 and 314.50\n\nSupplements to NADA\'s\n\n21 CFR 314.70\n\nII Information for terminal moist heat sterilization processes\n\nThe following types of information should be submitted in support of sterility assurance for products produced using terminal moist heat sterilization. Although the following outline directly addresses moist heat processes, the same types of information would generally pertain to other terminal sterilization processes (e.g., ethylene oxide or radiation). (See section III of this guidance.) The following information should be submitted for each facility to be used in the manufacture of the proposed drug product:\n\nDescription of the Process and Product\n\nThe Drug Product and Container-Closure System\n\nDescriptions of the drug product and the container-closure system(s) to be sterilized (e.g., size(s), fill volume, or secondary packaging).\n2. The Sterilization Process\n\nA description of the sterilization process used to sterilize the drug product in its final container-closure system, as well as a description of any other sterilization process(es) used to sterilize delivery sets, components, packaging, bulk drug substance or bulk product, and related items. Information and data in support of the efficacy of these processes should also be submitted.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the guidance for submission of documentation in applications for parametric release of human and veterinary drug products terminally sterilized by moist heat processes?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA recognizes that the following standards may be useful for determining sterilization processes and test methods. The database of CDRH recognized standards is available at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm\n\nFootnote 27: Submission and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile (Draft) available at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm109884.htm. When finalized this draft will supersede the FDA 2002 Updated 510(k) Sterility Review Guidance K90-1; http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm072790.pdf.\n\nFootnote 28: Guidance for Industry for the Submission Documentation for Sterilization Process Validation in Applications for Human and Veterinary Drug Products, available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM07217\n\nMoist Heat\n\nPart 1: Requirements for the development, validation, and routine control of a sterilization process for medical devices_\n\nEthylene oxide\n\nPart 1: Requirements for development, validation, and routine control of a sterilization process for medical device_\n\nUSP 27:2004,Sterility, Biocompatibility, Biological Tests and Assays, Bacterial Endotoxin Test (IAL), Pyrogen Test (USP Rabbit Test), or other applicable tests related to the drug/biological product and delivery of the drug/biological product\n\nAAMI/ANSI/ISO 11737-1:2006, Sterilization of medical devices-microbiological methods-Part 1: Determination of the population of microorganisms on product\n\nANSI/AAMI/ISO 11607:2006, Packaging for terminally sterilized medical devices\n\nFor an injector that will be in a co-package or will be pre-filled with a specific drug/biological product, the submission should address the possible effects of the method of sterilization on the package (e.g., effects specific to the drug/biological product concerning, for example, light stability or oxygen sensitivity; effect on stability; effect on performance). For an injector cartridge that will be in direct contact with a drug/biological product, we recommend that you select an appropriate method of sterilization for the product and primary packaging material, and that you justify your choice of method in your submission. For example, if terminal sterilization will adversely affect the drug or biological product, you should justify the selected method for sterility assurance.\n\n2 Cross-Contamination Potential\n\nThe vast majority of injectors are approved or cleared for single patient use. In general, multi-patient use injectors (e.g., reusable needle-free Multi-Use-Nozzle Jet Injectors) raise significant concerns for the risk of blood born pathogen and skin contaminant transmission from patient to patient. For example, there is a potential for disease transmission when blood contamination of the fluid path or the injectable product occurs during a previous injection. Contamination can occur on the skin-contacting surface of the injector or inside the injector from splash-back. It is also possible that the replaceable cap may become contaminated. In addition, in-between use cleaning of any component in or around the fluid path may result in contamination.\n\nSponsors are likely to face challenges in validating methods to evaluate the absence of cross-patient contamination. Initial information on such methodological challenges is available in the transcript of the FDA General Hospital and Personal Use Devices Advisory Panel meeting [29]. FDA strongly encourages sponsors who are considering the development of multi-patient use injectors to meet with FDA to discuss approaches to validate their testing methods and overall development plans. To facilitate discussion, FDA recommends that the sponsor submit a Pre-Submission, which should include, at a minimum, information on the use of the most sensitive test available, a discussion of test method selection, assumptions, limitations, plans to document the accuracy of this method, and a thorough discussion and justification of the test method selection.\n\nAppendix H Labeling\n\nPen, jet, and related injectors are intended for use by health care professionals, caregivers or for self-administration by the patient. We recommend developing labeling that carefully considers the end user and is consistent with the labeling of the drug or biological product for injection. (See section I.A.4 for the type of information that should be available in the approved labeling for the drug/biological product proposed for injection with the injector.) In some circumstances, it may be appropriate to develop a patient package insert or labeling for the patient or caregiver [30]. Additional instructions may be appropriate for in-service training programs to familiarize users with the features of the injector and how to use the injector in a safe and effective manner.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn general, the following describes the appropriate elements that should be included in the labeling of the injector. As appropriate for how the injector and the corresponding drug/biological product are marketed (e.g., co-packaged, prefilled, or separately sold products), the labeling format should be tailored to ensure safe and effective use.31\n\nFootnote 31: The labeling format may vary depending upon the type of marketing application. For example, a general use device under 510(k) should provide sufficient information for a user to determine how to select an approved drug/biological product to inject using the injector. (Generally, see 21 CFR Part 801). For a combination product, the language will be specific for the device and drug/biological product. If the combination product is under NDA/BLA the format should be consistent with the Physician Labeling requirements available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm085169.ht\n\nInjector description, including name\n\nIntended use and indications for use\n\nType-of-use for the injector (e.g., personal, professional, single-use, reusable, labeled and sold for only one patient)\n\nLabeling should include appropriate warnings and precautions for the use conditions and patient population. For example, single-patient reusable injectors should include a warning to inform the user not to share the injector with other patients.\n\nLabeling on the injector itself should provide for space to allow healthcare provider to write the name of the specific patient for whom the injector is specified to avoid medication error.\n\nLabeling should include a prominent statement for ""single patient use only"" to avoid misuse and cross contamination.\n\nIntended patient population\n\nFor general use injectors and those intended for use with a class/ family or a specific product line, sufficient labeling should be provided for the health care provider to determine what drug/biological product(s) is approved for administration by the injection method. As appropriate, this includes but is not limited to the following:32 Footnote 32: In developing final labeling, in addition to the data submitted, FDA considers the information on the approved drug label(s) provided in the submission, see Section I.A.4\n\nLanguage stating the readily identifiable characteristics of the class, family or product line of drug or biological products approved for use with the injector; e.g., characteristics that are in the drug/biological product labeling,\n\nLanguage referring the user to the approved drug/biological labeling to determine if it is specifically approved for use with that type of injector and to obtain relevant dosing information, or\n\nLanguage indicating that the injector is for use in accordance with the approved labeling of the drug/biological product.\n\nList of brand name or list of name, type, and characteristics of drug/biological product that is specifically approved for use with the type of injector, method of injection, the dose range for the\ninjector, number of doses the injector delivers, single patient use or other conditions. 5. Drug/biological product capability (e.g., single-dose-disposable, repeat dose disposable, single patient reusable or refillable, adjustable dose).\n\nContraindications\n\nWarnings, limitations, and precautions, including incomplete dosing, overdosing, dosing site error (e.g., injection into the incorrect tissue), and cross-contamination\n\nSafety and effectiveness data accrued with use of the injector\n\nIdentification of any drug/biological product characteristics that are not compatible with the injector, if known\n\nAreas of the body appropriate for injection, including depictions with diagrams, and appropriate skin preparation prior to injection\n\nTarget tissue and injection sites, including appropriate warnings for intravenous injection of drugs/biological products intended for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection\n\nDirections for use, user instructions, and diagrams. As appropriate, this should include instructions for use of the injector that is consistent with the approved drug labeling instructions\n\nAssembly instructions and diagrams (e.g., how the drug/biological product is contained in the injector and the method for inserting the drug/biological product into the injector)\n\nMaintaining sterility during injector assembly\n\nDose setting and administering an injection\n\nHow to ensure that the full dose is delivered\n\nHow to ensure that a full dose remains in a reusable prefilled injector\n\nPrevention of or remedy for incomplete or partial dosing or overdosing events\n\nThe correct amount of pressure needed for an injection\n\nInformation about injection depth\n\nLabeling recommendations for sharps injury prevention features\n\nEnvironmental conditions of use and storage\n\nReuse, cleaning, servicing\n\nProper safe biomedical sharps waste disposal instructions for the injector, cartridge, and needles\n\nTroubleshooting\n--------------------\nContext title: Technical Considerations for Pen, Jet, and Related Injectors Intended for Use with Drugs and Biological Products Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'

Any barrier or isolation systems should be described.\n\nSterilization and Depyrogenation of Containers, Closures, Equipment, and Components\n\nThe sterilization and depyrogenation processes used for containers, closures, equipment, components, and barrier systems should be described. A description of the validation of these processes should be provided including, where applicable, heat distribution and penetration summaries, biological challenge studies (microbiological indicators and endotoxin) and routine monitoring procedures. Validation information for sterilization processes other than moist heat should also be included. Methods and data (including controls) demonstrating distribution and penetration of the sterilant and microbiological efficacy of each process should be submitted. The section of this guidance concerning terminal sterilization contains information that may be of further assistance.\n\nBulk Drug Solution Components That are Sterilized Separately If the bulk drug solution is aseptically formulated from components that are sterilized separately, information and data concerning the validation of each of these separate sterilization processes should be provided.\n\nSterilization Information in the Batch Records The completed batch record supplied with the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls section of the application should identify the validated processes to be used for sterilization and depyrogenation of any container-closure components. This information may be included in the batch record by reference to the validation protocol or SOP.\n\nProcedures and Specifications for Media Fills\n\nThe procedures and specifications used for media fills, and summaries of results for validation using the same container- closure system and filling process that is to be used for the product should be described. The microbiological testing method(s) used should be described. Any procedural differences between the media fill and the production process should be indicated. A summary of recent media fill results, including failures, should be provided. These data should be obtained using the same filling line(s) that are to be used for the drug product. The following are recommended to be included with the data summary for each media fill run described:\n\nThe filling room Identify the aseptic filling area used and relate this to the floor plan provided in section IV.A.1 of this guidance.\n\nContainer-closure type and size Volume of medium used in each container\n\nType of medium used\n\nNumber of units filled\n\nNumber of units incubated\n\nNumber of units positive\n\nIncubation parameters The incubation time and temperature for each group of units incubated and specifications for any group of units subjected to two (or more) different temperatures should be specified.\n\nDate of each media fill\n\nSimulations The procedures used to simulate any steps of a normal production fill should be described. This might include, for example, slower line speed, personnel shift changes, equipment failure and repair, mock lyophilization and substitution of vial headspace gas.\n\nMicrobiological monitoring The microbiological monitoring data obtained during the media fill runs should be provided (see section IV.F. of this guidance).\n\nProcess parameters The parameters used for production filling and for media fills (e.g., line speed, fill volume, number of containers filled, or duration of fill) should be compared.\n\n1E. Actions Concerning Product When Media Fills Fail The disposition of product made before and after a failed media fill should be described. The description should include details of investigations, reviews, and how decisions are made to reject or release product.\n\n1F. Microbiological Monitoring of the EnvironmentThe microbiological monitoring program used during routine production and media fills should be described. The frequency of monitoring, type of monitoring, sites monitored, alert and action level specifications, and precise descriptions of the actions taken when specifications are exceeded should be included.\n\nMicrobiological Methods The microbiological materials and methods used in the environmental monitoring program should be described. Methods may include sample collection, transport, neutralization of sanitizers, incubation, and calculation of results. The following are sources of microbial contamination and their monitoring that should be addressed, including specifications: a. Airborne microorganisms b. Microorganisms on inanimate surfaces c. Microorganisms on personnel d. Water systems e. Product component bioburden\n\nYeasts, Molds, and Anaerobic Microorganisms A description of periodic or routine monitoring methods used for yeasts, molds, and anaerobes should be provided.\n\nExceeded Limits A description of the actions taken when specifications are exceeded should be provided.\n\nG. Container-Closure and Package Integrity The methods and results demonstrating the integrity of the microbiological barrier of the container-closure system should be summarized. This should include testing for initial validation. The procedures used for the stability protocol also should be described. For initial validation of microbiological integrity of container-closure systems, product sterility testing is not normally considered sufficient. The sensitivity of the experimental method used for container-closure integrity testing should be specified and provided.\n* H.: Sterility Testing Methods and Release Criteria\n\nSterility test methods should be described and should include the protocol for the selection of representative units during production. For a drug product represented to be a drug recognized in an official compendium, when test methods differ significantly from official compendial test methods, a demonstration of the equivalency to the official compendial method should be provided. Testing performed within barrier systems should be discussed, and information concerning validation of the barrier system may be necessary.\n* I.: Bacterial Endotoxins Test and Method\n\nThe bacterial endotoxins test used for the product should be described, if applicable. This description should include qualification of the laboratory, inhibition and enhancement testing and results, determination of noninhibitory concentration and maximum valid dilution. For further information see the agency guidance entitled ""Guidance on Validation of the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Test As An End-Product Endotoxin Test for Human And Animal Parenteral Drugs, Biological Products, and Medical Devices.""\n* J.: Evidence of Formal Written Procedures\n\nEvidence should be provided that there are formal, written procedures describing the above elements and that these procedures are followed. Such evidence may consist of SOP\'s or a listing of SOP\'s or protocols submitted as part of the elements listed above.\n* V.: MAINTENANCE OF MICRROBIOLOGICAL CONTROL AND QUALITY: STABILITY CONSiderations\n\nAppendix A Container-Closure Integrity\n\nThe ability of the container-closure system to maintain the integrity of its microbial barrier, and, hence, the sterility of a drug product throughout its shelf life, should be demonstrated. Reference is made to sections II.E. and IV.G. of this guidance. As previously stated, sterility testing at the initial time point is not considered sufficient to demonstrate the microbial integrity of a container-closure system. Documentation of the sensitivity of the container-closure integrity test should be provided.\n\nPreservative Effectiveness\n\nThe efficacy of preservative systems to control bacteria and fungi inadvertently introduced during drug product use should be demonstrated at the minimum concentration specified for drug product release or at the minimum concentration specified for the end of the expiration dating period, whichever is less. Since the efficacy of preservative systems is judged by their effect on microorganisms, microbial challenge assays should be performed. The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) provides a microbial challenge assay under the title ""Antimicrobial Preservatives-Effectiveness."" For purposes of the stability protocol, the first three production lots should be tested with a microbial challenge assay at the beginning and end of the stability period. Chemical assays to monitor the concentration of preservatives should be performed at all test intervals. For subsequent lots placed on stability, chemical assays may be adequate to demonstrate the presence of specified concentrations of preservatives, and such testing should be carried out according to the approved stability study protocol.\n\nPyrogen or Endotoxin Testing\n\nFor drug products purporting to be pyrogen free, it is recommended that pyrogen or endotoxin tests be carried out at the beginning and end of the stability period as part of the approved stability study protocol.\n\nVI Additional Information\n\nFurther information concerning content and format of drug applications is available in the form of guidances and other publications. The following documents contain information related to the topics discussed in this guidance:\n\n""Guideline for Submitting Documentation for the Stability of Human Drugs and Biologics"" (CDER).\n\n""Guideline on Validation of the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Test as an End-Product Endotoxin Test for Human and Animal Parenteral Drugs, Biological Products, and Medical Devices"" (CDER, CVM, CBER, CDRH).\n\n""Guideline on Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing"" (CDER).\n\n""Drug Stability Guideline"" (CVM).\n\nSubmitted by:\n\nPeter H.

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the guidance for submission of documentation in applications for parametric release of human and veterinary drug products terminally sterilized by moist heat processes?\n--------------------\nContext: [172] Identification of the critical process parameters (process/cycle parameters and appropriate load monitors essential for product release) for the product(s) proposed for parametric release, including the minimum and maximum limits for these critical parameters. The critical process parameters should be within the limits that have been validated and approved for sterility assurance of the subject product(s).\n\n[173] **Acknowledgement that adherence to the critical parameters of the parametric release program will substitute for the performance of a sterility test as the primary release criterion for the product and that sterility test results from the finished product will not be used to overrule any failure to meet the acceptance criteria of the parametric release program. In the event of failure, the specific sterilizer load will be rejected by the quality control unit and will not be released unless there is a provision for reprocessing.\n\nAcknowledgement that regardless of the batch release technique used, any specimen tested according to the reference test method for sterility (e.g., compendium or FDA regulations) will meet the criteria for sterility (such as during testing for stability or postmarketing investigations).\n\nA description of the sterilization load monitor that indicates the following: (1) the type of monitor being proposed, (2) how the load monitor will be used and analyzed, (3) what functions are being measured by the monitor, and (4) the rationale for the location of the monitor. Additionally, for indirect monitors, we recommend that you include a statement justifying the classification of the indirect indicator that you are using as defined by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI 2008). In certain circumstances a Class 3 indicator may be appropriate; however, a Class 5 indicator is recommended for most situations.\n\nDocumentation of the control system to verify exposure of the load to the sterilization process.\n\nRevision of the certificates of analysis or batch release records for each product subject to parametric release to indicate that parametric release is now the method used to provide assurance of the requirement of sterility. We recommend that you provide a reference to show the link between batch release criteria and the commitments in the application.\n\nFilling Requirements\n\nTo request parametric release in an original application submission, the request should include information specific to parametric release along with sterilization validation information and product release criteria. For changes to an approved application, the request for parametric release should be submitted in a prior approval supplement under 21 CFR 314.70, 21 CFR 601.12 or 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2). The change to parametric release requires FDA approval before its implementation. If the applicant has current experience using parametric release with a comparable sterilization cycle at the same manufacturing site, and the proposed product's manufacturing process fits into the same validation protocol for parametric release (e.g., container closure system, load patterns, cycle process parameters, and cycle acceptance criteria), then the applicant should meet the filing requirements with a special report for a human drug product,15 or an annual report for a veterinary drug product16 or a biologic product.17 If your product fits into one of these filing categories, contact the review division for your product to verify submission requirements.\n\n[234] V.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the guidance for submission of documentation in applications for parametric release of human and veterinary drug products terminally sterilized by moist heat processes?\n--------------------\nContext: Verifying that the equipment is suitable for its intended use, i.e., sterilization (e.g., autoclave, hot air oven); performing appropriate calibration of temperature probes used to monitor the sterilization cycle; using suitable and qualified biological indicators; and retaining maintenance and cycle run log records\n\nDemonstrating that the sterilization method for sterile components and disposable equipment (e.g., filters, bags, containers/ stoppers) is suitable and creating documentation that supports the appropriate use and shelf life of sterile components and equipment\n\nEnsuring that release of the final phase 1 investigational drug by the QC unit, or designated individual, includes an acceptable review of manufacturing records that demonstrate aseptic procedures and precautions were followed\n\nEnsuring that final phase 1 investigational drugs are not released until acceptable results of sterility testing are known. We understand that you may have to release a phase 1 investigational drug with a short shelf-life (e.g., radiopharmaceutical, cellular product) based on results from relevant tests (e.g., assessment of sterile filtration by bubble point filter integrity test, cell product -- an in-process test result and a negative gram stain, or other rapid microbial detection test and negative endotoxin test on the final product) while results of the sterility test are pending. When you obtain positive results or other relevant results from sterility testing, we recommend that you perform an investigation todetermine the cause of contamination followed by corrective action, if warranted. You should notify the person responsible for the associated clinical trials so appropriate action can be taken.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n6 Glossary\n\nAcceptance Criteria means numerical limits, ranges, or other suitable measures of test results necessary to determine acceptance of the drug substance, drug products, or materials at stages of their manufacture.\n\nActive Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) (or drug substance) means any substance or mixture of substances intended to be used in the manufacture of a drug (medicinal) product and that, when used in the production of a drug, becomes an active ingredient of the drug product. Such substances are intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease or to affect the structure and function of the body.\n\nBatch means a specific quantity of a drug or other material intended to have uniform character and quality, within specified limits, and is manufactured according to a single manufacturing order during the same cycle of manufacture.\n\nComponent means any ingredient intended for use in the manufacture of a drug product, including those that may not appear in such drug product.\n\nContamination means the undesired introduction of impurities of a chemical or microbiological nature, or of foreign matter, into or onto a raw material, in-process material, or phase 1 investigational drug during manufacturing, sampling, packaging or repackaging, storage, or transport.\n\nCross-Contamination means contamination of a material or phase 1 investigational drug with another material or product.\n\nDrug product means a finished dosage form (e.g., tablet, capsule, solution) that contains an active drug ingredient generally, but not necessarily, in association with inactive ingredients. The term also includes a finished dosage form that does not contain an active ingredient, but is intended to be used as a placebo.\n\nIn-process material means any material fabricated, compounded, blended, or derived by chemical reaction (e.g., intermediate) that is manufactured for, and used in, the preparation of the phase 1 investigational drug.\n\nPhase 1 investigational drug - a new drug or biological drug that is used in phase 1 of a clinical investigation. The term also includes a biological product that is used in vitro for diagnostic purposes.\n\nMultiproduct means more than one approved product, licensed product, IND drug; or separate process.\n\nManufacture (production) means all operations involved in the preparation of a phase 1 investigational drug from receipt of materials through distribution including processing, storage, packaging, labeling, laboratory testing, and QC.\n\nManufacturer means a person who takes responsibility for and is involved in any aspect of the manufacture of a phase 1 investigational drug.\n\nProcedural control means manufacturing methodologies executed in such a manner as to prevent or minimize contamination.\n\nSpecification means a list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and appropriate acceptance criteria or other criteria for the tests. It establishes the set of criteria to which a drug substance or drug product should conform to be considered acceptable for its intended use.

34,"As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?","['--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: Class III devices generally are those for which insufficient information exists to determine that general or special controls are sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Examples of Class III devices include replacement heart valves, silicone gel-filled breast implants, and implanted cerebellar stimulators.\n\n3 What are examples of medical devices?\n\nExamples of medical devices include surgical lasers, wheelchairs, sutures, pacemakers, vascular grafts, intraocular lenses, and orthopedic pins. A longer list of examples of medical devices is in the FDA Information Sheet Guidance, ""Significant Risk vs. Non-Significant Risk Devices.""\n\nMedical devices also include diagnostic products. Examples of diagnostics include in vitro diagnostic reagents and test kits such as pregnancy test kits, and imaging systems such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\n4 What is a premarket notification (510(k)) submission?\n\nA premarket notification, or 510(k), is submitted to FDA before a manufacturer proposes to market a medical device. If FDA agrees the new device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device for which premarket approval is not required, the manufacturer may market it immediately. FDA does not require clinical data in most 510(k)s. However, if clinical data are necessary to demonstrate substantial equivalence, the clinical study must comply with the IDE, IRB, and human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research) regulations. See section 520(g) of the act and 21 CFR Parts 812, 56 and 50.\n\n5 What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n\nA premarket approval (PMA) application is the most stringent type of device marketing application for medical devices. FDA approves a PMA if it determines that the application contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to provide reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s).\n\n6 Where can I find more information about 510(k)s and PMAs?\n\nAdditional information is available about these programs on the Center for Devices and Radiological Health\'s website at: www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/.\n\n7 What is a humanitarian use device (HUD)?\n\nAn HUD is a device that is intended to benefit patients in the treatment and diagnosis of diseases or conditions that affect or is manifested in fewer than 4,000 individuals in the United States per year. The Office of Orphan Products Development (OOPD) determines if a device meets specific requirements, including scientific rationale and population prevalence, for designation as a HUD.\n\n8 What is a humanitarian device exemption (HDE) application?\n\nA Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application is similar to a PMA, but because a HUD is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a PMA, an HDE application is not required to contain the results of scientifically valid clinical investigations demonstrating that the device is effective for its intended purpose. However, the HDE must contain sufficient information for FDA to determine that the probable benefit to health outweighs the risk of injury or illness, taking into account the probable risks and benefits of currently available devices or alternative forms of treatment. Section 520(m)(2)(C). An approved HDE authorizes marketing of an HUD.\n\nUnder the statute, once the HDE is approved, the HDE holder is responsible for ensuring that the approved HUD is only administered at institutions that have an IRB constituted and acting pursuant to 21 CFR 56, including conducting continuing review of the use of the HUD. In addition, an HUD should be administered only if such use has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) located at the facility, or by a similarly constituted IRB that has agreed to oversee such use and to which the local IRB has deferred in a letter to the HDE holder. An HDE holder may wish to ensure that this happens by not shipping the HUD to the facility until it has received confirmation of IRB approval.\n\nNOTE: HUDs should not be used until AFTER the HDE applicant obtains approval of the HDE from FDA and the IRB approves its use. IRBs should ensure that HDE approval has been granted before approving the device for use at their institution.\n\n9 What are the responsibilities of the IRBs regarding HDEs?\n\nInitial review:\n\nInitial IRB approval should be performed at a convened IRB meeting. The IRB does not need to review and approve individual uses of an HUD, but rather the IRB may approve use of the device as it sees fit. That is, the IRB may approve use of the HUD without any further restrictions, under a protocol, or on a case-by-case basis.\n\nContinuing review:\n\nIRBs may approve the use of the device for a period of time, not to exceed one year. 21 CFR 56.109(f). In some higher risk cases, IRBs have approved HUDs for a specific number of patients and have required a summary report before approving the use in additional patients. Continuing review should follow the requirements found at 21 CFR 56, and may be conducted using the expedited review procedures (see 21 CFR 56.110) unless the IRB determines that full board review should be performed. The agency believes that the expedited review procedures are appropriate for continuing review since the initial review would have been performed by the full board and use of the HUD within its approved labeling does not constitute research.\n\n10 Is informed consent required when treating/diagnosing a patient with an HUD?\n\nThe act and the HDE regulations do not require informed consent. Because an HDE provides for marketing approval, use of the HUD does not constitute research or an investigation which would normally require consent from the study subjects. However, there is nothing in the law or regulations that prohibits a state or institution from requiring prospective informed consent, when feasible. In fact, most HDE holders have developed patient labeling that incorporates information that may be used to assist a patient in making an informed decision about the use of the device. For example, the patient labeling may contain a discussion of the potential risks and benefits of the HUD, as well as any procedures associated with the use of the device. The HUD labeling also states that the device is a humanitarian use device for which effectiveness for the labeled indication has not been demonstrated. See 21 CFR 814.104(b)(4)(ii).\n\nUnless it is an emergency, before an HUD is used off-label, the agency recommends that the HDE holder obtain FDA approval of the use following the compassionate use policy for unapproved devices. (See Chapter III Expanded Access to Unapproved Devices of the ""IDE Policies and Procedures Guidance.""2) If FDA approves the compassionate use request, the physician should ensure that the patient protection measures are addressed before the device is used and should devise an appropriate schedule for monitoring the patient. If the situation is life-threatening and there is not time to get FDA approval for the off-label use, FDA recommends that the emergency use procedures outlined in the above referenced guidance be followed.\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance may be found at www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/idepolcy.html\n\nSometimes a physician or HDE holder may develop a research protocol designed to collect safety and effectiveness data to support a PMA for the device. In that case, an IDE is not needed if the research is within the approved labeling; however, IRB approval for the investigational study must be obtained before the research may begin. Informed consent must also be obtained from the subjects participating in the study. If the research is for a new use, the IDE regulation must be followed. 21 CFR Parts 812, 50, and 56.\n\n11 What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n\nIn accordance with section 520(g) and the regulations, clinical studies of medical devices must comply with FDA\'s human subject protection requirements (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research) (21 CFR Part 50), Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements (21 CFR Part 56), Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) requirements (21 CFR Part 812), Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators requirements (21 CFR Part 54) regulations, as well as any other applicable regulations, including pertinent regulations at 21 CFR Part 809 (In Vitro Diagnostic Devices For Human Use).\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThere are three types of studies described in the regulations at 21 CFR Part 812: significant risk (SR) device studies, non-significant risk (NSR) device studies, and exempt studies. A brief description of these types of studies follows. Please refer to the FDA Information Sheet Guidance ""Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies"" for more detailed information about SR and NSR device studies, the importance of the IRB\'s review, the regulatory requirements for these studies, and examples of devices in each category.\n\nA. Significant t Risk Device Studies\n\nA significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.2.1 Premarket Approval Applications (PMA)\n\nPMA approval is required by FDA before devices that are class III25 can be legally marketed.26 PMA approval is based on a determination by FDA that the PMA contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to reasonably assure that the device or device-led combination product is safe and effective for its intended use(s).27 Sponsors should ensure that PMA applications for device-led combination products contain sufficient data to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the combination product as a whole, including data regarding all constituent part(s). The PMA includes sections containing, among other things, technical data, non-clinical laboratory studies, and clinical investigations.28 Before approving or denying a PMA, the appropriate FDA advisory committee29 may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide FDA with the committee's recommendation on whether FDA should approve the submission.30\n\nFootnote 25: Class III devices are devices (1) for which there is insufficient information to determine that general controls and special controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, and (2) which are purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury (see section 513(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act).\n\n2.2.2 De Novo Classification Requests\n\nDevices of a new type that FDA has not previously classified or reclassified based on the criteria in section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act are automatically classified into class III by operation of section 513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, and may be classified into class I or class II under the De Novo classification process.\n\nIf a sponsor believes its product is appropriate for classification into class I31 or class II,32 it may submit a request for De Novo classification.33 If the sponsor demonstrates that the criteria in section 513(a)(1)(A) or (B) of the FD&C Act are met, FDA grants the request for De Novo classification and issues a written order classifying the specific product and product type in class I or class II. If the product is classified as class II, it is granted marketing authorization subject to general controls, as well as identified special controls which provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.34 Such a product may serve as a legally marketed (predicate)35 product for future 510(k) submissions. If the product cannot be classified as class I or II, the De Novo request is declined and the product remains in class III and subject to PMA approval.\n\nFootnote 31: Class I products are subject to a set of regulatory authorities called general controls (see section 513(a)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act). General controls include, but are not limited to, provisions that relate to establishment registration and listing, premarket notification, prohibitions against adulteration and misbranding, records and reports, and good manufacturing practices.\n\nFootnote 32: Class II products are products for which general controls, by themselves, are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the product, and for which there is sufficient information to establish special controls necessary to provide such assurance (see section 513(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act). Special controls are product type-specific and may include promulgation of performance standards, requirements for postmarket surveillance, patient registries, labeling, and performance testing and clinical/non-clinical data.\n\nFootnote 33: See section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 860, subpart D (86 FR 54826, October 5, 2021). See also the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff De Novo Classification Process (Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation)(October 2021).\n\nFootnote 34: Such special controls will generally be established through consultation and alignment with the non-lead center.\n\nFootnote 35: A legally marketed (predicate) device to which a new device may be compared for a determination regarding substantial equivalence is a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, or a device which has been reclassified from class III to class II or I, or a device which has been found to be substantially equivalent through the 510(k) premarket notification process (see 21 CFR 807.92(a)(3)).\n\nFootnote 36: See sections 513(a)(1)(B), 513(f)(1), 513(i), and 515(a)(2) of the FD&C Act; S. REP. NO. 105-43 at 35 (1997).\n\nFootnote 37: See section 513(f)(2)(A)(ii) and (iv) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 38: For example, blood, gene therapies, or human cellular or tissue products.\n\nSpecial controls set forth criteria for class II products that are necessary to provide the assurance of safety and effectiveness to justify classification in class II. To be class II by being within the same type as the product that was the subject of the De Novo, future products must be found substantially equivalent and comply with general controls and applicable special controls for the product type; a failure to comply with special controls will cause the product to be class III and subject to PMA approval.36\n\nFootnote 36: See sections 513(a)(1)(B), 513(f)(1), 513(i), and 515(a)(2) of the FD&C Act; S. REP. NO. 105-43 at 35 (1997).\n\nA sponsor may request De Novo classification without submitting a 510(k) first; FDA may decline to undertake such request if FDA identifies a predicate product that could provide a reasonable basis for review of substantial equivalence, or if FDA determines either that the product submitted is not of low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls to mitigate the risks cannot be developed.37 Among other considerations, understanding of the biological product or drug constituent parts, including limitations of such understanding, need to be considered when determining the suitability of the De Novo pathway for such device-led combination products. Because certain products present unique concerns (such as, for certain biological products,38 considerations associated with infectious disease transmission and challenges associated with ensuring reproducibility of such biological products), management of such concerns should be considered in determining the suitability of the De Novo pathway.\n\nSee annex for illustrative examples on how these principles can be applied.\n\niii.1.3 Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions\n\nThe 510(k) review standard (substantial equivalence of a new product to a predicate product) differs from the PMA and De Novo review standards. The 510(k) review standard is comparative, whereas the PMA and De Novo review standards rely on an independent demonstration of safety and effectiveness. Nonetheless, the principles of safety and effectiveness underlie the substantial equivalence determination in every 510(k) review.\n\nThe standard for a determination of substantial equivalence in a 510(k) review is set out in section 513(i) of the FD&C Act. A product is substantially equivalent to a predicate product if it:\n\nhas the same intended use as the predicate product; and\n\nhas the same technological characteristics as the predicate product;\n\nor\n\nhas the same intended use as the predicate product;\n\nhas different technological characteristics39; and\n\nthe information submitted to FDA, including appropriate clinical or scientific data if deemed necessary, demonstrates that the product:\n\nFootnote 39: Different technological characteristics are defined as “significant change in the materials, design, energy source, or other features” from the predicate. Section 513(i)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 807.100(b)(2)(ii)(A).\n\ndoes not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate product; and\n\ndemonstrates that the product is as safe and effective as the predicate product.40\n\nFootnote 40: See section 513(i)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act; 21 CFR 807.100(b). See also the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications [510(k)].\n\nFDA considers the product's relative safety and effectiveness in the substantial equivalence determination, and safety and effectiveness considerations are also critical to the Agency's evaluation of compliance with any applicable special controls, all of which FDA has determined to be necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the product type.\n\nThe following products cannot be cleared in a 510(k) submission:\n\nProduct with a new intended use as compared to the predicate product\n\nProduct with different technological characteristics than the predicate product if such differences raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate product.41\n\nFootnote 41: Ibid.\n\nGenerally, a device that is not combined with a drug or biological product constituent part could not be successfully used as a predicate for a 510(k) for a device-led combination product. This is because the addition of the drug or biological product constituent part would likely result in a new intended use and/or constitute a different technological characteristic that raises different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate. In addition, a product with a different active ingredient from a predicate would differ significantly in features such as design and materials, which would likely raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as well.42\n\nFootnote 42: In certain instances, it may be possible for special controls to specify multiple specific active ingredients or an active ingredient class, provided general and special controls are sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the product.\n--------------------\nContext title: Principles of Premarket Pathways for Combination Products Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff""

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nAppendix I Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this guidance document is to provide industry and FDA staff with information regarding the premarket approval application (PMA) modular review program and to outline the procedures for submitting or reviewing a modular PMA.\n\nThis guidance supersedes and replaces the documents entitled, ""A Modular Approach to PMA Review,"" dated January 29, 1998, and ""Guidance for the Medical Device Industry on PMA Shell Development and Modular Review,"" issued on November 6, 1998 (hereinafter referred to as the 1998 Guidances).\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nAppendix II Background\n\nIn a traditional PMA, the applicant submits all PMA data, as outlined in 21 CFR 814.20, at the same time, regardless of when testing is completed. FDA begins its review only upon receipt of all the required information In 1998, however, as part of CDRH\'s reengineering effort, FDA issued the above mentioned guidances. In these documents, FDA described a new policy whereby applicants could submit ""Modular PMAs."" The goal of FDA\'s 1998 Guidances was to increase the efficiency of the PMA review process by allowing applicants to submit discrete sections (modules) of the PMA to FDA for review soon after completing the testing and analysis.\n\nFDA intends the modular review approach to provide a mechanism by which applicants may submit preclinical data and manufacturing information for review while still collecting, compiling, and analyzing the clinical data. Therefore, a modular PMA is a compilation of sections or ""modules"" submitted at different times that together become a complete application. Additionally, the modular approach allows the applicant to potentially resolve any deficiencies noted by FDA earlier in the review process than would occur with a traditional PMA application.\n\nOn October 26, 2003, the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUMFA), Pub lic Law 107-250 was enacted. Section 209 of MDUFMA amended the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the act) to codify the modular review approach.1 In recognition that the agency would need to issue updated guidance to reflect the new statutory provision n, FDA requested comments on its modular PMA review program. On February 4, 2003, FDA published a Federal Register notice entitled, ""Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, Establishment of a Public Docket (68 FR 5643)(hereinafter referred to as the MDUFMA Docket). In addition, FDA issued a guidance entitled, ""Assessing User Fees: PMA Supplement Definitions, Modular PMA Fees, BLA and Efficacy Supplement Definitions, Bundling Multiple Devices in a Single Application, and Fees for Combination Products.""2 In the guidance, FDA asked for comments on the various topics discussed in the document, including modular review of PMAs.\n\nFootnote 1: Section 515(c) of the act, as amended by section 209 of MDUFMA.\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance was issued on February 25, 2003 and can be found at www.fda.gov/cdrh/mdufma/guidance/1201.html (hereinafter referred to as the Assessing User Fees guidance.)\n\nSince 1998, FDA has gained considerable experience with modular PMA submissions. Based on FDA\'s experience prior to the enactment of MDUFMA and comments submitted to the MDUFMA Docket, FDA is issuing this guidance to replace the 1998 Guidances. These changes include:\n\nclarifying that modular review should be limited to original PMAs (i.e., modular review is not ordinarily appropriate for PMA supplements)\n\nmodifying the procedures for preparing and submitting a modular PMA\n\nexplaining the significance of timing for submission of the modules\n\nrevising the sample shell and specifying the expected content of the modules\n\nsuggesting limitations to the total number of modules that should be submitted.\n\nThe agency expects these changes to: 1) help clarify which PMAs are appropriate for modular review, 2) simplify submission procedures, and 3) improve the efficiency of FDA\'s review. Additionally, we have added guidance addressing user fee payment procedures for modular PMAs.\n\nThe Least Burdensome Approach\n--------------------\nContext title: Premarket Approval Application Modular Review Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 20221 (MDUFA V), amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) to authorize FDA to collect user fees for the review of certain premarket submissions received on or after October 1, 2022, including premarket approval applications (PMAs). The additional funds obtained from user fees will enable FDA, with the cooperation of industry, to improve the device review process to meet certain performance goals and implement improvements for the medical device review process.\n\nFootnote 1: See Title II of the FDA User Fee Reauthorization Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-180).\n\nPerformance goals were negotiated and agreed to under MDUFA V for PMAs received in FY 2023-2027. These performance goals and process improvements are outlined in the letter from the Secretary of Health and Human Services to Congress2 (MDUFA V Commitment Letter) and are further described below.\n\nFootnote 2: See 168 CONG. REC. S5194-S5203 (daily ed. September 28, 2022) (Food and Drug Administration User Fee Reauthorization). The MDUFA V Commitment Letter is also available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/media/158308/download.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. Scope\n\nThis guidance document describes:\n\nthe different FDA actions that may be taken on premarket approval applications (PMAs);\n\n2027); and\n\nthe different industry actions that may be taken on PMAs.\n\nIII. FDA Actions\n\nThe PMA regulation outlines the various actions FDA may take on an original PMA or PMA supplement during the course of our review.3 For original PMAs, panel-track supplements, and 180-day supplements,4 the following responses are considered FDA actions:\n\nFootnote 3: See 21 CFR Part 814, Subpart C.\n\nFootnote 4: For more detailed information, see FDA’s guidance document, “User Fees and Refunds for Premarket Approval Applications and Device Biologics Licences Applications,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/user-fees-and-refunds-premarket-approval-applications-and-device-biologics-license-applications or the guidance document entitled, “Modifications to Devices Subject to Premarket Approval (PMA) - The PMA Supplement Decision-Making Process,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/modifications-devices-subject-premarket-approval-pma-pma-supplement-decision-making-process.\n\napproval order;\n\napprovable letter;\n\nmajor deficiency letter;\n\nnot approvable letter; and\n\ndenial order.\n\nFor real-time supplements, all of the above responses apply with the exception of a major deficiency letter.\n\nFurthermore, of these FDA actions, all but a major deficiency letter are a ""MDUFA decision"" under FDA\'s commitment letters and are measured against a MDUFA IV/V goal. These FDA actions are described below.\n\nAppendix A Approval Order\n\nFDA will issue an approval order (letter) informing the applicant that the PMA is approved and that the applicant may begin commercial distribution of the device in accordance with any prescribed conditions of approval after we have completed our review and:\n\nnone of the reasons listed in 21 CFR 814.45 for denying approval applies;\n\nthere is reasonable assurance the device is safe and effective (using the criteria provided in 21 CFR 860.7) for its intended use as prescribed in the product labeling; and\n\nthe device manufacturing facilities, methods, and controls were found to be in compliance with the Quality System regulation (21 CFR Part 820).\n\nAn approval order shuts off the review clock, marks the end of FDA review, and is considered a final action.\n\nAppendix B Approvable Letter\n\nFDA will issue an approvable letter informing the applicant that we have completed our review of the application and determined that there needs to be:\n\nresolution of minor deficiencies,5 which are identified in the approvable letter (21CFR 814.44(e)); and/or Footnote 5: Minor deficiencies may include, for example, clarifications of previously submitted information, revisions to the labeling, and revisions/development of a post approval study protocol.\n\ncompletion of an FDA inspection that finds the manufacturing facilities, methods, and controls in compliance with the Quality System (QS) regulation, 21 CFR Part 820, and, if applicable, verifies records pertinent to the PMA as per 21 CFR 814.44(e)(1)(iii). When this is the case, the approvable letter states that the device is ""approvable pending GMP inspection.""\n\nWhen FDA issues an approvable letter pending resolution of minor deficiencies, we stop the review clock and place the application on hold. When FDA receives a complete response to an approvable letter, we will resume the clock with a new FDA response timeframe to reach a final decision. FDA will issue a decision within 60 calendar days of the sponsor\'s response to the approvable letter, as resources permit, but not to the detriment of meeting the quantitative review timelines and statutory obligations.\n\nWhen FDA issues an approvable pending GMP inspection letter, we stop the review clock. Once FDA determines that the device manufacturing facilities, methods, and controls arefound to be in compliance with the Quality System regulation, 21 CFR part 820, we will issue an approval order.\n\nAppendix C Major Deficiency Letter\n\nFDA will issue a major deficiency letter6 informing the applicant that the PMA lacks significant information necessary for FDA to complete our review and requests the applicant to amend the application to provide the necessary information regarding the device (21 CFR 814.37(b)), such as:\n\nFootnote 6: For additional information about deficiencies, see FDA’s guidance document, “Developing and Responding to Deficiencies in Accordance with the Least Burdensome Provisions,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/developing-and-responding-deficiencies-accordance-least-burdensome-provisions.\n\na detailed re-analysis of previously submitted data (e.g., alternative statistical method);\n\nadditional test data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the device (e.g., electromagnetic compatibility, electrical safety, biocompatibility, reliability, software, labeling, animal testing, sensitivity and specificity in a certain population);\n\nscientific rationale for test data critical to determining reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device provided in the submission; or\n\nnew validation data and analyses (e.g., due to device modifications made during the course of the PMA review).\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA and Industry Actions on Premarket Approval Applications (PMAs)- Effect on FDA Review Clock and Goals Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: In requesting additional information with respect to a premarket approval application (PMA), ""the Secretary shall consider the least burdensome appropriate means necessary to demonstrate a reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness.""6 Footnote 5: Section 515(c)(5)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\n""[T]he Secretary shall consider the role of postmarket information in determining the least burdensome means of demonstrating a reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness.""7 Footnote 7: Section 515(c)(5)(C) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe term ""necessary"" in the least burdensome provisions means the ""minimum required information"" that would support a determination of substantial equivalence or a reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness.8 Footnote 8: Sections 513(a)(3)(D)(iii), 513(i)(1)(D)(ii), and 515(c)(5)(B) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe least burdensome provisions do not change the standards for premarket approval or substantial equivalence.9 Footnote 9: Sections 513(a)(3)(D)(iv), 513(i)(1)(D)(iii), and 515(c)(5)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFDA issued least burdensome guidance documents after the enactment of FDAMA. ""Suggested Format for Developing and Responding to Deficiencies in Accordance with the Least Burdensome Provisions of FDAMA"" (""Deficiencies Guidance"") was issued on November 2, 2000. In that guidance document, FDA recommended that its staff use a specific format for requests for additional information needed to make a decision on a medical device marketing submission (often called ""deficiencies"" or ""deficiency letters"") to be in accordance with least burdensome principles. This format was intended to directly connect FDA requests to applicable statutory and regulatory criteria for a decision and optimize the time and effort of both industry and FDA. That guidance document also included a recommended format for industry responses to FDA deficiencies.\n\nWith the enactment of the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017 (Public Law 115-52, SSSS 201-210) (MDUFA IV), FDA committed to updating the Deficiencies Guidance. Developing and Responding to Deficiencies in Accordance with the Least Burdensome Provisions was issued on September 29, 2017.10 The Deficiencies Guidance was updated to recommend that all deficiency letters include a statement regarding the basis for each deficiency and provides details regarding supervisory review, major/minor deficiencies, additional considerations, and prioritization of deficiencies.\n\nFootnote 10: https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM073680.\n\n""The Least Burdensome Provisions of the FDA Modernization Act of 1997: Concept and Principles"" was issued on October 4, 2002 (""2002 Least Burdensome Guidance""). The guidance stated that, while the least burdensome provisions from FDAMA applied to PMA and 510(k) submissions, FDA believed that least burdensome principles should be implemented for all medical device premarket regulatory activities. The document also defined the term ""least burdensome"" and included suggested approaches for industry and FDA staff to use least burdensome principles in PMA and 510(k) review, including focusing on the statutory and regulatory criteria for marketing authorization. The guidance also described general applications of least burdensome approaches to activities such as postmarket controls, and recommendations for how the Agency should communicate requests for additional information to industry.\n\nThis guidance document replaces the 2002 Least Burdensome Guidance. The statutory updates in FDASIA and the Cures Act clarified the original least burdensome provisions and further recognized the role of postmarket activities as they relate to premarket decisions. FDA believes,as a matter of policy, that least burdensome principles should be consistently and widely applied to all medical device regulatory activities in the premarket and postmarket settings to remove or reduce unnecessary burdens so that patients can have earlier and continued access to high quality, safe and effective devices. The Agency is applying tools in our implementation of these principles, such as regular internal training on least burdensome principles.\n\nThis guidance, therefore, reflects FDA\'s belief that least burdensome principles should be applied throughout the medical device total product lifecycle. The least burdensome concept remains the same in that the principles are based on sound science, the intent of the law, the use of alternative approaches, and the efficient use of resources to effectively address regulatory issues. We have provided contemporary examples for both premarket and postmarket settings to demonstrate approaches that FDA and industry can take to ensure that least burdensome principles are implemented for all device-related applications and interactions with FDA.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThe least burdensome concept and this guidance apply to all products that meet the statutory definition of a device,11 including device constituent parts of combination products. The policy in this guidance applies to all activities (including premarket and postmarket actions) pertaining to the regulation of medical devices. The policy in this guidance applies, but is not limited, to:\n\nFootnote 11: Section 201(h) of the FD&C Act.\n\nPremarket submissions, including premarket approval applications (PMAs), premarket notifications (510(k) submissions), De Novo classification requests, humanitarian device exemption (HDE) applications, and investigational device exemption (IDE) applications\n\nClinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Waiver by Applications\n\nAdditional Information and Major Deficiency Letters\n\nQ-Submissions, including Pre-Submissions\n\nInformal or interactive inquiries regarding device development\n\nPanel review and recommendations\n\nPostmarket surveillance, including Medical Device Reports (MDRs) and Post-Approval Studies\n\nReclassifications and 510(k) exemptions\n\nGuidance documents and their application\n\nCompliance-related interactions* Regulation development\n\nIV Guiding Principles\n\nFDA defines least burdensome to be the minimum amount of information necessary to adequately address a relevant regulatory question or issue through the most efficient manner at the right time (e.g., need to know versus nice to know). Our least burdensome definition and principles do not change the applicable statutory and regulatory standards, such as the device approval or clearance standards, nor the applicable requirements, including premarket submission content requirements and the requirement for valid scientific evidence.12\n\nFootnote 12: Sections 513(i) and 515 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR Part 807 Subpart E, Parts 812 and 814, and 860.7(c).\n\nNotwithstanding references to what industry should do, our guiding principles explain FDA\'s commitments for least burdensome device review. FDA intends to, and industry should, apply the following guiding principles when taking a least burdensome approach to a particular question or issue at any point in the total product lifecycle:\n\nFDA intends to request the minimum information necessary to adequately address the regulatory question or issue at hand.\n\nIndustry should submit material, including premarket submissions, to FDA that are least burdensome for FDA to review. * Industry should submit well-organized, clear, and concise information. * Industry should not submit information unrelated to the regulatory decision to FDA. * Industry should reference applicable FDA guidance documents where FDA recommendations were considered.\n\nFDA intends to use the most efficient means to resolve regulatory questions and issues. * FDA intends to use all reasonable measures to streamline processes and policies, as well as render regulatory decisions within appropriate timeframes, such as MDUFA performance goals. * FDA intends to routinely use both formal and informal interactive approaches, whenever possible, to resolve questions and issues. * FDA intends to, and industry should, use reasonable, tailored approaches that have been adapted to individual circumstances and needs to address regulatory questions and issues. * FDA intends to take appropriate consideration of the time and resource implications of its requests.\n\nThe right information should be provided at the right time (e.g., just-in-time data collection) to address the right questions. * FDA intends to, and industry should, consider the use of postmarket data collection to reduce premarket data collection whenever appropriate and feasible.\n\nRegulatory approaches should be designed to fit the technology, taking into account its unique innovation cycles, evidence generation needs, and timely patient access.\n\nFDA intends to leverage data from other countries and decisions by, or on behalf of, other national medical device regulatory authorities to the extent appropriate and feasible.\n\nFDA intends to apply least burdensome principles in international medical device convergence and harmonization efforts. * FDA intends to actively engage in the development, recognition, and use of voluntary consensus standards published by international and other standards development organizations.\n\nProviding excellent customer service is critical to successfully applying least burdensome principles. FDA strives for clear and concise communication of its requests, expectations, processes, policies, and decisions, as well as the rationale behind them. Industry can help us apply least burdensome principles by providing FDA with clear and concise requests, premarket submissions, and responses, along with their rationales. Excellent customer service and open lines of communication between FDA and its customers will help to provide regulatory outcomes that best serve patients.\n\nV Applications of Least Burdensome Principles\n--------------------\nContext title: The Least Burdensome Provisions- Concept and Principles Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'

Additionally, the guidance document entitled ""Acceptance and Filing Reviews for Premarket Approval Applications (PMAs); Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,"" dated January 30, 2018, may provide useful information to manufacturers when preparing PMAs. Available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulation andguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm313368.pdf.\n\n4 Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE)\n\nAn HDE provides a regulatory path for devices that are intended to benefit patients with rare diseases or conditions. To be eligible for an HDE, a device must first be designated as a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD).26 Additional information about the HUD designation process can be found in the draft guidance document entitled ""Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Program; Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,"" dated June 13, 2018,""27 available at https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm389275.pdf.\n\nFDA understands that applicants may have questions prior to submitting a premarket application. We have established a structured process for managing the various types of requests for feedback prior to a premarket submission, referred to as ""Q-Submissions."" FDA has issued guidance that provides an overview of the mechanisms available toapplicants through which they can request feedback from FDA regarding potential or planned medical device IDE applications or other premarket submissions, such as PMA applications, HDE applications, De Novo requests, 510(k)s, and BLAs.28\n\nFootnote 28: See Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff: Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff, dated September 29, 2017, available at:\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm311176.pdf.\n\nIV Combination Products\n\nConsistent with section 503(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, added by the Cures Act, and the Agency\'s approach to simplifying and streamlining the regulatory requirements for combination products in general, single entity combination products are generally reviewed under a single application.29 Devices intended for use with a specific RMAT may, together with the RMAT, be considered to comprise a biologic-led combination product and be evaluated for marketing under a BLA in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), with consulting review by other center(s) as appropriate.30\n\nFootnote 29: Section 503(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353(g)(1)(B)) provides that FDA shall review combination products in a single application, whenever appropriate. Note that under section 503(g)(6) of the FD&C Act, also added by the Cures Act, a sponsor may choose to submit separate applications for the constituent parts of a combination product, unless FDA determines that a single application is necessary.\n\nFootnote 30: See SMG 4101: Inter-Center Consult Request Process, June 2018, available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/StaffManualGuides/UCM283569.pdf.\n\nSome devices that can be used with approved RMATs may be evaluated independently using premarket submissions pathways identified in section III.B of this guidance. Examples may include some devices used in recovery (e.g., surgical tools, syringes, apheresis collection devices), or delivery (e.g., syringe, catheter). When a separate premarket application for a device to be used with an RMAT is appropriate, FDA will apply the least burdensome provisions of the FD&C Act as noted above to determine the ""minimum required information"" necessary for marketing authorization of that device.\n\nIn some instances, the device constituent part of an RMAT that is a combination product may be separately packaged. Separate marketing applications for each product may be appropriate, particularly, for example, if the delivery device may ultimately be labeled for use with multiple RMATs that have similar characteristics and administration requirements. In instances where there are separate applications for the RMAT(s) and device(s), fulfillment of regulatory requirements may be simplified or streamlined to reduce or avoid redundancy. For example, when appropriate and legally permissible, clinical or performance data generated in association with studies of one product may be submitted to support certain aspects of the approval or clearance of other, related product applications. It may also be possible for one regulatory submission to cross-reference existing performance data in another regulatory submission when available and when such reference is permissible. FDA intends to apply the least burdensome concept and principles in the guidance entitled, ""The Least Burdensome Provisions: Concept and Principles; Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,"" datedFootnote 20: https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM085999\n\nFootnote 21: https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidanceDocuments/UCM085999\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFebruary 5, 2019,31 in determining the data and information necessary to support marketing authorization for the device for its intended use. FDA intends to apply these least burdensome concept and principles in the manner described regardless of how the device is presented for review, e.g., under a standalone application for more general use; or a constituent part, reviewed under a separate device application, of an RMAT that is a combination product; or under a single application for a combination product as a whole.\n\nFootnote 31: The draft guidance is available at:\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM085999\n\nV Factors to Consider for when a device may be intended for use with only one particular type of cell-based RMAT or with more than one type of cell-based RMAT\n\nRMAT designation is granted for a specific therapeutic product and specific intended uses.\n\nRMATs may represent a highly diverse group of products with distinct biological and physical characteristics. These characteristics, along with other factors such as target patient population (e.g., adult vs pediatric), intended use and conditions for use must be considered when determining which device, or devices, may be suitable for use with a specified RMAT or type of RMAT. These same factors will influence when a device may be limited to a specific intended use with only one particular cell-based RMAT or type of cell-based RMAT.\n\nRMATs are likely to differ with regard to characteristics that can impact the way they interact with different devices, which may affect the RMAT\'s safety and effectiveness. In the case of cellular products that are RMATs, including cellular products that are constituent parts of combination products, the interaction between cells and a device can have an impact on critical characteristics, such as cell viability, differentiation potential, activation state and ability to respond to stimuli after administration. Further, differences in physical characteristics such as cell size and sensitivity to shearing forces can directly impact the potential utility of a given device with a specific RMAT or type of RMAT. For example, it may not be possible to use a small bore catheter or pen/jet injector to deliver an RMAT that contains a large delicate cell type because the shearing forces may negatively impact cell viability. In contrast, an RMAT that contains a smaller, more robust cell type may require the use of a small bore catheter to facilitate delivery to a specific tissue site, but have special requirements to prevent the cells from adsorbing to the interior catheter surface or to each other, resulting in occlusion of the tip. Such factors along with the demonstrated performance will influence whether the device can obtain marketing authorization for a broader use or should be limited to use with a specific RMAT(s).\n\nBecause cellular products can possess extremely variable sensitivities to physical and chemical stimuli, it may be necessary to repeat testing to assess interactions of each new device-RMAT combination. To leverage compatibility data for a different device-RMAT combination, a detailed and specific scientific rationale for the applicability of this data would be needed. Sufficient compatibility data should be provided to the Agency prior to initiation of clinical trials.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Evaluation of Devices Used with Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapies Guidance for Industry']",['A premarket approval (PMA) application is the most stringent type of device marketing application for medical devices.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) is issuing this guidance to provide establishments that manufacture animal cells, tissues, and cell- and tissue-based products (ACTPs) with recommendations for meeting current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements. All new animal drugs, including ACTPs, must be manufactured in accordance with CGMP to ensure that such drugs meet the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) as to safety, and have the identity, strength, quality, and purity characteristics which they purport to or are represented to possess.1\n\nFootnote 1: See section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B)]\n\nThere are both statutory and regulatory requirements for CGMP. The CGMP statutory requirements are found in section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act. The CGMP regulatory requirements are found in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, parts 210 and 211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211).\n\nFDA recognizes that the manufacture of ACTPs presents unique considerations for complying with regulatory CGMP and that these CGMP regulations do not specifically or fully address all aspects of the manufacture of ACTPs, including early stages of the ACTP manufacturing process. This document is specific to ACTPs to help establishments that manufacture ACTPs meet statutory and applicable regulatory CGMP. New animal drugs not manufactured in conformity with statutory and regulatory CGMP are adulterated under the relevant provisions of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn this guidance, we address the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing ACTPs, including steps in recovery, processing, storage, labeling, packaging, and distribution. The recommendations in this document should be applied to consistently produce quality ACTPs and to ensure that ACTPs are not contaminated and do not become contaminated during manufacturing. Generally, when we refer to CGMP in this document, we are referring either to statutory CGMP including those ACTP-specific recommendations provided in this document for meeting statutory CGMP, or applicable regulatory CGMP, or both.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nPredistribution shipment means the conveyance or shipment of an ACTP within your establishment or between establishments before it has met its product release criteria (i.e., it is not released for distribution).\n\nProcess control means controls put in place to address variability and to ensure product quality. Controls can consist of material analysis and equipment monitoring at significant processing points.\n\nProcessing means any activity performed on an ACTP, other than recovery, donor screening, donor testing, storage, labeling, packaging, or distribution. Processing includes activities such as testing for microorganisms, preparation, sterilization, steps to inactivate or remove adventitious agents, preservation for storage, and removal from storage.\n\nQuarantine of ACTP means the storage or identification of an ACTP, to prevent improper release, in a physically separate area clearly identified for such use or through use of other procedures, such as automated designation.\n\nRecovery means obtaining from a donor (live or deceased) cells or tissues that are intended for use in implantation, transplantation, infusion, transfer, or other means of administration to an animal recipient.\n\nValidation means confirmation by examination and provision of objective evidence that particular requirements can consistently be fulfilled (e.g., a process consistently produces an ACTP that meets its predetermined specifications).\n\nValidated methods means analytical methods confirmed to be suitable for their intended use through parameters such as accuracy, precision, robustness, linearity, range, specificity, limit of quantitation, and limit of detection.\n\nVerification means confirmation by examination and provision of objective evidence that specific requirements have been fulfilled.\n\nYou means the establishment that performs a manufacturing step or the establishment that performs a manufacturing step under contract, agreement, or other arrangement for another establishment.\n\nIII Purpose and SCOPE\n\nThis guidance is intended for any establishment that performs a manufacturing step for production of an ACTP, including autologous, allogeneic, and xenogeneic ACTPs. Preserving cellular function and integrity, ensuring consistency of the process and product, and preventing contamination are critical aspects of manufacturing ACTPs. The safety, effectiveness, and quality of an ACTP are dependent on appropriate control of the manufacturing process.\n\nEstablishments performing any part of a manufacturing process or any establishment utilized under a contract, agreement, or other arrangement for performing any step in the process must comply with applicable statutory and regulatory CGMP.\n\n2.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWe are providing these recommendations to help ensure that establishments are in compliance with statutory and regulatory CGMP. In some cases, regulatory CGMP does not fully or specifically address those aspects of ACTP manufacturing necessary to ensure the safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity of the product. For example, regulatory CGMP does not address critical items that we consider necessary to meet statutory CGMP such as donor eligibility or recovery of ACTPs.\n\nEstablishments performing part of a manufacturing process must comply with CGMP that are appropriate for the manufacturing steps they perform with the ACTP. Prior to entering into any contract, agreement, or other arrangement with another establishment, the ACTP sponsor should ensure that the establishment is following the recommendations for meeting CGMP in this document or is otherwise ensuring that the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of ACTPs complies with CGMP.\n\nCategory A Establishments\n\nEstablishments that manufacture finished ACTPs, other than Type II finished ACTPs,3 are Category A establishments.\n\nFootnote 3: Autologous ACTPs are Type II products if they meet all of the following criteria:\n\na. The ACTP is minimally manipulated;\n\nb. The ACTP is for homologous use;\n\nc. The ACTP is for use in nonfood-producing animals;\n\nd. The manufacture of the ACTP does not involve the combination of the cells with another article, except for water, crystalloids, or a sterilizing, preserving, or storage agent, provided that the addition of water, crystalloids, or the sterilizing, preserving, or storage agent does not raise new safety concerns with respect to the product; and\n\ne. The finished ACTP is not combined with or modified by the addition of any component that is a drug or device.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to help small businesses understand and comply with our reporting regulations for antimicrobial animal drug sales and distribution information. We have prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28).\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. Background\n\nSponsors of approved or conditionally approved applications for new animal drugs containing an antimicrobial active ingredient are required by section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360b), as amended by section 105 of Animal Drug User Fee Amendments of 2008 (ADUFA 105) (Title I of Pub. L. 110-316), to submit to us an annual report on the amount of each such ingredient in the drug that is sold or distributed for use in food-producing animals. We are also required by ADUFA 105 to publish annual summary reports of the data we receive from animal drug sponsors. In accordance with the law, sponsors of the affected antimicrobial new animal drug products began submitting their sales and distribution data to us on an annual basis, and we have published summaries of such data for each calendar year beginning with 2009.\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 11, 2016 (81 FR 29129), we published a final rule entitled ""Antimicrobial Animal Drug Sales and Distribution Reporting"" that amended our existing records and reports regulation in part 514 (21 CFR part 514) to incorporate the sales and distribution data reporting requirements specific to antimicrobial new animal drugs that were added to the FD&C Act by ADUFA 105. The rule also added an additional reporting provision intended to improve our understanding of antimicrobial animal drug sales intended for use in specific food-producing animal species. In accordance with the new rule, the sponsor of each approved or conditionally approved new animal drug product that contains an antimicrobial active ingredient must submit an annual report to us on the amount of each such ingredient in the drug product that is sold or distributed for use in food-producing animals, including information on any distributor-labeled product. The final rule, which is codified at 21 CFR 514.80 and 514.87, became effective July 11, 2016. This Small Entity Compliance Guide is intended to help small businesses understand and comply with our amended reporting regulations.\n\nIII.: Questions and Answers\n\nYou must have submitted complete periodic drug experience reports under 21 CFR 514.80 for such applications for at least 2 full years after the date of the initial approval of the application.\n\nYou must ensure that the beginning of the reporting period for the annual periodic drug experience reports for such applications is January 1. For applications that currently have a reporting period that begins on a date other than January 1, you must request a change in reporting submission date such that the reporting period begins on January 1 and ends on December 31, as described in 21 CFR 514.80(b)(4).\n\nIf you change the reporting submission date, you must also submit a special drug experience report, as described in 21 CFR 514.80(b)(5)(i), that addresses any gaps in distribution data caused by the change in date of submission.\n\nIf you choose not to report under 21 CFR 514.80(b)(4)(i)(A), you must ensure that full sales and distribution data for each product approved under such applications are alternatively reported under 21 CFR 514.87, including products that are labeled for use only in nonfood-producing animals.\n\nDivision of Surveillance (HFV-210)\n\nOffice of Surveillance and Compliance\n\nCenter for Veterinary Medicine\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\n\nMPN IV Bldg., Room 2613\n\n7519 Standish Place\n\nRockville, MD 20855-2773\n\nTelephone: (240) 402-7082\n\nFAX: (240) 276-9993\n\nCVMSurveillance@fda.hhs.gov.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #252 Small Entity Compliance Guide Antimicrobial Animal Drug Sales and Distribution Reporting'

If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn April 25, 2008, FDA published a final rule in the Federal Register, entitled ""Substances Prohibited from Use in Animal Food or Feed"" (73 FR 22719). See also 73 FR 18626; April 24, 2009. This final rule established a new regulation at 21 CFR 589.2001 entitled, ""Cattle Materials Prohibited in Animal Food or Feed to Prevent the Transmission of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy"". 21 CFR 589.2001 prohibits the use of certain cattle materials in the feed of all animals and is aimed primarily at rendering operations. This new rule also amended the previously existing BSE regulation, 21 CFR 589.2000 entitled, ""Animal Proteins Prohibited in Ruminant Feed"", which addresses only the feeding of ruminant animals.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has prepared this Small Entities Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996. (Public Law 104-121). This guidance document represents the agency\'s current thinking on compliance with the regulation 21 CFR 589.2000 ""Animal Proteins Prohibited in Ruminant Feed"", as amended during the recent rule-making process, and how the regulation impacts livestock producers feeding ruminant animals.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word ""should"" in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nWhat Is The Purpose And Scope Of This Regulation, 21 CFR 589.2000?\n\nThis regulation is designed to prevent the establishment and amplification of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), sometimes referred to as ""Mad Cow Disease,"" through animal feed. Theregulation prohibits the use of certain proteins derived from mammalian tissue in feeding ruminant animals. An example is meat and bone meal derived from cattle. However, certain products are exempt from this regulation.\n\nThe following protein products derived from mammals are exempt: (\\circ) Blood and blood products (\\circ) Gelatin (\\circ) Milk products (milk and milk proteins) (\\circ) Pure porcine (pork) or pure equine (horse) protein products (\\circ) Inspected meat products, such as plate waste, which have been cooked and offered for human food and further heat processed for animal feed\n\nThe following nonmammalian protein products are exempt: (\\circ) Poutry (\\circ) Marine (fish) (\\circ) Vegetable\n\nThe following products are also exempt because they are not protein or tissue: (\\circ) Grease (\\circ) Tallow that contains no more than 0.15% insoluble impurities2 Footnote 2: Tallow is defined by 21 CFR 589.2001(b)(5) as the rendered fat of cattle. Tallow that contains more that 0.15% insoluble impurities is considered to be an animal protein prohibited in ruminant feed in 21 CFR 589.2000(a)(1). Such tallow should be labeled with the cautionary statement “Do Not Feed to Cattle or Other Ruminants.” Footnote 3: Excludes tallow that contains more than 0.15% insoluble impurities.\n\nTallow that contains no more than 0.15% insoluble impurities 2 Footnote 2: Tallow is defined by 21 CFR 589.2001(b)(5) as the rendered fat of cattle. Tallow that contains more that 0.15% insoluble impurities is considered to be an animal protein prohibited in ruminant feed in 21 CFR 589.2000(a)(1). Such tallow should be labeled with the cautionary statement “Do Not Feed to Cattle or Other Ruminants.” Footnote 3: Excludes tallow that contains more than 0.15% insoluble impurities.\n\nAmino acids (\\circ) Vegetable oil (\\circ) Dicalcium phosphate\n\nWe refer to the exempted products throughout this guide as ""nonprohibited material."" We refer to all mammalian protein that is not exempted as ""prohibited material.""\n\nProhibited material and/or feeds containing prohibited material cannot be fed to ruminant animals. ""Ruminant animals"" are any animals with a four-chambered stomach including cattle, sheep, goats, buffalo, elk, and deer.\n\nIs My Operation Affected By 21 CFR 589.2000?\n\nThis regulation applies to livestock feeding operations that feed ruminants. The regulation applies to ""establishments and individuals that are responsible for feeding ruminants"" to make it clear that all responsible persons, in both large and small feeding operations, are subject to the regulation.\n\nExamples include dairies, cattle feed lots, calf and lamb raising operations, cattle, sheep, and goat grazing operations.\n\nCONTAINS NON-BINDING RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nIf a feed product intended for ruminants contains animal protein, the protein can consist only of nonprohibited material.\n\nThe Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) has identified the following ingredients listed in its Official Publication as prohibited material:\n\nFeed and feed ingredients not containing animal proteins are not subject to the regulation.\n\nPersons who feed prohibited material to ruminants would be subject to regulatory action under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Regulatory action could include seizure of inventory, injunction against feeding prohibited material to ruminants, or prosecution.\n\nNote: If you mix your own feed for your ruminant animals, you are subject to additional requirements. Consult the ""Small Entities Compliance Guide for Feeders of Raminant Animals with On-Farm Feed Mixing Operations,"" FDA Guidance for Industry 69.\n\nHow Do I Comply With 21 CFR 589.2000?\n\nCONTAINS NON-BINDING RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nDo not feed products labeled with the caution statement ""Do not feed to cattle or other ruminants"" to your ruminant animals4. Footnote 4: If the product label bears the “Do Not Feed to Animals” statement, take steps to ensure that it is not fed to animals. This product should not have been introduced into the animal feed chain because it is prohibited from use in any animal feed by another rule titled “SUBSTANCES PROHIBITED FROM USE IN ANIMAL FOOD OR FEED” and codified in 21 CFR 589.2001. This rule published on April 25, 2008, with an effective date of April 27, 2009.\n\nMaintain copies of all purchase invoices for ALL feeds received that contain animal protein.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe purpose of this document is to provide guidance to animal drug sponsors on specific areas of the approval process where the available scientific literature may be useful to support the approval of a new animal drug application (NADA), an abbreviated new animal drug application (ANADA), or a conditionally approved new animal drug application (CNADA), as well as methodologies to ensure the validity of conclusions drawn by animal drug sponsors from the scientific literature to support an approval.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nDefinitions of key terms may be found in section V.Glossary. The Appendix to this guidance provides example tables for organizing published studies and the data they provide to assist with screening and eligibility for analysis and data extraction.\n\nII Background\n\nThe original GFI #106 was published in 2000. Since its publication, animal drug sponsors have used literature to support various aspects of animal drug development and approval, including early stages of drug development, dosage characterization, microbial food safety, design of the target animal safety evaluation, prediction of potential adverse effects, and substantial evidence of effectiveness.\n\nAnimal drug sponsors have expressed interest in further leveraging information published in the scientific literature to support new animal drug approvals. Use of published scientific literature is of interest because it makes use of existing knowledge and may reduce the number of animals needed for studies to support approval, and in some cases may provide greater inferential value compared to individual studies conducted for the purpose of supporting an approval. Scientific literature may also be used to respond to specific regulatory questions, identify data gaps, and inform protocol design.\n\nHowever, use of scientific literature to support drug approval has its limitations. Although there may be a wealth of published data on a drug or drug class, underlying study protocols and original study data and records generally are not available, making it difficult to determine the quality of studies and confirm aspects of study conduct or design necessary to make a safety or effectiveness determination. Implementation of systematic methods to screen and analyze information across multiple publications may reduce the uncertainty resulting from analyzing limited information in individual studies.\n\n3 Considerations for using published literature\n\nThe Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) considers the quality of journals used in literature reviews when determining the validity of the review. CVM needs high-quality data to have confidence in its regulatory decisions.\n\nChanges in the publishing industry have brought more opportunities to publish research and greater access to such research. Because of the vast number of research journals that publish on topics relevant to many aspects of new animal drug approvals, sponsors should consider the quality and integrity of sources of published literature. For published studies conducted outside the United States, sponsors should consider factors that could affect the generalizability of study results to the U.S. target population and conditions of use.1\n\nFootnote 1: See CVM GFI #265, “Use of Data from Foreign Investigational Studies to Support Effectiveness of New Animal Drugs,” (October 2021).\n\nNew reporting guidelines, such as described by the REFLECT statement,2 CONSORT,3 STROBE,4 and ARRIVE,5 which are designed to improve the reporting of animal research studies, may increase the utility of such literature for regulatory purposes.\n\nFootnote 2: REFLECT stands for Reporting guidElines For randomized controLled trials for livEstoCk and food safeTy. (https://meridian.cvm.iastate.edu/reflect/ - Accessed on March 2, 2023).\n\nFootnote 3: CONSORT stands for Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials (http://www.consort-statement.org/ and as reported in https://www.bmi.com/content/355/bmi.i5239 - Accessed on March 13, 2023).\n\nFootnote 4: STROBE stands for STrengthening the Reporting of OBervational studies in Epidemiology (https://www.strobbe-statement.org/index.php?id=strobbe-home - Accessed on March 2, 2023).\n\nSome journals and scientific publications may be found in or as part of mainstream scientific databases. Certain journals may not scrutinize the studies and data they publish. CVM recommends consultation with subject matter experts to assess journal or publisher practices (e.g., robustness of the editorial or peer-review process and standards). Prior to submitting any published literature to support regulatory decisions, sponsors should confirm they have identified any retractions for literature included in their submission.\n\nSubmission of a Single Published Study as the Only Supporting Documentation for a Safety, Effectiveness, or Product Quality6 Decision\n\nFootnote 6: Section 512(d)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360b(d)(1)).\n\nStudies to support new animal drug approvals are ordinarily conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) (21 CFR part 58) or Good Clinical Practices (GCP) (GFI #85 (VICH7 GL9), ""Good Clinical Practice""8 (May 2001)). Sponsors are required to follow GLP regulations that establish requirements for non-clinical studies including safety and bioequivalence studies. Substantial evidence of effectiveness requirements consists of one or more adequate and well-controlled studies conducted in accordance with an appropriate standard of conduct (21 CFR 514.117). The standard of conduct generally used for effectiveness studies is GCP. Although GCP is a guidance rather than a regulation, studies conducted in accordance with the GCP guidance are more likely to meet requirements for substantial evidence.\n\nWhile publications may describe a drug\'s safety, effectiveness, and chemical or pharmacological characteristics, most published studies are not designed or conducted to specifically address regulatory requirements for new animal drugs. Most studies published in the peer-reviewed literature aim to explore whether a drug or treatment may have an effect, and the discussion is often focused on the generation of hypotheses for further investigation. Studies conducted to support a new animal drug approval are required to demonstrate that the drug is effective, safe, and/or can be manufactured to meet quality standards. Further, guidelines for peer review and editorial decisions are not necessarily designed with regulatory review requirements in mind. An article that summarizes a single study may not contain sufficient details about the study plans, study conduct, quality assurance measures, clinical end-point descriptions, or methods of data analysis. All of these are needed to assess the reliability of the results and their applicability to the target animal population.\n\nGenerally missing from published literature are original study data and records, extensive documentation9 of the study design, the study protocol, details of study conduct, data handling and storage information, and data analysis and interpretation. Where present, these additional details and documentation may allow a single published study to be considered adequate for making population-level inferences and ultimately a regulatory decision.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #106 The Use of Published Literature in Support of New Animal Drug Approvals'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist sponsors of animal drug products in addressing changes in the United States Pharmacopeia (USP)1 requirements for the control of elemental impurities in drug products marketed in the United States.\n\nFootnote 1: http://www.usp.org/\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.\n\nInstead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency\'s guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background and scope\n\nUSP General Chapter (<)231(>), Heavy Metals, was deleted with the implementation of General Chapters (<)232(>), Elemental Impurities - Limits, and (<)233(>), Elemental Impurities - Procedures. While USP (<)232(>) does not apply to animal drug products, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) expects sponsors of animal drug products to continue to apply a risk-based control strategy for elemental impurities and establish appropriate acceptance criteria and test methods for elemental impurities where necessary. Ensuring that elemental impurities in the final drug product are controlled within safe limits remains the responsibility of the sponsor of the animal drug product.\n\nThis document provides recommendations to sponsors regarding the control of elemental impurities in animal drug products, including pending and approved applications for all dosage forms and routes of administration. The information to be maintained on-site and information to be submitted to CVM is also clarified. The submission of information regarding components and composition, as well as manufacturing methods, facilities, and controls is required under 21 CFR 514.1(b)(4) and (5) for new animal drug applications and under section 512(n)(1)(G) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for abbreviated new animal drug applications. The submission of manufacturing changes to an approved application is required under 21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(i).\n\nApproaches other than those set forth in this guidance may be applicable and acceptable.\n\nIII Recommendations\n\nCVM recommends that animal drug product sponsors perform a thorough evaluation of the component materials of the drug product (e.g., drug substance, excipients, and primary packaging), including communication with the suppliers of sourced materials, and an evaluation of the manufacturing process for the drug product to identify risk factors that could potentially lead to significant levels of one or more elemental impurities in the drug product. CVM will only expect test methods and limits for elemental impurities in cases where a specific risk is identified based on the evaluation of the components, including the primary packaging, and the manufacturing process for the product.\n\nThis section includes CVM\'s answers to the following questions regarding control of elemental impurities.\n\nWhat elements should be evaluated?\n\nTypically, the greatest emphasis should be placed on arsenic, lead, mercury, cadmium, and any additional elements used in the excipient, drug substance, and drug product manufacturing process, such as catalysts; however, any elements that could be present at levels that may be of toxicological concern for the target species and, where relevant, the consumer, should be considered. Refer to International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Q3D, ""Elemental Impurities,""2 for details. Footnote 2: https://www.fda.gov/media/135956/download.\n\nIs it necessary to test investigational and approved animal drug products for elemental impurities?\n\nCVM recommends that animal drug product sponsors evaluate the components of the drug product, including the primary packaging, and the drug product manufacturing process to identify any risk factors that could potentially lead to significant levels of one or more elemental impurities in the drug product (see Q3 and Q4 below). Some examples of risk factors for introduction of elemental impurities into the drug product include the use of a catalyst or inorganic reagent in the manufacture of a component or the drug product, and the use of high concentrations of inorganic components, including mined materials, in the drug product formulation. See ICH Q3D for more information on performing risk assessments. In cases where a specific risk factor has been identified based on this assessment, CVM would expect a test method and limit for elemental impurities in either the component or the drug product to ensure that they are adequately controlled (see Appendix I for more information).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nQ3. How should drug product components be evaluated for their potential to introduce elemental impurities into the finished drug products?\n\nA. The considerations may include, but are not limited to:\n\nKnowledge of the source and production process for drug product components (drug substance, excipients, and primary packaging), including information or data from suppliers;\n\nThe concentration of the component (drug substance or excipient) in the drug product formulation;\n\nThe quality of any water used in the production of the component;\n\nPublished data;\n\nTest results generated by the animal drug product sponsor.\n\nThe principles described in ICH Q9, ""Quality Risk Management,""3 and ICH Q3D should be considered. Control approaches should be proportional to the level of risk (see Q5, Q9, Q10, and Appendix I).\n\nFootnote 3: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/q9-quality-risk-management.\n\nQ4. How should the potential for the container closure and manufacturing equipment to leach elemental impurities into the drug product be addressed?\n\nA. CVM considers the risk of elemental impurities from the container closure to be low in most cases. The probability of elemental leaching into solid dosage forms is minimal and does not require further evaluation in the risk assessment. For liquid and semi-solid dosage forms, if the primary container closure components may introduce elemental impurities into the drug product at levels that present a safety concern, adequate controls should be in place. If the supplier certifies that the materials of construction of the primary packaging meet the applicable requirements of the USP and the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the animal drug product sponsor will not be asked to confirm the COA results for extractable metals. If a statement or data are unavailable from the manufacturer of the primary packaging regarding elemental impurities, CVM recommends performing at a minimum a test for heavy metals, such as the procedure previously described in USP <231>, for containers used for liquid and semi-solid dosage forms. The probability of elemental leaching into solid dosage forms is minimal and does not require further evaluation in the risk assessment. If the primary container closure components are expected to introduce elemental impurities into the drug product at levels that present a safety concern, adequate controls should be in place or testing of the drug product may be necessary.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #255 Elemental Impurities in Animal Drug Products Questions and Answers'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations  Does FDA have guidelines for animal bedding?\n--------------------\nContext: This guideline does not apply to prophylactic vaccines. Chemically synthesised oligonucleotides or their analogues, which are not produced using a biotechnology-based manufacturing process, are also outside the scope of this guideline.\n\nThe release of a GT product outside the body via excreta and secrets (faeces, urine, saliva, nasopharyngeal fluids, etc.), or through the skin (pustules, sores, wounds) is termed ""shedding"". Evaluation of the nonclinical shedding profile of a GT product is outside the scope of this guideline. Assessment of genomic integration and germline integration of GT products is also outside the scope of this guideline. Considerations for these aspects of nonclinical data can be found in existing ICH Consideration documents [1, 2].\n\n2 Definition of Nonclinical Bd\n\nBD is the in vivo distribution, persistence, and clearance of a GT product at the site of administration and in target and non-target tissues, including biofluids (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal fluid, vitreous fluid). Nonclinical BD assessment entails the use of analytical methods to detect the GT product and transferred genetic material in collected samples and can include methods to detect the expression product of the transferred genetic material.\n\n3 Timing of Nonclinical Bd Assessment\n\nBD data should be available when evaluating and interpreting the nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology findings. Nonclinical BD data can also inform design aspects of a first-in-human clinical trial (see Section 6). It is important that nonclinical BD assessment be completed prior to initiation of the clinical trial.\n\n4 Design of Nonclinical Bd Studies\n\nGeneral Considerations\n\nNonclinical studies for BD assessment can be conducted as stand-alone BD studies or in conjunction with nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies. Therefore, in this document the term ""BD study"" represents either scenario. Nonclinical BD study should be performed in a biologically relevant animal species or model (see Section 4.3) following administration of a GT product that is representative of the intended clinical product (see Section 4.2 for possible alternate scenarios). It is important that the route of administration (ROA) reflect the intended clinical ROA to the extent possible and that the dose levels studied provide sufficient characterisation of the BD profile (see Section 4.5).\n\nIt is important to verify the data quality, integrity, and reliability of the BD evaluation. In principle, nonclinical BD studies that are not conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) are acceptable. However, when BD evaluation is performed as part of a GLP-compliant toxicology study, it is important that all in-life evaluations and sample collection procedures remain in compliance with GLP. Sample analysis for BD can be conducted in non-GLP manner.\n\nConsiderations specific to ex vivo genetically modified cell products are addressed in Section 5.4.\n\nTest Article\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_S12_Step4_Guideline_2023_0314_WithCorrection_0']","['No, but the GLPs prohibit the use of bedding which can interfere with the objectives of the study.']",0.0,0.0

[Moved to Final from Draft September 2021]\n\nA.I.24.: When an applicant is seeking licensure for an indication for which the reference product has unexpired orphan exclusivity, an applicant should submit data and information to support approval of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product for this indication.18 For example, an applicant may submit data and information intended to provide sufficient scientific justification for extrapolation to support approval of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product for one or more indications, including an indication(s) for which the reference product has unexpired orphan exclusivity. In reviewing such information under section 351(k), FDA will not approve the proposed product for the protected indication(s).19\n\nFootnote 19: See License for Fewer than All Conditions of Use Guidance for information about timing of submissions for supplements seeking licensure for indications protected by unexpired exclusivity. This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nII Provisions Related to Requirement to Submit a Bla for a ""Biological Product""\n\nThis question and its answer have been withdrawn. For information on the definition of ""protein"" in section 351(i)(1) of the PHS Act, see Final Rule on Definition of the Term ""Biological Product"" (85 FR 10057, February 21, 2020) and 21 CFR 600.3(h)(6). [\\ast\\ast\\ast\\ast]\n\nHow is ""product class"" defined for purposes of determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period? [Final April 2015]\n\nFor purposes of section 7002(e)(2) of the ACA, a proposed biological product will be considered to be in the same product class as a protein product previously approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2010, if both products are homologous to the same gene-coded sequence (e.g., the INS gene for insulin and insulin glargine) with allowance for additional novel flanking sequences (including sequences from other genes). Products with discrete changes in gene-coded sequence or discrete changes in post-translational modifications may be in the same product class as the previously approved product even if the result may be a change in product PK.\n\nFor naturally derived protein products that do not have identified sequences linked to specific genes and that were approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2010, a proposed biological product is in the same product class as the naturally derived protein product if both products share a primary biological activity (e.g., the 4-number Enzyme Commission code for enzyme activity).\n\nHowever, for any protein product (whether naturally derived or otherwise), if the difference between the proposed product and the protein product previously approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act alters a biological target or effect, the products are not in the same product class for purposes of section 7002(e)(2) of the ACA.\n\nQ.II.3: What type of marketing application should be submitted for a proposed antibody-drug conjugate? [Final December 2018]\n\nA.II.3. A BLA should be submitted for a proposed monoclonal antibody that is linked to a drug (antibody-drug conjugate). FDA considers an antibody-drug conjugate to be a combination product composed of a biological product constituent part and a drug constituent part (see 21 CFR 3.2(e)(1); 70 FR 49848, 49857-49858 (August 25, 2005)).\n\nCDER is the FDA center assigned to regulate antibody-drug conjugates, irrespective of whether the biological product constituent part or the drug constituent part is determined to have the primary mode of action. For more information, see section 503(g) of the FD&C Act; see also, e.g., Transfer of Therapeutic Biological Products to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (June 30, 2003), available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/JurisdictionalInformation/ucm136265.htm; Intercenter Agreement Between the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (October 31, 1991), available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/JurisdictionalInformation/ucm121179.htm.\n\nTo enhance regulatory clarity and promote consistency, CDER considered several factors to determine the appropriate marketing application type for antibody-drug conjugates, including the relative significance of the safety and effectiveness questions raised by the constituent parts, particularly the highly specific molecular targeting by the antibody to a cell type, cellular compartment, or other marker at the site of action (as distinguished from mere alteration of systemic PK).\n\nIn light of such factors, CDER considers submission of a BLA under section 351 of the PHS Act to provide the more appropriate application type for antibody-drug conjugates.\n\nSponsors seeking to submit a BLA for a proposed antibody-drug conjugate may contact CDER\'s Office of New Drugs at 301-796-0700 for further information.\n\nIII Exclusivity\n\nCan an applicant include in its 351(a) BLA submission a request for reference product exclusivity under section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act? [Final December 2018]\n\nYes. An applicant may include in its BLA submission a request for reference product exclusivity under section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act, and FDA will consider the applicant\'s assertions regarding the eligibility of its proposed product for exclusivity. For more information, see FDA\'s draft guidance for industry Reference Product Exclusivity for Biological Products Filed Under Section 351(a) of the PHS Act.20 The draft guidance describes the types of information that reference product sponsors should provide to facilitate FDA\'s determination of the date of first licensure for their products. Footnote 20: This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nHow can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n\nThe FDA\'s Orphan Drug Product designation database is available to search for orphan drug designations and/or approvals. The database is updated monthly (see https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/index.cfm). FDA will not approve a subsequent application for the same drug for the same indication during the 7-year period of orphan exclusivity, except as otherwise provided in the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 316.\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: A.I.7. An applicant generally may obtain licensure of a proposed biosimilar product for fewer than all conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed. The 351(k) application must include information demonstrating that the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling submitted for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product (see section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act).\n\nFor information about the licensure of a proposed interchangeable product, see FDA's guidance for industry Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference Product.5\n\nFootnote 5: As explained in that guidance, FDA generally expects that applicants seeking to demonstrate interchangeability will submit data and information to support a showing that the proposed interchangeable product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in all of the reference product’s licensed conditions of use.\n\nQ.1.8. Can a sponsor use comparative animal or clinical data with a non-U.S.-licensed product to support a demonstration that the proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n\nA.I.8. A sponsor may use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in certain studies to support a demonstration that the proposed biological product is biosimilar to the U.S.-licensed reference product. However, as a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) study, which may include pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoint(s) intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed.\n\nIf a sponsor seeks to use data from an animal study6 or a clinical study comparing its proposed biosimilar product to a non-U.S.-licensed product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. As a scientific matter, the type of bridging data needed will always include data from analytical studies(e.g., structural and functional data) that directly compare all three products (i.e., the proposed biosimilar product, the U.S.-licensed reference product, and the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product), and is likely to also include bridging clinical PK data or, when appropriate, PD data, for all three products. All three pairwise comparisons should meet the prespecified acceptance criteria for analytical and PK or PD similarity. The acceptability of such an approach will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and should be discussed in advance with the Agency. For certain complex biological products, a modified approach may be needed. A final determination about the adequacy of the scientific justification and bridge will be made during the review of the application.\n\nIssues that a sponsor may need to address to use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in a biosimilar development program include but are not limited to the following:\n\nRelevance of the design of the clinical program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity to the U.S.-licensed reference product for the condition(s) of use and patient population(s) for which licensure is sought\n\nRelationship between the license holder for the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product and BLA holder for the U.S.-licensed reference product\n\nWhether the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product was manufactured in a facility(ies) licensed and inspected by a regulatory authority that has similar scientific and regulatory standards as FDA (e.g., International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) countries)\n\nWhether the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product was licensed by a regulatory authority that has similar scientific and regulatory standards as FDA (e.g., ICH countries) and the duration and extent to which the product has been marketed\n\nScientific bridge between the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product and the U.S.-licensed reference product, including comparative physicochemical characterization, biological assays/functional assays, degradation profiles under stressed conditions, and comparative clinical PK or, when appropriate, PD data, to address the impact of any differences in formulation or primary packaging on product performance\n\nA sponsor should also address any other factors that may affect the relevance of comparative data with the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to an assessment of biosimilarity with the U.S.-licensed reference product.\n\nA sponsor may submit publicly available information regarding the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to justify the extent of comparative data needed to establish a bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. The complexity of the products, particularly with respect to higher order structure, post-translational modifications (e.g., glycosylation), and the degree of heterogeneity associated with the product may affect the considerations for the scientific justification regarding the extent of bridging data. Additional factors that FDA may consider regarding the extent of bridging data include but are not limited to the following:\n\nWhether the formulation, dosage form, and strength of the U.S.-licensed reference product and non-U.S.-licensed comparator products are the same\n\nRoute of administration of the U.S.-licensed reference product and non-U.S.-licensed comparator products\n\nDesign of the physicochemical and biological/functional assessments and the use of multiple orthogonal methods with adequate sensitivity to detect differences among the products\n\nScientific justification for the selection of the non-U.S.-licensed comparator lots used to establish the scientific bridge and how the selected lots relate to the material used in the nonclinical and clinical studies; the scientific bridge should include a sufficient number of lots of non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to adequately capture the variability in product quality attributes, and when possible, the non-U.S.-licensed comparator lots used in the nonclinical or clinical studies should be included in the assessment performed to establish the analytical bridge\n\nSponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program the adequacy of the scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of this scientific justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFor more information about whether a non-U.S.-licensed comparator can be used in studies intended to support the additional criteria required for a determination of interchangeability with the reference product, see FDA's guidance for industry Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference Product.\n\nQ.I.9.: Is a clinical study to assess the potential of the biological product to delay cardiac repolarization (a QT/QTc study) or a drug-drug interaction study generally needed for licensure of a proposed biosimilar product? [Final December 2018]\n\nA.I.9. In general, a 351(k) application for a proposed biosimilar product may rely upon the Agency's previous determination of safety, purity, and potency for the reference product, including any clinical QT/QTc interval prolongation and proarrhythmic potential and drug-drug interactions. If such studies were not required for the reference product, then these data generally would not be needed for licensure of a proposed biosimilar product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. However, if the BLA holder for the reference product has been required to conduct postmarket studies or clinical trials under section 505(o)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to assess or identify a certain risk related to a QT/QTc study or a drug-drug interaction study and those studies have not yet been completed, then FDA may impose similar postmarket requirements on the 351(k) applicant in appropriate circumstances.\n\nQ.1.10: How long and in what manner should sponsors retain reserve samples of the biological products used in comparative clinical PK and/or PD studies intended to support a 351(k) application? [Final December 2018]\n\nA.I.10.: Reserve samples establish the identity of the products tested in the actual study, allow for confirmation of the validity and reliability of the results of the study, and facilitate investigation of further follow-up questions that arise after the studies are completed. FDA recommends that the sponsor of a proposed biosimilar product retain reserve samples for at least 5 years following the date on which the 351(k) application is licensed, or, if such application is not licensed, at least 5 years following the date of completion of a comparative clinical PK and/or PD study of the reference product and the proposed biosimilar product (or other clinical study in which PK or PD samples are collected with the primary objective of assessing PK or PD similarity) that is intended to support a submission under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. Contact FDA for specific advice if an alternative approach is being considered. For a three-way PK similarity study, FDA recommends that samples of both comparator products be retained, in addition to samples of the proposed biosimilar product.\n\nFor most protein therapeutics, FDA recommends that a sponsor retain the following quantities of product and dosage units, which are expected to be sufficient for evaluation by state of the art analytical methods:\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: To support a demonstration of interchangeability, section 351(k)(4)(A) of the PHS Act provides, among other things, that a sponsor must show that the proposed interchangeable product ""is biosimilar to the reference product."" Where a product is first licensed as a biosimilar, that licensure may be referenced to support a showing for this statutory criterion for demonstrating interchangeability.\n\nIn addition, section 351(k)(4)(A) of the PHS Act provides that an application for an interchangeable product must include information sufficient to show that the proposed interchangeable product ""can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient."" FDA expects that sponsors will submit data and information to support a showing that the proposed interchangeable product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in all of the reference product\'s licensed conditions of use.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\non the nature of the proposed interchangeable product, and not all factors will necessarily be relevant to a given scientific justification. The data and information may also include a scientific rationale for extrapolation of data and information to support a demonstration of interchangeability. Extrapolation is further described in section VI.B of this guidance.\n\nGenerally, the data and information to support a showing under the ""can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient"" standard will likely not involve additional clinical studies other than those necessary to support other elements of demonstrating interchangeability, which are described in section VI. We note that although a sponsor may seek licensure for a proposed interchangeable product for fewer than all conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed, we recommend that a sponsor seek licensure for all of the reference product\'s licensed conditions of use when possible.\n\nFurther, for biological products administered more than once to a patient, section 351(k)(4)(B) of the PHS Act provides that another of the criteria for FDA to make a determination of interchangeability is a finding that information in the application is sufficient to show that ""the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch."" FDA expects that applications generally will include data from a switching study or studies12 in one or more appropriate conditions of use. FDA anticipates that data and information acquired from a switching study or studies will be useful in assessing the risk, in terms of safety and diminished efficacy, of alternating or switching between the products. Considerations for the design of a switching study, including study endpoints, study design and analysis, study population, condition(s) of use, and routes of administration to be studied, are discussed in detail in section VI.A of this guidance.\n\nFootnote 12: The term switching study or studies as used throughout this guidance refers to a clinical study or studies used to determine the impact of alternating or switching between the proposed interchangeable product and the reference product.\n\nV Factors impacting the type and amount of data and information needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability\n\nThe data and information needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability, beyond that needed to demonstrate biosimilarity,13 may be dependent on and influenced by multiple factors, which are discussed in this section.\n\nA.: Product-Dependent Factors That May Impact the Data Needed to Support a Demonstration of Interchangeability\n\n1. Product Complexity and the Extent of Comparative and Functional Characterization\n\nThis section provides general, prospective considerations for evaluating the types and extent of data needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability. These considerations may affect the study design and aid in the justification of a development program for a proposed interchangeable product. Consistent with the guidance for industry Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product (April 2015),14 the Agency recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to generating data and information, which may allow the sponsor to address any uncertainty about demonstrating interchangeability that may arise at each stage of product development. At each stage, the sponsor should evaluate the extent to which there is uncertainty about the interchangeability of the proposed product with the reference product and identify a strategy to address that uncertainty.\n\nFootnote 14: We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nSection 351(k)(4)(A)(i) of the PHS Act provides that one of the criteria for FDA to make a determination of interchangeability is a finding that information in the application is sufficient to show that the proposed interchangeable product is biosimilar to the reference product. Such information would include, in part, a showing that the proposed interchangeable product meets the highly similar standard for demonstrating biosimilarity.15 The ""highly similar"" standard applies to both interchangeable and biosimilar products.\n\nFootnote 15: Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act defines biosimilarity, in part, to mean “that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components.”\n\nThe product\'s degree of structural and functional complexity may influence the extent of clinical data needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability. For example, clinical data needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability of a product expected to have a single target (e.g., a receptor) may be more limited than the clinical data that may be needed for a product acting on multiple targets or less-defined biological pathways. In addition, the extent of clinical data needed may be affected by the presence of structural features that specifically impact interchangeability (e.g., features that influence patient response to one product after exposure to another product).\n\nFDA acknowledges that there is a range of comparative analytical data that may be submitted to support licensure under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.16 Data sets that include highly sensitive analytics and/or sequential analytical methods that can identify molecules with different combinations of attributes (e.g., charge variants and glycoforms), as well as a comprehensive assessment of the relationships between attributes, may provide information that reduces theuncertainty about interchangeability. These approaches could be of greater importance for more complex products because these products would have a larger number of attributes and thus a potential for greater uncertainty regarding interchangeability. Advances in analytics may allow for extended analytical characterization that affect the extent of other data and information needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability and may in certain circumstances lead to a more selective and targeted approach to clinical studies intended to support a demonstration of interchangeability.\n\nii.1.2 Product-Specific Immunogenicity Risk\n\nClinical experience with the reference product and comprehensive product risk assessments (e.g., regarding immunogenicity)17 may also affect the data and information needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability. For example, products with a documented history of inducing detrimental immune responses may require more data to support a demonstration of interchangeability than products with an extensive documented history that immunogenicity does not impact clinical outcomes.\n\nFootnote 17: Section VII.D.2 in the guidance for industry Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product (April 2015) provides a discussion on clinical immunogenicity assessment.\n\nii.1.3 Totality of Factors to Consider in Assessing the Data and Information Needed to Support a Demonstration of Interchangeability\n\nThe factors discussed in sections V.A.1 and V.A.2 of this guidance need to be considered together to inform the data and information needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability in a particular context. Consider the following illustrative examples:\n\nProduct A and its associated reference product have relatively low structural complexity and the reference product has no history of inducing severe immune responses related to immunogenicity. Product A also has a low incidence of serious adverse events related to immunogenicity, similar in nature and frequency to those observed with the reference product, as demonstrated in clinical studies conducted as part of the development program for Product A. Here, sufficiently extensive comparative analytical data supporting a demonstration that the proposed interchangeable product (Product A) is highly similar to the reference product, in addition to data derived from an appropriately designed dedicated switching or integrated study (see section VI.A), may be sufficient to support a demonstration of interchangeability.\n--------------------\nContext title: Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference Product Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: An application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that ""the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product"" based upon data derived from:11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(3) of the PHS Act.\n\nAnalytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;\n\nAnimal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and\n\nA clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.\n\nThe Agency has the discretion to determine that an element described above is unnecessary in a 351(k) application.12 FDA advises sponsors intending to develop biosimilar products to meet with FDA to present their product development plans and establish a schedule of milestones that will serve as landmarks for future discussions with the Agency. FDA anticipates that early discussions with FDA about product development plans and about approaches to providing adequate scientific justifications will facilitate biosimilar development.13\n\nFootnote 12: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See the draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants for a detailed discussion. When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\n4 Complexities of Protein Products\n\nA sponsor should consider the complexities of protein products and related scientific issues when designing a development program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.\n\nNature of Protein Products and Related Scientific Considerations\n\nUnlike small molecule drugs, whose structure can usually be completely defined and entirely reproduced, proteins are typically more complex and are unlikely to be shown to be structurally identical to a reference product. Many potential differences in protein structure can arise. Because even minor structural differences (including certain changes in glycosylation patterns) can significantly affect a protein\'s safety and/or effectiveness, it is important to evaluate these differences.\n\nIn general, proteins can differ in at least three ways: (1) primary amino acid sequence; (2) modification to amino acids, such as sugar moieties (glycosylation) or other side chains; and (3) higher order structure (protein folding and protein-protein interactions). Modifications to amino acids may lead to heterogeneity and can be difficult to control. Protein modifications and higher order structure can be affected by formulation and environmental conditions, including light, temperature, moisture, packaging materials, container closure systems, and delivery device materials. Additionally, process- as well as product-related impurities may increase the likelihood and/or the severity of an immune response to a protein product, and certain excipients may limit the ability to characterize the protein product.\n\nAdvances in analytical sciences enable some protein products to be extensively characterized with respect to their physicochemical and biological properties, such as higher order structures and functional characteristics. These analytical methodologies have increasingly improved the ability to identify and characterize not only the drug substance of a protein product but also excipients and product- and process-related impurities.\n\nDespite such significant improvements in analytical techniques, however, current analytical methodology may not be able to detect all relevant structural and functional differences between two protein products. In addition, there may be incomplete understanding of the relationship between a product\'s structural attributes and its clinical performance. Thus, as set forth in the PHS Act, data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies are required to demonstrate biosimilarity unless FDA determines an element unnecessary.14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nManufacturing Process Considerations\n\nDifferent manufacturing processes may alter a protein product in a way that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the product. For example, differences in biological systems used to manufacture a protein product may cause different posttranslational modifications, which in turn may affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the product. Thus, when the manufacturing process for a marketed protein product is changed, the application holder must assess the effects of the change and demonstrate--through appropriate analytical testing, functional assays, and/or in some cases animal and/or clinical studies--that the change does not have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they relate to the safety oreffectiveness of the product.15 The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process (ICH Q5E) describes scientific principles in the comparability assessment for manufacturing changes.\n\nFootnote 15: See 21 CFR 601.12 and 21 CFR 314.70 for regulatory requirements for changes (including manufacturing changes) made to a licensed biologics license application (BLA) and an approved NDA, respectively.\n\nDemonstrating that a proposed product is biosimilar to a reference product typically will be more complex than assessing the comparability of a product before and after manufacturing changes made by the same manufacturer. This is because a manufacturer that modifies its own manufacturing process has extensive knowledge and information about the product and the existing process, including established controls and acceptance parameters. By contrast, the manufacturer of a proposed product is likely to have a different manufacturing process (e.g., different cell line, raw materials, equipment, processes, process controls, and acceptance criteria) from that of the reference product and no direct knowledge of the manufacturing process for the reference product. Therefore, even though some of the scientific principles described in ICH Q5E may also apply in the demonstration of biosimilarity, in general, FDA anticipates that more data and information will be needed to establish biosimilarity than would be needed to establish that a manufacturer\'s post-manufacturing change product is comparable to the pre-manufacturing change product.\n\nV U.S.-LICENSED Reference Product and Other Comparators\n\nTo obtain licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act, a sponsor must demonstrate that the proposed product is biosimilar to a single reference product that previously has been licensed by FDA.16 In general, a sponsor needs to provide information to demonstrate biosimilarity based on data directly comparing the proposed product with the reference product. As a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical PK study and, if appropriate, at least one PD study, intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity for purposes of section 351(k) of the PHS Act must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed. However, a sponsor may seek to use data derived from animal or clinical studies comparing a proposed product with a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act. In such a case, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.17 Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program their plans to provide an adequate scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of such justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFootnote 16: Sections 7002(a)(2) and (b)(3) of the Affordable Care Act, adding sections 351(k), 351(i)(2), and 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act.\n\nVI Approaches to developing and assessing evidence to demonstrate biosimilarity\n\nFDA recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to develop the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity. FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence provided by a sponsor when the Agency evaluates the sponsor\'s demonstration of biosimilarity, consistent with a longstanding Agency approach to evaluating scientific evidence.18\n\nFootnote 18: See footnote 4.\n\nUsing a Stepwise Approach to Demonstrate Biosimilarity\n--------------------\nContext title: Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsors may request advice from FDA regarding proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product development programs that identify a biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as the intended reference product. A sponsor will be able to submit a 351(k) BLA that references the biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as its reference product after the NDA for the biological product is deemed to be a 351(a) BLA.\n\nQ19. Can an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a ""deemed"" 351(a) BLA seek a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act to another biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act?\n\nAny person (including an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a ""deemed"" 351(a) BLA) may seek to establish the biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product to another biological product licensed or deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. FDA intends to work with applicants to address scientific or regulatory issues that may arise in the context of these 351(k) development programs, and to provide additional procedural information. Any sponsor or applicant may contact the relevant review division within the Office of New Drugs in FDA\'s CDER to request advice on a 351(k) development program.\n\nD. Transition of Biological Products from the Orange Book to the Purple Book\n\nQ20. Will any therapeutic equivalence evaluations for biological products previously listed in the Orange Book be reflected in the Purple Book?\n\nNo, the Purple Book does not include therapeutic equivalence evaluations as reflected in the Orange Book. The Purple Book identifies, among other things, whether a biological product licensed under section 351(k) of the PHS Act has been determined by FDA to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product.\n\nE. Designation of Proper Name\n\nQ21. What will be the proper name for a biological product that has be en approved in an NDA that is deemed to be a BLA?\n\nThe (proper\\,name) is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)). FDA does not intend to apply the nonproprietary naming convention (in which the proper name is composed of a core name and a four-letter distinguishing suffix) to biological products that are the subject of an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act that is deemed to be a license under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. This is consistent with what was previously communicated in FDA\'s draft guidance for industry (Nonproprietary\\,Naming) of Biological Products: Update_ (March 2019).20\n\nIV Compliance Policy for Requirements Related to Labeling\n\nTo minimize possible disruption to the distribution of biological products that are the subject of the transition provision and to minimize burden on holders of deemed BLAs, FDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA with labeling that does not conform to certain labeling requirements for BLAs until March 23, 2025, provided that all other applicable labeling requirements are met. The compliance policy set forth in this guidance would apply only as described below.\n\nFDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA and that are introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce between March 23, 2020, and March 22, 2025, where the package is not marked with:\n\nThe proper name of the biological product contained in the package (provided that the current packaging is plainly marked with the established name of the biological product);\n\nThe name and address of the manufacturer of the biological product (provided that the current packaging is plainly marked with the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor as required in 21 CFR 201.1);\n\nThe applicable license number; or\n\nOther information required by 21 CFR 610.60 through 610.64, for which there is not a corresponding requirement under 21 CFR 201.1.\n\nFDA also generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA and that are introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce between March 23, 2020, and March 22, 2025, where the content and format of labeling required by 21 CFR 201.56, 201.57, 201.80, and/or 208.20, as applicable, does not include the following information:\n\nThe proper name of the biological product, including any appropriate descriptors (provided that the current labeling uses the established name of the biological product);\n\nThe name and address of the manufacturer of the biological product (provided that the current labeling includes the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor as required by 21 CFR 201.1);\n\nThe applicable license number; or\n\nFor biological products with approved labeling in the format described by 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57 (PLR format), the year of Initial U.S. Approval of the new biological product (provided that the current labeling includes the year of Initial U.S. Approval of the new molecular entity).\n\nFDA notes that the timing of BLA-specific revisions to the prescribing information should be coordinated with the corresponding revisions to the container labels, carton labeling, and any FDA-approved patient labeling for the biological product to ensure consistency among the different types of product labeling.\n\nIf the holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product has an administratively converted supplement that includes proposed revisions to product labeling or submits a supplement that includes proposed revisions to product labeling before March 22, 2025 (i.e., the end of the compliance period), and the required BLA-specific labeling revisions to container labels, carton labeling, and prescribing information referenced in this guidance have not already been addressed, such revisions would need to be addressed before the supplement could be approved (see, e.g., 21 CFR 610.60). A changes-being-effected (CBE-0) supplement may be submitted prior to submission of a prior approval supplement that includes the BLA-specific labeling revisions. However, the prior approval supplement would need to be approved before or concurrent with approval of the CBE-0 supplement. Under this approach, holders of deemed BLAs may coordinate BLA-specific labeling updates with their plans for other proposed revisions to product labeling.\n\nAfter FDA approval of a supplement for the BLA-specific labeling revisions, FDA understands that application holders may need to wait to implement these labeling revisions until their next printing of the labels and labeling. Accordingly, to enable such application holders to exhaust existing inventory, FDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA where FDA has already approved a supplement that includes the BLA-specific labeling revisions but the labels and labeling do not include the BLA-specific labeling revisions prior to March 22, 2025.\n--------------------\nContext title: The “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: The BPCI Act also includes, among other provisions:\n\nA 12-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which approval of a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be made effective (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nA 4-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be submitted (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nAn exclusivity period for the first biological product determined to be interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use, during which a second or subsequent biological product may not be determined interchangeable with that reference product (see section 351(k)(6) of the PHS Act)\n\nProcedures for identifying and resolving patent disputes involving applications submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act (see section 351(l) of the PHS Act)\n\nTransition Period for Certain Biological Products\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act provides that a marketing application for a ""biological product"" (that previously would have been submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act) must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, subject to the following exception during the transition period described below:\n\nAn application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2020, if the biological product is in a product class4 for which a biological product in such product class was approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2010. Footnote 4: FDA has interpreted the statutory term “product class” for purposes of determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period (see guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act, at Q&A II.2).\n\nHowever, an application for a biological product may not be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act if there is another biological product approved under section 351(a) of the PHS Act that could be a ""reference product""5 if such application were submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 5: The term “reference product” means the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in an application submitted under section 351(k) (see section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act (a ""deemed Biologics License Application (BLA)"") on March 23, 2020.\n\nIII Interpretation of the ""deemed to be a license"" provision\n\nFDA\'s Interpretation of Section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act is directed primarily to the submission of an application for a biological product during the transition period ending on March 23, 2020.6 Though the transition scheme described in section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act culminates with the ""deemed to be a license"" provision in section 7002(e)(4), the statute is silent regarding the process foraccomplishing the transition of approved new drug applications (NDAs) to deemed BLAs, or the implications of the deeming process on pending applications.7\n\nFootnote 7: In other legislation, Congress has described the implications of transitioning applications for drug products from one statutory scheme to another, while also describing the process that would be used in effecting the transition. See, e.g., section 107(c) of the Drug Amendments of 1962 (Pub. L. 87-781) (providing that all NDAs effective on the day immediately preceding the date of enactment of the Drug Amendments of 1962 shall be deemed approved as of the enactment date, and that the provision for withdrawal of approval of an application for lack of effectiveness generally would not apply to such deemed NDAs for a period of 2 years after the enactment date); section 125 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) (Pub. L. 105-115) (repealing section 507 of the FD&C Act and providing that an application for an antibiotic drug approved under section 507 of the FD&C Act on the day before enactment of FDAMA shall, on and after the date of enactment, be considered to be an NDA submitted and filed under section 505(b) and approved under section 505(c) or an ANDA filed and approved under 505(j)).\n\n2.1.1 FDA Interprets section 7002(e)(4) to be Limited to Approved Applications\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act provides:\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under such section 351 [of the PHS Act] on the date that is 10 years after the date of enactment of [the BPCI Act].\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) is explicitly limited to an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act. Moreover, while this provision explicitly provides that an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date, the statute does not provide a means for deeming an approved NDA to be an approved BLA prior to, or after, the transition date.8 Finally, section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act does not provide a basis for the Agency to treat approved NDAs for biological products as both NDAs and BLAs after such applications are deemed to be BLAs. Therefore, FDA interprets section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act to plainly mean that, on March 23, 2020, only approved NDAs will be deemed to be BLAs. After March 23, 2020, the Agency will not approve any application submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act for a biological product subject to the transition provision that is pending or tentatively approved.9({}^{,})10 As a corollary, applications for biological products approvedunder section 505 of the FD&C Act will no longer exist as NDAs and will be replaced by approved BLAs under section 351 of the PHS Act.11\n\nFootnote 11: See FDA’s draft guidance for industry The “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the BPCI Act: Questions and Answers (Transition Q&A Draft Guidance) for additional information, including whether an approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act will be deemed a license for the biological product under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act and administrative issues associated with the transition (including BLA numbers and user fee questions). When final, that guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nAccordingly, an original 505(b)(2) application (including a resubmission) for a biological product that relies, at least in part, on FDA\'s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug that is a biological product will receive a complete response if the application is pending at the end of the day (11:59 pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) on Friday, March 20, 2020, because the NDA for the listed drug relied upon will no longer exist at midnight on Monday, March 23, 2020.\n\nFDA intends to assist applicants who may be affected by section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act, where feasible and appropriate. For example, during the review of a BLA submitted after the transition date under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act for a proposed biological product that was previously submitted, but not approved, in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act, FDA intends to consider any previously conducted scientific review by the Agency of such previous application under the FD&C Act, to the extent that such review is relevant to, and consistent with, applicable requirements of section 351 of the PHS Act.\n\nAn application generally includes all amendments and supplements to the application.13 We recognize that there may be one or more supplements submitted to an approved NDA for a biological product before March 23, 2020, that is pending on March 23, 2020. Such supplements may include a prior approval supplement (e.g., an efficacy supplement,14 a labeling supplement,\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry']","[""The FDA's Orphan Drug Product designation database is available to search for orphan drug designations and/or approvals.

Column headings (e.g., ""Amount Per Serving"" and ""% Daily Value"") and footnotes (e.g., ""Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet"") must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Because many dietary supplement products may contribute a negligible amount of calories, we do not require information about calories to be displayed in a larger type size or highlighted on Supplement Facts labels (81 FR 33742 at 33939).\n\nFor small packages which have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, all information within the nutrition label must be in type size no smaller than 4.5 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(i)).\n\nIntermediate-sized packages, which have from 12 to 40 square inches of surface area available to bear labeling, have different type size requirements. All information within the nutrition label must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)). However, type size no smaller than 4.5 point may be used on packages that have less than 20 square inches available for labeling and more than eight dietary ingredients to be listed (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)). Similarly, type size no smaller than 4.5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches available for labeling and more than 16 dietary ingredients to be listed (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)).\n\nThe footnote stating that the ""Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet"" is required if the percent DV is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, protein, or added sugars (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D)). On labels of products represented or purported to be for use by children 1 through 3 years of age, the footnote statement must read: ""Percent Daily Values are based on a 1,000 calorie diet"" if the % Daily Value is declared for total fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, protein, or added sugars (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D)).\n\nIf there is inadequate space to list the required information vertically, the list may be split. The list to the right must be set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the dietary ingredients and percent DV information given to the left (21 CFR 101.36(e)(12)). The column headings are also repeated (21 CFR 101.36(e)(12)). Figure 17 reflects this label formatting.\n\nIX When Must I Comply with the Rule?\n\nIf you have $10 million or more in annual food sales, your compliance date is January 1, 2020. If you have less than $10 million in annual food sales, your compliance date is January 1, 2021.\n\nIf you manufacture single-ingredient packages and/or containers of pure honey, pure maple syrup, or other pure sugars and syrups, as well as the cranberry products discussed in the Final Guidance (Ref. 1), we intend to exercise enforcement discretion until July 1, 2021, for compliance with the labeling changes outlined in the Nutrition Facts label rule and the Serving Size rule.\n\nIf you manufacture certain dried cranberry products with added flavorings (Ref. 11), we intend to exercise enforcement discretion until July 1, 2020, for compliance with the labeling changes outlined in the Nutrition Facts label final rule and the Serving Size final rule.\n\nX Why Must I Comply with the Rule?\n\nFailure to comply with the final rule will render the covered food misbranded under section 403(q) of the FD&C Act and potentially other sections as well. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is misbranded constitutes a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act. Among potential consequences, committing a prohibited act can result in injunction and/or seizure (see sections 302 and 304 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 332 and 334)).\n\nFigure 17: Supplement Facts Label – Split List (101.36(e)(12))\n\nXI References\n\nThe following references are on display at the Dockets Management Staff ((HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852) and are available for viewing by interested persons between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday; they are also available electronically at https://www.regulations.gov.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What are intermediate-sized packages?\n--------------------\nContext: The ""Supplement Facts"" nutrition information (referred to as a panel) must be enclosed in a box by using hairlines. The title, ""Supplement Facts,"" must be larger than all other print in the panel and, unless impractical, must be set full width of the panel. The title and all headings must be bolded to distinguish them from other information.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n36. How must I present the information in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n\nYou must present all information using the following:\n\na. A single easy-to-read type style;\n\nb. All black or one color type, printed on a white or neutral contrasting background, whenever practical;3. Upper- and lowercase letters, except that you may use all uppercase lettering on small packages (i.e., packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches); d. At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text); and e. Letters that do not touch.\n37. What are the type size requirements for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n\nExcept as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must set information other than the title, headings, and footnotes in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. You also must use a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label for the title ""Supplement Facts."" You may set the column headings and footnotes in type no smaller than 6 point type. See the section on ""Special Labeling Provisions"" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nMust I use hairlines in the Supplement Facts panel?\n\nExcept for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must use a hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text to separate each dietary ingredient from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it. FDA has provided an exception for certain packages with space constraints. See the section on ""Special Labeling Provisions"" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nHow closely must I follow the ""Examples of graphic enhancements used by the FDA"" in appendix B to Part 101?\n\nYou are not required to follow Appendix B to Part 101. Appendix B and its specifications are a model, which FDA has suggested in the interest of uniformity of presentation. For example, 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(i) requires the use of an ""easy-to-read"" type style, not specifically Helvetica type, as suggested in Appendix B.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)(9)\n\nHow do I provide nutrition labeling when my product contains two or more packets of supplements (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening)?\n\nYou may present the information for each packet (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening) in an individual nutrition label or you may use an aggregate nutrition label. For two packets, this would consist of five columns. List all of the dietary ingredients in the first column. List the amounts and percents of the morning packet in the second and third columns and similar information for the evening packet in the fourth and fifth columns (see the illustration of aggregate nutrition labeling in 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iii)).\n\nCompliance\n\nWhat kind of samples will FDA collect to determine compliance with 21 CFR 101.36?\n\nFDA will collect a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller. FDA will randomly select these packages.\n\nWhat if it is not technically feasible for me to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements?\n\nFDA may permit you to use an alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9). If your firm needs such special allowances, you must make your request in writing to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(f)(2)\n\nMust dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?\n\nFor dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value.\n\nExemptions\n\nWhat are the circumstances in which my dietary supplement products would be exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements? Your dietary supplement product is not required to have a ""Supplement Facts"" panel if: a. Your firm is a small business that has not more than $50,000 gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers or not more than $500,000 per year from total sales in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1); b. You sell less than 100,000 units of the product annually, your firm has fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(2) andyou file an annual notification with FDA as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(18)(iv); or c. You ship the product in bulk form, do not distribute it to consumers in such form, and you supply it for use in the manufacture of other dietary supplements in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(3). The two exemptions for small businesses and low-volume products (a. and b. above) are available to you only if your products\' labels bear no claims or other nutrition information.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(h)(1) - (3)\n\nSpecial Labeling Provisions\n\nWhat are small packages?\n\nSmall packages are those packages having less than 12 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)\n\nWhat is the telephone provision for small packages?\n\nIn lieu of a ""Supplement Facts"" panel, you may print labels for small packages with a telephone number or address that consumers can use to obtain nutrition information. You may use a telephone number or an address in place of the ""Supplement Facts"" panel only if you place no claims or other nutrition information on the product label.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size that I may use for small packages?\n\nYou may use a type size no smaller than 4-5 point for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on the labels of small packages.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(i)\n\nMay I use a tabular or linear format for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on a small package?\n\nYes. You may use a tabular format on small packages. You also may present ""Supplement Facts"" information in a linear (i.e., string) fashion if the label will not accommodate the ""Supplement Facts"" panel in a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j) (13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display.)\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n\nWhat are intermediate-sized packages?\n\nIntermediate-sized packages are those packages having from 12 to 40 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(ii)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size for intermediate-sized packages?The ""Supplement Facts"" panel on the labels of intermediate-sized packages must use type size no smaller than 6 point, except that type no smaller than 4-5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches that list more than 16 dietary ingredients. Also, 4-5 point type may be used on packages with less than 20 square inches that list more than 8 dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the type size used in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on an inner container may be as small as needed to accommodate all required information if the ""Supplement Facts"" on the outer container meets these type size requirements.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv)\n51. May I use a tabular or linear format for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on an intermediate-sized package? You may use a tabular format on an intermediate-sized package if the package shape or size cannot accommodate vertical columns. You may use a linear format if the label will not accommodate a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n52. May I abbreviate on the labels of intermediate- sized packages? You may use the abbreviations in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B) in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel for small and intermediate-sized packages, e.g, ""Serv size"" for ""Serving Size"" and ""Servings"" for ""Servings Per Container.""\n\n21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B)\n53. Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What are intermediate-sized packages?\n--------------------\nContext: Figure 8: Tabular Display\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:28]\n\n11.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe third modification is the use of abbreviations, as listed in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B). We now allow for the following additional abbreviations on labels for small and intermediate-sized packages: ""vitamin"" may be abbreviated as ""Vit.,"" ""potassium"" may be abbreviated as ""Potas.,"" and ""Includes"" may be abbreviated as ""Incl."" These abbreviations will further conserve label space. In addition, we allow the abbreviations of ""Total carb."" and ""Incl."" to be used on dual-column display labels (see section VIII.D).\n\n3.3 What Type Size Must be Used for the Declaration of Calories on the Tabular or Linear Displays for Small or Intermediate-Sized Packages?\n\nThe numeric value for ""Calories"" must be in a type size no smaller than 14 point, and the word ""Calories"" must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n3.4 How Do the Declarations of Serving Size and Servings Per Container on the Tabular or Linear Displays for Small or Intermediate-Sized Packages Differ from the Standard Label Version?\n\nThe "" -- servings per container"" declaration immediately follows the ""Nutrition Facts"" heading, as in the standard label version; however, it must be in a type size no smaller than 9 point on the tabular or linear display for small packages (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i)). If a linear display is used, then the actual number of servings (i.e., ""Servings"" as shown in Fig 10) may be listed instead of the servings per container declaration.\n\nThe declaration of ""Serving size,"" which follows below the "" -- servings per container"" or ""servings"" declaration, is to be highlighted in bold or extra bold and in a type size no smaller than 9 point on the tabular or linear display for small or intermediate-sized packages. See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n11.3.5 Is the ""% Daily Value*"" Footnote Required on Foods in Small and Intermediate-Sized Packages?\n\nFor products in small and intermediate-sized packages that qualify for the use of the tabular or linear format as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) and (2), there is no longer a requirement to place an asterisk, followed by the statement ""Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet,"" at the bottom of the label if the footnote corresponding to ""% Daily Value"" is omitted. If ""Daily Value"" is not spelled out in the heading, then an asterisk can be placed at the bottom of the label followed by the statement ""% DV = % Daily Value"" in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n3.6 VIII.D How Do I Comply with the Nutrition Labeling Formatting Requirements when Dual Column Labeling is Required or Provided Voluntarily?\n\nDual column labeling is required under certain conditions, and can be used in other situations. In the Federal Register of March 2, 2018 (83 FR 9003), we announced the availability of a separate Small Entity Compliance Guide entitled ""Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That CanReasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments: Guidance for Industry,"" which, among other topics, discusses a new requirement regarding the use of dual-column labeling (Ref. [9]). In the Federal Register of December 31, 2019 (84 FR 72230), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled ""Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Sizes-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics."" This final guidance also discusses formatting issues for dual-column labeling (Ref. [10]).\n\nRegarding specific formatting for dual column labeling, the final rule updates certain requirements. Directly following the serving size declarations, each column of nutrition information must contain a heading that accurately describes why a dual column is being utilized. For example, a product may provide nutrition information for two different RDI groups, like in Figure 11 below. A product may also provide nutrition information for two different forms of the same food (e.g., ""Per 1/4 cup mix"" and ""Per prepared portion""), as in Figure 12 below (21 CFR 101.9(e)). The quantitative information by weight and percent DV must be presented for each column, and the columns are to be separated by vertical lines (21 CFR 101.9(e)(3)). Nutrient information for vitamins and minerals must be separated from the information on other nutrients by a bar and be arrayed vertically in the required order (21 CFR 101.9(e)(4)). Note that the ""Amount per serving"" statement is not required for the dual column formats (21 CFR 101.9(d)(4)). See Figures 11 through 15 (see also 21 CFR 101.9(e)(5) and (e)(6)(i)).\n\nFigure 11: Dual Column Display for 2 different RDI Groups (101.9(e)(5))\n\nFigure 12: Dual Columns, Two Forms of the Same Food (101.9(e)(5))\n\nFigure 13: Dual Column Display, Per Serving and Per Container (101.9(e)(6)(i))\n\nFigure 15 shows the use of dual columns in a tabular display format for products. As mentioned above, ""Calories"" must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point, and the numeric amount for ""Calories"" must be in a type size no smaller than 22 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). ""Serving size"" declaration must be in a type size no smaller than 9 point; however, the "" - servings per container"" declaration must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point, as with the standard label version (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i) and (ii)). ""Amount per serving"" is not required (21 CFR 101.9(d)(4)).\n\nVIIILE When Can the Simplified Format Be Used?\n\nYou can use the simplified format when a food product contains insignificant amounts of eight or more of the following: Calories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium (21 CFR 101.9(f)). For foods intended for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age, you can use the simplified format when a food product contains insignificant amounts of six or more of the following: Calories, total fat, sodium, total\n\nFigure 14: Dual Column Display, Per Serving and Per Unit (101.9(e)(6)(i))\n\nFigure 15: Tabular Dual Column Display (101.9(e)(6)(ii))\n\ncarbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, or potassium (21 CFR 101.9(f)). The definition of ""insignificant amount"" has not changed.\n\nThe footnote requirement which states, ""Not a significant source of (\\underline{\\ })"" (listing the name(s) of any nutrients listed in this paragraph that are present in insignificant amounts) still exists (21 CFR 101.9(f)(4)). While the full ""% Daily Value"" footnote (see 21 CFR 101.9(d)(9)) is not required for the simplified format, the column header ""% Daily Value"" can be abbreviated as ""% DV."" If this abbreviation is used, then an asterisk must be placed at the end of the abbreviation and the corresponding footnote must read, ""% DV = % Daily Value"" (21 CFR 101.9(f)(5)). No footnote is required if ""Daily Value"" is spelled out in the column header (21 CFR 101.9(f)(5)). Figure 16 displays an example of a simplified format label.\n\nVIIILF Are Foods in Small Packages with a Total Surface Area Available to Bear Labeling of Less than 12 Square Inches Exempt from the Nutrition Facts Labeling Requirements?\n\nNot always. Foods in small packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches are not exempt from bearing a Nutrition Facts label if a nutrition claim or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising (21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)) is used or as outlined for covered vending machine food (see 21 CFR 101.8(c)). However, as previously allowed, if your product qualifies for and uses the exemption (i.e., claims or other nutrition information are not presented on the label or in labeling or advertising), then you must list an address or telephone number that a consumer can use to obtain the required nutrition information (21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)(A)).\n\nVIIILG How Do These New Formatting Rules Affect the Percentage Juice Declaration?\n\nFigure 16: Simplified Format Label (101.9(f))\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWith the changes to some type size requirements on the Nutrition Facts label, it is permissible if the percentage juice declaration for foods purporting to be beverages that contain fruit or vegetable juice is smaller in height than the declaration of ""Serving size,"" ""Calories,"" and the numerical value for ""Calories,"" in addition to already being permitted to be smaller in height than the brand name, product name, logo, universal product code, and ""Nutrition Facts"" heading (21 CFR 101.30(e)(2)).\n\n4.2.3 VIII.H Are There Specific Formatting Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels?\n\nInformation other than the title, headings, and footnotes must be in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Column headings (e.g., ""Amount Per Serving"" and ""% Daily Value"") and footnotes (e.g., ""Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet"") must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Because many dietary supplement products may contribute a negligible amount of calories, we do not require information about calories to be displayed in a larger type size or highlighted on Supplement Facts labels (81 FR 33742 at 33939).\n\nFor small packages which have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, all information within the nutrition label must be in type size no smaller than 4.5 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(i)).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the\n\npublic. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable\n\nstatutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible\n\nfor this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016 (81 FR 34000), we published a final rule pertaining to serving sizes for food. The final rule amends the definition of a single-serving container,\n\nrequires dual-column labeling for certain containers, updates the tables of Reference Amounts\n\nCustomarily Consumed (reference amounts, or RACCs), and amends the serving size for breath mints. The rule became effective on July 26, 2016. We have prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28). This guidance document restates in plain language the legal requirements set forth in the rule, and is intended to help small entities comply with the rule established in 21 CFR 101.9 and 101.12.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in our guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nIn the remainder of this guidance, ""you"" and ""I"" refer to food manufacturers that are subject to the rule. Many answers in this guidance are followed by citations to show where a specific requirement can be found in either the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) or Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nII Who Is Subject to the Rule?\n\nDoes the Rule Apply to Food Manufacturers?\n\nYou are subject to the rule if you manufacture food that is subject to our nutrition labeling requirements.\n\nHow Does FDA Define ""Serving Size""?\n\nA serving size is the amount of food customarily consumed (i.e., typically eaten) in one sitting for that food (section 403(q)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act).\n\nServing sizes are determined from the RACCs established in 21 CFR 101.12(b) and the procedures described in 21 CFR 101.9(b). A serving size should be written in a common household measure (e.g., cup, tablespoon, piece, slice, fraction (e.g., 1/4 pizza), ounce (oz), fluid ounce (fl oz), or other common household equipment used to package food products (e.g., jar, tray)) as defined under 21 CFR 101.9(b)(5).\n\nHow Does the Rule Define Single-Serving Container?\n\nA single-serving container is a product that is packaged and sold individually and contains less than 200 percent of the applicable reference amount for that product (21 CFR 101.9(b)(6)). The entire content of a single-serving container must be labeled as one serving (21 CFR 101.9(b)(6)). The final rule removed a preexisting exception from this labeling requirement that applied to certain products for which the RACC was 100 g or mL or larger. Under the final rule, regardless of the size of the RACC, all products that are packaged and sold individually and contain less than 200 percent of the applicable reference amount for that product must be labeled as a single-serving container (21 CFR 101.9(b)(6)). However, if the product is more than 150 percent and less than 200 percent of the applicable RACC, the manufacturer may voluntarily provide an additional on the Nutrition Facts label, to the left of the column that provides nutrition information per container (i.e., per serving). The voluntary column would list the quantitative amounts and the percent Daily Value (DV) per common household measure that most closely approximates the RACC (21 CFR 101.9(b)(6)).\n\nWhat Are the Requirements for Dual-Column Labeling?\n\nFDA regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(a)(1), require that the labeling of packaged foods provide certain nutrition information in a specified format (i.e., the Nutrition Facts label). While most packaged foods provided a single column of nutrition information under preexisting regulations, the final rule requires that a second column of nutrition information be placed on products that are packaged and sold individually and that contain at least 200 percent and up to and including 300 percent of the applicable reference amount for that product, unless an exemption applies (21 CFR 101.9(b)(12)(i)). The second column is part of the Nutrition Facts label and must list the nutrition information for the entire package (21 CFR 101.9(b)(12)(i)). The first nutrition column must list the nutrition information per serving (21 CFR 101.9(b)(12)(i)). See Figure 1. Unless an exemption applies, dual-column labeling requirements also apply for products in discrete units--regardless of whether they are packaged and sold individually--where the discrete unit contains at least 200 percent and up to and including 300 percent of the reference amount (21 CFR 101.9(b)(2)(i)(D)). For these products, the second column that is part of the Nutrition Facts label must list the nutrition information for the discrete unit (21 CFR 101.9(b)(2)(i)(D)).\n\nWhat Products Are Not Required to Provide Dual-Column Labeling?\n--------------------\nContext title: Food Labeling- Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What are intermediate-sized packages?\n--------------------\nContext: Products in the general food supply that contain insignificant amounts of eight or more of calories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium are eligible to provide a simplified declaration of nutrition information (21 CFR 101.9(f)). Products that qualify for the simplified declaration that bear nutrition claims are required to bear the statement ""Not a significant source of ____"" (with the blank filled in with the name(s) of any nutrient(s) identified in 21 CFR 101.9(f) that are present in insignificant amounts) and included at the bottom of the nutrition label). However, some products are sold in small packages (e.g., certain sugar-free chewing gums) for which the package size may render it impracticable for the label to display a substantial amount of information. Under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9), when ""circumstance[s] make it impracticable for firms to comply"" with Nutrition Facts labeling requirements, ""FDA may permit alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions to deal with the situation.""\n\nGiven the small package size of certain products and the potentially long statement that would be required if the label had to identify each nutrient that is present in insignificant amounts (see 21 CFR 101.9(f)), we consider 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9) to permit an alternative means of compliance with respect to the nutrition labeling for certain products sold in small packages for which the addition of such statement would be impracticable. In lieu of providing the ""Not a significant source of ____"" statement as required in 21 CFR 101.9(f)(4), we recommend that the label for such packages bear a statement such as ""Not a significant source of other nutrients"" at the bottom of the simplified Nutrition Facts label on such products sold in small packages.\n\nWhat are the requirements relating to multiunit retail food packages?\n\nWe recognize that many retail food products contain multiple, individually packaged items within the larger container (i.e., multiunit retail food packages). FDA\'s labeling requirements provide flexibility for such products, and manufacturers of such products generally have two options. The individual units within the multiunit retail food packages may be ""packaged and sold individually,"" meaning that each individually packaged item bears a Nutrition Facts label (81 FR 34000 at 34005). Note that, when individual units are packaged and sold individually, the Nutrition Facts label must still be visible at point of sale (see 21 CFR 101.9(h)). FDA regulations provide different requirements for unit containers in a multiunit retail food package when the individual unit containers are securely enclosed within and not intended to be separated from the retail package under conditions of retail sale and each unit container is labeled with the statement ""This Unit Not Labeled For Retail Sale"" or ""This Unit Not Labeled for Individual Sale"" in type size not less than 1/16-inch in height, except that this statement shall not be required when the inner unit containers bear no labeling at all (see 21 CFR 101.9(j)(15)(iii)). When this option is used, the multiunit retail food package must bear nutrition information in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9.\n\nCan Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels be placed on the bottom of a food package?\n\nGenerally not. The bottom of the package (such as the bottom of boxes, cans, and bottles, which generally cannot be viewed by the consumer at the point of sale) is not a permissible location for a Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels, unless it is visible during normal retail display and consumer handling (as with some frozen food packages or containers of mints and gum). The Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels must be placed either on the principal display panel or on the information panel (21 CFR 101.2(b)). The ""principal display panel"" means the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale (21 CFR 101.1). The ""information panel"" means the part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the principal display panel as observed by an individual facing the principal display panel, subject to a few exceptions (see 21 CFR 101.2(a)).\n\nWill the increase in RACCs for certain beverages, combined with recent changes to daily values (DVs) and the mandatory declaration of potassium--as updated in the Nutrition Facts label final rule--require products such as coffee, tea, and bottled water to bear mandatory nutrition labeling when such products were previously exempt under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(4)?\n\nNo. As explained in the serving size final rule, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to mandatory nutrition labeling on any products currently on the market, or that come on the market in the future, that would have been exempt under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(4) before the effective date of the serving size final rule, until such time as we have the opportunity to consider this issue in a future rulemaking (81 FR 34000 at 34026-34027). Examples of such products include coffee beans (whole or ground), tea leaves, commitment-type dehydrated vegetables, flavor extracts, food colors, and certain bottled water products.\n\nDoes FDA have recommendations or requirements relating to how nutrition information should be formatted if I use the tabular display for small packages as provided in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)? Specifically, are there limitations on the number of columns I can use in the tabular display?\n\nManufacturers using the tabular display must comply with all applicable requirements in 21 CFR 101.9. With respect to specific requirements that could impact the display of nutrition information using the tabular format, we note that 21 CFR 101.9 includes requirements for which nutrients must be indented under other nutrients (e.g., under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)(A), ""Soluble fiber content shall be indented under dietary fiber""). Attempting to divide the required nutrition information into more than two columns could result in a violation of such formatting requirements. We recommend that manufacturers follow the sample tabular display for small packages provided in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii), which uses two columns of nutrition information.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Size-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics']",['Intermediate-sized packages are those packages having from 12 to 40 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.'],0.99999999995,0.125

Detailed discussion of experimental design (i.e., choice of species, dose and dosing frequency justifications, etc.) is outside the scope of this guidance. However, dosages should be appropriate to address any identified cause for concern or to provide exposure margins that are clinically relevant (e.g., when conducting a study with two early stage agents). & Because of the potential complexity of performing and interpreting a combination toxicity study with more than two entities, it is generally more practical for initial studies to evaluate combinations of no more than two entities. Additional testing would then depend on the outcome of these studies and should be considered on a case-by-case basis, and in consultation with appropriate regulatory authorities. \\ \\hline\n7 & December 2011 & If a compound is being developed which aims to reduce another compound\'s side effect, such combination effects would be evaluated in clinical or nonclinical pharmacology studies. Do the pharmacology studies replace the combination toxicity study? & When combination toxicity studies are warranted, they generally can not be replaced by combination pharmacology studies except for anticancer pharmaceuticals (see ICH S9). The purpose of a combination toxicity study is to evaluate toxicity endpoints that could give rise to an unanticipated hazard for humans. These toxicity endpoints are not usually adequately evaluated in the pharmacology studies.

What are ""data to support a rationale for the combination study""? (3.6)\n--------------------\nContext: For combinations of an early stage entity(ies) with clinical experience with a late stage entity(ies), for which there is no significant toxicological concern, combination toxicity studies are not recommended to support clinical proof-of-concept studies of up to one months\' duration. The clinical study of the combination should not be longer than the clinical experience of the individual entities. Later stage or longer duration clinical studies should be supported by a nonclinical combination toxicity study.\n\nFor combinations of two early stage entities, nonclinical combination toxicity studies are recommended to support clinical trials.\n\nProvided complete nonclinical development programs are being conducted on the individual entities and a nonclinical combination toxicity study is warranted to support combination clinical trials, the duration of the combination study should be equivalent to that of the clinical trial, up to a maximum duration of 90 days. A 90-day combination toxicity study would also support marketing. A combination toxicity study of shorter duration can also support marketing, depending on the duration of the intended clinical use.\n\nThe design of the nonclinical studies recommended to characterize the combination will depend on the pharmacological, toxicological and PK profiles of the individual entities, the treatment indication(s), the intended patient population, and the available clinical data.\n\nCombination nonclinical studies should generally be limited to a single relevant species. If unexpected toxicity is identified, additional testing can be appropriate.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen complete nonclinical development programs are not conducted on the individual entities, then a complete nonclinical toxicology program with the combination only can be appropriate, provided that the individual agents are only intended for use in combination.\n\nCombination genotoxicity, safety pharmacology, or carcinogenicity studies generally are not recommended to support clinical trials or marketing if the individual agents have been tested according to current standards. In those cases where the patient population includes WOCBP and studies with the individual agent(s) have shown findings indicative of embryo-fetal risk, combination studies are not recommended as a potential human developmental hazard has already been identified. If nonclinical embryo-fetal studies have indicated that neither agent poses a potential human developmental risk, combination studies are not recommended unless concerns exist, based on the properties of individual components, that their combination could give rise to a hazard for humans. In circumstances when the individual agents have been tested in embryo-fetal studies but embryo-fetal studies of the drug combination are warranted, the study(ies) of the combination should be available to support the marketing application.\n\nXviii. Continuing efforts to improve harmonization (18)\n\nIt is recognized that significant advances in harmonization of the timing of nonclinical safety studies for the conduct of human clinical trials for pharmaceuticals have already been achieved and are detailed in this guidance. However, differences remain in a few areas. Regulators and industry will continue to consider these differences and work towards further improving the drug development process.\n\nXix Endnotes (19)\n\nNote 1: In this document, exposure generally means group mean AUC. In some circumstances (e.g., if the compound or compound class is known to produce acute functional cardiovascular changes or central nervous system-related clinical signs), it might be appropriate to base the exposure margin on group mean Cmax values rather than AUC.\n\nNote 2: An assessment of male and female fertility by thorough standard histopathological examination on the testis and ovary in a repeated-dose toxicity study (generally rodent) of at least 2-week duration is considered to be as sensitive as fertility studies in detecting toxic effects on male and female reproductive organs (Refs. 3, 15, 16).\n\nNote 3: Highly effective methods of birth control are defined as those, alone or in combination, that result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1 percent per year) when used consistently and correctly. For subjects using a hormonal contraceptive method, information regarding the product under evaluation and its potential effect on the contraceptive should be addressed.\n\nNote 4: A preliminary embryo-fetal study useful for this purpose is one with adequate dose levels; that includes assessment of fetal survival, body weight, and external and visceral examinations; that uses a minimum of six dams per group; and that has dams treated over the period of organogenesis. This preliminary nonclinical study should be conducted under high-quality scientific standards with data collection records readily available or under GLP conditions.\n\nNote 5: The pregnancy rate of women initially attempting to become pregnant is (\\sim)17 percent per menstrual cycle. Pregnancy rates estimated from phase 3 studies conducted in WOCBP were observed to be (<)0.1 percent per menstrual cycle. During these studies, subjects were encouraged to avoid pregnancy and measures were instituted to prevent pregnancy. Survey information from earlier phase 2 studies suggests that the pregnancy rates were lower than in phase 3 studies but the extent of further reduction could not be estimated due to the limited number of women enrolled. Based on the above phase 3 experience, phase 2 trials enrolling 150 WOCBP for 3 months are estimated to result in significantly less than 0.5 pregnancies per pharmaceutical under development.\n\nNote 6: Testing for photocarcinogenicity in rodents using currently available models (e.g., hairless rodent) is not considered useful in support of pharmaceutical development and generally is not recommended. If the phototoxicity assessment suggests a potential photocarcinogenic risk and an appropriate assay becomes available, the study should usually be completed before marketing and the results should be considered in the human risk assessment.\n\nReferences (20)\n\n[1] ICH S6 Safety Studies for Biotechnological Products\n\n[2] ICH E8 General Considerations for Clinical Trials\n\n[3] ICH S5(R2) Detection of Toxicity to Reproduction for Medicinal Products and Toxicity to Male Fertility\n\n[4] ICH S1C(R2) Dose Selection for Carcinogenicity Studies of Pharmaceuticals\n\n[5] ICH S7A Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human Pharmaceuticals\n\n[6] ICH S7B Nonclinical Evaluation of QT Interval Prolongation\n\n[7] ICH S3A Toxicokinetics: The Assessment of Systemic Exposure in Toxicity Studies\n\n[8] National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research.

The guideline describes potential strategies and study designs to supplement available data to identify, assess, and convey risk. General concepts and recommendations are also provided that should be considered when interpreting study data.\n\nThis is a revision of the ICH guideline ""S5 Detection of Toxicity to Reproduction for Medicinal Products"" that was originally published in 1993. This revision brings the guideline into alignment with other ICH guidelines, elaborates on the use of exposure margins in dose level selection, incorporates a section on risk assessment, and expands the scope to include vaccines and biopharmaceuticals. It also describes qualification of alternative assays, potential scenarios of use, and provides options for deferral of developmental toxicity studies.\n\nTo assess a human pharmaceutical\'s effect on reproduction and development, there should generally be information available that addresses the potential impact of exposure to a pharmaceutical and, when appropriate, its metabolites (ICH M3 (1), ICH S6 (2)) on all stages of reproduction and development. No guideline can provide sufficient information to cover all possible cases, and flexibility in testing strategy is warranted.\n\nAim of Studies\n\nThe aim of DART studies is to reveal any effect of the pharmaceutical on mammalian reproduction relevant for human risk assessment. As appropriate, the set of studies conducted should encompass observations through one complete life cycle (i.e., from conception in one generation through conception in the following generation), and permit detection of immediate and latent adverse effects. The following stages of reproduction are generally assessed:\n\n[label=)]\n\nPremating to conception (adult male and female reproductive functions, development and maturation of gametes, mating behavior, fertilization).\n\nConception to implantation (adult female reproductive functions, preimplantation development, implantation).\n--------------------\nContext title: S5-R3_Step4_Guideline_2020_0218_1'

40,"After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?","['--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?\n--------------------\nContext: IV SCOPE OF GUIDANCE\n\nThis guidance is intended to help manufacturers and repackagers understand and satisfy the requirements of section 582(b)(2) and (e)(2) of the FD&C Act, respectively, to affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product that they intend to introduce in a transaction into commerce. The recommendations in this guidance are intended to assist manufacturers and repackagers in developing standardized formats for the human- and machine-readable information that is contained in the product identifier. The requirements set forth in the DSCSA do not change the linear barcode requirements under 21 CFR 201.25.\n\nV Product Identifiers under the DSCSA\n\nAs noted in Section II of this guidance, a product identifier is defined under section 581(14) of the FD&C Act as a standardized graphic that includes the product\'s standardized numerical identifier (composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number), lot number, and expiration date, in both human- and machine-readable formats. The machine-readable format must be on a data carrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization.10 The product identifier data is specifically required under section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act to be in a ""2-dimensional data matrix barcode"" for packages and in a ""linear or 2-dimensional data matrix barcode"" for homogenous cases, which can be verified using ""human-readable or machine-readable methods.""11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 581(14) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act. As described in section 582(a)(9)(A), FDA may decide in the future to allow the use of other technologies for data instead of, or in addition to, the 2-dimensional data matrix barcode or linear barcode.\n\nUnder section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act, manufacturers are required to ""affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce"" beginning no later than November 27, 2017. Under section 582(e)(2) of the FD&C Act, repackagers are required to ""affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction in commerce"" beginning no later than November 27, 2018. Therefore, each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce must include the NDC, unique serial number, lot number, and expiration date in both human- and machine-readable formats.\n\nVI Compliance Policy for Product Identifier Requirements\n\nIn the guidance titled ""Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Compliance Policy,"" FDA stated that it did not intend to take enforcement action against manufacturers who did not, prior to November 27, 2018, affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction intocommerce as required by section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.12 As the time frame described in this compliance policy has since ended, it no longer represents the Agency\'s thinking in terms of enforcement policy.\n\nFootnote 12: See guidance for industry Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy (September 2018). We update guidances periodically.

The linear barcode requirements were established for different purposes than the DSCSA requirements and apply to additional FDA-regulated products and packaging in some instances, and are still in effect. In the Federal Register of February 26, 2004 (69 FR 9120), FDA published a final rule requiring certain human drug and biological product labels to have a linear barcode that contains, at a minimum, the drug\'s NDC number (SS 201.25).18 Manufacturers, repackers (also known as ""repackagers""), relabelers, and private label distributors of human prescription drug products, biological products, and over-the-counter (OTC) drug products dispensed pursuant to an order and commonly used in hospitals, are subject to the linear barcode requirement. The linear barcode must appear on the drug\'s label as defined by section 201(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(k)). FDA has interpreted that requirement to mean the linear barcode should be on the outside container or wrapper, as well as on the immediate container unless the barcode is readily visible and machine-readable through the outside container or wrapper.19\n\nFootnote 18: See 69 FR 9120 at 9140 (Feb. 26, 2004), https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2004-02-26/pdf/04-4249.pdf.\n\nAs stated in the preamble to the final rule:\n\nBar codes can help reduce or detect potential medication errors by enabling health care professionals to check whether they are giving the right drug via the right dose and right route of administration to the right patient at the right time.20\n\nFootnote 20: Id. at 9120.\n\nThe preamble contemplated that linear barcodes, the use of scanning equipment, and computerized databases would be part of a system that could help reduce the number of medication errors that occur in hospitals and other health care settings.21\n\nFootnote 21: Id. at 9120.\n\nManufacturers, repackers, relabelers, and private label distributors of drug products who are subject to the establishment registration and drug listing requirements in section 510 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360) are responsible for placing the appropriate barcode on the product.22 The following prescription drug products, however, are exempted under SS 201.25 from the linear barcode requirements:\n\nFootnote 22: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products. Private label distributors who do not also manufacture, repack, relabel, or salvage drugs are not required to register under part 207.\n\nFootnote 23: For the purposes of the linear barcode requirements, radiopharmaceuticals are considered “radioactive drugs” or “radioactive biological products”, as defined in 21 CFR 310.3(n) and 21 CFR 600.3(ce), respectively.\n\nFootnote 24: § 201.25(b)(1)(ii).\n\nprescription drug samples\n\nallergenic extracts\n\nintrauterine contraceptive devices regulated as drugs\n\nmedical gases\n\nradiopharmaceuticals23\n\nlow-density polyethylene form fill and seal containers that are not packaged with an overwrap.\n\nFootnote 23: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products. Private label distributors who do not also manufacture, repack, relabel, or salvage drugs are not required to register under part 207.\n\nIn addition, the linear bar code requirement does not apply to prescription drugs that are sold by a manufacturer, repacker, relabeler, or private label distributor directly to patients, unless versions of that same drug are also sold to or used in hospitals.24\n\nIX Questions and Answers\n\nAgency Contacts\n\nWho should be contacted for questions related to barcode requirements for drug packages and homogenous cases under the DSCSA?\n\nFor CDER-regulated products, inquiries should be emailed to:\n\nCDER BarcodeQuestions(@fda.hhs.gov.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 18: See section 582(b)(2) of the FD&C Act. Product Identifier is defined in section 581(14) and includes the product’s standardized numerical identifier, which is composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number (see section 581(20)).\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(b)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 20: See section 582(b)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nProduct Tracing and Verification\n\nUnder section 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act, trading partners are required to provide the subsequent purchaser with product tracing information22 for each transaction23 involving a DSCSA-covered MMA product. For example, if the manufacturer transfers ownership of a DSCSA-covered MMA product to a wholesale distributor, the wholesale distributor generally shall not accept ownership of a product unless the manufacturer has, prior to or at the time of the transaction, provided the transaction history, transaction information, and a transaction statement for the product.24\n\nFootnote 21: See FDA Guidance for Industry Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (Sept. 2018). This guidance and other guidance documents on the DSCSA are available on FDA’s website at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nFootnote 22: For purposes of this guidance, the term product tracing information refers to the transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statement defined in section 581(26), (25), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nTrading partners also are required to have verification systems in place for the DSCSA-covered MMA products to comply with the requirements under section 582(b)(4), (c)(4), (d)(4), and (e)(4) of the FD&C Act. These requirements include steps to handle suspect and illegitimate product.25\n\nFootnote 23: Suspect product is defined in section 581(21), and illegitimate product is defined in section 581(8), of the FD&C Act.\n\nVIII. Importation of MMA Products\n\nThis section sets forth recommendations intended to assist importers of MMA products by facilitating an efficient and effective admissibility review. Following the procedures in this section will also assist FDA in determining that the importation is authorized and not, for example, a counterfeit.\n\nImportant Entries for MMA Products\n\nTo help FDA verify that a shipment that purports to contain an MMA product is one in which the manufacturer26 has, in fact, authorized the drug to be marketed in the United States and has caused the drug to be labeled to be marketed in the United States, we strongly encourage the filing of an electronic entry in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). If a manufacturer plans to use or authorize another process for making entry of an MMA product other than ACE, such as a paper entry, we strongly encourage the manufacturer to inform FDA in advance. FDA\'s view is that international mail is not appropriate for the importation of MMA products.\n\nFootnote 26: As noted in footnote 5, above, for purposes of this guidance, the manufacturer is the NDA or BLA holder for the MMA product.\n\nACE is currently the sole Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system authorized by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to process electronic entry and entry summary filings for FDA-regulated products. Submitting complete, accurate information in ACE facilitates effective and efficient admissibility review by FDA. FDA regulations set forth the required data elements that must be submitted in an electronic entry in ACE, or any other EDI system authorized by CBP, for any entry that includes FDA-regulated products (21 CFR Part 1, Subpart D).27\n\nFootnote 27: FDA published its final rule, “Submission of Food and Drug Administration Import Data in the Automated Commercial Environment,” on November 29, 2016 (81 FR 85854), and the rule was effective December 29, 2016.\n\nAt the time of filing entry in ACE, a filer must submit, among other elements, a Drug Listing Number, which is currently the NDC for drugs, including biological products and combination products, regulated by CDER (21 CFR 1.74). For drugs, biological products and combination products, regulated by CBER, the Drug Listing Number is not required. Although not required, FDA strongly encourages filers to submit the Drug Listing Number for CBER-regulated MMA products in ACE at the time of entry because this information will assist FDA\'s initial screening and further review of the entry, which can significantly increase the likelihood that the entry line will receive an automated ""May Proceed"" from FDA.\n\nManufacturer Authorization for MMA Products\n\nAs stated above, section 801(d)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act provides that, with limited exceptions:\n\n[N]o drug that is subject to section 503(b)(1) [of the FD&C Act] may be imported into the United States for commercial use if such drug is manufactured outside the United States, unless the manufacturer has authorized the drug to be marketed in the United States and has caused the drug to be labeled to be marketed in the United States.\n\nUnder this provision, any shipment of a purported MMA product that is offered for importation would be subject to refusal unless the manufacturer has authorized the MMA product to be marketed in the United States. It is essential that FDA be provided the information needed to confirm that each shipment of a purported MMA product offered for importation has been authorized for marketing in the United States by the manufacturer. To help ensure that a particular shipment is authorized, and to help mitigate the potential for counterfeiting, the manufacturer should provide information that is sufficient for FDA to verify that each shipmentof an MMA product has, in fact, been authorized by the manufacturer to be marketed in the United States. This information is described in the following paragraph.\n\nFDA strongly encourages manufacturers to submit a report via the Electronic Submissions Gateway (ESG) (or to an alternative transmission point identified by FDA) notifying the Agency of the importation of an MMA product 10 business days in advance of the first import entry of an MMA product covered by the report, which will facilitate FDA\'s timely admissibility review when the MMA product is offered for import. This report should include: the MMA product name, dosage form, and quantity of the MMA product; the name, address, and telephone number of the authorized importer; and any temporal or other limitations the manufacturer has placed on the authorized importation. For example, a report could authorize multiple shipments of an MMA product for a specified period of time. An updated report should be timely submitted by the manufacturer each time there is a change to the material information in the report; this updated report would be submitted before any additional imports affected by the changes are entered into ACE. Manufacturers who choose to submit this report must do so electronically in Portable Document Format (PDF) using the Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) format and the ESG (or to an alternative transmission point identified by FDA).28 The report should be referenced and placed in Module 1. For further information regarding eCTD, please refer to FDA\'s website at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/Electr\n\nonicSubmissions/ucm153574.htm.\n\nFootnote 28: FDA Guidance for Industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format — Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specifications (Jan. 2019). For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIX Other Requirements applicable to an MMA product\n\nAn MMA product is subject to all relevant requirements of applicable statutes, including those implemented by FDA such as the FD&C Act and the PHS Act; applicable implementing regulations under those authorities; and other relevant statutes, including the Social Security Act, the Poison Prevention Packaging Act, and the Controlled Substances Act. The provisions implemented by FDA include, but are not limited to, provisions related to adulteration and misbranding, and requirements related to adverse event reporting (or postmarketing safety reporting for combination products under 21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B), recalls, and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAppendix A: Dear Healthcare Provider Letter\n\nDear Healthcare Provider\n\nMonth Year\n\nIMPORTED PRODUCT FOLLOWING PROCEDURES IN: ""Importation of Certain FDA-\n\nApproved Human Prescription Drugs, Including Biological Products, and Combination Products\n\nunder Section 801(d)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act: Guidance for\n\nIndustry"" - MODEL LETTER\n\nSubject: Importation of TRADENAME (nonproprietary name for drugs/proper name for\n\nbiological products) (NDC #1, NDC #2): Availability of an FDA-approved prescription drug/biological product/combination product that was originally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and authorized for sale in that foreign country.\n\nDear Health Care Provider:\n\nThe purpose of this letter is to inform you that TRADENAME (NDC #1, NDC #2), an FDA-\n\napproved prescription drug(s)/biological product(s)/combination product(s) that was/were\n\noriginally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and authorized for sale in that foreign\n\ncountry, will be available in the United States.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 10: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(d)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 12: For this guidance, (tradangpartner) is defined as described in section 581(23)(A) of the FD&C Act. Although third-party logistics providers are also considered trading partners under section 581(23)(B) of the FD&C Act, they are not subject to the same product tracing requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nThe Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public Law 113-54) was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier, authorized trading partner, and verification requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers, and dispensersto facilitate the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act is prohibited under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nOne requirement of the verification scheme outlined in the DSCSA is the verification of saleable returned product. Under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act, wholesale distributors must have systems in place that will enable them to verify the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, on each sealed homogeneous case of saleable returned product, or, if such product is not in a sealed homogeneous case, on each package of saleable returned product. A saleable returned product may not be further distributed until the product identifier is verified.13 The product should be handled as suspect product if the product identifier is not successfully verified (i.e., it should be quarantined and investigated).14. 15 FDA published the 2019 Compliance Policy on September 24, 2019, announcing a 1-year delay in enforcement against wholesale distributors who do not verify the product identifier of saleable returned product prior to further distributing such product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 14: See Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs (October 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIn addition, section 582 of the FD&C Act requires certain trading partners (manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers) to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and a transaction statement when engaging in transactions involving certain prescription drugs.16({}^{,})17 A transaction statement must include a statement that the entity transferring ownership in a transaction had systems and processes in place to comply with verification requirements under section 582 of the FD&C Act.18 In the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA acknowledged that wholesale distributors may not have systems in place by November 27, 2019, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, the 2019 Compliance Policy indicated FDA\'s intent to take no enforcement action prior to November 27, 2020, against a wholesale distributor that provided a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor did not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(c)(4)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act details how wholesale distributors must handle suspect product.\n\nFootnote 17: Transaction, transaction history, transaction information, and transaction statement are defined under sections 581(24), (25), (26), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582 also includes requirements for dispensers to verify product identifiers when investigating suspect or illegitimate product. Specifically, section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act provides that, effective November 27, 2020, dispensers must verify ""the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, of at least 3 packages or 10 percent of such suspect product, whichever is greater, or all packages, if there are fewer than 3, corresponds with the product identifier for such product [in the dispenser\'s possession or control]"".19 Section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act requires dispensers to verify product as described in 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act when they have received a notification of illegitimate product from FDA or a trading partner.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIII Compliance Policy for Wholesale Distributor Verification of Saleable Returned Product\n\nAfter publishing the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA has received comments and feedback from wholesale distributors, as well as other trading partners and stakeholders, expressing additional concern with industry-wide readiness for implementation of the verification of saleable returned product requirement for wholesale distributors. Stakeholders have explained that the primary factors FDA considered when issuing the 2019 Compliance Policy still exist: (1) the very large volume of saleable returned products requiring verification; (2) the need to refine and test verification systems during actual production using real-time volumes of saleable returned product rather than simply in pilots; and (3) the complexities of building an interoperable, electronic system with the capabilities to timely and efficiently verify the large volume of saleable returned products amid immature technologies.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some wholesale distributors may still need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, when the delay in enforcement set forth in the 2019 Compliance Policy expires, before they can begin verifying returned products prior to resale or other further distribution as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act in an efficient, secure, and timely manner. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against wholesale distributors who do not verify a product identifier prior to resale or other further distribution of a package or sealed homogenous case of product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAdditionally, FDA recognizes that wholesale distributors may still not have systems in place by November 27, 2020, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, prior to November 27, 2023, FDA does not intend to take action against a wholesale distributor for providing a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor does not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.20\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPolicy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (September 2018), addresses such returns.28_\n\nFootnote 28: For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page.\n\nIV Compliance Policy for the Dispenser Verification Requirements\n\nIn the years since the passage of the DSCSA, FDA has received comments and feedback from dispensers expressing concern with readiness for implementation of certain requirements under section 582(d) of the FD&C Act, including the verification requirements addressed in this compliance policy. Specifically, dispensers have described challenges with implementation of these provisions in the DSCSA due to the time necessary to develop technologies and processes that would support a robust verification system.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some dispensers may need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, before they can begin to verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect and illegitimate products as described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect product as required by section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act. In addition, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify, as required by section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act, the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of product that is the subject of an illegitimate product notification by FDA or a trading partner.\n--------------------\nContext title: Wholesale Distributor Verification Requirement for Saleable Returned Drug Product and Dispenser Verification Requirements When Investigating a Suspect or Illegitimate Product—Compliance Policies'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes FDA\'s compliance policy with regard to a requirement related to product identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. Specifically, this guidance addresses the requirement in section 582(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360eee-1(b)(2)) that manufacturers ""affix or imprint a product identifier2 to each package3 and homogenous case4 of a product5 intended to be introduced in a transaction6 into commerce"" beginning not later than November 27, 2017.7\n\nFootnote 2: Product identifier is defined in section 581(14) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee(14)) as a standardized graphic that includes, in both human-readable formand on a machine-readable datacarrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization, the standardized numerical identifier, lot number, and expiration date of the product.\n\nFootnote 3: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 4: Homogeneous case is defined in section 581(7) of the FD&C Act. The terms “homogeneous” and “homogenous” are used interchangeably throughout the DSCSA. FDA has chosen to use only the term “homogenous” throughout this guidance.\n\nFootnote 5: Product is defined in section 581(13) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 6: Transaction is defined in section 581(24) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 7: See section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe compliance policy set forth in this guidance applies only to the requirement regarding product identifiers described above. In brief, FDA does not intend to take action against manufacturers who do not affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product before November 27, 2018. This represents a one year delay in enforcement of the requirement for manufacturers to affix or imprint product identifiers.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances  means that something  is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe Drug Supply  Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public  Law 113-54)  was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier,  authorized trading partner, and verification  requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors,  repackagers, and dispensers  to facilitate  the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution  supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 is prohibited  under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nAn important  requirement of the product tracing scheme outlined  in the DSCSA is the product identifier.  Section 582 requires that each package and homogenous  case of product in the pharmaceutical distribution  supply chain bear a product identifier  in both a human-readable  form and on a machine-readable  data carrier. The product identifier includes  the product\'s standardized  numerical identifier,8 lot number, and expiration  date. Manufacturers are required  to begin affixing  or imprinting  a product identifier  to each package and homogenous  case of a product intended to be introduced  in a transaction into commerce no later than November 27, 2017. Repackagers are required to do the same no later than November 27, 2018.9\n\nFootnote 8: Standardized numerical identifier is defined in section 581(20) of the FD&C Act as a set of numbers or characters used to uniquely identify each package or homo genus case that is composed of the National Drug Code that corresponds to the specific product (including the particular package configuration) combined with a unique alphanumeric serial number of up to 20 characters.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 582(e)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSince product packaged by a manufacturer during  the one year delay in enforcement of the product identifier requirement is also subject to the policy  set forth in the final guidance Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (grandfathering policy),  trading partners should  read that final  guidance to understand how to treat such product for the purposes of the product identifier  and verification requirements.10\n\nFootnote 10: Final guidance for industry Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 35: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 36: Dispenser is defined in section 581(3) of the FD&C Act.\n\nTherefore, manufacturers and repackagers must determine the smallest individual saleable unit product configuration that they intend to be sold to the dispenser, and affix or imprint a product identifier (included in a 2-dimensional data matrix barcode) to that package.\n\nTo determine what constitutes a package, manufacturers and repackagers should consider how their packages of product may be opened and separated by wholesale distributors, who may sell smaller individual units of product that were inside the larger package to a dispenser for ultimate dispensing or administration to a patient. For example, although a carton of 10 individual product units may be sold to a dispenser, manufacturers and repackagers may want to apply a product identifier to each of the 10 product units in the carton if it is reasonably foreseeable that a wholesale distributor might sell individual product units to a dispenser. See Section IX.E of this guidance for examples of potential individual saleable units and a discussion of the applicable barcode requirements. Also, see Section IX.C for additional regulatory requirements that may apply when determining whether to affix or imprint a product identifier to a product unit.\n\nDo manufacturer and repackager activities related to affixing or imprinting the product identifier need to comply with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP)?\n\nYes, the CGMP requirements under 21 CFR parts 210 and 211 apply to the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of a drug product, including packaging and labeling operations, testing, and quality control of drugs.\n\nCan manufacturers and repackagers request a waiver, exemption, or exception from the DSCSA requirement to include a product identifier?\n\nYes. FDA has authority under section 582(a)(3) of the FD&C Act to grant a waiver, exception, or exemption for products and transactions from certain requirements in section 582. Manufacturers and repackagers should use the processes set forth in FDA\'s draft guidance for industry Waivers, Exceptions, and Exemptions from the Requirements of Section 582 of the _Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to make a request.37 This guidance also describes what information should be included with the request.\n\nFootnote 37: Draft guidance for industry Waivers, Exceptions, and Exemptions from the Requirements of Section 582 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (May 2018). When finalized, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nDo the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA apply to prescription drugs marketed without FDA approval?\n\nYes. The DSCSA establishes requirements for ""products,"" which as defined under section 581(13) of the FD&C Act are generally prescription drugs in a finished dosage form for administration to patients without substantial further manufacturing. ""Prescription drugs"" in the DSCSA refer to drugs for human use,38 which meet the requirements of section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)), independent of approval status.\n\nFootnote 38: See section 581(12) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFor prescription drugs that are marketed without FDA approval, is the manufacturer required to submit the product identifier as part of its product labeling during registration and listing?\n\nYes. FDA interprets the definition of ""labeling"" in section 201(m) of the FD&C Act to include the product identifier. Accordingly, as part of registration and listing under 21 CFR part 207, a manufacturer of any prescription drug for commercial distribution39 must submit a copy of all current labeling as specified under SS 207.49(a)(15)(i), independent of approval status.\n\nFootnote 39: Commercial distribution is defined in 21 CFR 207.1.\n\nSubmission of Label Changes Under the DSCSA\n\nHow should manufacturers or repackagers submit a package label change to FDA that is solely for incorporating the product identifier of an already approved prescription drug?40\n\nFootnote 40: For purposes of this guidance, the term drug includes biological drug products that are licensed by CDER and CBER.\n\nApplicants who submit annual reports should be aware of product identifier changes made by manufacturers and repackagers in the supply chain. Under section 582(a)(8) of the FD&C Act, a change made to the drug package label solely to incorporate the product identifier may be submitted in an applicant\'s annual report41 in accordance with 21 CFR 314.70(d). Under SS 314.70(d), the applicant must document certain changes in the next annual report in accordance with SS 314.81(b)(2).42 Under SS 314.81(b)(2)(i), the annual report must contain a brief summary of significant new information from the previous year that might affect the safety, effectiveness, or labeling of the drug product.\n\nFootnote 41: For purposes of this guidance, the term establishment, as used in section 582(a)(8) of the FD&C Act, refers to the applicant.\n\nA table of contents may be included in the annual report which indicates the inclusion of the labeling change for incorporating the product identifier on products.\n\nIn certain instances, it may be appropriate to submit a labeling change in a Prior Approval Supplement (PAS) or in a Changes Being Effected supplement instead of in an annual report.43\n\nFootnote 43: For further information, consult the guidance for industry Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA (April 2004).\n\nIs a manufacturer or repackager required to submit to FDA information encoded in the product identifier for each package and homogenous case of product?\n\nIn general, the information encoded in each product identifier for packages and homogenous cases is not required to be submitted to FDA. However, FDA may request information from a manufacturer or repackager in the event of a recall or to investigate a suspect or illegitimate product. In this circumstance, the manufacturer or repackager must provide the applicable transaction information,44 which includes the NDC number and lot number, as well as the transaction history and transaction statement for the product.45\n\nFootnote 44: See section 582(b)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act for manufacturer requirement; section 582(e)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act for repackager requirement.\n\nAlso, FDA may request information from a manufacturer or repackager to verify a product identifier if FDA has made the determination that a suspect product is in the possession or control of such manufacturer or repackager. In this circumstance, the manufacturer or repackager must provide relevant information46 in response that FDA can use to determine whether the product identifier affixed to or imprinted on a package or homogenous case corresponds to the standardized numerical identifier47 or lot number and expiration date assigned to the product by the manufacturer or repackager.\n\nFootnote 45: Transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statement are defined in section 581(26), (25), and (27) of the FD&C Act, respectively.\n\nFootnote 46: See section 582(b)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act for manufacturer requirement; section 582(e)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act for repackager requirement.\n\nCan a manufacturer submit a placeholder when submitting initial or updated product labeling as part of an application or supplemental application (i.e., New Drug Application [NDA], Abbreviated New Drug Application [ANDA], or Biologics License Application [BLA]) to reflect its commitment to affix or imprint the product identifier on its product?\n\nYes. CDER and CBER will accept the submission of a drug product label that contains a placeholder when submitting initial or updated product labeling as part of an application or supplemental application (i.e., NDA, ANDA, or BLA) in lieu of an image of the final product identifier that the manufacturer intends to use at the time of drug manufacturing. The placeholder should be represented on the initial or updated product labeling submission as a blank space with labels to sufficiently describe what information will be placed in that space at the time the product is manufactured (e.g., ""lot number"" and ""expiration date"") (see Question and Answer #4 above for examples of how to label each element of information).\n\nThe Product Identifier Requirement of the DSCSA and the Linear Barcode Requirement Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nIs my product package required to have both a linear barcode and a 2D data matrix barcode?\n\nIt depends. There will be instances when a product package is required to have both a linear barcode, pursuant to SS 201.25, and a 2D data matrix barcode, pursuant to the DSCSA. For a product for which a manufacturer, under the DSCSA, has identified the smallest individual saleable unit intended for ultimate sale to a dispenser--which is a ""package"" under FD&C Act section 581(11)--the package would generally require a 2D data matrix barcode to comply with the DSCSA48 in addition to the requisite linear barcode under SS 201.25. See Section E of this guidance for examples of when a 2D data matrix barcode may not be required.\n\nFootnote 48: See FD&C Act sections 582(b)(2)(A) and 582(a)(9).\n\nWith the enactment of the DSCSA, is the guidance for industry ""Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers"" (August 2011) still applicable for the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25?\n\nYes. The guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers remains applicable to the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25 unless or until such time the guidance is revised, replaced, or withdrawn. This guidance should be consulted for questions specific to the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.49\n\nFootnote 49: See guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers (August 2011), available at https://www.fda.gov/files/vaccines%2C%20blood%20%26%20biologies/published/Guidance-for-Industry–Bar-Code-Label-Requirements.pdf).\n--------------------\nContext title: Product Identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPolicy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (September 2018), addresses such returns.28_\n\nFootnote 28: For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page.\n\nIV Compliance Policy for the Dispenser Verification Requirements\n\nIn the years since the passage of the DSCSA, FDA has received comments and feedback from dispensers expressing concern with readiness for implementation of certain requirements under section 582(d) of the FD&C Act, including the verification requirements addressed in this compliance policy. Specifically, dispensers have described challenges with implementation of these provisions in the DSCSA due to the time necessary to develop technologies and processes that would support a robust verification system.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some dispensers may need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, before they can begin to verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect and illegitimate products as described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect product as required by section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act. In addition, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify, as required by section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act, the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of product that is the subject of an illegitimate product notification by FDA or a trading partner.\n\nDispensers should refer to the Verification Systems Draft Guidance for a detailed description of responsibilities that are applicable to them, as the compliance policy described in this section applies only to the dispenser requirements regarding verification of product identifiers described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act and does not apply to any other provision in section 582 of the FD&C Act. This compliance policy does not address any of the other verification requirements set forth in section 582(d)(4) of the FD&C Act. For example, this compliance policy does not affect the requirement that as of November 27, 2020, a dispenser may engage in transactions involving a product only if such product is encoded with a product identifier (except as provided pursuant to section 582(a)(5) of the FD&C Act),29 and this compliance policy does not affect the other activities required by section 582(d)(4)(A) and section 582(d)(4)(B) by incorporation (e.g., dispensers must still quarantine product, conduct investigations, and disposition illegitimate product). This compliance policy does not relieve a manufacturer of its verification obligations pursuant to section 582(b)(4)(C) of the FD&C Act upon receiving a request for verification from an authorized dispenser.\n\nFootnote 29: See section 582(d)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThis compliance policy aligns with the statutory requirements for an enhanced drug distribution system discussed above in section III of this guidance. When effective on November 27, 2023,the enhanced system must include as part of the transaction information the product identifier for each package in the transaction.30 The enhanced system must also allow for the verification of product at the package level.31 In addition, the enhanced system must allow for the ability to promptly generate and provide specific product and transaction documentation upon request by FDA, another Federal or State official, or an authorized trading partner for purposes of investigating suspect or illegitimate product.32 FDA believes that dispensers can use this 3-year period to ensure the systems and processes that are put into place to meet the enhanced system requirements by November 27, 2023, will also fulfill all dispenser verification requirements under section 582(d)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 30: See section 582(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 31: See section 582(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 32: See section 582(g)(1)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n--------------------\nContext title: Wholesale Distributor Verification Requirement for Saleable Returned Drug Product and Dispenser Verification Requirements When Investigating a Suspect or Illegitimate Product—Compliance Policies']","['As noted in Section II of this guidance, a product identifier is defined under section 581(14) of the FD&C Act as a standardized graphic that includes the product\'s standardized numerical identifier (composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number), lot number, and expiration date, in both human- and machine-readable formats. The machine-readable format must be on a data carrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization.10 The product identifier data is specifically required under section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act to be in a ""2-dimensional data matrix barcode"" for packages and in a ""linear or 2-dimensional data matrix barcode"" for homogenous cases, which can be verified using ""human-readable or machine-readable methods.""11']",0.99999999998,0.0

A brief description of these types of studies follows. Please refer to the FDA Information Sheet Guidance ""Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies"" for more detailed information about SR and NSR device studies, the importance of the IRB\'s review, the regulatory requirements for these studies, and examples of devices in each category.\n\nA. Significant t Risk Device Studies\n\nA significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. (21 CFR 812.3(m))\n\nSponsors of investigational SR device studies are required to get an approved IDE from FDA before starting their study. 21 CFR 812.20 (FDA gives each IDE a number - for example #GXX0000, where XX denotes the year of the submission). Sponsors and clinical investigators of these studies must comply with the regulations at 21 CFR Part 812, ""Investigational Device Exemptions.""\n\nIf FDA disapproves an IDE, FDA\'s letter will describe the reasons for the disapproval. If the sponsor submits an IDE amendment satisfactorily addressing the issues in FDA\'s letter, the agency sends an IDE approval letter to the sponsor. In accordance with the regulations at Part 812, the study may not start until both FDA and the IRB have given their approval.\n\nNote: A conditional approval letter from FDA allows the study to begin if the study is approved by the IRB, but requires the sponsor to provide additional clarifying information in order to obtain full approval for the study.\n\nIRBs do not have to make the SR or NSR determination if FDA has already made the risk determination. Most often, clinical investigators submit SR device investigations for IRB review after the study has already received IDE approval from FDA. IRBs may ensure that SR device investigations have an FDA-approved IDE by asking the clinical investigator to request from the sponsor a copy of FDA\'s IDE approval letter.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAn IRB may be asked to review an SR device study before the sponsor receives FDA approval of an IDE submission. Under this circumstance, IRBs should be aware that because it is possible that FDA may not approve the IDE or may request significant changes to the research protocol, the IRB may need to re-evaluate the study after FDA reviews the application. If an IRB approves the significant risk device study before FDA approves the IDE, there may be more of a risk that clinical investigators will mistakenly enroll subjects before the study should be started (i.e, before FDA approves the IDE.)\n\nNon-Significant Risk Device Studies\n\nAn NSR device is an investigational device that does not meet the definition of a significant risk device. If an IRB finds that an investigational medical device study poses a NSR, the sponsor does not need to submit an IDE to FDA before starting the study. If the IRB determines that the proposed study is an NSR study, the IRB may proceed to review the study under 21 CFR 56.109 and 21 CFR 56.111. FDA considers an NSR device study to have an approved IDE after IRB approval and when sponsors meet the abbreviated requirements at 21 CFR 812.2(b). Consequently, in most cases, FDA is not aware of non-significant risk device studies.\n\nAs stated above, if FDA has already made the risk determination, the IRB does not need to duplicate this effort. If, however, FDA has not made the risk determination or the IRB disagrees with the NSR determination made by a sponsor, then the IRB must notify the investigator and, where appropriate, the sponsor, that the study involves a significant risk device (21 CFR 812.66). If a sponsor or an IRB needs help in making the SR/NSR determination, it may ask for a written determination from FDA.3\n\nFootnote 3: See the guidance memorandum entitled, “Procedures for Handling Inquiries Regarding the Need for an Investigational Device Exemptions Application for Research Involving Medical Devices” at www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/blue-ide-d01-1.html\n\nThe IRB should consider the following in determining whether a device study poses a SR or NSR:\n\nthe sponsor\'s description of why the study is not SR\n\nwhether the proposed NSR research study meets the definition of ""significant risk"" (see above)\n\nthe proposed use of the device as well as any protocol related procedures and tests, not just the device (test article) alone. (This process is different from the IRB review process found at 21 CFR 56.111(a)(2)).)\n\nadditional information from the sponsor, if needed.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.3.1 C. Exempt Studies\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 812.2(b), sponsors and investigators of certain studies are exempt from the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812, with the exception of SS812.119 (disqualification of a clinical investigator). Examples of exempt studies are consumer preference testing, testing of a device modification, or testing of two or more devices in commercial distribution if the testing does not collect safety or effectiveness data, or put subjects at risk.4\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 CFR 812.2(c)(4).\n\nStudies of an already cleared medical device in which the device is used or investigated in accordance with the indications in the cleared labeling are exempt from Part 812.5 Note: Studies of a cleared device for a new use must comply with the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations. Similarly, studies of a PMA approved device are exempt from the IDE requirements if the device is being studied for the indications in the approved labeling.\n\nFootnote 5: See 21 CFR 812.2(c)(1) and (2).\n\nIn addition, diagnostic device studies (e.g., in vitro diagnostic studies) are exempt from the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812 under certain circumstances. The study is exempt as long as the sponsor complies with the requirements at 21 CFR 809.10(c) for labeling, and if the testing: (i) is noninvasive; (ii) does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents significant risk; (iii) does not by design or intention introduce energy into a subject; and (iv) is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure. 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3).\n\n3.2 Are IDE exempt studies subject to the requirements for informed consent and IRB review and approval under Parts 50 and 56?\n\nIf an exempt study is being conducted to collect data to support either a clinical investigation or a marketing application, then the study must comply with 21 CFR Part 50 and should comply with 21 CFR Part 56. 21 CFR 50.1(a), 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 56.101(a), 21 CFR 56.103.\n\n3.3.3 Does FDA require IRB review and approval of off-label use of a legally marketed device?\n\nNo, when a physician uses a legally marketed device outside its labeling to treat a patient and no research is being done, IRB review is not required. Note: Although not required by FDA, an IRB may still decide on its own initiative to review such use. Yes, when the off-label use of a legally marketed device is part of a research study collecting safety and effectiveness data involving human subjects, IRB review and approval is required (21 CFR 812.2(a)).\n\nFor additional information on the off-label use of devices, see the FDA Information Sheet guidance, "" \'Off-label\' and Investigational Use of Marketed Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices.""6\n\nFootnote 6: This guidance can be found at: www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/offlabel.html\n\nMust an IRB review a study conducted after submission of a (510(k)) to FDA but prior to FDA\'s decision on that submission?\n\nYes. During FDA\'s review of the premarket notification submission, the device remains an investigational product. Therefore, the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations apply. The device may not be distributed, except for investigational use, unless FDA clears the device for marketing.\n\n16 Can a physician use an unapproved device in an emergency?\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Devices Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist the research community in interpreting requirements for submitting reports of unanticipated problems, including certain adverse events reports, to the institutional review board (IRB) under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) part 56 (Institutional Review Boards), part 312 (Investigational New Drug Application), and part 812 (Investigational Device Exemptions). Specifically, the guidance provides recommendations for sponsors and investigators conducting investigational new drug (IND) trials to help them differentiate between those adverse events that are unanticipated problems that must be reported to an IRB and those that are not. The guidance also makes suggestions about how to make communicating adverse events information to IRBs more efficient.\n\nFDA developed this guidance in response to concerns raised by the IRB community, including concerns raised at a March 2005 public hearing,2 that increasingly large volumes of individual adverse event reports submitted to IRBs--often lacking in context and detail--are inhibiting, rather than enhancing, the ability of IRBs to protect human subjects.\n\nFootnote 2: Federal Register, “Reporting of Adverse Events to Institutional Review Boards; Public Hearing,” (70 FR 6693, March 21, 2005).\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nFDA regulates clinical studies authorized under sections 505(i) (drugs and biologics) and 520(g) (devices) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. All such clinical studies must be reviewed and approved by an IRB before the study is initiated, in accordance with the requirements of 21 CFR part 50 (Protection of Human Subjects), part 56 (Institutional Review Boards), and either part 312 (Investigational New Drug Application) or part 812 (Investigational Device Exemptions) (see SSSS 50.1, 56.101, 312.23(a)(1)(iv), 312.40(a), 812.2(b)(1)(ii), 812.2(c) and 812.62(a)).3 After the initial review and approval of a clinical study, an IRB must conduct continuing review of the study at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk presented by the study, but at least annually (SS 56.109(f)). The primary purpose of both initial and continuing review of the study is ""to assure the protection of the rights and welfare of the human subjects"" (SS 56.102(g)). To fulfill its obligations during the conduct of a clinical study, an IRB must have, among other things, information concerning unanticipated problems involving risk to human subjects in the study, including adverse events (AEs) that are considered unanticipated problems (SSSS 56.108(a)(3), (4), (b)).4\n\nFootnote 3: As described below, there are some differences between the requirements for investigational new drug and investigational device exemption studies, as they concern obligations to report to a reviewing IRB.\n\nFootnote 4: Unanticipated problems may be adverse events or other types of problems, i.e., adverse events are a subset of unanticipated problems.\n\nFor clinical investigations of drug and biological products conducted under an investigational new drug (IND) application, information about adverse events5 must be communicated among investigators, sponsors, and IRBs as follows:\n\nFootnote 5: The IND regulations use the term adverse effect (§ 312.64) and adverse experience (§ 312.32). These terms are interchangeable with adverse event.\n\nInvestigators are required to report promptly ""to the sponsor any adverse effect that may reasonably be regarded as caused by, or probably caused by, the drug. If the adverse effect is alarming, the investigator shall report the adverse effect immediately"" (SS 312.64(b)).\n\nSponsors are specifically required to notify all participating investigators (and FDA) in a written IND safety report of ""any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected"" and ""any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects"" (SS 312.32(c)(1)(i)(A),(B)). And, more generally, sponsors are required to ""keep each participating investigator informed of new observations discovered by or reported to the sponsor on the drug, particularly with respect to adverse effects and safe use"" (SS 312.55(b)).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nInvestigators are required to report promptly ""to the IRB... all unanticipated problems involving risks to human subjects or others,"" including adverse events that should be considered unanticipated problems (SSSS 56.108(b)(1), 312.53(c)(1)(vii), and 312.66).\n\nA critical question for studies conducted under part 312 is what adverse events should be considered unanticipated problems that merit reporting to an IRB. In the years since the IRB and IND regulations issued, changes in the conduct of clinical trials (e.g., increased use of multicenter studies, international trials) have complicated the reporting pathways for adverse event information described in the regulations. In particular, the practice of local investigators reporting individual, unanalyzed events to IRBs, including reports of events from other study sites that the investigator receives from the sponsor of a multi-center study--often with limited information and no explanation of how the event represents an unanticipated problem--has led to the submission of large numbers of reports to IRBs that are uninformative. IRBs have expressed concern that the way in which investigators and sponsors of IND studies typically interpret the regulatory requirement to inform IRBs of all ""unanticipated problems"" does not yield information about adverse events that is useful to IRBs and thus hinders their ability to ensure the protection of human subjects. This guidance is intended to help differentiate those adverse events that should be considered unanticipated problems (and thus reported to the IRB) from those that should not, thereby helping to ease the burden on IRBs and make the adverse events information they receive more informative and useful.\n\nIII Reporting AEs to IRBs in clinical trials of drug and biological products conducted under IND regulations\n\nHow to Determine If an AE is an Unanticipated Problem that Needs to Be Reported\n\nIn general, an AE observed during the conduct of a study should be considered an unanticipated problem involving risk to human subjects, and reported to the IRB, only if it were unexpected, serious, and would have implications for the conduct of the study (e.g., requiring a significant, and usually safety-related, change in the protocol such as revising inclusion/exclusion criteria or including a new monitoring requirement, informed consent, or investigator\'s brochure). An individual AE occurrence ordinarily does not meet these criteria because, as an isolated event, its implications for the study cannot be understood.\n\nMany types of AEs generally require an evaluation of their relevance and significance to the study, including an aggregate analysis of other occurrences of the same (or similar) event, before they can be determined to be an unanticipated problem involving risk to human subjects. For example, an aggregate analysis of a series of AEs that are commonly associated with the underlying disease process that the study intervention is intended to treat (e.g., deaths in a cancer trial), or that are otherwise common in the study population independent of drug exposure (e.g., cardiovascular events in an elderly population) may reveal that the event rate is higher in the drug treatment group compared to the control arm. In this case, the AE would be considered an unanticipated problem. In the absence of such a finding, the event is uninterpretable.\n--------------------\nContext title: Adverse Event Reporting to IRBs — Improving Human Subject Protection Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs'

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to provide information about FDA inspections of Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) conducted under FDA\'s Bioresearch Monitoring (BIMO) Program. This document supersedes another document, ""FDA Institutional Review Board Inspections,"" issued in September 1998, by the former Office of Health Affairs, FDA. This document has been revised to provide updated information and is being issued in accordance with the Agency\'s regulations on Good Guidance Practices (21 CFR 10.115)2.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nFootnote 2: 65 FR 56477, September 19, 2000.\nFDA regulations generally require IRB review and approval of research involving FDA regulated products (e.g., investigational drugs, biological products, and medical devices) (21 CFR Part 56).\n\nFDA developed its BIMO Program to ensure the protection of the rights, welfare, and safety of human subjects and the quality and integrity of data submitted to the Agency. Among other things, the FDA BIMO Program involves site visits to IRBs, clinical investigators, sponsors, monitors, contract research organizations, nonclinical (animal) laboratories, and bioequivalence analytical laboratories. This document addresses site visits to IRBs that review clinical investigations that are regulated by FDA under 21 USC 355(i) and 21 USC 360(j) and clinical investigations that support applications for research or marketing permits for products regulated by FDA.\n\n3 When Are IRB Inspections Conducted?\n\nFDA conducts IRB inspections to determine if IRBs are operating in compliance with current FDA regulations and statutory requirements and if the IRBs are following their own written procedures. The FDA regulations pertinent to IRBs include 21 CFR Part 50 (Protection of Human Subjects), Part 56 (Institutional Review Boards), Part 312 (Investigational New Drug Application), and Part 812 (Investigational Device Exemptions).\n\nFDA inspections of IRBs generally fall into one of two categories:\n\nperiodic, scheduled inspections to review the overall operations and procedures of the IRB.\n\nunscheduled inspections focused on the IRB\'s review of a specific clinical trial or trials. Directed inspections generally result from a complaint, clinical investigator misconduct, or safety issues pertaining to a trial or site.\n\n4 How Are IRB Inspections Conducted?\n\nFDA personnel from one of FDA\'s District Offices contact a responsible individual at the institution, usually the IRB chairperson to schedule the site visit. FDA personnel issue a notice of inspection (Form FDA 482) and present their credentials to the most responsible individual before the inspection begins. They interview appropriate people and obtain information about the IRB\'s policies and procedures. Usually, the IRB\'s performance is evaluated by tracking one or more studies that are subject to IRB review under FDA regulations. Also, the IRB\'s procedures and membership rosters are examined to determine whether they conform to current FDA regulations (21 CFR Part 56, subparts A-D). During the inspection, FDA personnel typically review and copy:\n\nRecords of IRB membership\n\nIRB procedures and guidelines\n\nMinutes of IRB meetings for the past year * Documents related to the studies given by the clinical investigator to the IRB\n\nDocuments related to the studies sent by the IRB to the clinical investigator\n\nAny other materials about these studies\n\nV What happens after an inspection?\n\nAt the end of an inspection, FDA personnel conduct an exit interview with responsible institutional and IRB representatives. At this interview, FDA personnel who conducted the inspection review and discuss the findings from the inspection and, if deficiencies are found, issue a written Form FDA 483 (Inspectional Observations; 483) to the most responsible IRB representative. The 483 describes any inspectional observations that, in the opinion of the FDA personnel conducting the inspection, represent deviations from applicable statutes and regulations. The IRB may respond to the 483 observations verbally during the exit interview and/or respond in writing after the inspection. If the IRB/responsible institution chooses to respond in writing to the deficiencies listed on the 483, the response should be directed to the FDA District Office listed in the upper left corner of the 483. A list of FDA District Offices is also posted on FDA\'s website (http://www.fda.gov/ora).\n\nFollowing the inspection, the FDA personnel who conducted the IRB inspection prepare a written Establishment Inspection Report (EIR). The EIR, 483 (if issued), copies of any materials collected during the inspection, and any IRB response are forwarded to the appropriate FDA Center for further evaluation. After this review, one of the following types of letters is typically sent from the Center to the IRB chairperson or other responsible institutional official:\n\nA letter that generally states that FDA observed no significant deviations from the regulations. Note that a letter is not always sent when FDA observes no significant deviations.\n\nAn informational or untilted letter that identifies deviations from statutes and regulations for which voluntary corrective action is sufficient. Occasionally, such letters request a response from the IRB.\n\nA Warning Letter that identifies serious deviations from applicable statutes and regulations. A Warning Letter generally requests prompt correction by the IRB and a formal written response to the Agency.\n\nLetters may also be issued in accordance with 21 CFR 56.120. In such cases, the Agency will require that the IRB or parent institution respond to the letter within a time period specified by FDA and describe the corrective actions that will be taken by the IRB or the parent institution, or both, to achieve compliance. Based on the response from the IRB or institution to these letters, FDA may schedule a reinspection to confirm the adequacy of corrective actions. In addition to issuing these letters, FDA can take other administrative actions against IRBs, or their institutions,for noncompliance with applicable statutes and regulations (21 CFR Part 56, subpart E). Until the IRB or parent institution takes appropriate corrective action, FDA may (for studies subject to FDA\'s IRB regulations):\n\nWithhold approval of new studies that are conducted at the institution or reviewed by the IRB\n\nDirect that no new subjects be added to ongoing studies\n\nTerminate ongoing studies when doing so would not endanger the subjects\n\nNotify relevant State and Federal regulatory agencies and other parties with direct interest in the Agency\'s action of the deficiencies in the operation of the IRB in instances when the apparent noncompliance creates a significant threat to the rights and welfare of human subjects\n\nThe FDA Commissioner can also begin proceedings to disqualify an IRB or the institution if the IRB has refused or repeatedly failed to comply with FDA\'s IRB regulations (21 CFR Part 56) and the noncompliance adversely affects the rights or welfare of the human subjects in a clinical investigation.\n\nVI Who can provide more information?\n\nIf, during an inspection, an IRB official has any questions the FDA personnel conducting the inspection has not answered, either the District Office Director or the contact person at the Center that assigned the inspection can be contacted. The FDA personnel conducting the inspection should be able to provide the name and telephone number of the District Office Director and the Center contact person.\n\nIn addition, the FDA Compliance Program Guidance Manual for Institutional Review Board Inspections (Program 7348.809), used by FDA to conduct these inspections, is available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/ora/cpgm/default.html#bimo.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Institutional Review Board Inspections Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'

It does not create any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist institutional review boards (IRBs), clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA\'s informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. This guidance supersedes FDA\'s guidance entitled ""A Guide to Informed Consent,"" issued in September 1998, and finalizes FDA\'s draft guidance entitled ""Informed Consent Information Sheet,"" issued in July 2014. This document is structured to first present general guidance on FDA\'s regulatory requirements for informed consent and a discussion of the roles of IRBs, clinical investigators, sponsors, and FDA related to informed consent, followed by a series of frequently asked questions.\n\nIn a final rule published on January 19, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal departments and agencies revised the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects. The final rule became effective in 2018 (codified for HHS at 45 CFR 46, subpart A; ""the 2018 Common Rule"").2,3 The 2018 Common Rule sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by federal departments or agencies that have adopted the Common Rule. The revisions include significant changes to the provisions regarding informed consent. FDA is currently engaged in notice and comment rulemaking to harmonize its human subject protection\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nof the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Summary of the Consent process\n\nTo many, the term informed consent is mistakenly viewed as synonymous with obtaining a subject\'s signature on the consent form;9 however, obtaining documentation of a subject\'s informed consent is only part of the consent process. Informed consent involves providing a prospective subject, or their legally authorized representative (LAR), with adequate information to allow for an informed decision about participation in the clinical investigation prior to enrollment. Informed consent also involves facilitating the prospective subject\'s understanding of the information, providing adequate opportunity for the prospective subject to ask questions and to consider whether to participate, obtaining the prospective subject\'s voluntary agreement to participate prior to enrollment, and continuing to provide information as the clinical investigation progresses or as the enrolled subject or situation requires.10\n\nFootnote 9: In this guidance document, the terms informed consent form and informed consent document are used interchangeably.\n\nExcept as provided in 21 CFR 50.23 and 50.24,11 (see section III.A.1, ""Exceptions to Informed Consent""), no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in FDA-regulated research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s LAR (21CFR 50.20).12 To be legally effective, the informed consent process must satisfy the general requirements under 21 CFR 50.20 and include the relevant elements of informed consent described at 21 CFR 50.25 (see section3), ""FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion"").\n\nFootnote 12: As described in guidance, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances, with respect to its current regulations governing the requirement for informed consent when human specimens are used for FDA-regulated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device investigations. See “Guidance on Informed Consent for in Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable: Guidance for Sponsors, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff”, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-informed- Consent-vitro-diagnostic-device-studies-using-leftover-human-specimens-are-not\n\nFDA considers advertising used to recruit subjects into the clinical trial to be the start of the ongoing consent process, and the information provided in any online or hard copy recruitment materials should be consistent with the informed consent document. Generally, FDA recommends that any advertisement to recruit subjects be limited to the information the prospective subjects need to determine their interest and potential eligibility. The FDA information sheet ""Recruiting Study Subjects"" includes information regarding scripts for those who will interface with subjects to determine basic eligibility.13\n\nFootnote 13: See the FDA Information Sheet “Recruiting Study Subjects,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects, for further information.\n\nOnce a prospective subject is identified, and before research activities requiring prior consent occur, a person knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and capable of answering questions raised by the prospective subject should conduct a consent discussion. The consent discussion and the consent form must contain information to allow prospective subjects to make an informed decision about participation in a clinical investigation and provide an opportunity for prospective subjects to ask questions about the clinical investigation and the information in the consent document (see section3), ""FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion"") (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25).14 The consent form serves several purposes, including helping to ensure that prospective subjects receive the required information, providing a ""take home"" reminder of the elements of the clinical investigation, providing contact information in case additional questions or concerns arise, and documenting prospective subjects\' voluntary agreement to participate as well as the date of their agreement.\n\nFootnote 14: The regulations allow use of a “short form” consent form when the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For a discussion of the short form written consent, see section3.5.4.2, “Short Form.”\n\nThe informed consent process is an ongoing exchange of information throughout a subject\'s participation in a clinical trial and does not end after the consent form is signed. For example, if new safety information or protocol changes occur during the conduct of the study, additional information may need to be given to the subject, and/or the subject may need additional opportunities to ask questions and receive answers throughout the clinical investigation (see sectionIII.3.5, ""Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects,"" and Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nIII FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b ""Short Form"" for more details). If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For ""applicable clinical trials"" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, “Element of Informed Consent for ‘Applicable Clinical Trials.”\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nSponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/sponsor-investigator-irb-interrelationship). Office of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nThe interrelationship and interaction between the research sponsor (e.g., drug, biologic and device manufacturers), the clinical investigator and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) may be very complex. The regulations do not prohibit direct sponsor-IRB contacts, although, the sponsor-IRB interaction customarily occurs through the investigator who conducts the clinical study. The clinical investigator generally provides the communication link between the IRB and the sponsor. Such linkage is agreed to by the sponsors and investigators when they sign forms FDA-1571 and FDA-1572, respectively, for drug and biologic studies or an investigator agreement for device studies. There are occasions when direct communication between the IRB and the sponsor may facilitate resolution of concerns about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The clinical investigator should be kept apprised of the discussion.\n\nSponsor Assurance that IRBs Operate in Compliance with 21 CFR Part 56\n\nFDA regulations [21 CFR 312.23(a)(1)(iv)] require that a sponsor assure the FDA that a study will be conducted in compliance with the informed consent and IRB regulations [21 CFR parts 50 and 56]. This requirement has been misinterpreted to mean that it is a sponsor\'s obligation to determine IRB compliance with the regulations. This is not the case. Sponsors should rely on the clinical investigator, who assures the sponsor on form FDA-1572 for drugs and biologics or the investigator agreement for devices that the study will be reviewed by an IRB. Because clinical investigators work directly with IRBs, it is appropriate that they assure the sponsor that the IRB is functioning in compliance with the regulations.\n\nAn IRB must notify an investigator in writing of its decision to approve, disapprove or request modifications in a proposed research activity [21 CFR 56.109(e)]. This correspondence should be made available to the sponsor by the clinical investigator. In the Agency\'s view, this required documentation provides the sponsor with reasonable assurance that an IRB complies with 21 CFR part 56 and that it will be responsible for initial and continuing review of the study. Also, the sponsor and, in fact, anyone who is interested, mayobtain an Establishment Inspection Report from an FDA inspection of an IRB. These reports summarize the conditions observed during the IRB inspection. FDA, however, does not certify IRBs.\n\nSponsor Access to Medical Records\n\nThe IRB is responsible for ensuring that informed consent documents include the extent to which the confidentiality of medical records will be maintained [21 CFR 50.25(a)(5)]. FDA requires sponsors (or research monitors hired by them) to monitor the accuracy of the data submitted to FDA in accordance with regulatory requirements. These data are generally in the possession of the clinical investigator. Each subject must be advised during the informed consent process of the extent to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained and of the possibility that the FDA may inspect the records. While FDA access to medical records is a regulatory requirement, subject names are not usually requested by FDA unless the records of particular individuals require a more detailed study of the cases, or unless there is reason to believe that the records do not represent actual cases studied or actual results obtained. The consent document should list all other entities (e.g., the sponsor) who will have access to records identifying the subject. The extent to which confidentiality will be maintained may affect a subject\'s decision to participate in a clinical investigation.\n\nConfidentiality of Sponsor Information\n\nThe IRB\'s primary responsibility with respect to protecting confidentiality is to the research subject. IRBs should, however, respect the sponsor\'s need to maintain confidentiality of certain information about products under development. IRB members and staff should be aware that information submitted for review may be confidential, trade secret, and of commercial interest and should recognize the need for maintaining the confidentiality of the review materials and IRB records. It is advisable for IRBs to have policies that address this issue.\n\nNonsignificant Risk Device Studies\n\n""A sponsor\'s preliminary determination that a medical device study presents an NSR is subject to IRB approval."" The effect of the IRB\'s NSR decision is important to research sponsors and investigators because significant risk (SR) studies require sponsors to file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with FDA before they may begin. NSR studies, however, may begin as soon as the IRB approves the study. The sponsor, usually through the clinical investigator, provides the IRB with information necessary to make a judgment on the risk of a device study. While the investigational plan and supporting materials usually contain sufficient information to make a determination, the IRB can request additional information if needed [21 CFR 812.150(b)(10)]. If the IRB believes that additional information is needed, it may contact the sponsor directly, but it should keep the clinical investigator apprised of the request. While making the SR/NSR determination, any of the three parties may ask FDA to provide a risk assessment. See FDA Information Sheet: ""Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies"" for further information.\n\nDisagreements\n\nThe sponsor may choose not to conduct, to terminate, or to discontinue studies that do not conform with the sponsor\'s wishes. For example, the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB may reach an impasse about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The FDA will not mediate such disagreements. The Agency\'s policy of decentralized ethical review of clinical investigations allows such decisions to be made by local IRBs, and any disagreements between a sponsor, IRB, and clinical investigator should be resolved through appropriate communication among those parties.\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) - Specific Electronic Submissions Intended For FDA\'s Dockets Management Staff (i.e., Citizen Pettitions, Draft Proposed Guidance Documents, Variances, and other administrative record submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management Food and Drug Administration 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061 Rockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\n[] Search for FDA Guidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Investigational plan - sponsor\'s overall plan regarding the conduct of an investigational study. It includes, but is not limited to, the purpose of the study, a written protocol, a risk analysis, device description, labeling, written monitoring procedures, informed consent materials, and Institutional Review Board (IRB) information. (21 CFR 812.25.) For IVD studies, protocols should describe the study objectives, design, methodology, subject populations, types of specimens, data to be collected and planned data analysis.\n\nInvestigational Use in vitro diagnostic (IVD) product - an IVD product being used for product testing prior to full commercial marketing (e.g., for use on specimens derived from humans to compare the usefulness of the product with other products or procedures in current use or recognized as useful). These products must be labeled according to 21 CFR 812.5 for non-significant risk or significant risk devices and according to 21 CFR 809.10(c)(2)(ii) for devices that are exempt under 21 CFR 812.2(c).\n\nInvestigator - an individual who actually conducts a clinical investigation, i.e., a person under whose immediate direction the investigational product is administered, dispensed, or used, provided that the investigation involves a subject. In the event of an investigation conducted by a team of individuals, the investigator is the responsible leader of that team (21 CFR 812.3(i)).\n\nIn vitro diagnostic (IVD) products - those reagents, instruments, and systems intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, including a determination of the state of health, in order to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease or its sequelae. Such products are intended for use in the collection, preparation, and examination of specimens taken from the human body. IVD products are devices as defined in section 201(h) of the Act and may also be biological products subject to section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. The regulatory definition of in vitro diagnostic products is found in 21 CFR 809.3(a).\n\nLeftover specimens -- remnants of specimens collected for routine clinical care or analysis that would otherwise have been discarded, or remnants of specimens previously collected for other unrelated research. These specimens may be obtained from a specimen repository -- a common site for storage of collections of human biological specimens available for study. See also Excess samples.\n\nNon-significant risk (NSR) device - a device that does not meet the definition of significant risk (SR) device (see definition below). An IDE is considered approved for a NSR investigational device study once sponsors meet the abbreviated requirements found in the ""Investigational Device Exemptions"" regulation at 21 CFR 812.2(b). The risk determination for an investigational device study should be based on the proposed use of the device in the investigation in addition to the characteristics of the device.\n\nOutlier - a data observation whose value appears to be out of line with the main body of data that has been collected.\n\nPre-amendment in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests - IVD tests that were in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976.\n\nPrecision - the closeness of agreement between independent diagnostic test results obtained under stipulated conditions. For additional information refer to the Harmonized Technology Database, Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, available at\n\nhttp://www.clsi.org.\n\nPremarket Approval Application (PMA) - the application for approval required prior to the marketing of most Class III medical devices (section 515 of the Act, 21 U.S.C.\n\n360e). (See definitions of Class I, II, and III devices above.) PMA approval is based on a determination by FDA that the applicant\'s submission provides sufficient valid scientific evidence to provide reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The PMA regulation is 21 CFR Part 814. PMA information is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYour\n\nDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketApprovalPMA/default.htm.\n\nPremarket Notification - also referred to as a 510(k), is a submission to FDA that contains information to demonstrate that a device is substantially equivalent (SE) to a legally marketed (predicate) device. Governing regulations regarding premarket notification procedures are found in Subpart E of the ""Establishment Registration and Device Listing for Manufacturers and Initial Importers of Devices"" regulation (21 CFR Part 807).

It may also contain information regarding the planned data analysis and study monitoring. For most studies in the development of an IVD product, it also contains information regarding types of specimens and subject populations.\n\nReserved samples - see excess samples.\n\nSensitivity - the probability that a diagnostic test will yield a positive result when the disease or the target analyte is present.\n\nSignificant risk (SR) device - an investigational device that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject and:\n\nis intended as an implant;\n\nis purported or represented to be for use in supporting or sustaining human life;\n\nis for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health; or\n\notherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n\nThe risk determination for an investigational device study should be based on the proposed use of the device in the investigation in addition to the device characteristics. Sponsors of significant risk device studies must apply to FDA for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) (see definition above). (21 CFR 812.3(a), 812.3(m); 812.20.)\n\nSimulated specimens - specimens made in the laboratory by adding the analyte of interest in known concentrations to a medium that simulates the natural matrix.\n\nSpecificity - the probability that a diagnostic test will yield a negative result when the disease or target analyte is absent.\n\nSponsor - a person who initiates, but who does not actually conduct, the investigation, i.e., the investigational device is administered, dispensed, or used under the immediate direction of another individual. A person other than an individual that uses one or more of its own employees to conduct an investigation that it has initiated is a sponsor, not a sponsor-investigator (see next definition), and the employees are investigators (see definition above) (21 CFR 812.3(n)).\n\nSponsor-investigator - an individual who both initiates and actually conducts, alone or with others, an investigation, i.e., under whose immediate direction the investigational device is administered, dispensed, or used. The term does not include any person other than an individual. The obligations of a sponsor-investigator include both those of an investigator and those of a sponsor (21 CFR 812.3(o)).\n\nStatistical hypothesis - a statement about some state of nature that a proposed study or set of studies will either accept or reject on the basis of the experimental data. The hypothesis is usually broken down into a null hypothesis (a statement of what the testing results will hopefully reject) and an alternative hypothesis (a statement of what the testing results will hopefully accept).\n\nStudy - as used in this document, covers the systematic evaluations conducted in the development of an IVD product, including the feasibility, analytical assessments, method comparison, and evaluations to determine clinical utility of a product.\n\nSubject - a human who participates in an investigation, either as an individual on whom or on whose specimen an investigational device is used or as a control. A subject may be in normal health or may have a medical condition or disease (21 CFR 812.3(p)).\n\nSurplus samples - see excess samples.\n\nTransitional device - a product defined as a device as of May 28, 1976, but previously considered by FDA to be a new drug or an antibiotic drug (21 CFR 812.3(r)).\n\nTreatment IDE - use of an unapproved investigational device for the treatment or diagnosis of patients during the clinical trial or prior to final FDA action on the marketing application, if during the course of the clinical trial the data suggest that the device is effective. A treatment IDE may cover a large number of patients that exceeds the number of clinical sites and patients stipulated in the original IDE. The device must be for treatment or diagnosis of a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition; there must be no comparable or satisfactory alternative device or therapy available; the device must be under investigation in a controlled clinical study for the same use under an approved IDE, or such clinical studies have been completed; and the sponsor must be actively pursuing marketing approval or clearance of the device. Requirements for an application for a treatment IDE are found in the Investigational Device Exemptions regulation at 21 CFR 812.36.\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff']","['An NSR device is an investigational device that does not meet the definition of a significant risk device. If an IRB finds that an investigational medical device study poses a NSR, the sponsor does not need to submit an IDE to FDA before starting the study. If the IRB determines that the proposed study is an NSR study, the IRB may proceed to review the study under 21 CFR 56.109 and 21 CFR 56.111.

42,"Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?","['--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: Can the study director authorize changes in the SOPs? No. Approval of the SOPs and changes thereto is a function of laboratory management.\n\nHow many copies of the complete laboratory SOPs are needed? Each work station should have access to the SOPs applicable to the work performed at the station. A complete set of the SOPs, including authorized amendments, should be maintained in the archives.\n\nWho approves the SOPs of the Quality Assurance Unit? Laboratory Management.\n\nTo what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs? The GLPs do not specify the contents of individual SOPs, but the SOP that deals with computerized data acquisition should include the purpose of the program, the specifications, the procedures, the end products, the language, the interactions with other programs, procedures for assuring authorized data entry and access, procedures for making and authorizing changes to the program, the source listing of the program and perhaps even a flow chart. The laboratory\'s computer specialists should determine what other characteristics need to be described in the SOP.\n\nSection 58.83 Reagents and solutions.\n1. What are the GLP requirements for labeling of reagents purchased directly from manufacturers? All reagents used in a nonclinical laboratory have to be labeled to indicate identity, titer or concentration, storage requirements, and expiration date. Purchased reagents usually carry all these items except for the expiration date, so the laboratory should label the reagent containers with an expiration date. The expiration date selected should be in line with laboratory experience and need not require specific stability testing.\n2. How extensive should the procedures be for confirming the quality of incoming reagents used in nonclinical laboratory studies? Laboratory management should make this decision but the SOPs should document the actual procedures used.\n\nDo the procedures used for preparing the S9 activator fraction (liver microsomal fraction from rats challenged with a toxin) have to be performed in accord with the GLPs? No. The GLPs consider the S9 activator fraction to be a reagent. Therefore, it must be labeled properly, stored properly, tested prior to use in accord with adequate SOPs, and it can not be used if its potency is below established specifications.\n\nDo the GLPs require the use of product accountability procedures for reagents and chemicals used in a nonclinical laboratory study? No. Section 58.90 Animal care.\n\nCan diseased animals received from a supplier be diagnosed, treated, certified ""well"" and then entered into a nonclinical laboratory study? The GLPs provide for this procedure by including provisions directed towards animal quarantine and isolation. The question of whether such animals can be entered into a study, however, is a scientific one that should be answered by the veterinarian-in-charge and the study director and other scientists involved in the study.\n\nDo the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies? No. Again, the question is a scientific one and the potential impact of multiple use on study interpretation should be carefully assessed.\n\nIs a photocopy of an animal purchase order which has been signed and dated by the individual receiving the shipment sufficient proof of animal receipt? Yes, but actual shipping tickets are also acceptable.\n\nDoes FDA have guidelines for animal bedding? No, but the GLPs prohibit the use of bedding which can interfere with the objectives of the study.\n\nDoes FDA permit the sterilization of animal feed with ethylene oxide. No.\n\nFor certain test systems (timed-pregnant rodents), it is not possible to use long quarantine periods. Do the GLPs specify quarantine periods for each test system? No. The quarantine period can be established by the veterinarian in charge of animal care and should be of sufficient length to permit evaluation of health status.\n\nHow are feed and water contaminants to be dealt with? The protocol should include a positive statement as to the need for conducting feed analysis for contaminants. If analysis is necessary, the identities and specifications for the contaminants should be listed. The need for analysis as well as the specifications should be determined by the study scientists. Water contaminants can be handled similarly.\n\nHow is the adequacy of bedding materials to be handled? This can be handled as are the analyses for possible contaminants in feed and water. The study director and associated scientists should consider the bedding and its possible impact on the study. The results of this consideration should appear in the protocol.\n\nWhat do the GLPs require in regard to assuring the genetic quality of animals used in a nonclinical laboratory study? This is a scientific issue that is not specifically addressed by the GLPs. Suitability of the test system for use in a study is a protocol matter and any required testing procedure should be arrived at by the study scientists.\n\nDo the GLPs require specific procedures for the microbiological monitoring of animals used in nonclinical laboratory studies? The procedures used should be in accord with acceptable veterinary medical practice.\n\nThe Japanese are preparing animal care guidelines which are similar but not identical to the U.S. guidelines prepared by NIH. Would these be acceptable? Japanese guidelines that are similar, but no less stringent, in the important particulars with the NIH guidelines would be acceptable to FDA.\n\nJapanese guidelines that are similar, but no less stringent, in the important particulars with the NIH guidelines would be acceptable to FDA.\n12. What is the frequency of feed contaminant analysis? If contaminant analyses are required by the protocol, then the GLPs require periodic analysis of the feed to ensure that the contaminant level is at or below that judged to be acceptable. Statistical procedures should be used to determine the frequency of analysis since this is dependent on the specific chemical characteristics of the interfering contaminant.\n13. It is necessary to use ""official"" methods of analysis to determine the levels of interfering contaminants? No. The methods should be appropriate for the analysis and FDA reserves the right to examine the raw data supporting the analytical results.\n14. Do the GLPs require production facilities to be dedicated to the manufacture of specific animal feeds used in nonclinical laboratory studies? No.\n15. Is a separate room required for animal necropsy? No. The GLPs require separate areas and/or rooms as necessary to prevent any activity from having an adverse effect on the study. If the necropsy is done in an animal room, precautions should be taken to minimize disturbances that may interfere with the study.\n\nSUBPART F TEST AND CONTROL ARTICLES\n\nSection 58.105 Test and control article characterization.\n\nIs it necessary to retain samples of feed from nonclinical laboratory studies in which the feed serves as the control article? Yes. It is not necessary, however, to retain reserve samples of feed from studies that involve test article administration by routes other than feed.\n\nWhat expiration date is placed on the label of test articles whose stability is being assessed concurrently with the conduct of the study?\n\nIn this situation, the stability of the test article is unknown, but periodic analysis data exist. The label should contain a statement such as ""see protocol"" or ""see periodic analysis results"" so that test article users will know that current analytical data should be examined prior to continued use of the test article.\n3. If analysis of the reserve samples is required by the Study Director or the QAU, is it permitted?\n\nYes, but sufficient reserve sample should be retained so that the sample is not exhausted.\n4. Are physical and chemical tests conducted on test articles required to be done under the GLPs?\n\nAccording to section 58.105, such tests conducted to characterize the specific batch of test article used in the nonclinical laboratory study are covered.\n\nSection 58.107 Test and control article handling.\n\nWith regard to safety studies in large animals (cattle, horses, etc.), must test article accountability be maintained and can the animals be used for food purposes?\n\nTest article accountability must be maintained. For guidance on whether the treated animals can be used for food, you should contact the appropriate individuals in the Bureau of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nSection 58.113 Mixtures of articles with carriers.\n\nDo the GLPs require tests for homogeneity, concentration, and stability on mixtures of control articles used as positive controls?\n\nYes.\n2. Do test or control article concentration assays have to be performed on each batch of test or control article carrier mixture?\n\nNo. The GLPs require only periodic analysis of test or control article carrier mixtures.\n\nWhat is the purpose of periodic analysis requirement for test or control article mixtures? This requirement provides additional assurance that the test system is being exposed to protocol-specified quantities of test article. Whereas, in most instances proper assurance is obtained through adequate uniformity-of-mixing studies, adequate SOPs, and trained personnel, occasionally the mixing equipment can malfunction or other uncontrollable events can occur which lead to improper dosages. These events can be recognized through periodic analysis.\n\nFor acute studies, does the test article carrier mixture have to be analyzed (single dose studies)? Yes, but the analysis need not be done prior to the study provided the mixture is stable in storage.\n\nFor liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Questions and Answers'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: SOP Version Control: SOPs should define how variant information is aggregated, curated, and evaluated. These SOPs should be documented and versioned. Changes to SOPs should be clearly documented with sufficiently detailed information regarding the change accompanied by any necessary explanation to ensure all stakeholders understand any limitations created by or implications of the change in procedure. To maintain quality variant assertions and ensure that genetic variant database operations keep pace with advances in technology and scientific knowledge, operations and SOPs should be reviewed at least annually.\n\nData Preservation: FDA recommends that genetic variant database administrators have processes in place for assessing overall database stability and architecture and for ensuring that data linkages are properly maintained. When a genetic variant database contains linkages to secondary databases, the genetic variant database administrator should have predefined processes in place to recognize changes to the secondary databases and account for them in version control of the primary database. FDA recommends genetic variant database administrators back-up the database on a regular basis so that it can be reinstated as necessary.\n\nGenetic variant database administrators should have a plan in place to ensure database content and processes are preserved in the event a genetic variant database ceases operations permanently or temporarily (e.g., a database loses funding, infrastructure upgrades). A location to deposit data, including versioning information and supporting SOPs and documentation, in the event that the genetic variant database ceases operation should be identified.\n\nSecurity and Privacy: Genetic variant database operations must be in compliance with all applicable federal laws and regulations (e.g., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, the Privacy Act, the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (""Common Rule""), etc.) regarding protected health information, patient privacy, research involving human subjects, and data security, as applicable. The genetic database administrator should identify the applicable laws and regulations to assure that any requirements are addressed and transparently documented. Genetic variant database administrators should also put in place adequate security measures to ensure the protection and privacy of personally identifiable information and protected health information and provide training for database staff on security and privacy protection.\n\nData formats and nomenclature: To facilitate genetic variant database use for regulatory purposes and to help assure the accuracy and quality of variant assertions, genetic variant database administrators should employ commonly accepted data formats and identify which format is used by the genetic database. Furthermore, genetic variant databases should use consistent nomenclature that is widely accepted by the genomics community for gene names and/or symbols, genomic coordinates, variants, described clinical and functional characteristics, and classifications. The genetic variant database administrator should also make available a description of which nomenclature is used to allow FDA and external users to accurately understand the information presented. This standardization will help minimize ambiguity regarding variants and better enable comparisons of variant assertions between different databases or other entities.\n\nAppendix B Data Quality\n\nIt is essential that the data regarding genotypes and phenotypes or clinical information placed into the genetic variant database are of sufficient quality and based on current scientific knowledge in order for there to be a reasonable assurance that the assertions made linking specific genetic variants to diseases or conditions are accurate.\n\nMetadata: Variant data in the genetic variant database should be accompanied by metadata appropriate to the type of variant. To the extent possible or applicable, this metadata should include information about the analytical performance of the test used to detect the variant, including the number of independent laboratories and/or studies reporting the variant, name of the laboratory(ies) that reported the variant, the name of the test used to detect the variant, and details of the technical characteristics of the test that was used (e.g., reference sequence version or build, instrument, software, bioinformatics tools, etc.). For germline variants, metadata should also include, to the extent possible, variant characteristics (which could include but is not limited to, patient ethnicity, zygosity, phasing, and segregation). For somatic variants, metadata should include, to the extent possible, additional information about the context in which the variant was detected (which could include but is not limited to, variant allele frequency, tumor only versus tumor-normal matched sequencing, cellularity). For cases in which multiple genetic variants factor into determining the overall risk of developing a disease or condition, database administrators should include any multivariant or polygenic scoring methods used in the metadata. As applicable, database administrators should also include as much information as is available regarding the contribution of environmental exposures to the development of a genotype-associated disease or condition.\n\nGenetic variant databases should clearly and transparently document evidence source(s) used to support variant assertions (e.g., literature, well-documented case histories). As discussed in Section IV.A., database administrators should take into consideration applicable security and privacy requirements when collecting and reporting this metadata.\n\nData Uniqueness: Genetic variant database operations should also include methods to ensure that individual data points (e.g., a variant from one individual for a particular phenotype) are not represented more than once in the database.\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nVariant Evaluation: Written SOPs for variant evaluation, including evaluation of data from clinical practice guidelines, peer-reviewed literature, and pre-curated knowledge bases, should be available to the public for review. SOPs should generally include validated protocols for evaluation. All genetic variant database evaluation rules, and future modifications of those rules, should be explained and made available to the public. Furthermore, if variant assertions from other sources are to be integrated into the genetic variant database, then the evaluation processes and data quality of those outside sources should be clearly identified and audited by the database administrator on a regular basis.\n\nFDA believes that each variant evaluation should be performed by at least two qualified and trained professionals to lessen the risk that any single assertion could be incorrectly made. In cases where it is not feasible for a database administrator to have two independent professionals evaluating the same variant, there should be other ways to mitigate the risk of an incorrect assertion (e.g., multiple levels of review, use of curator training modules). Furthermore, genetic variant databases should have SOPs for resolving internal differences in evaluation. Providing SOPs publicly for each of these activities will facilitate outside users review of the evidence used in variant evaluation.\n\nFDA believes that use of publicly available and validated protocols for variant evaluation is important to assuring that assertions from genetic variant databases constitute valid scientific evidence supporting the clinical validity of a test. FDA reviewers evaluate evidence in the context of a test\'s intended use and conditions of use,3 including specific facts about genes or diseases under consideration (e.g., population incidence of a disease, variant incidence, relationship of a variant with respect to ethnicity or haplotype) in their review. Similarly, such factors should be incorporated into a finalized protocol.\n\nFootnote 3: Section 513(a)(2) of the FD&C Act; 21 CFR 860.7(e)(1).\n\nAssertions: The types of evidence used for evaluating variants, and their corresponding strengths, should be defined and combined in a protocol. Generally, these protocols should meet the following recommendations:\n\nProtocols should incorporate multiple lines of scientific evidence, where available, and appropriately weigh each line of evidence.\n\nProtocols should use a tiered system of assertions (e.g., pathogenic, likely pathogenic) and adequately describe the meanings of each tier.\n\nProtocols should incorporate unique details of the gene/disease or condition being evaluated, where available or applicable.\n\nProtocols should be validated.\n\nAll protocols and details supporting each variant assertion should be made available to the public.\n\nAssertions within a genetic variant database should be appropriate to the level of certainty and the nature of the genotype-phenotype relationship, as well as be adequately supported.\n\nAssertions should report known variant associations with respect to ethnicity or haplotype, when relevant. Assertions should be versioned, such that changes in assertions over time are identified and maintained. Genetic variant databases should also have mechanisms in place to receive feedback about individual variant assertions (e.g., ability for users to report that there is new or contradictory evidence available regarding a variant assertion) and processes to document, evaluate, and resolve, if necessary, such discordances.\n--------------------\nContext title: Use of Public Human Genetic Variant Databases to Support Clinical Validity for Genetic and Genomic-Based In Vitro Diagnostics Guidance for Stakeholders and Food and Drug Administration Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: Test procedures, test data, and test results should be documented in a manner permitting objective pass/fail decisions to be reached. They should also be suitable for review and objective decision making subsequent to running the test, and they should be suitable for use in any subsequent regression testing. Errors detected during testing should be logged, classified, reviewed, and resolved prior to release of the software. Software error data that is collected and analyzed during a development life cycle may be used to determine the suitability of the software product for release for commercial distribution. Test reports should comply with the requirements of the corresponding test plans.\n\nSoftware products that perform useful functions in medical devices or their production are often complex. Software testing tools are frequently used to ensure consistency, thoroughness, and efficiency in the testing of such software products and to fulfill the requirements of the planned testing activities. These tools may include supporting software built in-house to facilitate unit (module) testing and subsequent integration testing (e.g., drivers and stubs) as well as commercial software testing tools. Such tools should have a degree of quality no less than the software product they are used to develop. Appropriate documentation providing evidence of the validation of these software tools for their intended use should be maintained (see section 6 of this guidance).\n\nTypical Tasks - Testing by the Software Developer\n\nTest Planning\n\nStructural Test Case Identification\n\nFunctional Test Case Identification\n\nUnit (Module) Tests to Detailed Design\n\nIntegration Tests to High Level Design\n\nSystem Tests to Software Requirements\n\nUnit (Module) Test Execution\n\nIntegration Test Execution\n\nFunctional Test Execution\n\nSystem Test Execution\n\nAcceptance Test Execution\n\nTest Results Evaluation\n\nError Evaluation/Resolution\n\nFinal Test Report\n\nUser Site Testing\n\nTesting at the user site is an essential part of software validation. The Quality System regulation requires installation and inspection procedures (including testing where appropriate) as well as documentation of inspection and testing to demonstrate proper installation. (See 21 CFR SS820.170.) Likewise, manufacturing equipment must meet specified requirements, and automated systems must be validated for their intended use. (See 21 CFR SS820.70(g) and 21 CFR SS820.70(i) respectively.)\n\nTerminology regarding user site testing can be confusing. Terms such as beta test, site validation, user acceptance test, installation verification, and installation testing have all been used to describe user site testing. For purposes of this guidance, the term ""user site testing"" encompasses all of these and any other testing that takes place outside of the developer\'s controlled environment. This testing should take place at a user\'s site with the actual hardware and software that will be part of the installed system configuration. The testing is accomplished through either actual or simulated use of the software being tested within the context in which it is intended to function.\n\nGuidance contained here is general in nature and is applicable to any user site testing. However, in some areas (e.g., blood establishment systems) there may be specific site validation issues that need to be considered in the planning of user site testing. Test planners should check with the FDA Center(s) with the corresponding product jurisdiction to determine whether there are any additional regulatory requirements for user site testing.\n\nUser site testing should follow a pre-defined written plan with a formal summary of testing and a record of formal acceptance. Documented evidence of all testing procedures, test input data, and test results should be retained.\n\nThere should be evidence that hardware and software are installed and configured as specified. Measures should ensure that all system components are exercised during the testing and that the versions of these components are those specified. The testing plan should specify testing throughout the full range of operating conditions and should specify continuation for a sufficient time to allow the system to encounter a wide spectrum of conditions and events in an effort to detect any latent faults that are not apparent during more normal activities.\n\nSome of the evaluations that have been performed earlier by the software developer at the developer\'s site should be repeated at the site of actual use. These may include tests for a high volume of data, heavy loads or stresses, security, fault testing (avoidance, detection, tolerance, and recovery), error messages, and implementation of safety requirements. The developer may be able to furnish the user with some of the test data sets to be used for this purpose.\n\nIn addition to an evaluation of the system\'s ability to properly perform its intended functions, there should be an evaluation of the ability of the users of the system to understand and correctly interface with it. Operators should be able to perform the intended functions and respond in an appropriate and timely manner to all alarms, warnings, and error messages.\n\nDuring user site testing, records should be maintained of both proper system performance and any system failures that are encountered. The revision of the system to compensate for faults detected during this user site testing should follow the same procedures and controls as for any other software change.\n\nThe developers of the software may or may not be involved in the user site testing. If the developers are involved, they may seamlessly carry over to the user\'s site the last portions of design-level systems testing. If the developers are not involved, it is all the more important that the user have persons who understand the importance of careful test planning, the definition of expected test results, and the recording of all test outputs.\n\nTypical Tasks - User Site Testing\n\n(\\bullet) Acceptance Test Execution\n\n(\\bullet) Test Results Evaluation\n\n(\\bullet) Error Evaluation/Resolution\n\n(\\bullet) Final Test Report\n\nMaintenance and Software Changes\n\nAs applied to software, the term maintenance does not mean the same as when applied to hardware. The operational maintenance of hardware and software are different because their failure/error mechanisms are different. Hardware maintenance typically includes preventive hardware maintenance actions, component replacement, and corrective changes. Software maintenance includes corrective, perfective, and adaptive maintenance but does not include preventive maintenance actions or software component replacement.\n\nChanges made to correct errors and faults in the software are corrective maintenance. Changes made to the software to improve the performance, maintainability, or other attributes of the software system are perfective maintenance. Software changes to make the software system usable in a changed environment are adaptive maintenance.\n\nWhen changes are made to a software system, either during initial development or during post release maintenance, sufficient regression analysis and testing should be conducted to demonstrate that portions of the software not involved in the change were not adversely impacted. This is in addition to testing that evaluates the correctness of the implemented change(s).\n\nThe specific validation effort necessary for each software change is determined by the type of change, the development products affected, and the impact of those products on the operation of the software. Careful and complete documentation of the design structure and interrelationships of various modules, interfaces, etc., can limit the validation effort needed when a change is made. The level of effort neededto fully validate a change is also dependent upon the degree to which validation of the original software was documented and archived. For example, test documentation, test cases, and results of previous verification and validation testing need to be archived if they are to be available for performing subsequent regression testing. Failure to archive this information for later use can significantly increase the level of effort and expense of revalidating the software after a change is made.\n\nIn addition to software verification and validation tasks that are part of the standard software development process, the following additional maintenance tasks should be addressed:\n\nFor software that was previously validated, the existing software validation plan should be revised to support the validation of the revised software. If no previous software validation plan exists, such a plan should be established to support the validation of the revised software.\n\nSoftware organizations frequently maintain documentation, such as software problem reports that describe software anomalies discovered and the specific corrective action taken to fix each anomaly. Too often, however, mistakes are repeated because software developers do not take the next step to determine the root causes of problems and make the process and procedural changes needed to avoid recurrence of the problem. Software anomalies should be evaluated in terms of their severity and their effects on system operation and safety, but they should also be treated as symptoms of process deficiencies in the quality system. A root cause analysis of anomalies can identify specific quality system deficiencies. Where trends are identified (e.g., recurrence of similar software anomalies), appropriate corrective and preventive actions must be implemented and documented to avoid further recurrence of similar quality problems. (See 21 CFR 820.100.)\n\nAll problems discovered during maintenance of the software should be documented. The resolution of each problem should be tracked to ensure it is fixed, for historical reference, and for trending.\n--------------------\nContext title: General Principles of Software Validation Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 9: For purposes of this guidance, the term quality unit is synonymous with the term quality control unit. For the definition of quality control unit, see § 210.3(b)(15).\n\n3 Does each CGMP workflow on a computer system need to be validated?\n\nYes, a CGMP workflow, such as creation of an electronic master production and control record (MPCR), is an intended use of a computer system to be checked through validation (see SSSS 211.63, 211.68(b), and 211.110(a)). The extent of validation studies should be commensurate with the risk posed by the automated system. When the same system is used to perform both CGMP and non-CGMP functions, the potential for non-CGMP functions to affect CGMP operations should be assessed and mitigated appropriately.10\n\nFootnote 10: See note 8.\n\nIf you validate the computer system but you do not validate it for its intended use, you cannot know if your workflow runs correctly.11 For example, qualifying the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) platform, a computer system, ensures that it meets its relevant requirements and specifications; however, it does not demonstrate that a given MPCR generated by the MES contains the correct calculations. In this example, validating the workflow ensures that the intended steps, requirements, and calculations in the MPCR are accurate and perform properly. This is similar to reviewing a paper MPCR and ensuring all supporting procedures are in place before the MPCR is implemented in production (see SSSS 211.100, 211.186, and 212.50(b) and the guidance for industry PET Drugs--Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP)).\n\nFDA recommends you implement appropriate controls to manage risks associated with each element of the system. Controls that are appropriately designed to validate a system for its intended use address software, hardware, personnel, and documentation.\n\n4 How should access to CGMP computer systems be restricted?\n\nYou must exercise appropriate controls to assure that changes to computerized MPCRs or other CGMP records or input of laboratory data into computerized records can be made only by authorized personnel (SS 211.68(b)). Other examples of records for which control should be restricted to authorized personnel include automated visual inspection records, electronic materials management system records, and automated dispensing system weighing records. FDA recommends that you restrict the ability to alter specifications, process parameters, data, or manufacturing or testing methods by technical means where possible (e.g., by limiting permissions to change settings or data).\n\nThe system administrator role, including any rights to alter files and settings, should be assigned to personnel independent from those responsible for the record content. To assist in controlling access, it is important that manufacturers establish and implement a method for documenting authorized personnel's access privileges for each CGMP computer system in use (e.g., by maintaining a list of authorized individuals) (see SS 211.68(b)).\n\n5 Why is FDA concerned with the use of shared login accounts for computer systems?\n\nWhen login credentials are shared, a unique individual cannot be identified through the login and the system would not conform to the CGMP requirements in parts 211 and 212. FDA requires that system controls, including documentation controls, be designed in accordance with CGMP to assure product quality (e.g., SSS 211.100 and 212.50). For example, you must implement documentation controls that ensure that the actions as described in question 4 are attributable to a specific individual (see SSS 211.68(b), 211.188(b)(11), 211.194(a)(7) and (8), and 212.50(c)(10)).\n\nShared, read-only user accounts that do not allow the user to modify data or settings are acceptable for viewing data, but they do not conform with the part 211 and 212 requirements for actions, such as second person review, to be attributable to a specific individual.\n\n6 How should blank forms be controlled?\n\nThere must be document controls in place to assure product quality (see SSS 211.100, 211.160(a), 211.186, 212.20(d), and 212.60(g)). For example, bound paginated notebooks, stamped for official use by a document control group, provide good document control because they allow easy detection of unofficial notebooks as well as any gaps in notebook pages. If used, blank forms (e.g., electronic worksheets, laboratory notebooks, and MPCRs) should be controlled by the quality unit or by another document control method. As appropriate, numbered sets of blank forms may be issued and should be reconciled upon completion of all issued forms. Incomplete or erroneous forms should be kept as part of the permanent record along with written justification for their replacement (see, e.g., SSS 211.192, 211.194, 212.50(a), and 212.70(f)(1)(vi)). All data required to recreate a CGMP activity should be maintained as part of the complete record.\n\n7 Who should review audit trails?\n\nAudit trail review is similar to assessing cross-outs on paper when reviewing data. Personnel responsible for record review under CGMP should review the audit trails that capture changes to data associated with the record as they review the rest of the record (e.g., SS SS 211.22(a), 211.101(c) and (d), 211.103, 211.182, 211.186(a), 211.192, 211.194(a)(8), and 212.20(d)). For example, all production and control records, which includes audit trails, must be reviewed and approved by the quality unit (SS 211.192). The regulations provide flexibility to have some activities reviewed by a person directly supervising or checking information (e.g., SS 211.188). FDA recommends a quality system approach to implementing oversight and review of CGMP records.12\n\nFootnote 12: See guidance for industry Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical CGMP Regulations. See also guidance for industry Contract Manufacturing Arrangements for Drugs: Quality Agreements for information about auditing as it relates to contract facilities.\n\n8 How often should audit trails be reviewed?\n\nIf the review frequency for the data is specified in CGMP regulations, adhere to that frequency for the audit trail review. For example, SS 211.188(b) requires review after each significant step in manufacture, processing, packing, or holding, and SS 211.22 requires data review before batch release. In these cases, you would apply the same review frequency for the audit trail.\n\nIf the review frequency for the data is not specified in CGMP regulations, you should determine the review frequency for the audit trail using knowledge of your processes and risk assessment tools. The risk assessment should include evaluation of data criticality, control mechanisms, and impact on product quality.13\n\nFootnote 13: Risks to data include, but are not limited to, the potential to be deleted, amended, or excluded without authorization or without detection. Examples of audit trails that may be appropriate to review on a risk-based frequency include audit trails that capture instrument operational status, instrument communication logs, and alert records.\n\nYour approach to audit trail review and the frequency with which you conduct it should ensure that CGMP requirements are met, appropriate controls are implemented, and the reliability of the review is proven.\n\nSee the audit trail definition in 1.c. above for further information on audit trails.\n\n9 Can electronic copies be used as accurate reproductions of paper or electronic records?\n\nYes. Electronic copies can be used as true copies of paper or electronic records, provided the copies preserve the content and meaning of the original record, which includes all metadatarequired to reconstruct the CGMP activity and the static or dynamic nature of the original records.\n\nTrue copies of dynamic electronic records may be made and maintained in the format of the original records or in a format that allows for the content and meaning of the original records to be preserved if a suitable reader and copying equipment (e.g., software and hardware, including media readers) are readily available (SSSS 211.180(d) and 212.110).\n\nIs it acceptable to retain paper printouts or static records instead of original electronic records from stand-alone computerized laboratory instruments, such as an FT-IR instrument?\n\nA paper printout or static record may satisfy retention requirements if it is the original record or a true copy of the original record (see SSSS 211.68(b), 211.188, 211.194, and 212.60). During data acquisition, for example, pH meters and balances may create a paper printout or static record as the original record. In this case, the paper printout or static record, or a true copy, must be retained (SS 211.180).\n\nHowever, electronic records from certain types of laboratory instruments--whether stand-alone or networked--are dynamic, and a printout or a static record does not preserve the dynamic record format that is part of the complete original record. For example, the spectral file created by FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) is dynamic and can be reprocessed.\n\nHowever, a static record or printout is fixed and would not satisfy CGMP requirements to retain original records or true copies (SS 211.180(d)). Also, if the full spectrum is not displayed in the printout, contaminants may be excluded.\n\nYou must ensure that original laboratory records, including paper and electronic records, are subject to second-person review (SS 211.194(a)(8)) to make certain that all test results and associated information are appropriately reported. Similarly, in microbiology, a contemporaneous written record is maintained of the colony counts of a petri dish, and the record is then subject to second-person review.\n\nDocument control requirements in SS 211.180 pertain only to CGMP records.\n--------------------\nContext title: Data Integrity and Compliance With Drug CGMP- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry""

If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\n1 Introduction and Scope\n\nFDA seeks to encourage medical device research and innovation to address important clinical needs and improve patient care. In many cases, device development and evaluation include clinical investigation. This guidance document has been developed to facilitate the initiation of clinical investigations to evaluate medical devices under FDA's Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) regulations, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 812.\n\nFDA approval of an IDE submission allows the initiation of subject enrollment in a clinical investigation of a significant risk1 device. This guidance is intended to provide clarification regarding the regulatory implications of the decisions that FDA may render based on review of an IDE as well as a general explanation of the reasons for those decisions.\n\nFootnote 1: 21 CFR 812.3(m): A significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\n(1) Is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\n(2) Is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\n(3) Is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\n(4) Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n\nand communication of outstanding issues related to the IDE through Study Design Considerations and Future Considerations, are described in this guidance.2\n\nFDA's decision-making for IDEs was modified with passage of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) (Pub. L. No. 112-144). Section 601 of FDASIA amended Section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to specify certain situations in which FDA cannot disapprove an IDE. Section 520(g)(4)(C) of the FD&C Act states that, consistent with section 520(g)(1), FDA shall not disapprove an IDE because:\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance does not offer specific information related to the design of a clinical investigation, nor does this guidance discuss the specific content that should be provided in an IDE application. For additional information on those topics, please refer to FDA’s regulations (21 CFR Part 812) and to FDA’s “Guidance on IDE Policies and Procedures”\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm080202.htm).\n\n(i): the investigation may not support a substantial equivalence or de novo classification determination or approval of the device; (ii): the investigation may not meet a requirement, including a data requirement, relating to the approval or clearance of a device; or (iii): an additional or different investigation may be necessary to support clearance or approval of the device.\n\nHowever, the Agency recognizes that some IDE sponsors may wish to ensure that the pivotal study design may support a marketing application if it is successfully executed, meets its stated endpoints, and does not raise unforeseen safety concerns. Through mechanisms such as the Pre-Submission3 process, FDA wishes to work interactively with sponsors interested in addressing important limitations with such a study that might impair its ability to support a future marketing application.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nFootnote 3: For more information, see FDA’s Guidance “Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff - Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.”\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM311176.pdf\n\n2 IDE Decisions\n\nFDA's regulations4 provide for three FDA actions on IDE applications:\n\nFootnote 4: 21 CFR 812.30.\n\nApproval5* Approval with Conditions6\n\nDisapproval\n\nFDA must inform the sponsor7 or sponsor-investigator8 of its decision, or must notify the sponsor that the investigation may not begin, within 30 days from the date of receipt of the IDE application, or the IDE application will be deemed approved. If an IDE application is approved or approved with conditions, the sponsor may begin subject enrollment, up to the number of subjects and investigational sites specified in FDA's decision letter, upon receipt of Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, which may occur prior to FDA approval.\n\nFootnote 6: As discussed in Section 5, enrollment for an IDE application that is Approved or Approved with Conditions may in some cases be limited to a portion of the total expected enrollment (i.e., “Staged Approval”) while certain outstanding questions are answered concurrently with enrollment in the clinical investigation.\n\nFootnote 7: FDA has traditionally referred to IDE approvals that have conditions as “Conditional Approvals.” FDA believes that the term “Approval with Conditions” is more appropriate because the term conveys that the IDE has been approved and may begin without awaiting further FDA review.\n\nFootnote 8: 21 CFR 812.3(n): Sponsor means a person who initiates, but who does not actually conduct, the investigation, that is, the investigational device is administered, dispensed, or used under the immediate direction of another individual. A person other than an individual that uses one or more of its own employees to conduct an investigation that it has initiated is a sponsor, not a sponsor-investigator, and the employees are investigators.\n\nFootnote 9: The term “approval” in this document and in FDA’s communications means approval without conditions.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: If a clinical study is needed to demonstrate substantial equivalence, i.e., conducted prior to obtaining 510(k) clearance of the device, the study should generally be conducted under the Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) regulation, 21 CFR 812. Generally, we believe PTA balloon catheters and specialty catheters addressed by this guidance document are significant risk devices subject to all requirements of 21 CFR part 812. Please see the FDA guidance, ""Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies.""13 In addition to the requirements of 21 CFR part 812, sponsors of such trials must comply with the regulations governing institutional review boards (21 CFR part 56) and informed consent (21 CFR part 50). When data from clinical investigations conducted outside the United States are submitted to FDA for PTA and specialty catheters, the requirements of 21 CFR 812.28 may apply.14 21 CFR 812.28 outlines the conditions for FDA acceptance of clinical data from investigations conducted outside the US when submitted to support premarket submissions. For more information, see the FDA guidance, ""Acceptance of Clinical Data to Support Medical Device Applications and Submissions: Frequently Asked Questions.""15\n\nFootnote 13: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/significant-risk-and-nonsignificant-risk-medical-device-studies\n\nFootnote 14: Applies to data from clinical investigations that began on or after February 21, 2019 and are submitted to support a premarket submission, including IDEs, PMAs, and 510(k)s.\n\nFootnote 15: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/acceptance-clinical-data-support-medical-device-applications-and-submissions-frequently-asked\n\nFootnote 16: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-real-world-evidence-support-regulatory-decision-making-medical-devices\n\nIn some cases, ""real-world data"" (RWD) may be used to support expansion of the indication for a device for which 510(k) clearance has already been obtained. Whether the collection of RWD for a legally-marketed device requires an IDE depends on the particular facts of the situation. Specifically, if a cleared device is being used in the normal course of medical practice, an IDE would likely not be required.

Labeling for PTA balloon catheters and specialty balloons should include all applicable information, including indications, contraindications, warnings, product information, a summary of the clinical data (if applicable), and directions for use.\n\nAs prescription devices, PTA balloon and specialty catheters are exempt from having adequate directions for lay use under section 502(f)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) as long as the conditions in 21 CFR 801.109 are met. For instance, labeling must include adequate information for practitioner use of the device, including indications, effects, routes, methods, frequency and duration of administration (e.g., infusion time, inflation duration), and any relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects and precautions (21 CFR 801.109(d)).\n\nAppendix K Modifications\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3), a device change or modification ""that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device"" or represents ""a major change or modification in the intended use of the device"" requires a new 510(k).17 The changes or modifications listed below are examples of changes that may require submission of a new 510(k). Note that this list is not exhaustive but provides examples of modifications that are likely to require submission of a new 510(k). For additional details, please see FDA guidance ""Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device.""18\n\nFootnote 17: Section 3308 of the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, Title III of Division FF of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328 (“FDORA”), enacted on December 29, 2022, added section 515C “Predetermined Change Control Plans for Devices” to the FD&C Act (section 515C). Under section 515C, FDA can approve or clear a predetermined change control plan (PCCP) for a device that describes planned changes that may be made to the device and that would otherwise require a supplemental premarket approval application or premarket notification. For example, section 515C provides that a supplemental premarket approval application (section 515C(a)) or a premarket notification (section 515C(b)) is not required for a change to a device if the change is consistent with a PCCP that is approved or cleared by FDA. Section 515C also provides that FDA may require that a PCCP include labeling for safe and effective use of a device as such device changes pursuant to such plan, notification requirements if the device does not function as intended pursuant to such plan, and performance requirements for changes made under the plan. If you are interested in proposing a PCCP in your marketing submission, we encourage you to submit a Pre-Submission to engage in further discussion with CDRH.

Additionally, the test results should fall within the acceptance criteria previously found to be acceptable.\n--------------------\nContext title: Peripheral Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) and Specialty Catheters - Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: In accordance with section 520(g) and the regulations, clinical studies of medical devices must comply with FDA\'s human subject protection requirements (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research) (21 CFR Part 50), Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements (21 CFR Part 56), Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) requirements (21 CFR Part 812), Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators requirements (21 CFR Part 54) regulations, as well as any other applicable regulations, including pertinent regulations at 21 CFR Part 809 (In Vitro Diagnostic Devices For Human Use).\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThere are three types of studies described in the regulations at 21 CFR Part 812: significant risk (SR) device studies, non-significant risk (NSR) device studies, and exempt studies. A brief description of these types of studies follows. Please refer to the FDA Information Sheet Guidance ""Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies"" for more detailed information about SR and NSR device studies, the importance of the IRB\'s review, the regulatory requirements for these studies, and examples of devices in each category.\n\nA. Significant t Risk Device Studies\n\nA significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. (21 CFR 812.3(m))\n\nSponsors of investigational SR device studies are required to get an approved IDE from FDA before starting their study. 21 CFR 812.20 (FDA gives each IDE a number - for example #GXX0000, where XX denotes the year of the submission). Sponsors and clinical investigators of these studies must comply with the regulations at 21 CFR Part 812, ""Investigational Device Exemptions.""\n\nIf FDA disapproves an IDE, FDA\'s letter will describe the reasons for the disapproval. If the sponsor submits an IDE amendment satisfactorily addressing the issues in FDA\'s letter, the agency sends an IDE approval letter to the sponsor. In accordance with the regulations at Part 812, the study may not start until both FDA and the IRB have given their approval.\n\nNote: A conditional approval letter from FDA allows the study to begin if the study is approved by the IRB, but requires the sponsor to provide additional clarifying information in order to obtain full approval for the study.\n\nIRBs do not have to make the SR or NSR determination if FDA has already made the risk determination. Most often, clinical investigators submit SR device investigations for IRB review after the study has already received IDE approval from FDA. IRBs may ensure that SR device investigations have an FDA-approved IDE by asking the clinical investigator to request from the sponsor a copy of FDA\'s IDE approval letter.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAn IRB may be asked to review an SR device study before the sponsor receives FDA approval of an IDE submission. Under this circumstance, IRBs should be aware that because it is possible that FDA may not approve the IDE or may request significant changes to the research protocol, the IRB may need to re-evaluate the study after FDA reviews the application. If an IRB approves the significant risk device study before FDA approves the IDE, there may be more of a risk that clinical investigators will mistakenly enroll subjects before the study should be started (i.e, before FDA approves the IDE.)\n\nNon-Significant Risk Device Studies\n\nAn NSR device is an investigational device that does not meet the definition of a significant risk device. If an IRB finds that an investigational medical device study poses a NSR, the sponsor does not need to submit an IDE to FDA before starting the study. If the IRB determines that the proposed study is an NSR study, the IRB may proceed to review the study under 21 CFR 56.109 and 21 CFR 56.111. FDA considers an NSR device study to have an approved IDE after IRB approval and when sponsors meet the abbreviated requirements at 21 CFR 812.2(b). Consequently, in most cases, FDA is not aware of non-significant risk device studies.\n\nAs stated above, if FDA has already made the risk determination, the IRB does not need to duplicate this effort. If, however, FDA has not made the risk determination or the IRB disagrees with the NSR determination made by a sponsor, then the IRB must notify the investigator and, where appropriate, the sponsor, that the study involves a significant risk device (21 CFR 812.66). If a sponsor or an IRB needs help in making the SR/NSR determination, it may ask for a written determination from FDA.3\n\nFootnote 3: See the guidance memorandum entitled, “Procedures for Handling Inquiries Regarding the Need for an Investigational Device Exemptions Application for Research Involving Medical Devices” at www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/blue-ide-d01-1.html\n\nThe IRB should consider the following in determining whether a device study poses a SR or NSR:\n\nthe sponsor\'s description of why the study is not SR\n\nwhether the proposed NSR research study meets the definition of ""significant risk"" (see above)\n\nthe proposed use of the device as well as any protocol related procedures and tests, not just the device (test article) alone. (This process is different from the IRB review process found at 21 CFR 56.111(a)(2)).)\n\nadditional information from the sponsor, if needed.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.3.1 C. Exempt Studies\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 812.2(b), sponsors and investigators of certain studies are exempt from the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812, with the exception of SS812.119 (disqualification of a clinical investigator). Examples of exempt studies are consumer preference testing, testing of a device modification, or testing of two or more devices in commercial distribution if the testing does not collect safety or effectiveness data, or put subjects at risk.4\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 CFR 812.2(c)(4).\n\nStudies of an already cleared medical device in which the device is used or investigated in accordance with the indications in the cleared labeling are exempt from Part 812.5 Note: Studies of a cleared device for a new use must comply with the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations. Similarly, studies of a PMA approved device are exempt from the IDE requirements if the device is being studied for the indications in the approved labeling.\n\nFootnote 5: See 21 CFR 812.2(c)(1) and (2).\n\nIn addition, diagnostic device studies (e.g., in vitro diagnostic studies) are exempt from the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812 under certain circumstances. The study is exempt as long as the sponsor complies with the requirements at 21 CFR 809.10(c) for labeling, and if the testing: (i) is noninvasive; (ii) does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents significant risk; (iii) does not by design or intention introduce energy into a subject; and (iv) is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure. 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3).\n\n3.2 Are IDE exempt studies subject to the requirements for informed consent and IRB review and approval under Parts 50 and 56?\n\nIf an exempt study is being conducted to collect data to support either a clinical investigation or a marketing application, then the study must comply with 21 CFR Part 50 and should comply with 21 CFR Part 56. 21 CFR 50.1(a), 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 56.101(a), 21 CFR 56.103.\n\n3.3.3 Does FDA require IRB review and approval of off-label use of a legally marketed device?\n\nNo, when a physician uses a legally marketed device outside its labeling to treat a patient and no research is being done, IRB review is not required. Note: Although not required by FDA, an IRB may still decide on its own initiative to review such use. Yes, when the off-label use of a legally marketed device is part of a research study collecting safety and effectiveness data involving human subjects, IRB review and approval is required (21 CFR 812.2(a)).\n\nFor additional information on the off-label use of devices, see the FDA Information Sheet guidance, "" \'Off-label\' and Investigational Use of Marketed Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices.""6\n\nFootnote 6: This guidance can be found at: www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/offlabel.html\n\nMust an IRB review a study conducted after submission of a (510(k)) to FDA but prior to FDA\'s decision on that submission?\n\nYes. During FDA\'s review of the premarket notification submission, the device remains an investigational product. Therefore, the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations apply. The device may not be distributed, except for investigational use, unless FDA clears the device for marketing.\n\n16 Can a physician use an unapproved device in an emergency?\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Devices Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA is committed to improving U.S. patient access to new devices by strengthening and streamlining the clinical trial enterprise so that medical device clinical trials are conducted in the U.S. in an efficient and cost-effective manner, while maintaining appropriate patient and research participant protections.\n\nThe purpose of this guidance is to provide greater clarity for FDA staff and investigational device exemption (IDE) sponsors and sponsor-investigators1 regarding the principal factors that FDA considers when assessing the benefits and risks of IDE applications for human clinical studies.\n\nConsistent with applicable laws and regulations, FDA may disapprove an IDE application if, among other reasons, ""[t]here is reason to believe that the risks to the subjects are not outweighed by the anticipated benefits to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained.""2 In many cases, the Agency believes that effective risk management, including the application of risk controls, which includes risk mitigation measures, can result in a favorable IDE benefit-risk determination.\n\nFDA recognizes that in assessing risks and anticipated benefits, the medical device total product lifecycle should be considered, and that earlier stages of device development and investigational clinical study are typically associated with greater uncertainty (i.e., a lower level of evidence). A primary goal of this guidance is to clarify the factors that FDA considers when assessing risks and anticipated benefits as significant contributors to the decision to approve IDE studies, and how uncertainty may be offset by a variety of risk mitigation measures which can ensure appropriate patient and research participant protections in investigational research settings. For proposed IDE studies, at earlier stages of device development, FDA considers appropriate mitigation measures for anticipated possible risks and unanticipated risks, whereas in later stages, FDA considers whether risk mitigation measures focus on the most probable risks.\n\nFootnote 2: 21 CFR 812.30(b)(4).\n\nAnother important goal of this guidance is to characterize benefits in the context of investigational research, which includes direct benefits to the subject and benefits to others (to the extent there are indirect benefits to subjects such as knowledge to be gained from the study or information that may contribute to developing a treatment).\n\nAs with the benefit-risk framework for evaluating marketing applications, FDA assessment of benefits and risks for an IDE application takes into account the contextual setting in which the study is being proposed, including but not limited to characterization of the disease or condition being treated or diagnosed, the availability of and risks associated with alternative treatments or diagnostics. When available, information characterizing subject tolerance for risk and their perspective on benefit may provide useful context during this assessment. See for more information FDA Guidance, Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications (http://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm517504.pdf).\n\nFDA believes use of this benefit-risk framework will facilitate the incorporation of evidence and knowledge from different domains--clinical, nonclinical, and patient--to support a comprehensive, balanced decision-making approach. FDA envisions this will facilitate a common understanding between FDA and sponsors/sponsor-investigators by highlighting which factors are critical in the benefit-risk assessment for a specific application, and clearly explaining how these factors influence FDA\'s decisions. This guidance document will also help improve the predictability, consistency, and transparency of the review process for IDE applications.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this one, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Scope\n\nThis guidance document explains the principal factors that FDA considers when assessing benefits and risks of original IDE applications, IDE amendments and IDE supplements for human clinical investigations of certain medical devices to determine safety and effectiveness. The approach discussed in this guidance is applicable to studies subject to the IDE requirements in 21 CFR part 812, including postmarket studies. In general, IDE applications are required for clinical investigations of significant risk devices to determine safety and effectiveness.3 This guidance applies to both diagnostic and therapeutic devices. This guidance is not intended to provide recommendations regarding device-specific data or study requirements.\n\nFootnote 3: 21 CFR 812.2 and 20.\n\n3 Informed Consent and IDE Decisions\n\nThe purpose of the IDE regulations, as set forth in Title 21 CFR part 812, is to encourage, to the extent consistent with the protection of public health and safety and with ethical standards, the discovery and development of useful devices intended for human use, and to maintain optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of this purpose.4 Title 21 CFR part 812 applies to all clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness with some exceptions, as described in 21 CFR 812.2(c).\n\nFootnote 4: 21 CFR 812.1.\n\nFDA approval of an IDE application prior to study initiation is typically required for a clinical investigation conducted in the U.S. of a significant risk device that is not approved or cleared for the indication being studied.5 As defined in 21 CFR 812.3(m), a significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nFootnote 5: See section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 812.2(b) for conditions under which an IDE application is required prior to study initiation.\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations for Medical Device Investigational Device Exemptions Guidance for Investigational Device Exemption Sponsors, Sponsor-Investigators and Food and Drug Administration Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 3: 21 CFR 812.2 and 20.\n\n3 Informed Consent and IDE Decisions\n\nThe purpose of the IDE regulations, as set forth in Title 21 CFR part 812, is to encourage, to the extent consistent with the protection of public health and safety and with ethical standards, the discovery and development of useful devices intended for human use, and to maintain optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of this purpose.4 Title 21 CFR part 812 applies to all clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness with some exceptions, as described in 21 CFR 812.2(c).\n\nFootnote 4: 21 CFR 812.1.\n\nFDA approval of an IDE application prior to study initiation is typically required for a clinical investigation conducted in the U.S. of a significant risk device that is not approved or cleared for the indication being studied.5 As defined in 21 CFR 812.3(m), a significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nFootnote 5: See section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 812.2(b) for conditions under which an IDE application is required prior to study initiation.\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAn approved IDE application exempts the study spons from certain provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (such as certain requirements for a marketing submission and good manufacturing practice). However, IDE studies must comply with the applicable requirements set forth in 21 CFR part 812, including requirements for informed consent under 21 CFR part 50, labeling of devices for investigational use only, study monitoring, records and reporting, and approval by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with 21 CFR part 56.6\n\nFootnote 6: Section 520(g)(3) of the FD&C Act.\n\nii.1.4 Informed Consent\n\nA key tenet of FDA\'s IDE benefit-risk framework is appropriate protection of human subjects and a key principle of human subject protection in clinical investigations is the informed consent process.7 This process goes beyond obtaining a signature on an informed consent form. The informed consent process provides the prospective subject or his or her legally authorized representative with adequate information about the study, including pertinent information about the investigational device, its risks and benefits, alternatives, and what is expected of the subject in order to participate in the study (e.g., study visits, procedures, maintaining subject diaries).8\n\nFootnote 7: See generally, 21 CFR part 50.\n\nThe subject or his or her legally authorized representative must be given sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate in the clinical study under circumstances that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.9\n\nFootnote 8: See 21 CFR 50.25.\n\nAn informed consent process should allow an individual to decide to accept potential risks associated with a study in exchange for the potential for anticipated benefits to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained. The informed consent process allows individuals to exercise their personal tolerance of risks as weighed against other factors, including the reasonably expected benefits and the alternatives to the study.\n\nThe informed consent process ensures that each individual makes a determination about study participation after being informed of the study, including the risks and benefits of study participation, and, if applicable, the possibility of receiving no direct benefit. The informed consent regulations in 21 CFR part 50 describe the informed consent aspects of human subject protection in clinical investigations subject to FDA regulations. For example 21 CFR 50.20, states the following:\n\n_""Except as provided in 50.23 and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative.""_In addition, 21 CFR 50.25(a)(2) states that the informed consent must include ""a description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject.""\n\nRegulatory Standard for IDE Decisions\n\nUnder section 520(g)(4)(B) of the FD&C Act, an IDE application may only be disapproved if FDA finds that the investigation does not conform to the procedures and conditions prescribed under regulations. The purpose of the IDE process is ""to encourage, to the extent consistent with the protection of the public health and safety and with ethical standards, the discovery and development of useful devices intended for human use and to that end to maintain optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of that purpose.""10\n\nFDA\'s decision-making process for IDE applications was modified with the passage of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) of 2012 (Pub. L. No. 112-144). Section 601 of FDASIA amended Section 520(g) of the FD&C Act to specify certain situations in which FDA cannot disapprove an IDE application. Section 520(g)(4)(C) of the FD&C Act states that, consistent with section 520(g)(1), FDA shall not disapprove an IDE application because:\n\nFootnote 10: Section 520(g)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nthe investigation may not support a substantial equivalence or de novo classification determination or approval of the device;\n\nthe investigation may not meet a requirement, including a data requirement, relating to the approval or clearance of a device; or\n\nan additional or different investigation may be necessary to support clearance or approval of the device.\n\nConsidering the above criteria, when the objective of a proposed study is to support a marketing submission, the sponsor may benefit from learning whether there are protocol modifications that FDA believes are needed for the study to adequately support product approval or clearance. FDA intends to convey such considerations to the sponsor to provide greater clarity and predictability.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.2 Are IDE exempt studies subject to the requirements for informed consent and IRB review and approval under Parts 50 and 56?\n\nIf an exempt study is being conducted to collect data to support either a clinical investigation or a marketing application, then the study must comply with 21 CFR Part 50 and should comply with 21 CFR Part 56. 21 CFR 50.1(a), 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 56.101(a), 21 CFR 56.103.\n\n3.3.3 Does FDA require IRB review and approval of off-label use of a legally marketed device?\n\nNo, when a physician uses a legally marketed device outside its labeling to treat a patient and no research is being done, IRB review is not required. Note: Although not required by FDA, an IRB may still decide on its own initiative to review such use. Yes, when the off-label use of a legally marketed device is part of a research study collecting safety and effectiveness data involving human subjects, IRB review and approval is required (21 CFR 812.2(a)).\n\nFor additional information on the off-label use of devices, see the FDA Information Sheet guidance, "" \'Off-label\' and Investigational Use of Marketed Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices.""6\n\nFootnote 6: This guidance can be found at: www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/offlabel.html\n\nMust an IRB review a study conducted after submission of a (510(k)) to FDA but prior to FDA\'s decision on that submission?\n\nYes. During FDA\'s review of the premarket notification submission, the device remains an investigational product. Therefore, the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations apply. The device may not be distributed, except for investigational use, unless FDA clears the device for marketing.\n\n16 Can a physician use an unapproved device in an emergency?\n\nIn general, an unapproved medical device may be used only on human subjects when the device is under clinical investigation and when used by investigators participating in a clinical trial. Section 561 of the Act, however, recognizes that there may be circumstances under which a health care provider may wish to use an unapproved device to save the life of a patient or to prevent irreversible morbidity when there exists no other alternative therapy. For investigational devices under an IDE, the IDE regulation permits deviations from the investigational plan without prior approval when necessary to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency. (See 21 CFR 812.35(a)). A physician may treat a patient with an unapproved medical device in an emergency situation if he/she concludes that:\n\nThe patient has a life-threatening condition that needs immediate treatment;7 Footnote 7: FDA considers “life-threatening condition” to include serious diseases or conditions such as sight-threatening and limb-threatening conditions as well as other situations involving risk of irreversible morbidity.\n\nNo generally acceptable alternative treatment for the condition exists; and\n\nBecause of the immediate need to use the device, there is no time to use existing procedures to get FDA approval for the use.\n\nFDA expects the physician to make the determination that the patient\'s circumstances meet the above criteria, to assess the potential for benefit from the use of the unapproved device, and to have substantial reason to believe that benefits will exist. In the event that a device is used in circumstances meeting the criteria listed above, the physician should follow as many of the patient protection procedures listed below as possible:\n\nInformed consent from the patient or a legal representative;\n\nClearance from the institution as specified by their policies;Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nConcurrence of the IRB chairperson;\n\nAn assessment from a physician who is not participating in the study; and\n\nAuthorization from the IDE sponsor, if an IDE exists for the device.\n\nWhile prior approval for shipment or emergency use of the investigational device is not required, the use must be reported to FDA by the IDE sponsor within 5 working days from the time the sponsor learns of the use. 21 CFR 812.35(a)(2) and 812.150(a)(4). The report should contain a summary of the conditions constituting the emergency, patient outcome information, and the patient protection measures that were followed. If no IDE exists, the physician should follow the above procedures and report the emergency use to CDRH or CBER.\n\nFor additional information on the procedures physicians and IRBs should follow in an emergency use situation, please see Chapter III Expanded Access to Unapproved Devices of the guidance entitled, ""IDE Policies and Procedures.""8\n\nFootnote 8: This guidance may be found at: www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/idepolcy.html\n\nWhat if the situation is not an emergency? Can a patient with a serious illness or condition have access to an investigational device outside a study?\n\nYes, FDA recognizes that there are circumstances in which an investigational device is the only option available for a patient faced with a serious or life-threatening condition (hereinafter referred to as ""compassionate use""). Unlike emergency use of an unapproved device discussed above, prior FDA approval is needed before compassionate use occurs. Section 561(b) of the act and 21 CFR 812.35. In order to obtain agency approval, the sponsor should submit an IDE supplement requesting approval for a protocol deviation under section 812.35(a) in order to treat the patient. The IDE supplement should include:\n\nA description of the patient\'s condition and the circumstances necessitating treatment;\n\nA discussion of why alternatives therapies are unsatisfactory and why the probable risk of using the investigational device is no greater than the probable risk from the disease or condition;\n\nAn identification of any deviations in the approved clinical protocol that may be needed in order to treat the patient; and\n\nThe patient protection measures listed above that will be followed.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe patient identified in the supplement should not be treated with the device until FDA approves its use under the proposed circumstances. In reviewing this type of request, FDA will consider the above information as well as whether the preliminary evidence of safety and effectiveness justifies such use and whether such use would interfere with the conduct of a clinical trial to support marketing approval.\n\nIf the request is approved, the attending physician should devise an appropriate schedule for monitoring the patient, taking into consideration the investigational nature of the device and the specific needs of the patient. The patient should be monitored to detect any possible problems arising from the use of the device. Following the compassionate use of the device, a follow-up report should be submitted to FDA in which summary information regarding patient outcome is presented. If any problems occurred as a result of device use, they should be discussed in the supplement and reported to the reviewing IRB as soon as possible.\n\nAdditional information on the procedures physicians and IRBs should follow in compassionate use situations may be found in Chapter III Expanded Access to Unapproved Devices of the guidance entitled, ""IDE Policies and Procedures.""9\n\nFootnote 9: This guidance may be found at: www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/idepolcy.html\n\n18 What is the definition of a custom device?\n\nTo be considered a custom device, the device must meet all of the following criteria, which are described in section 520(b) of the act and at 21 CFR 812.3(b):\n\n(1) It necessarily deviates from devices generally available or from an applicable performance standard or premarket approval requirement in order to comply with the order of an individual physician or dentist;\n\n(2) The device is not generally available to, or generally used by, other physicians or dentists;\n\n(3) It is not generally available in finished form for purchase or for dispensing upon prescription;\n\n(4) It is not offered for commercial distribution through labeling or advertising; and\n\n(5) It is intended for use by an individual patient named in the order form of a physician or dentist, and is to be made in a specific form for that patient, or is intended to meet the special needs of the physician or dentist in the course of professional practice (such as a particular operating tool).\n\n19 Does an IRB need to review custom use?\n\nFDA regulations do not require review and approval for custom device use. However, FDA recommends that as many of the patient protection measures listed in paragraph 16 be followed as possible. IRBs should be familiar with the regulatory requirements for custom devicesbecause physicians or institutions may seek information from the IRB about the use of a custom device in patients at their healthcare facility. IRBs may develop procedures for the use of custom devices to ensure that patient protection measures are thoughtfully carried out.\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Devices Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors']","[""In accordance with section 520(g) and the regulations, clinical studies of medical devices must comply with FDA's human subject protection requirements (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research) (21 CFR Part 50), Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements (21 CFR Part 56), Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) requirements (21 CFR Part 812), Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators requirements (21 CFR Part 54) regulations, as well as any other applicable regulations, including pertinent regulations at 21 CFR Part 809 (In Vitro Diagnostic Devices For Human Use).""]",0.9999999999833332,0.1111111111111111
44,"Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency? If yes, can CDER be notified in an annual report?","['--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency? If yes, can CDER be notified in an annual report?\n--------------------\nContext: Q4:: A packaging site will be added that will enclose two sample cartons, along with some promotional material, into a larger carton or box preprinted with the product name:\n\nDoes the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency? If yes, can CDER be notified in an annual report?\n\nIs the tertiary site held to the same CGMP requirements as a secondary site? For example, if a tertiary site should be submitted to the agency, and this site has not had any CGMP inspection within the last two years, is this change still annual reportable?\n\nA4: The guidance only distinguishes between primary and secondary packaging sites. The site described would be considered a secondary packaging site. CGMP requirements extend beyond packaging and repackaging operations that involve direct product contact. For example, a site must register with FDA (21 CFR Part 207) and is subject to CGMP inspection (21 CFR Part 211) when the site is used to attach inserts, or in the case of a cartoning site, when cartons contain product labels. If registration and/or inspection are required for the site of this secondary packaging operation, CDER should be notified of the different site (via the application). The site should have a satisfactory inspection relating to packaging operations for notification to occur in the annual report. For the purposes of this guidance, in general, there is no two-year limit on the CGMP inspection (see Manufacturing Sites Q10). If registration and inspection are not required for the site of this secondary packaging operation, the applicant need not notify CDER of the site. If you have any questions on whether this packaging operation is subject to FDA registration or inspection, you should contact the appropriate CDER inspection and/or compliance staff for advice.\n\nQ5:: Certain changes relating to contract sterilization sites for packaging components can be reported in an annual report (section VI.D.4). Does this also apply to applicant owned sites?\n\nA5: Yes. Whether the sterilization site is applicant- or contractor-owned, a change to a different sterilization site for packaging components can be reported in an annual report when the process is not materially different from the process described in the approved application, and the facility has a satisfactory CGMP inspection for the type of operation that is being performed.\n\nQ6:: Should a prior approval supplement be submitted for a change in the sterilization site for a primary packaging component of a metered dose inhaler?\n\nA6: The change can be reported in an annual report as long as the process is not materially different from that provided for in the approved application and as long as the facility has a satisfactory CGMP inspection for the type of operation being performed (section VI.D.4)\n\nQ7: If an intermediate or starting material is also a drug substance, would the recommendations on reporting site changes for intermediates or drug substances apply?\n\nA7: If a drug substance is used as an intermediate in a drug substance manufacturing process, the guidance on intermediates would apply. This assumes that the material has been classified appropriately as an intermediate (see relevant definitions in the glossary of the guidance). CDER traditionally does not consider a drug substance to be a starting material.\n\nQ8: Do the recommendations for manufacturing site changes apply to manufacturing sites outside the United States as long as the site has a satisfactory CGMP inspection for the type of operation that will be moved?\n\nA8: Yes. The recommendations in the guidance apply to domestic and foreign manufacturing sites.\n\nQ9: The site where the certificates of analysis and regulatory documentation are reviewed prior to commercial distribution of the product will be relocated. Should this site change be reported in the application?\n\nA9: A change in the site where GMP support paperwork operations occur need not be reported in the application.\n\nQ10: The guidance (section VI.B.2) states that a manufacturing site change should be submitted in a prior approval supplement if the new manufacturing site does not have a satisfactory CGMP inspection for the type of operation being moved. In previous guidances it was stated that a satisfactory CGMP inspection within the last two years was needed. Should a prior approval supplement be used if the new facility has a satisfactory CGMP inspection for the type of operation being moved, but the inspection occurred more than two years ago?\n\nA10: For the purposes of the guidance, there is no time limit on the satisfactory CGMP inspection unless the type of operation was discontinued (section VI.B.1).\n\nQ11: What is the reporting category for a change to a different manufacturing site for an excipient?\n\nA11: CDER need not be notified of this type of change.\n\nQ12: What is the recommended reporting category for the addition of a new aseptic filling line for sterile products?* The addition of a new aseptic filling line should be reported in a prior approval supplement (section VI.B.4).\n* Why does the guidance exclude drug substance intermediates when referring to satisfactory CGMP inspections?\n* Section 510(a)(2)(B) of the Act requires that all drugs be manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs. No distinction is made between the manufacture of drug substance and drug product. Although the CGMP regulations under 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 apply only to drug products, FDA expects appropriate CGMPs to be applied to all steps of a drug substance manufacturing process beginning with the use of starting materials. The types of sites identified in the guidance are routinely subject to FDA inspection with the exception of those facilities or establishments used to manufacture or process drug substance intermediates. Drug substance intermediate manufacturing or processing sites are not exempt from inspection, but an inspection is generally discretionary. Moreover, this type of facility is always subject to for cause inspection. Because drug substance intermediate sites are not routinely inspected, a satisfactory CGMP inspection was not included as a condition for submitting the change in a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected in 30 Days or annual report. However, when a drug substance intermediate manufacturing or processing site has been inspected and the CGMP inspection was not satisfactory, the change in site should be submitted as a prior approval supplement.\n\nManufacturing Process\n\nAn applicant intends to add a coarse screen to the opening of a blender, through which all individual components of a granulation would pass prior to granulation. The applicant asks whether this could be considered a change in a control which would be reportable in a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected under section VII.C.2.a of the guidance.\n\nThis change is not considered a change in control but an additional step in the manufacturing process. However, it is not considered a fundamental change in the manufacturing process. This type of change should be reported in a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected in 30 Days (section VII.C.1.a).\n\nCan changes in mixing steps and elimination of a mixing step be reported in an annual report if these changes are implemented prior to the manufacture of validation batches?\n\nThe timing of the postapproval change (i.e., pre- or post validation batches) does not affect the recommended reporting category. The type of change should be submitted in either a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected in 30 Days (e.g., VIII.C.1.a.) or prior approval supplement (e.g., VII.B.1) depending on the specifics of each situation such as the type of dosage form.\n\nWhat is the recommended reporting category for a drug product (immediate release solid oral dosage form) scale change beyond 10 times the size of the biobatch? If the change is annual reportable, should the information identified in SUPAC-IR3 for a Level 1 scale change be submitted?\n\nAll changes in the scale of the nonprotein drug product manufacturing batches can be reported in an annual report (see section VII.D.1.a).4 However, if the scale change results in other changes (e.g., equipment, process), the change would be considered a multiple change, and the recommended reporting category should be the most restrictive of those for any of the individual changes (section XII). Recommendations on scale changes for protein drug products are included in section VII.C.1.c and VII.D.1.a of the guidance. Footnote 4: The reporting categories in the Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA guidance supersede those recommended in SUPAC guidances where there are inconsistencies. Therefore, the recommendations in SUPAC-IR that certain scale changes be submitted in supplements are superseded.\n\nSPECifications\n\nQ1: How should a revision of an analytical procedure be reported to allow for the use of a company (i.e., secondary) standard in addition to the U. S. Pharmacopeia (USP) standard?\n\nA1: The revision of an analytical procedure to allow the option to use a secondary standard should be reported in an annual report. Also, the laboratory reference standards used must comply with CGMP regulations (e.g., 21 CFR 211.194(c)). Q2: How should a decrease in the fill volume be reported?\n\nA2: A change in the fill volume of a drug product involves a change to the specification and must be submitted in a prior approval supplement unless exempted by regulation or guidance (506A(c)(2)(A) of the Act). There is no exemption for this type of specification change; therefore, a prior approval supplement should be submitted. Q3: What reporting category should be used if a USP HPLC assay procedure replaces, or is used in addition to, a microbiological assay that is listed in the approved specification as the regulatory analytical procedure?\n--------------------\nContext title: Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'

Q3: What reporting category should be used if a USP HPLC assay procedure replaces, or is used in addition to, a microbiological assay that is listed in the approved specification as the regulatory analytical procedure?\n\nA3: The addition of the HPLC analytical procedure to comply with an official compendium can be submitted in an annual report (section VIII.D.1). However, if the microbiological assay will also be deleted, the deletion of a test should be reported in a prior approval supplement (section VIII.B.2 and 3). Q4: In the approved application, it is specified that full product testing will be performed before bulk material is sent to a contract package and when the packaged material is received from the contractor. Can notification in an annual report be used to replace the full testing of the product after it is received from the contractor with an identity test?\n\nA4: This change involves a deletion of tests and should be reported in a prior approval supplement (section VIII.B.2).\n\nPACKAGE\n\nQ1: The plastic used in a desiccant canister is being changed. When the desiccant is used for bottles of solid oral dosage form products, should it be reported as a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected under section IX.C.2.b of the guidance?\n\nMiscellaneous Changes\n\nThe guidance recommends an annual report for the addition of time points to the stability protocol or deletion of time points beyond the approved expiration dating period. If these changes are made in an annual report, is the protocol still considered approved?\n\nYes. If changes such as these are made in an annual report, the stability protocol is still considered approved.\n\nHow should the addition of a test to an approved stability protocol be reported?\n\nWhen a test is added, whether it is added to a release specification or a stability protocol, the change should be reported in a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected under section VIII.C.2.a of the guidance, which states ""An addition to a specification that provides increased assurance that the drug substance or drug product will have the characteristics of identity, strength, purity, or potency that it purports or is represented to possess.

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency? If yes, can CDER be notified in an annual report?\n--------------------\nContext: 4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAddition of a characterization test, study, or associated acceptance criterion to be achieved not specified in an approved CP that provides the same or increased assurance of the product quality.\n\nThe following are examples of modifications to an approved CP considered to have a minimal potential to have an adverse effect on product quality. If these planned modifications fit within the scope (e.g., same type of change(s)) of the original CP submission, they must be submitted in an annual report:\n\nAny change to a characterization test or study, analytical procedure, or acceptance criteria to be achieved as specified in an approved CP that is made to comply with an official compendium and that does not relax an acceptance criterion or delete a test,\n\nTightening of acceptance criteria to be achieved for a characterization test or study,\n\nAn approved change in the information within the application that is referenced in an approved CP, and\n\nEditorial changes to an approved CP.\n\nThis section of the guidance has a binding effect with regard to submitting such modifications to an approved CP in a CBE-30 supplement, CBE-0 supplement, or annual report rather than a PAS.\n\nFor tracking purposes, FDA recommends that a submission proposing modifications to an approved CP include a reference to the previously approved original application or PAS supplement containing the CP. The appropriate FDA review division can be contacted for questions regarding proposed modifications to an approved CP for a specific product.42\n\nFootnote 42: For questions about a CP submitted to an approved NDA, ANDA, or BLA in CDER, contact the Regulatory Business Process Manager in OPQ for the specific product. For questions about a CP submitted to a BLA, NDA, or ANDA in CBER, contact the Regulatory Project Manager in the product office for the specific product.\n\nVI Implementation of CMC Changes According to an Approved Comparability Protocol\n\nWhen making a CMC change(s) in accordance with an approved CP, you should review the initial risk assessment associated with making the change(s) provided in the approved CP and compare it with your current understanding of the product and manufacturing process to ensure that the outcomes of that risk assessment as they pertain to the planned change(s) remain valid. If your review of the risk assessment indicates a substantive difference in the previously described level of risk associated with making the change, either higher or lower, this may affect the reporting category for the change(s) specified in the approved CP. In this case, we recommend that you contact the appropriate FDA review division to discuss an appropriate course of action, which may include modification of the CP, the approved reporting category, or both. In addition, you should confirm that your control strategy will continue to ensureconsistent production of product of acceptable quality after implementing the change(s). The change(s) outlined in the approved CP should be implemented within your change management system as part of your overall pharmaceutical quality system.43 In addition, the change(s) must be approved by your quality control unit.44 Upon completion of the plan for successful implementation of the change(s) as described in the approved CP (including achievement of all of the predefined acceptance criteria), the change(s), if implemented, must be submitted to FDA using the reporting category specified in the approved CP submission.45\n\nFootnote 43: See ICH Q10, section II.B.\n\nFootnote 44: See footnote 17.\n\nFDA realizes that minor deviations from the approved CP may occur during implementation. Such deviations should not affect the technical principles of the protocol, should be addressed by the risk assessment, and should not affect product quality or the approved reporting category. You should evaluate whether the CP needs to be modified (see section V).\n\nYou are responsible for ensuring that the facility(ies) where the change(s) is to be made is capable of implementing the change(s) in accordance with CGMP. If any impacted facility is not capable of implementing the change(s) in accordance with CGMP, the approved CP should not be implemented at those facilities.46\n\nFootnote 45: See 21 CFR 314.70 and 601.12.\n\nFootnote 46: In the case where a manufacturing change is needed to correct a CGMP deficiency, we recommend that you contact the appropriate FDA review division regarding how to proceed.\n\nIn addition, CGMP observations that raise concern regarding the effectiveness of a facility's pharmaceutical quality system, and change management in particular, may lead to a need to modify previously approved CP reporting categories until the pharmaceutical quality system effectiveness has returned to an acceptable state. For example, inspection observations that lead to classifying a facility as Official Action Indicated (OAI) would generally impact an approved CP. In these cases, FDA intends to communicate with facilities and applicants, as appropriate, any CP reporting category modifications that are necessary based on CGMP observations, which may include reverting to the reporting categories that would apply in the absence of the approved CP.47\n\nFootnote 47: See 37.\n\nYou should collect and analyze commercial scale data, except where less than commercial scale data is justified,48 to determine whether the change(s) has been successfully implemented in accordance with the approved CP.\n\nFootnote 47: See 37.\n\nData demonstrates criteria have been achieved\n\nIf the data derived from the tests and studies demonstrate that the approved acceptance criteria in the CP have been achieved, the product manufactured by the new process can be distributed once the provisions of the approved reporting category are satisfied (e.g., if a PAS, after approval is obtained; if CBE-30, 30 days after notification; if CBE-0, upon notification; if an annual report, distribution can commence immediately).49\n\nFootnote 49: In addition to satisfying the provisions of the approved reporting category, successful completion of Stage 2 process validation is also necessary before commercial distribution (see 21 CFR 211.22, 211.100, and 211.165). See also guidance for industry Process Validation: General Principles and Practices (January 2011).\n\nFollowing implementation of the change(s), you must continue monitoring the process performance and product quality in accordance with CGMP requirements to ensure that a state of control is maintained.50 Written records, including records containing the data associated with implementing the change(s), must be retained in accordance with CGMP requirements (see 21 CFR 211.180(e)). These records (or copies of such records), including the raw data therein, must be available during the retention period51 for FDA to review during an inspection under section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act or when requested by FDA in advance of or in lieu of an inspection as described in section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act.

See also the recommendations in ICH Q10.\n\nData demonstrates criteria have not been achieved\n\nIf the data derived from the tests and studies demonstrate that the approved acceptance criteria in the CP have not been achieved or there is an otherwise unwanted, unintended, or unpredicted outcome that affects product quality,53 product manufactured by the altered process must not be distributed.54\n\nFootnote 54: See section 704 of the FD&C Act, and 21 CFR 314.70 and 601.12.\n\nIf you wish to pursue such a change using a CP, FDA recommends that you contact the appropriate FDA review division to discuss an appropriate course of action, which may include modification of the proposed change(s) as well as the risk assessment, the CP for the change, and the reporting category.

If yes, can CDER be notified in an annual report?\n--------------------\nContext: GUIDANCE DOCUMENT\n\nSUPAC-IR Questions and Answers about SUPAC-IR\n\nGuidance\n\nFEBRUARY 1997\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/supac-ir-questions-and-answers-about-supac-ir-guidance)\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\n(February 18, 1997)\n\nAll NDA, ANDA, and AADA Holders\n\nDear Sponsors:\n\nOn November 30, 1995, the Scale-up and Post-Approval Changes Guidance for Immediate Release Products (SUPAC-IR) was published. Since then a number of questions have arisen in interpreting the Guidance as it applies to specific situations encountered or that could be encountered in the pharmaceutical industry. The purpose of this letter is primarily to share with you the questions that have been asked most frequently or that we consider the most significant. Also included are the Center\'s responses to these questions. The responses were developed and concurred with by the Office of New Drug Chemistry and Office of Generic Drugs, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). We believe the sharing of the information will result in furthering the use of the Guidance to increase regulatory flexibility for industry.\n\nIn addition, the Center\'s Chemistry and Manufacturing Controls Coordinating Committee (CMC CC) has met and reconsidered two SUPAC-IR issues which have been of great concern and interest to industry. The following information on stand alone packaging operation site changes and stand alone analytical site changes represents a re-assessment of how SUPAC-IR should be interpreted on these issues.\n\n7 Stand alone packaging operations site changes\n\nFor immediate release solid oral dosage forms, a stand alone packaging operations site change, utilizing container(s)/closure(s) in the approved application, may be submitted as a Changes Being Effected supplement. The facility should also have a current and satisfactory cGMP compliance profile with FDA for the type of packaging operation in question before submitting the supplement. The supplement should contain written certification from the packaging facility stating that it is in conformance with cGMP\'s. If the facility has not received a satisfactory cGMP inspection within the previous two years for the type of packaging operation involved, a prior-approval supplement with the same commitment for stability is recommended.\n\nThe supplement should also contain a commitment to place the first production batch of the product on long-term stability studies using the approved protocol in the application and to submit the resulting data in annual reports. Where the product is available in more than one strength, size, or container/closure system, one batch of each combination should be placed on long-term stability studies. Bracketing or matrixing is allowed only if it has been approved previously by FDA. Any changes to an approved stability protocol should have a supplemental approval prior to the initiation of the stability study. Batches should be tested annually as per the stability commitments in the approved application.\n\n3 Stand Alone Analytical Testing Lab Site Changes\n\nFor immediate release solid oral dosage forms, a stand alone analytical testing laboratory site change may be submitted as a Changes Being Effected supplement, if the new facility has a current and satisfactory cGMP compliance profile with FDA for the type of testing operation in question. The supplement should contain a commitment to use the same SOP\'s and test methods employed in the approved application, written certification from the testing laboratory stating that they are in conformance with cGMP\'s, and a full description of the testing to be performed by the testing lab. If the facility has not received a satisfactory GMP inspection within the previous 2 years for the type of testing involved, a prior-approval supplement is recommended.\n\nThe CMC CC and the Center intend that the SUPAC-IR Guidance will be revised to further clarify and update its recommendations and to assure good correspondence between these recommendations and those of other SUPAC documents in preparation. In the meantime, we hope these questions and answers will help clarify the application of the Guidance.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n/s /\n\nRoger L. Williams, M. D.\n\nDeputy Center Director for Pharmaceutical Science\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and ResearchEnclosure\n\nSUPAC-IR: Questions and Answers\n\n(To the extent these questions and answers provide guidance, that guidance was prepared by the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Coordinating Committee in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the Food and Drug Administration. Although this guidance does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind the FDA or the industry, it does represent the Agency\'s current thinking on questions related to the Scale-Up and Post-Approval Changes Guidance for Immediate Release Products (SUPAC-IR). An electronic version of these questions and answers are also available via Internet using the World Wide Web (WWW). To access the document on the WWW, connect to the CDER Home Page (http://wcms-prod-cntr-app2.fda.gov/sites/default/files/ucm2018538.xcsr) and go to the ""Regulatory Guidance (/guidances-drugs)"" section.)\n\nComponent and Composition Changes\n\nQ: May one color be replaced with another by placing the batch on concurrent stability and reporting it in the annual report?A: A change from one color to another should be submitted as a prior approval supplement.2. Q: Can color be changed under SUPAC-IR?A: Yes. A change in color, either in amount or from one color to another, is a level 3 component and composition change which calls for a prior approval supplement. However, if the color is merely being removed, it is a level 1 change and can be reported in the next annual report.3. Q: What is the full definition of a change in \'technical grade"" of an excipient? Does this only mean a change in excipient specifications that may impact functionality or does it include a change in supplier even if all applicable specifications remain the same? A: Technical grades of excipients differ in their specifications and intended use. Technical grades may differ in: 1) specifications and/or functionality; 2) impurities; and 3) impurity profiles. If a supplier of an excipient changes but its technical grade AND specifications remain the same, the agency should be notified in an annual report.4. Q: How does one apply SUPAC-IR to multifunctional excipients, e.g., starch?A: SUPER-IR composition changes are based on being able to define the use or action of the particular excipient in the product. This rationale should be included by the applicants as part of their original applications. Not all multifunctional excipients are listed in the guidance. However, if an excipient was utilized to provide multiple functions such as pregelatinized starch as a filler, starch as a disintegrant, starch paste as a binder, then the most conservative recommended change should be followed (e.g., for an excipient that is a filler, disintegration and binder, the recommended limit for a Level 2 change is "" 0.5 percent, see page 7, SUPAC-IR). An applicant may wish to add an explanation of how the change will affect other functions of the excipient in the product. If this information was not included in the original application, the review division should be consulted before filing such a SUPAC change, either through a CBE or annual report.\n--------------------\nContext title: SUPAC-IR Questions and Answers about SUPAC-IR Guidance'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency? If yes, can CDER be notified in an annual report?\n--------------------\nContext: Certain changes (e.g., change in strength, change in composition of the product in relation to the reference listed drug (RLD)) may not be permitted in an ANDA without prior FDA approval of the change (see 21 CFR 314.93).\n\nWhen an NDA or an ANDA is submitted, the applicant is required in FDA Form 356(h) to provide a complete listing of all the manufacturing, packaging, and control sites for drug substance and drug product and provide information on readiness of each site for inspection (see 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)). If at the time of inspection the facility is not ready, the application may not be approved. The inspector will be aware of the application and any amendments to it at the time of the inspection.\n\nAfter an application is approved, 21 CFR part 212 permits an applicant to change equipment provided that it is qualified before use. Under FDA regulations at 21 CFR 314.70, certain changes after approval must be requested in a prior approval supplement (PAS). If a PAS is required and an inspection requested, FDA would seek to perform the inspection as soon as possible.\n\nIn preparation for the inspection, an amendment to the application that describes the changes and provides supporting data will need to be submitted. Whenever an amendment is submitted, a field copy (with certification) must also be submitted to inform the inspector of changes (see 21 CFR 314.70(a)(5); see also Appendix B).\n\nQ5: Can we submit an ANDA on CD? If so, do we need to submit a paper copy as back up?\n\nInformation on electronic submission on physical media is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM163567.pdf.\n\nIt is not necessary to submit a paper copy of the entire submission as a back up. However, if you are submitting on physical media (e.g., a CD or DVD), you should submit a paper FDA Form 356h with original signatures. FDA requires this hard copy document in the unlikely event that the physical media are damaged or corrupted and rendered unreadable. Without the paper document, FDA would not be able to contact the sponsor if the physical media are unreadable.\n\nQ6: Will hybrid applications be accepted?\n\nYes. CDER's Electronic Submissions Group (ESub Group) will grant waivers for hybrid applications for PET producers. The ESub group will provide instructions to sponsors and advise which forms and templates to use. The ESub group can be contacted at\n\nESub@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nIs there a way to determine whether a PET producer has submitted an NDA or ANDA for approval or has received approval of an application? There is no public list of submitted NDAs or ANDAs. FDA cannot publicly disclose the existence of an NDA or ANDA before it is approved unless the applicant has publicly disclosed the existence of the application (see 21 CFR 314.430(b)). Once a product is approved, it is listed in FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book). If you intend to purchase PET drugs for commercial use from a producer of those drugs, you should seek assurance from the vendor that they have submitted an application to FDA.\n\nContent and Format for NDAs and ANDAs,_ provides reference to and advice to format an application in the common technical document (CTD) format. The attachments to the guidance, which provide sample formats, are not formatted according to the CTD. What is the correct format for the CTD? The sample formats have been kept in the old Office of Generic Drug (OGD) format to avoid confusion for the three commonly used drugs (FDG, Ammonia N13, and Sodium Fluoride F18). You may organize the application in the CTD format and keep the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) sections (module 3 of the CTD format) as formatted in the CMC attachment. Alternatively, you can organize the application, including CMC, entirely in CTD format. The following FDA guidances provide further information about the CTD format: * _Submitting Marketing Applications According to the ICH-CTD Format\n\nGeneral Considerations3 Footnote 3: This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic. * International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidance, _M4: Organization of the CTD * ICH guidance on _M4Q: The CTD -\n\nIf the drug substance and the drug product are the same, do applicants have to repeat the information in the two sections of the CTD? No. You do not have to repeat information if the drug product and substance are the same. You can hyperlink to the section where the information is provided.\n\nWhat are the differences between Module 3 for the NDA and ANDA?The modules are the same.\n\nQ11:: Would FDA consider an application for FDG for a concentration greater than 300 millicuries (mCi)/milliliter (mL) and perhaps as high as 500 mCi/mL?\n\nFDA has not placed any limit on the strength for the multidose vial. As long as the data support manufacturability and stability of the product at the proposed strength, FDA will consider the application. Be advised that if the proposed strength is not in the mCi/mL range approved for the RLD, a suitability petition or a 505(b)(2)4 NDA must be submitted (see 21 CFR 314.93). For further information on acceptable ranges, see the guidance PET Drug Applications - Content and Format for NDAs and ANDAs.\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 U.S.C. 355(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act).\nQ12:: Has FDA considered establishing a few different queues for PET applications?\n\nNo, FDA has developed internal tracking procedures specifically for PET products, but we do not believe that a different queue is necessary.\n\nQ13:: If we use two different synthesizers to make the same product, do we need to submit two NDAs or ANDAs?\n\nYou can have two different synthesizers in the same NDA or ANDA as long as the finished product at the end is the same, meaning that the product meets the same set of specifications and the formulation is the same. If the finished product formulation from the two synthesizers is different, two separate applications may need to be submitted. Please contact the Office of Generic Drugs (for an ANDA) or the Office of New Drugs' Division of Medical Imaging Products (for an NDA) to discuss your options. However, in certain cases, a formulation that differs in terms of exception excipients (e.g., a buffer, an antioxidant or a stabilizer) may be submitted within the same ANDA; otherwise, sameness to the RLD must be shown.\nQ14:: How much does FDA want to see in an application about the parameters and the controls on the cyclotron itself?\n\nInformation about the operating parameters for cyclotron operation (e.g., the make of cyclotron used, bombardment times, information on the target, and the target windows), should be submitted. This information may be submitted by a reference to a Type-II Drug Master File (DMF) if the isotope is obtained from outside sources. When buying isotopes from a vendor, appropriate specifications should be established and the vendor should be qualified.\n\nWill FDA treat foreign producers who seek to export PET drug products into the United States differently than domestic producers? No, FDA will not treat foreign PET drug product producers differently than domestic producers. In addition to other applicable requirements, all foreign drug establishments whose products are imported or offered for import into the United States are required to register their establishment with FDA and list all of their drug products in commercial distribution in the United States. More information on the registration and listing process is available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/DrugRegistration andListing/ucm2007058.htm.\n\nINDs\n\nWho can sponsor an IND? INDs can be sponsored by an individual (e.g., a physician), an institution, or a company.\n\nContent and Format for NDAs and ANDAs_.\n\nWill drugs for which there is a United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) monograph be exempt from submitting an IND? No. The fact that a drug has a USP monograph does not eliminate the need for an IND, although the drug might be eligible for an expanded access IND if the criteria are met (see the guidance Investigational New Drug Applications for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Drugs).\n\nWhat is the definition of clinical use in the context of PET drugs?Clinical use refers to administration of the drug to patients as a component of their clinical care with no intent to study the safety or effectiveness of the drug in any systematic way.\nQ20: Can research be conducted under an IND for FDG, Ammonia N13, Sodium Fluoride F18, or Rubidium Chloride Rb82?\n\nYes. Research and/or investigational studies using these drugs should be conducted under an IND if they are being studied for purposes of commercial clinical use (see the guidance Investigational New Drug Applications for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Drugs). Human research using a PET drug may be conducted under the RDRC if it is basic science research and not research that is intended for immediate therapeutic, diagnostic, or similar purposes, or research to determine the safety and effectiveness of the radioactive drug or biological product for such purposes (see the guidance The Radioactive Drug Research Committee: Human Research Without an Investigational New Drug Application).\nQ21: In submitting the physician-sponsored IND, one of the biggest hurdles is trying to get the necessary preclinical pharmacological and toxicology data to support the submission. Would FDA consider reducing the requirement?\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Oversight of PET Drug Products -- Questions and Answers""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency? If yes, can CDER be notified in an annual report?\n--------------------\nContext: Under 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(v), an applicant may submit one or more protocols (i.e., comparability protocols) describing tests, studies, and acceptance criteria to be achieved to demonstrate the absence of an adverse effect from specified types of changes. A comparability protocol can be used to reduce the reporting category for specified changes. A proposed comparability protocol must be submitted as a prior approval supplement, if not approved as part of the original application (21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(v)). On February 25, 2003, FDA issued a draft guidance on comparability protocols entitled Comparability protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information.\n\n4 General Requirements\n\nOther than for editorial changes in previously submitted information (e.g., correction of spelling or typographical errors, reformatting of batch records), an applicant must notify FDA about each change in each condition established in an approved application beyond the variations already provided for in the application (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(i)).\n\nA supplement or annual report must include a list of all changes contained in the supplement or annual report (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(v)). On the list, FDA recommends that the applicant describe each change in enough detail to allow FDA to quickly determine whether the appropriate reporting category has been used. For supplements, this list must be provided in the cover letter (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(v)). In annual reports, the list should be included in the summary section. The supplement or annual report also is required to describe the change fully (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(i)).\n\nAn applicant making a change to an approved application under section 506A of the Act also must conform to other applicable laws and regulations, including current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements of the Act (21 U.S.C. SS 351(a)(2)(B)) and applicable regulations in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (e.g., 21 CFR parts 210, 211, 225, 226, and 514). For example, manufacturers must comply with relevant CGMP validation and recordkeeping requirements (21 CFR parts 210, 211, 225, 226) and ensure that relevant records are readily available for examination by authorized FDA personnel during an inspection.\n\nAn applicant must include a statement in each supplement and amendment to a supplement certifying that a field copy has been provided to the appropriate FDA district office (21 CFR514.8(b)(1)(iv)).3\n\nFootnote 3: For a change to a product manufactured in a foreign facility, a field copy of the supplement or its amendment is not required to be submitted to an FDA district office. However, FDA recommends that the applicant state that the drug made with the change is manufactured only at a foreign site.\n\n4 Assessing the effect of manufacturing changes\n\nAssessment of the Effects of the Change\n\nThe holder of an approved application under section 512 of the Act must assess the effects of the change before distributing a drug made with a manufacturing change (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(ii)).4 For each change, the supplement or annual report must contain information determined by FDA to be appropriate and include the information developed by the applicant in assessing the effects of the change (section 506A(b), (c)(1), (d)(2)(A), and (d)(3)(A) of the Act). The type of information that must be included in a supplemental application or annual report is specified in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(iii), (b)(3)(iv), (b)(3)(vi), and (b)(4)(iii).\n\nFootnote 4: Assess the effects of the change means to evaluate the effects of a manufacturing change on the identity, strength, quality, purity and potency of a drug as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug. (21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(i)). The term assess or assessment as used in this guidance are not the same as validation. Certain validation information, such as sterilization processes, is considered information that is needed to assess the effect of the change as specified in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(ii) and should be submitted in an NADA or ANADA. Unless otherwise specified by FDA, other validation (e.g., process, equipment) data need not be submitted in the application, but must be retained at the facility and be available for review by FDA (see, e.g., 21 CFR 211.180).\n\nConformance to Specifications\n\nAn assessment of the effects of a change on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the drug should include a determination that the drug substance intermediates, drug substance, in-process materials, and/or drug product affected by the change conform to the approved specifications.5 A specification is a quality standard (i.e., tests, analytical procedures, and acceptance criteria) provided in an approved application to confirm the quality of drugs including, for example, drug substances, Type A medicated articles, drug products, intermediates, raw materials, reagents, components, in-process materials, container closure systems, and other materials used in the production of a drug. (21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iv)). Acceptance criteria are numerical limits, ranges, or other criteria for the tests described (21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iv)). Conformance to a specification means that the material, when tested according to the analytical procedures listed in the specification, will meet the listed acceptance criteria.\n\nFootnote 5: If a specification needs to be revised as a result of the change, this would be considered a multiple change (see sections VIII and XI).\n\n3 Contains Non-Binding Recommendations\n\nIn addition to confirming that the material affected by manufacturing changes continues to meet its specification, the applicant should perform additional testing, when appropriate, to assess whether the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a drug as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug have been or will be affected. The assessment should include, as appropriate, evaluation of any changes in the chemical, physical, microbiological, biological, bioavailability, and/or stability profiles. This additional assessment could involve testing of the post-change drug itself or, if appropriate, the material directly affected by the change. The type of additional testing that an applicant should perform would depend on the type of manufacturing change, the type of drug, and the effect of the change on the quality of the drug. For example:\n\nEvaluation of changes in the impurity or degradant profile could first involve profiling using appropriate chromatographic techniques and then, depending on the observed changes in the impurity profile, toxicology tests to qualify a new impurity or degradant or to qualify an impurity that is above a previously qualified level.6 Footnote 6: Recommendations on identifying, qualifying, and reporting impurities can be found in relevant guidances (e.g., VICH GL10(R), Impurities in New Veterinary Drug Substances (Revision), Draft Revised Guidance, (GFI 92) (January 6, 2006)).\n\nEvaluation of the hardness or friability of a tablet after certain changes.\n\nAssessment of the effect of a change on bioequivalence could include, for example, multipoint and/or multimedia dissolution profiling and/or an in vivo bioequivalence study.\n\nEvaluation of extractables from new packaging components or moisture permeability of a new container closure system.\n\nAn applicant should refer to all relevant FDA guidance documents for recommendations on the information that should be submitted to support a given change. If guidance for information that should be submitted to support a particular change is not available, CVM's Division of Manufacturing Technologies, HFV-140, should be consulted.\n\nEquivalence\n\nWhen testing is performed, the applicant should assess the extent to which the manufacturing change has affected the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the drug product. Typically, this is accomplished by comparing test results from pre- andpost-change material and determining if the test results are equivalent. Simply stated: Is the drug made after the change equivalent to the drug made before the change? Equivalence comparisons frequently have a criterion for comparison with calculation of confidence intervals relative to a predetermined equivalence interval. For this, as well as for other reasons, equivalent does not necessarily mean identical. Equivalence also may relate to maintenance of a quality characteristic (e.g., stability) rather than a single performance of a test.\n\nAdverse Effect\n\nSome manufacturing changes have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug. In many cases, the applicant chooses not to implement these manufacturing changes, but sometimes the applicant wishes to do so. If an assessment indicates that a change has adversely affected the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug, FDA recommends that the change be submitted in a prior approval supplement, regardless of the recommended reporting category for the change. For example, a process change recommended for a changes-being-effected-in-30-days supplement could cause the formation of a new degradant that requires qualification and/or identification. The applicant's degradation qualification procedures may indicate that there are no safety concerns relating to the new degradant. Even so, the applicant should submit this change in a prior approval supplement with appropriate information to support the continued safety and effectiveness of the drug. During the review of the prior approval supplement, FDA will assess the impact of any adverse effect on the drug as this change may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #83 Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Changes to Approved NADA:ANADA""]","['The site described would be considered a secondary packaging site. CGMP requirements extend beyond packaging and repackaging operations that involve direct product contact.

The signed and dated pathology report (raw data)4 is critical in facilitating a thorough review of the toxicologic potential of a specific investigational product.\n\nFootnote 4: The final rule, “Good Laboratory Practice Regulations,” published September 4, 1987 (21 CFR Part 58).\n\nTesting facility management should implement appropriate measures to ensure that the conduct of all phases of GLP toxicology studies, including the generation of the pathology report, is free from undue influence impacting the conclusions of the studies. Regarding pathology peer review, the independence of both the study pathologist and the peer-review pathologist(s) throughout the process should be ensured by both the management of the nonclinical testing facility and the sponsor or the applicant. Measures to ensure transparency can include, among other options, the implementation of an audit trail, or conducting contemporaneous peer review after the study pathologist's diagnoses are fixed or locked in an electronic system.\n\nDiverging diagnoses, interpretations, or conclusions between the study pathologist and peer-review pathologist(s) should be addressed using a transparent and unbiased process that is clearly described in written procedures (see Q9).\n\nQ9: How are differences in interpretation that result from pathology peer review addressed?\n\nA9: If no resolution of differences in diagnoses and interpretations can be reached during pathology peer review, the study pathologist and peer-review pathologist should carefully follow a transparent and unbiased process that is clearly described in written procedures (i.e., SOPs, study protocol, or study protocol amendment) for addressing diagnostic and interpretative differences during pathology peer review.\n\nDepending upon the directives of the written procedures, consensus could be achieved through consultation with additional experienced pathologists (e.g., PWG). Records of communications pertinent to differences of opinion relevant to the pathology peer review, including but not limited to records of meetings (e.g., meeting minutes), should be retained in the study file. Adherence to written procedures should be documented.

Pathology peer review can help to ensure the quality and accuracy of histopathological diagnoses and interpretations.\n\nCausal discussions, opinion exchange, and mentoring among pathologists do not constitute pathology peer review and are not covered by this guidance document.\n\nQ2: Who should conduct a pathology peer review?\n\nA2: A peer-review pathologist should have a combination of appropriate education, training, and experience to be qualified to render opinions on the study pathologist's histological descriptions. It can be beneficial for a peer-review pathologist to have experience with the route of administration, contact type and duration of the test article, species and strains of animals being tested, and duration and design of the study. It can also be beneficial for a peer-review pathologist to have knowledge of the mechanism of action of the test article and knowledge of the results of test article administration at other dose levels or in other species.\n\nQ3: When can pathology peer review occur?\n\nA3: Pathology peer review can occur before finalization (contemporaneous) or after finalization (retrospective) of the study pathologist's report (i.e., signed and dated pathology report). Pathology peer review that occurs before finalization of the study pathologist's report is considered contemporaneous peer review. When pathology peer review occurs before the finalization of the study pathologist's report, the study pathologist should prepare a written narrative that describes the diagnoses and interpretations of available slides before the contemporaneous peer review occurs.\n\nPathology peer review that occurs after finalization of the pathology report is considered retrospective peer review. When pathology peer review occurs retrospectively, the study pathologist should document any changes to the diagnoses and interpretations that result from the retrospective peer-review process in an amendment to the pathology report. When pathology peer review occurs after the final study report is signed, the study director should amend the final study report as necessary to reflect changes in histopathology diagnoses and interpretations.\n\nQ4: How should pathology peer review be documented, and what should be included in the peer-review statement?\n\nA4: It is important that the peer-review process be well documented and transparent. When either a contemporaneous or a retrospective pathology peer review is part of a GLP toxicology study, the activity should be included in the study protocol or protocol amendment. The process should be guided by written procedures to establish the extent of the review and ensure the integrity of the study. Because the study pathologist is responsible for the overall pathology data, the pathology report will reflect the study pathologist's best scientific opinion and judgment regarding the diagnoses and pathological interpretations.\n\nPathology peer review should be planned, conducted, documented, and reported in accordance with established written procedures. These written procedures should be available to the peer-review pathologist(s) prior to the initiation of peer review as SOPs, or in the study protocol or study-protocol amendment.\n\nThe peer-review pathologist(s) should generate a signed and dated peer-review statement (document, report, memorandum, or certificate) for inclusion in the final study report. All peer-review pathologists' signature blocks (identity and affiliation) should be included in the peer-review statement that is contained in the final study report.\n\nThe peer-review statement should be signed and dated by the peer-review pathologist(s) and include the following information:\n\nWho performed the peer-review and the date(s) it was performed\n\nWhether the peer-review was performed contemporaneously or retrospectively\n\nWhether the peer-review was conducted in compliance with GLP regulations\n\nWhat tissues were examined microscopically, corresponding animal identification number, dose/treatment group, and the basis for their selection\n\nWhat format (e.g., glass slides or whole slide images) was used_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nWhether the terminology, diagnoses, and interpretations used in the pathology report were agreed upon by both the study and peer-review pathologist(s)\n\nWhether a narrative report prepared by the study pathologist was reviewed either prior to or during peer review (for contemporaneous review only)\n\nWhat data and documents were utilized during the peer review (a listing)\n\nIf the peer-review pathologist concurs with the diagnoses and interpretations of the study pathologist, the peer-review statement might not include a comprehensive analysis of the outcome of the peer review. Under these conditions, sponsors or applicants can submit a statement explaining that a peer review was conducted, and the final pathology report reflects the consensus opinions of the study pathologist and peer-review pathologist(s). If no resolution of differences in diagnoses and interpretations can be reached during pathology peer review, the study pathologist and peer-review pathologist should carefully follow a transparent and unbiased process that is clearly described in written procedures (i.e., SOPs, study protocol, or study protocol amendment) for addressing diagnostic and interpretative differences during pathology peer review (as discussed further in Q9).\n\nAny changes to the diagnoses and interpretations by the study pathologist as a result of a contemporaneous peer review do not need to be documented in the study pathology report, as contemporaneous peer review is considered part of the iterative diagnostic pathology process. Any changes to the diagnoses and interpretations by the study pathologist as a result of a retrospective peer-review should be documented in the peer-review statement and in an amendment to the study pathologist's report.\n\nQ5: Can pathology peer review for a GLP toxicology study be conducted at a site that does not have an established quality system that complies with GLP regulations?\n\nA5: Yes, it is possible to conduct the pathology peer review for a GLP toxicology study at a site that does not have an established quality system that complies with GLP regulations provided the integrity of the study is protected. It is preferable that the peer-review pathologist(s) perform the peer review under a GLP-compliant quality system after receiving training on GLP regulations and relevant SOPs. If the pathology peer review is not conducted under a GLP-compliant quality system, that fact should be recorded within the study protocol and final study report. The name, affiliation, and work address of the peer-review pathologist(s) should be included in the final study report. Also, the name, qualifications (including GLP training), affiliations, and work address of the peer-review pathologist(s) should be documented in the peer-review pathologist's training files and retained at the testing facility.\n\nQ6: When should the peer-review statement be signed, and should the peer-review pathologist sign the pathology report?\n\nA6: The peer-review statement for a contemporaneous review can be signed by the peer-review pathologist before or after the study pathologist's report is signed. The peer-review statement for a retrospective review is by definition signed by the peer-review pathologist(s) after the study pathologist report is signed. The pathology report is the sole responsibility of the study pathologist, and the peer-review pathologist(s) should not sign the final pathology report. Anychanges to a study pathologist's report resulting from a retrospective pathology peer-review should be documented in an amendment to the study pathologist's report.\n\nQ7: Should the signed peer-review statement be included in the final study report?\n\nA7: Yes, the signed peer-review statement should be included in the final study report.\n\nQ8: How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n\nA8: The pathology report is the responsibility of the study pathologist and reflects that individual's diagnoses and interpretations. The signed and dated pathology report (raw data)4 is critical in facilitating a thorough review of the toxicologic potential of a specific investigational product.\n\nFootnote 4: The final rule, “Good Laboratory Practice Regulations,” published September 4, 1987 (21 CFR Part 58).\n\nTesting facility management should implement appropriate measures to ensure that the conduct of all phases of GLP toxicology studies, including the generation of the pathology report, is free from undue influence impacting the conclusions of the studies. Regarding pathology peer review, the independence of both the study pathologist and the peer-review pathologist(s) throughout the process should be ensured by both the management of the nonclinical testing facility and the sponsor or the applicant. Measures to ensure transparency can include, among other options, the implementation of an audit trail, or conducting contemporaneous peer review after the study pathologist's diagnoses are fixed or locked in an electronic system.\n\nDiverging diagnoses, interpretations, or conclusions between the study pathologist and peer-review pathologist(s) should be addressed using a transparent and unbiased process that is clearly described in written procedures (see Q9).\n\nQ9: How are differences in interpretation that result from pathology peer review addressed?\n--------------------\nContext title: Pathology Peer Review in Nonclinical Toxicology Studies- Questions and Answers""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n--------------------\nContext: III Questions and Answers\n\nQ1: What is whole slide imaging?\n\nA1: Whole slide imaging includes the software and hardware used to generate a two-dimensional digital image4 of a glass histology slide used for routine assessment in generation of the pathology report. The process includes four sequential parts: image acquisition (scanning), image processing, image file storage, and display of images. The FDA does not consider the resulting digital image to be an exact copy of the glass slide. A whole slide image used in a GLP-compliant study should include all the elements from the glass slide that are needed for histopathological examination or pathology peer review.\n\nFootnote 4: Digital images comprise a sequence of small images (referred to as tiles) taken from distinct locations on the glass slide. Whole slide imaging systems typically determine the optimal focal plane at a limited, discrete set of locations on the glass slide and interpolate the optimal focal plane to generate all of the tiles. The individual tiles are then combined to create the “whole slide” image.\n\nQ2: Should whole slide images be retained?\n\nA2: For GLP-compliant nonclinical toxicology studies, if whole slide images are assessed in lieu of the original glass slides and result in the generation of pathology raw data, the whole slide image files should be retained as study records and archived. Consideration should be given to ensure that archived digital images remain viewable as software/hardware updates/versions are implemented.\n\nQ3: If the whole slide image files are retained, should the glass slides also be retained?\n\nA3: Yes. The glass slides contain study specimens and must be retained as study specimens after study finalization in accordance with 21 CFR part 58.\n\nQ4: What should be retained with respect to the whole slide image file? Should modified whole slide image files be retained?\n\nA4: The whole slide image files provided to the study pathologist for histopathological examination and/or provided to the peer review pathologist(s) for pathology peer review (i.e., files containing all image data captured by the scanner and documentation of any technical image processing modifications), referred to here as the original whole slide image files, should be retained if they are used to generate raw data. Specifically, any technical image processing modifications made to whole slide image files prior to being provided to the pathologist (e.g., smoothing, color manipulation) should be documented and retained. Technical image processing should not obscure elements captured from the glass slide (e.g., label, artifact).\n\nThe pathologist should not permanently alter the original whole slide image files. Nonpermanent adjustments made by the pathologist using the image viewing software during whole slide image evaluation (e.g., brightness, contrast, annotations) do not need to be documented or retained.\n\nQ5: Should written procedures for whole slide imaging processes be in place?\n\nA5: Yes, written procedures for whole slide imaging processes should be in place because whole slide images may be used to generate raw data. These processes may include, for example, training, slide scanning, software management, and file access and exchange control.\n\nQ6: Should the whole slide imaging system be validated?\n\nA6: If the whole slide images are used to generate raw data, the whole slide imaging system (including software and hardware) should be validated in a manner specific to the intended use of the technology.\n\nQ7: Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n\nA7: If the whole slide images are used to generate raw data, they should be protected to prevent loss or alteration of data, maintain chain of custody, control access, and secure data systems and data transmission. These measures should be performed following written procedures and processes in compliance with electronic record requirements under 21 CFR part 11 to maintain whole slide image file integrity.\n\nQ8: Should the signed pathology report/peer review statement state that whole slide images were evaluated in lieu of glass slides?\n\nA8: Yes, the signed pathology report should state whether glass slides or whole slide images were used for histopathological evaluation by the study pathologist, consistent with 21 CFR 58.\n\nContents\n\n1 Introduction\n\n2 Preliminaries\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_POST]\n\nuidance for Industry Pathology Peer Review in Nonclinical Toxicology Studies: Questions and Answers (December 2021).

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist\'s diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n--------------------\nContext: Traditionally, histopathology has been used to identify morphologic changes associated with an in vivo diagnosis, evaluation of response to therapy, basic research, and nonclinical safety assessment. There is often a strong correlation between specific histopathologic findings and clinical signs, or some clinical chemistry parameters. Thus, histopathology is currently used in some biomarker qualification programs as a reference or truth standard to evaluate the temporal correlation of the biomarker with the evolution and reversibility of the morphologic changes. This guidance is intended to provide recommendations to investigators who conduct nonclinical biomarker qualification studies when histopathology is used as a reference or truth standard.\n\nThis guidance is not intended to address the use of histopathology in traditional drug development nonclinical safety assessment studies. Biomarker qualification studies are different from nonclinical safety assessment studies and call for a different scientific paradigm.\n\nNonclinical safety assessment studies are conducted primarily for hazard characterization of a specific drug, and histopathologic assessment assists in identifying effects of the drug. In safety assessment studies, it is common practice for the pathologist to evaluate the histopathology knowing the identity of the treatment groups, the clinical signs, hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, organ weight, and gross pathology data, and then to integrate this information in a unified, physiologically plausible format (Crissman et al. 2004).\n\nIn contrast, histopathology is used in nonclinical biomarker qualification studies to establish correlative and temporal relationships between the biomarker and morphologic changes.\n\nExamples include (1) establishing a possible quantitative relationship between biomarker level and severity of morphological change; (2) exploring the kinetics of release, clearance of the biomarker, and correlative histomorphology; (3) determining the range of normal variability of the biomarker and any associated morphologic findings; and (4) identifying potentially confounding factors for use of the biomarker. Particularly in confirmatory nonclinical biomarker qualification studies, histopathology can be used as a reference or truth standard. In these cases, the pathologist should function as an impartial interpreter, uninfluenced by other information, and unequivocally blinded to novel biomarker value and comparator value (e.g., standard clinical chemistry value) and preferably to assigned treatment group.\n\nAlthough this guidance is not intended to apply to the conduct of nonclinical safety assessment studies, biomarker data, either exploratory or confirmatory, can be gathered from safety assessment studies to support the qualification of a biomarker. For example, data collected following ""Best Practices,"" such as those outlined by Burkhardt et al. 2011, can be used as supportive data, regardless of whether the data were derived from safety assessment studies or dedicated qualification studies. We recommend that biomarker developers consult with the FDA prior to initiating dual purpose safety assessment-qualification studies.\n\nQualification of a biomarker is a regulatory conclusion, and thus, the studies used to support qualification are expected to be scientifically valid, of high quality, and unbiased.\n\nIII Establishing performance characteristics of biomarkers\n\nMethodology for Detection of the Biomarker (Biomarker Assay)\n\nBiomarker detection can be based on several different methodologies (e.g., biochemical measurements, physiologic organ function tests, or imaging of structural features ranging from molecular to anatomic levels). The method of biomarker detection provides the measurements that are the basis for comparison of the biomarker to the reference or truth standard of histopathology and, therefore, is critical to biomarker characterization. Thus, the detection system should be well characterized.6\n\nFootnote 6: See FDA’s draft guidance for industry Bioanalytical Method Validation (Revision 1). In the Federal Register of September 13, 2013 (78 FR 56718), FDA published a notice announcing the availability of the revised draft guidance. When finalized, it will represent the Agency’s current thinking on the topic.\n\nFor example, for a biochemical biomarker, the assay used to measure the biomarker should have scientifically rigorous analytical sensitivity and analytical specificity. An assay with poor sensitivity or one that is inhibited by other substances in the biological sample or matrix could lead to a false negative result by failing to detect initial changes in biomarker levels. An assay with poor specificity would not distinguish injury to a nontarget organ or the assay may cross-react with nonspecific substances in the specimen. Thus, the biomarker assay should reliably and reproducibly detect changes (increase or decrease) or absence of changes in biomarker levels. Interpretation of any detected change in biomarker levels should ultimately include an assessment of whether the change is biologically meaningful through comparison to the histopathology.\n\nConsiderations for biomarker detection based on biochemical measurements also apply to biomarker detection based on other methodologies such as imaging technologies (e.g., positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, radiology). Histopathology used as a reference or truth standard provides an independent means of evaluating the same variable that is assessed by the biomarker.\n\nBiological Performance of the Biomarker\n\nii.2.1 Performance Characteristics\n\nIt is highly unlikely that any biomarker will be 100 percent specific or 100 percent sensitive.\n\nThe proposed context of use for a biomarker determines the specific performance characteristics that can be used to support qualification. Studies intended to establish the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the biomarker should be relevant to the proposed context of use. A reference or truth standard such as histopathology provides an independent means of evaluating the same parameter that the biomarker is intended to assess.\n\nii.2.2 Biomarker Sensitivity and Temporal Correlation\n\nIn contrast to analytical sensitivity, biomarker sensitivity is related to (1) the probability of identifying a morphologic effect, (2) the threshold of morphologic change that would cause a discernible change in the biomarker level, and (3) the time interval before or after a morphologic effect until a change in the biomarker level can be detected.\n\nBiomarker sensitivity is the probability that a biomarker will indicate a specific morphologic change when the change is present. If the biomarker is 100 percent sensitive, it will never be negative in the presence of the specific morphologic change that it is designed to detect.\n\nThe temporal relationship between the initial change in biomarker level and the onset of histopathologic change defines the biomarker sensitivity. Accurate characterization of this temporal relationship is important to optimizing the biomarker sensitivity.\n\nThe timing and frequency of biomarker measurement in qualification studies should allow for a clear interpretation of the temporal relationship of the biomarker with morphologic changes. The time frame and mechanism by which an agent (e.g., mechanical, chemical, natural disease) produces morphologic changes in tissue should be understood and considered when planning the time course of sampling and/or analysis in biomarker qualification studies.\n\nHistopathologic evaluation using light microscopy with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is preferred in qualification studies, when this is the method that will be used in the context of use of the biomarker. For treatment-induced histopathologic changes in animals, the temporal relationship between changes in biomarker levels and detectable morphologic changes, as observed by light microscopy and H&E staining, usually can be described by one of the following statements, as indicated by appropriate supportive data:\n\nThe initial change in biomarker levels precedes the onset of morphologic changes.\n\nThe initial change in biomarker levels is approximately concurrent with the onset of morphologic changes.\n\nThe initial change in biomarker levels occurs only after the development of morphologic change.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSimilarly, when there is a relationship between morphologic and biomarker changes during reversal or recovery, morphologic changes may be preceded by, concurrent with, or followed by changes in the biomarker levels. Sometimes recovery from morphologic changes may be unrelated to changes in the biomarker levels.\n\nThere are several potential causes for false negative biomarker results (when a morphologic effect is not accompanied by an expected change in biomarker). These include (1) low analytical sensitivity, (2) interference of other proteins or substances with the assay, (3) inconsistent expression of the biomarker under different physiologic or pathologic conditions, (4) a prolonged latency in biomarker change relative to the morphologic effect, (5) the morphologic effect being caused by a mechanism other than the one measured by the biomarker, (6) mishandling of a specimen, or (7) inadequate sampling of a specimen.\n\nHistopathologic sensitivity depends on the histopathologic methods of examination. The use of light microscopy for the initial evaluation of biomarker sensitivity is preferable. Special methods (e.g., electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry) may be useful to investigate whether small or early changes in biomarker levels are associated with histopathologic changes too subtle to be detected by light microscopy with H&E stain.\n--------------------\nContext title: Considerations for Use of Histopathology and Its Associated Methodologies to Support Biomarker Qualification Guidance for Industry'

46,"Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?","['--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?\n--------------------\nContext: This guidance does not address how to link a repackager SNI to a manufacturer SNI, nor does it address standards for prescription drug SNI at levels other than the package-level including, for example, the case- and pallet-levels. Standards for track and trace, authentication, and validation are also not addressed in this guidance because this guidance only addresses the standardized numerical identifier itself and not implementation or application issues.\n\nIII Standardized Numerical Identifiers\n\nWhat should be a package-level SNI for most prescription drugs?\n\nThe SNI for most prescription drug packages should be a serialized National Drug Code (sNDC). The sNDC is composed of the National Drug Code (NDC) (as set forth in 21 CFR Part 207) that corresponds to the specific drug product (including the particular package configuration)4 combined with a unique serial number, generated by the manufacturer or repackager for each individual package. Serial numbers should be numeric (numbers) or alphanumeric (include letters and/or numbers) and should have no more than 20 characters (letters and/or numbers). An example is shown below with a 10-character NDC.\n\nFootnote 4: In the case of repackaged drugs, each package type should have an NDC that corresponds to the repacker or private label distributor for whom the drug is repacked and to the new package configuration.\n\nWhat should be the package-level SNI for certain biological products that do not use NDC numbers?\n\nSome prescription drugs approved under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, such as blood and blood components and certain minimally manipulated human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), do not currently use NDC numbers. Examples of HCT/Ps that do not use NDC numbers include allogeneic placental/umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood progenitor cells, and donor lymphocytes for infusion. Instead, such productscurrently use other recognized standards for identification and labeling, such as ISBT 128, which creates a unique identification number for each product package. See\n\nhttp://iccbba.org/about gettoknowisbt128.html, ""Guidance for Industry: Recognition and Use of a Standard for Uniform Blood and Blood Component Container Labels,""\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/BiopicicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Blood/ucm073362.htm.) The SNI for these products should be the unique identification number created for each package under these other recognized standards, such as ISBT 128.5\n\nFootnote 5: FDA currently also recognizes Codabar as a standard for blood and blood component container labels. We note that ISBT 128 is becoming the more widely-used industry standard.\n\nDoes the SNI include expiration date and/or lot or batch number?\n\nExpiration date and/or lot or batch numbers are not part of the recommended SNI. Expiration date and/or lot or batch numbers are already accessible because FDA regulations require the inclusion of this information on the label of each drug product. (See 21 CFR SSS 201.17, 201.18, 211.130, 211.137, 610.60, and 610.61.) In addition, the SNI can be linked to databases containing this and other information. Addition of this information within the SNI will unnecessarily increase the length of, and introduce complexity into, the SNI. However, if a manufacturer or repackager chooses to include expiration date and/or lot or batch number with the SNI, it should ensure that the resulting number still permits users to distinguish and make use of the SNI. For example, expiration date and lot or batch number may be incorporated in accordance with the GS1 standards for use of Global Trade Item Numbers (GTIN)6 (discussed below in Section F).\n\nWhy did FDA select the serialized NDC for package-level SNI for most prescription drugs?\n\nFDA chose the sNDC as the package-level SNI for most prescription drugs because we believe that it serves the needs of the drug supply chain as a means of identifying individual prescription drug packages,7 which in turn should facilitate authentication and tracking and tracing of those drugs. Most prescription drug product packages already have an NDC on them. By combining a serial number of up to 20 characters with the NDC, the sNDC should be sufficiently robust to support billions of units of marketed products without duplication of an SNI. This approach will allow manufacturers and repackagers to assign serial numbers to combine with the NDC for unique identification of individual product packages. The SNI can also be linked to databases containing such product attributes as lot or batch number, expiration date, distribution/transaction history information, and other identifiers related to a product. As already noted, defining the SNI is expected to be a first step to facilitate the development of other standards and systems for securing the drug supply chain. Many aspects of the implementation of package-level identification will take shape in the future, as the standards that make use of SNI are developed.\n\nFootnote 7: As described above, ISBT-128 and Codabar serve the same function for certain biologics that lack NDCs.\n\nShould the SNI be in human- and machine-readable forms?\n\nFDA believes that an SNI generally should be applied to each package in both human-readable and machine-readable forms. However, at this time, FDA is not specifying the means of incorporating the SNI onto the package. The SNIs described in this guidance are compatible with, and flexible for, encoding into a variety of machine-readable forms of data carriers, such as2-dimensional bar codes and radio-frequency identification (RFID),8 leaving options open as technologies for securing the supply chain continue to be identified, and standards making use of SNI are developed. A redundant human-readable SNI on the package would provide the ability to identify the package when electronic means are unavailable (e.g., in the event of hardware/software failure). Due to the wide-variety of packaging required to accommodate different products and product integrity needs, FDA also is not specifying a location on the package where an SNI should be placed. If the NDC is already printed on the package in human-readable form, then the serial number could be printed in human-readable form in a non-contiguous manner elsewhere on the product package. Any SNI placed on the package must not obstruct FDA-required labeling information9 and should be placed in a manner that allows it to be readily scanned/viewed without damaging the integrity of the packaging or product..\n\nFootnote 8: FDA’s enforcement policy with respect to the application of current good manufacturing practices to RFID technology is provided in Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Section 400.210. See http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074357.htm. This CPG would apply if an SNI were embedded into an RFID tag.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 502(c) of the Act.\n\nF. Is the SNI that FDA is recommending compatible with international standards? In addition to facilitating other actions to secure the drug supply chain, adoption of the sNDC as the SNI for most prescription drugs, and of other recognized standards, such as ISBT 128, for certain biological products, satisfies the requirement in 505D(b)(2) that the SNI developed by FDA be harmonized, to the extent practicable, with internationally recognized standards for such an identifier. Specifically, use of an sNDC is compatible with, and may be presented within, a GTIN, which can be serialized using an Application Identifier (AI) [(21)] to create a serialized GTIN (sGTIN) for use with RFID or for certain barcodes.10 GTIN is a global standard for item and object identification, established by GS1, a consensus-based, not-for-profit, international\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]\n--------------------\nContext title: Standards for Securing the Drug Supply Chain - Standardized Numerical Identification for Prescription Drug Packages Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?\n--------------------\nContext: Product that has been previously or is currently the subject of a drug shortage (see a list of current drugs in shortage at http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/Shortages/default_htm and https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/drugshortages/default.cfm for more information).\n\nProduct that has been or is the subject a public alert or announcement related to drug quality issued by a trading partner or FDA.\n\nProduct that has been or is the subject of an FDA counterfeit or cargo theft alert (See http://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/counterfeitmedicine/default.htm and http://www.fda.gov/iceci/criminalinvestigations/ucm182888.htm for more information).\n\nAppearance of the Product\n\nAppearance of a package or a container used for transport (e.g., case or tote) that seems questionable (e.g., it has a label that contains misspellings or appears different from the standard label for that product in color, font, images, or otherwise).\n\nPackage that exhibits unusual or excessive adhesive residue.\n\nPackage that contains foreign identification features (such as a different drug identification number where a National Drug Code (NDC) number would be expected).\n\nPackage that is missing information, such as the lot number or other lot identification, or the expiration date.\n\nPackage that is missing security or anti-counterfeiting technologies normally featured on the FDA-approved product that are easily visible to the eye, such as holograms, color shifting inks, neckbands, or watermarks.\n\nFinished dosage form that seems questionable (e.g., it has a different shape or color from the FDA-approved product, a different or unusual imprint, an unusual odor, or there are signs of poor quality like chips or cracks in tablet coatings or smeared or unclear ink imprints).\n\nRecommendations on How Trading Partners Might Identify Suspect Product and Determine Whether the Product Is a Suspect Product as Soon as Practicable\n\nThe following are recommendations for trading partners, as applicable, on ways that they can expeditiously identify suspect product and determine whether the product is suspect (and, after investigation, whether it is illegitimate). In general, trading partners should exercise due diligence and shall only conduct business with authorized trading partners.7 Trading partners should discuss with each other any observations, questions, or concerns they have related to the status of a drug as a suspect product to aid them in determining whether the drug should be considered a suspect product. Because a product\'s manufacturer is usually the best able to assess the authenticity and quality of a product, a trading partner should consult with the manufacturer when conducting any investigation of suspect product. Trading partners should also contact regulatory authorities, law enforcement, or other available resources to aid in that determination when additional expertise is called for to make an accurate assessment of the status of a drug as a suspect product. If a trading partner receives a product in a secured transport container or sealed homogenous case, trading partners should examine the appearance of that container as recommended below. If trading partners observe anything questionable, they should take steps to ascertain whether the product inside the transport container is suspect. Strategies to identify suspect product include, but are not limited to, the following recommendations:\n\nBe alert for offers of product for sale at a very low price or one that is ""too good to be true.""\n\nClosely examine the package and the transport container (such as the case or tote):\n\nTo look for signs that it has been compromised (e.g., opened, broken seal, damaged, repaired, or otherwise altered). If a trading partner receives a product in a secured transport container or sealed homogenous case, trading partners should examine the appearance of that container to see if anything about that appearance seems questionable, such as shrink wrap that has unexpected markings, or a seal that is broken, torn, or repaired. Such examinations may include:\n\nSeeing if the package or the transport container has changed since the last shipment of the same product type was received for an unexplained reason (e.g., a notification about the change from the manufacturer has not been received).\n\nSeeing if product inserts are missing, do not correspond to the product, or are questionable in some way.\n\nFor shipping addresses, postmarks, or other materials indicating that the product came from an unexpected foreign entity or source.\n\nClosely examine the label on the package, and the label on the individual retail unit, if applicable, for:\n\nAny missing information, such as the lot number or other lot identification, NDC, or strength of the drug.\n\nAny altered product information, such as smudged print or print that is very difficult to read.\n\nMisspelled words.\n\nBubbling in the surface of a label.\n\nLack of an ""Rx only"" symbol.8 Footnote 8: Or, for products distributed solely in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or any other territory where the predominant language is Spanish, “Solamente Rx” (21 CFR 201.16).\n\nForeign language with little or no English provided.9 Footnote 9: Except for products distributed solely in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or any other territory where the predominant language is one other than English (21 CFR 201.15 (c)(1)).\n\nForeign language that is used to describe the lot number.10 Footnote 10: Except for products distributed solely in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or any other territory where the predominant language is one other than English (21 CFR 201.15 (c)(1)).\n\nA product name that differs from the name that appears on the FDA-approved drug label or labeling.\n\nA product name that is the product name for a foreign version of the drug.\n\nA product that is transported in a case or tote, when not expected under the circumstances.\n\nLot numbers and expiration dates on product that do not match the lot numbers and expiration dates of its outer container.\n\nAgain, under section 582 of the FD&C Act, trading partners must have systems in place that enable them, upon determining that a product in their possession or control is suspect or upon receiving a request for verification from the FDA that has made a determination that a product within the possession or control of the trading partner is a suspect product, to quarantine suspect product and promptly conduct an investigation, in coordination with the manufacturer and other trading partners, as applicable, to determine whether a suspect product is illegitimate. In addition, trading partners must, as applicable, make the notifications described in section 582(b)(4)(B)(ii)(I), (c)(4)(B)(ii), (d)(4)(B)(ii), and (e)(4)(B) of the FD&C Act related to illegitimate product determinations and, for manufacturers, the notification of a high risk of illegitimacy described in section 582(b)(4)(B)(ii)(II).\n\nFor Manufacturers: High Risk of Illegitimacy Notifications\n\nSection 582(b)(4)(B)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act requires manufacturers to make notifications in certain circumstances for suspect products that pose a high risk of illegitimacy. The provision states as follows:\n\n(II) HIGH RISK OF ILLEGITIMACY.-A manufacturer shall notify the Secretary and immediate trading partners that the manufacturer has reason to believe may have in the trading partner\'s possession a product manufactured by, or purported to be a product manufactured by, the manufacturer not later than 24 hours after determining or being notified by the Secretary or a trading partner that there is a high risk that such product is an illegitimate product. For purposes of this subclause, a \'high risk\' may include a specific high risk that could increase the likelihood that illegitimate product will enter the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain and other high risks as determined by the Secretary in guidance pursuant to subsection (h).\n\nWhile suspect product generally does not require notification, FDA interprets this provision to require manufacturers to notify (1) FDA and (2) the manufacturer\'s immediate trading partners(that the manufacturer has reason to believe may have in the trading partner\'s possession a product manufactured by, or purported to be a product manufactured by, the manufacturer) where the circumstances surrounding the suspect product include at least one of three types of high risk factors described below:\n\nWithin 24 hours after determining or being notified by FDA or a trading partner that there is a high risk that a product that the manufacturer has reason to believe is in an immediate trading partner\'s possession is an illegitimate product.\n\nWithin 24 hours after determining or being notified by FDA or a trading partner that there is a specific high risk that could increase the likelihood that illegitimate product will enter the U.S. pharmaceutical distribution supply chain.\n\nWithin 24 hours after determining or being notified by FDA or a trading partner that there exists an ""other high risk"" as determined by FDA in guidance pursuant to subsection 582(h).\n\nFDA believes that Congress intended section 582(b)(4)(B)(ii)(II) to give flexibility to manufacturers to determine systems and processes needed for verification, including the surveillance systems that many manufacturers already have in place to detect counterfeit and otherwise violative versions of their products. Manufacturers may discover product with a high risk of illegitimacy either through their own investigation of suspect product, or through information they receive from a variety of other sources, including from within their own company, from their trading partners, from FDA, or from other domestic and/or foreign regulatory authorities.\n\nBelow are scenarios and examples in which a manufacturer should make a notification under section 582(b)(4)(B)(ii)(II).\n--------------------\nContext title: Drug Supply Chain Security Act Implementation- Identification of Suspect Product and Notification Guidance for Industry'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?\n--------------------\nContext: The Agency considers appropriate pharmacovigilance fundamentally important for biological products. Although safety of biological products is rigorously assessed before approval, safety issues that are specific to a manufacturer may arise after approval with any marketed product. To help ensure patient safety and allow the Agency and the manufacturer to swiftly identify and address a problem, FDA aims to track adverse events to a specific manufacturer (and as appropriate, to a lot or manufacturing site for a particular biological product) and allow surveillance systems to detect safety signals throughout the life cycle of a product. Identifying a biological product's manufacturer can help target remedial action (including recall) to avoid implicating a broader set of products for which no such problem exists.\n\nPharmacovigilance systems, both active and passive, vary in their use of identifiers to differentiate among biological products. These identifiers may include the proprietary name, proper name, manufacturer, national drug code (NDC) number, lot number, and billing codes. However, many active pharmacovigilance systems, which generally identify adverse events by querying privately held electronic health care data such as administrative and billing data, have limited ability to track to its manufacturer a biological product that shares the same proper name with other biological products. Other product identifiers, such as NDC numbers, are not routinely recorded in billing and patient records in many clinical settings in which biological products are dispensed and administered, and therefore the utility of these alternative identifiers in active pharmacovigilance is limited. Similarly, proprietary names and NDC numbers are often not included in adverse event reports. As a result, the use of alternative identifiers, including distinct proprietary names or NDC numbers, is insufficient to address concerns regarding pharmacovigilance.\n\nNonproprietary names that include distinguishing suffixes can serve as a key element to identify specific products in spontaneous adverse event reporting and to reinforce accurate product identification in billing and claims records used for active pharmacovigilance. Other product-specific identifiers, such as proprietary names or NDCs, may not be available or could change over time. A distinguishing suffix will also support the tracking of product-specific events over time, thereby enhancing the accurate attribution of product-specific adverse event reports.8\n\nFootnote 8: See the draft guidance for industry Postmarketing Safety Reporting for Human Drugs and Biological Products Including Vaccines. When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nThe Agency's approach to nonproprietary naming of biological products will provide another critical tool for accurately identifying and facilitating pharmacovigilance for originator biological products, related biological products, and biosimilar products.\n\nEnsuring Safe Use for Biological Products\n\nBiological products generally consist of large, complex molecules and raise unique safety concerns related to immunogenicity. FDA believes the nonproprietary naming convention for originator biological products, related biological products, or biosimilar products should help prevent inadvertent substitution. Inadvertent substitution may lead to unintended alternating or switching of biological products that are not determined by FDA to be interchangeable with each other. This naming convention should facilitate safe use and help to protect the safety of patients.\n\nRelated biological products may be licensed for different indications. Biosimilar products may be licensed for fewer than all indications for which the reference product is licensed. Likewise, related biological products and biosimilar products may be licensed for fewer than all routes of administration and may be packaged in different delivery systems than those approved for the originator biological product. If originator biological products, related biological products, and biosimilar products all share the same proper name, inadvertent substitution may lead to medication errors. For example, a patient could inadvertently receive a product with a different delivery system or route of administration than was prescribed, which may lead to confusion among patients and result in dosing errors.\n\nConfusion may also arise among health care providers who, based on their experience with small-molecule drugs and generic versions of those drugs, may incorrectly assume that FDA has determined biological products with the same proper name to be interchangeable. Information on alternating or switching between a proposed product and its reference product is required to support a demonstration of interchangeability, but is not required to support a demonstration of biosimilarity (see section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act). Applications for related biological products are not required to include any comparative data to any other biological product in support of licensure (see section 351(a) of the PHS Act). Although many biological products may have proprietary names, many health care systems mainly use proper names instead of proprietary names for ordering, prescribing, and dispensing products.\n\nThe naming convention discussed in this guidance will also facilitate use of the Purple Book9 for biological products. The Purple Book enables a user to readily see all licensed biological products and identify whether a biological product licensed under section 351(k) of the PHS Act has been determined by FDA to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference product (a previously licensed biological product). Biosimilar products and interchangeable products licensed under section 351(k) of the PHS Act will be listed under the reference product to which biosimilarity or interchangeability was demonstrated.\n\nFootnote 9: FDA published the Purple Book: Lists of Licensed Biological Products With Reference Product Exclusivity and Biosimilarity or Interchangeability Evaluations in September 2014, which is publicly available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/drugs/developmentapprovalprocess/howdrugsaredevelopedandapproved/approvalapplications/th\n\nerapeuticbiologicalapplications/biosimilars/ucm411418.htm. The Purple Book is updated periodically to reflect FDA license of a biological product under section 351(a) or section 351(k) of the PHS Act and/or to reflect a determination regarding date of first licensure for a biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act.\n\n3 Advancing Appropriate Practices and Perceptions Regarding Biological Products\n\nWith the introduction of more biological products, FDA believes it is important to encourage routine use of designated suffixes in ordering, prescribing, dispensing, recordkeeping, and pharmacovigilance practices for biological products, irrespective of their licensure pathway and date of licensure. The designated suffix will provide a consistent, readily available and recognizable mechanism for patients and health care professionals, including providers and pharmacists, to correctly identify these products. FDA believes it is likely that FDA-designated suffixes will be used routinely when identifying, describing, and recording use of biological products if such suffixes are present in the proper names of all biological products licensed under the PHS Act.\n\n3.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe inclusion of an FDA-designated suffix in the nonproprietary name of biological products licensed under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act should have the added benefit of helping to avoid inaccurate perceptions of the safety and effectiveness of biological products based on their license pathway. The safety and effectiveness of biological products is rigorously assessed before approval. Through FDA's implementation of the BPCI Act's standards for biosimilarity and interchangeability, FDA can ensure that the products it determines to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference product can be relied upon by providers and patients to be safe and effective. Applying this naming convention only for products licensed under section 351(k) of the PHS Act--but not for the reference product licensed under 351(a) of the PHS Act--could adversely affect health care provider and patient perceptions of these new products. Specifically, such an approach could be misinterpreted as indicating that biosimilar products differ from their reference products in a clinically meaningful way or are inferior to their reference products for their approved conditions of use.\n\nProspective and Retrospective Application of Naming Convention\n\nFDA's current thinking is that a proper name that includes a distinguishing suffix is warranted for both newly licensed and previously licensed originator biological products, related biological products, and biosimilar products. As with prospective application of the naming convention, retrospective application will help (1) prevent a patient from receiving a product different from what was intended to be prescribed; (2) facilitate manufacturer-specific pharmacovigilance by providing a means of determining which biological product is dispensed to patients; (3) encourage routine use of FDA-designated suffixes in ordering, prescribing, dispensing, and recordkeeping practices for these products; and (4) advance accurate perceptions of these biological products.\n\nV Framework for designating the proper name of a biological product\n\nFDA's naming convention for biological products licensed under the PHS Act will be a proper name consisting of a core name10 and an FDA-designated suffix. Proper names designated by FDA for originator biological products, related biological products, and biosimilar products will include a combination of a core name and a distinguishing suffix.\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry""

The FDA regionally controlled terminologies are defined in Section G.k, Drug(s) Information, to support use of FDA regional product identifiers and FDA specialized product categories:\n\nMedicinal Product Identifier (MPID) (ISO 11615:2012)\n\nMedicinal Product Name as Reported by the Primary Source\n\nSubstance/Specified Substance TermID (ISO 11238:2012)\n\nAuthorization/Application Number\n\nPharmaceutical Dosage Form TermID (ISO 11239:2012)\n\nFDA Additional Information on Drug\n\nFDA Specialized Product Category\n\n4.2.5.2 Data Element G.k.2.1.1b: Medicinal Product Identifier (MPID)\n\nThe FDA National Drug Code (NDC), when known, should be used as the regional MPID.23 If the NDC or MPID is unknown, please refer to the E2B(R3) Electronic Transmission of ICSRs IG. Information about obtaining a list of the NDCs can be found on the NDC Structured Product Labeling Data Elements (""NDSE"") web page (see https://www.fda.gov/industry/structured-product-labeling-resources/nsde).\n\nFootnote 23: The full three segments of the NDC are technically referred to as Packaged Medicinal Product Identifier (PCID) per ISO 11615. Reporters can use either only the first two segments of the NDC or the full NDC as regional MPID in ICSR reporting to FDA.\n\n4.2.5.3 Data Element G.k.2.2: Medicinal Product Name as Reported by the Primary Source\n\nFDA validates Medicinal Product Names for products marketed in the United States against the available Structured Product Labeling (SPL)24 XML file or the label that was submitted with the ICSR as an attachment. When the product has an SPL file, use the same naming convention in the ICSR as the name appears in the SPL file. When submitting a product label as an attachment to an ICSR, use the name as it appears on the submitted product label.\n\nIf the Medicinal Product Name is not provided but the active substance name is known, provide the active substance as it appears in the FDA SRS Unique Ingredient Identifiers (UNII) (see https://precision.fda.gov/unisearch) list using the free text data element G.k.2.3.r.1, Substance/Specified Substance Name.\n\nIf data element G.k.2.2, Medicinal Product Name as Reported by the Primary Source, is a foreign product trade name, provide the active substance name as it appears in the FDA SRS UNII list using the free text data element G.k.2.3.r.1, Substance/Specified Substance Name. Additionally, provide the foreign product trade name in data element G.k.2.2.\n\n4.2.5.4 Data Element G.k.2.3.r.2b: Substance/Specified Substance TermID\n\nIf the Substance/Specified Substance TermID (data element G.k.2.3.r.2b) is not available, the FDA SRS UNII list should be used to populate data element G.k.2.3.r.1, Substance/Specified Substance Name.\n\nFDA recommends that applicants proactively validate substance information with primary source reporters before preparing the ICSR submission. FDA UNII codes are updated monthly and may be obtained from the FDA SRS UNII list.\n\n4.2.5.5 Data Element G.k.3.1: Authorisation/Application Number\n\nFDA requires the use of a prefix to determine the application type associated with products. For example, for human drug products, include the acronym ""NDA"" or ""ANDA"" immediately followed by the application number with no spaces (e.g., NDA123456, ANDA012345). Table 3 describes format specifications for FDA application numbers and exceptions such as marketed unapproved prescription drug products (use 000000), marketed unapproved nonprescription drug products (use 999999), and compounded products (use COMP99).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \\hline Product Type & FDA Application Type & Recommended Format \\ \\hline Human drug product & NDA/ANDA & NDA123456 or ANDA012345 \\ \\hline Biological product & BLA & BLA123456 \\ \\hline Prescription drug products marketed without an approved application & Rx No Application & 000000 \\ \\hline Non-prescription drug product marketed without an approved application & Non-Rx No Application & 999999 \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 3: FDA Product and Format Specifications\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:22]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:23]\n\nSubmission Rules\n\nThe submission rules define conditions that will result in a negative acknowledgement and not be accepted by FAERS, if not met.

The tab ""Rejection and Warning Rules"" lists the rejection rules that will result in a negative acknowledgement, and the warning rules that will list a warning but result in positive acknowledgement.\n\nForward Compatibility\n\nThe forward compatibility defines the rules to migrate existing FDA regional E2B(R2) data elements to the FDA regional E2B R3 data elements. The document FDA E2B(R3) Forward Compatible Rules lists the data elements and the rules to be applied when moving from E2B(R2) to E2B(R3) format. Additionally, the guidance for industry Appendix I (B) to the ICH E2B(R3) ICSRs Implementation Guide -- Backwards and Forwards Compatibility (April 2022) should be referenced for data elements whose ""Source"" is ICH.\n\nGeneral Data Completion Instruction\n\nRequired and Optional Data Elements\n\nA required data element is one that needs to be present (i.e., not to be omitted) either in the ICSR message or an instance of a repeating data element section within the ICSR message.\n\nA required data element may or may not allow a nullFlavor, depending on the data validation rules associated with the data element.\n\nAn optional data element generally does not have to be included in the message if it does not have a value. But in some cases, a referential data validation rule may necessitate an optional data element be indicated with a nullFlavor under certain circumstances.\n\nThe FDA E2B(R3) Core and Regional Data Elements and Business Rules document lists all data elements, including ICH and FDA regional data elements, and validation rules used to process incoming ICSRs. The Business Rules document provides detailed information on the conformance, format, and where applicable, allowed values, nullFavors, and controlled terminologies for each data element.\n\nRegional extensions not described in the FDA E2B(R3) Core and Regional Data Elements and Business Rules document are not allowed.\n\nDescription in English\n\nAll ICSR data elements should be completed in English with the exceptions of the following elements:\n\n""Reaction/Event as Reported by the Primary Source in Native Language"" (E.i.1.1a);\n\n""Case Summary and Reporter\'s Comments in Native Language"" (H.5.r)\n\nDate/Time Data Elements\n\nActual local dates and times should be used and offset (i.e., +/-ZZzz) is attached where appropriate. A single format (CCYYMMDDhhmmss.UUUU[+/-ZZzz]) is used to represent dates and times. The minimum level of precision for the date data elements is specified in theBusiness Rules; however, as much information as is available (e.g., known) should be provided. Future dates are not acceptable in an ICSR message.\n\nUse of Metric Units\n\nMetric units should be used for measurement values.\n\nVersion of Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)\n\nA single version of MedDRA should be used for all MedDRA coding data elements within the same ICSR (i.e., ICSR message). Therefore, the same MedDRA version should be reflected in all the populated data elements concerning MedDRA version information. However, within a safety message (i.e., a batch of ICSRs), different ICSRs can refer to different MedDRA versions.\n\nStandard Terminologies and Codelists\n\nIf a data element is defined with a specific codelist (in the ""Values"" column of the Business Rules), the associated codelist needs to always be used. Also, when the codelist code is captured as the value of a data element, its text name should be provided in display name to make the XML code human readable.\n\nUse of nullFlavors\n\nNullFlavors are used to explain the reason for the lack of data on required elements. The definitions of nullFlavors are from the E2B(R3) Electronic Transmission of ICSRs IG and can be used as appropriate.\n\nICSR Attachment(s)\n\nIn accordance with E2B(R3) Electronic Transmission of ICSRs IG, ICSR attachments should be sent inline as embedded files using base 64 encoding (refer to E2B(R3) Electronic Transmission of ICSRs IG Section 3.5 (Document Attachments) for further information).

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis document is intended to provide guidance to pharmaceutical manufacturers who want to use physical-chemical identifiers (PCIDs) in solid oral dosage forms (SODFs). A PCID is a substance or combination of substances possessing a unique physical or chemical property that unequivocally identifies and authenticates a drug product or dosage form.\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to pharmaceutical manufacturers on (1) design considerations for incorporating PCIDS into SODFs, (2) supporting documentation to be submitted in new drug applications (NDAs) and abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) to address the proposed incorporation of PCIDs in SODFs, (3) supporting documentation to be submitted in postapproval submissions to report or request approval to incorporate PCIDs into SODFs, and (4) procedures for reporting or requesting approval to incorporate PCIDs into SODFs as a postapproval change.\n\nThe incorporation of components or features used in radiofrequency identification for drug products is outside the scope of this guidance. In addition, this guidance does not apply to manufacturing or formulation changes, made in conjunction with the addition of a PCID, that go beyond simply inserting the PCID into a blending or mixing operation (e.g., adding a PCID to a non-functional tablet film coating is covered by this guidance, but adding a non-functional film coating that contains a PCID to a previously uncoated tablet involves manufacturing changes that are not covered by this guidance). The incorporation of a PCID into the packaging or labeling is not covered in this guidance.\n\nOther guidance documents, which may be applicable to proposed changes outside the scope of this guidance, are located on FDA's guidance Web site2 and should be consulted to help todetermine whether additional reporting or approval procedures may apply to proposed changes outside the scope of this guidance.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in an Agency guidance document means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nPharmaceutical manufacturers aiming to thwart drug product counterfeiting have been investigating readily available technologies that may make drug products more difficult to duplicate. One approach that pharmaceutical manufacturers appear to be considering involves adding a trace amount of an inactive ingredient(s) to an existing section3 of the dosage form. A unique physical-chemical characteristic of that ingredient makes it possible to detect and authenticate legitimate dosage forms, and to identify counterfeits.\n\nFootnote 3: Section is the term used for a discrete, contained solid or a layer in a solid oral dosage form. Any section can be described by its composition, the functional characteristics that distinguish it from other sections in that dosage form, and its position relative to other sections that may be present (e.g., coatings, capsule shells, encapsulated particles, a layer in a bi-layer tablet, and compressed powders).\n\nExamples of substances that may be incorporated into SODFs as PCIDs include inks, pigments, flavors, and molecular taggants. Such PCIDs may allow product authentication by their presence alone or may be used to code the product identity into or onto the SODF.\n\nThere are various available means for presentation and detection of PCIDs (e.g., photolithography, holography, optical microscopy, laser scanning devices, excitation/fluorescence detection). Some identifying characteristics, such as pigments or flavors, could be easily observed by patients, healthcare practitioners, and pharmacies. Others could require the use of a detection instrument (e.g., a scanner, photometric detector, mass spectrometry).\n\nFDA anticipates that many of the ingredients that will ultimately be employed as PCIDs are already used as food additives, colorants, or excipients with established safety profiles.\n\n3 Design Considerations for Incorporation of PCIDs in Solid Oral Dosage Forms\n\nPharmacological and Toxicological Considerations\n\nIf an applicant incorporates a PCID into a solid oral dosage form, we recommend that the ingredients comprising the PCID be pharmacologically inactive so the ingredients can be treated as excipients.\n\nTo minimize toxicological risk, FDA recommends using permissible direct food additives,4 food substances that are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) (including direct food substancesaffirmed as GRAS),5 or those ingredients listed in the FDA Inactive Ingredient Guide (IIG) that have been used in SODFs.6\n\nFootnote 5: See 21 CFR parts 182 and 184.\n\nFootnote 6: See http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/iig/index.cfm.\n\nCertain substances could present a toxicological risk when used as a PCID in a SODF if the substance is:\n\nUsed at a level in excess of the limitations provided in the relevant IIG listing or Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) chapter for direct food additives\n\nAn ingredient that has never been used in an SODF or as a direct food additive\n\nAn ingredient that poses risk of adverse reaction (e.g., allergic reaction or irritation), including an ingredient derived from a major food allergen (i.e., milk, eggs, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat and soybeans)7 Footnote 7: See section 201(qq) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n\nWe recommend that applicants contact the appropriate clinical review division for more information on how to assess the safety of such proposed PCIDs.\n\n2 Other Design Considerations\n\nA substance employed as a PCID should not adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, potency, or bioavailability of the SODF. To minimize the risk of adverse effects on these characteristics, FDA recommends that applicants add a PCID to an SODF at the lowest level that ensures identification of the dosage unit. Applicants also can minimize the potential for adverse interactions by using a PCID that is relatively inert (i.e., unreactive). Applicants also should consider the potential effect of a PCID on the quality, performance, and stability of the SODF both during the selection of a PCID and during the design of an SODF that will include a PCID.\n\nAnother factor that applicants should consider is the location of the PCID within the drug product. When considering where to place a PCID, the applicant may find it helpful to conceptually subdivide an SODF into sections that differ in composition that may or may not contain active drug substance. For example, a core section in an SODF is likely to contain one or more drug substances,8 while the external sections of the SODF may not. If an applicant places a PCID inside a core section of the SODF, that placement may increase the chances of interactions with the drug substance that could result in degradation. If the applicant is concerned the PCID will interact with core components, incorporating the PCID into an external section of the SODF (e.g., in a coating or an ink-imprinted logo) may reduce the possibility of such interaction.\n\nFootnote 8: The term drug substance is defined in FDA’s regulations at 21 CFR 314.3.\n\nThe applicant should also consider whether the presence of the PCID might interfere with control of the release rate of modified-release SODFs (SODF-MRs), including extended-release and delayed-release dosage forms. Thus, FDA recommends that the applicant consider incorporating the PCID into a section of the SODF-MR that does not contain any release-controlling excipient.9 Since the mechanisms that impart modified-release characteristics are varied, the potential impact on drug product release rate and stability should be evaluated by the applicant prior to incorporating a PCID into an SODF-MR, regardless of the location of the PCID relative to the drug substance and release-controlling excipients.\n\nIV Supporting Documentation to Address the Proposed Incorporation of PCIDs in Solid Oral Dosage Forms\n\nSection A below describes FDA's recommendations for documentation to be submitted both by applicants proposing to incorporate PCIDs into new SODFs in an NDA or ANDA for initial approval of a drug product and by applicants proposing to incorporate PCIDs into SODFs as a postapproval change. In addition, as described in section B below, FDA recommends that applicants proposing to incorporate PCIDs into SODFs as a postapproval change submit certain additional documentation.\n--------------------\nContext title: Incorporation of Physical-Chemical Identifiers into Solid Oral Dosage Form Drug Products for Anticounterfeiting Guidance for Industry""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act – Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.3.3 Ndc\n\nTo identify each drug for which you are reporting, you will use the 10-digit NDC for the drug as listed with FDA. You will need to format the NDC using hyphens between the labeler code, the product code, and the package code. Appropriately formatted NDCs should have one of the following configurations: 4-4-2 (e.g., 1234-5678-90), 5-4-1 (e.g., 12345-6789-1), 5-3-2 (e.g., 12345-678-90).16\n\nFootnote 16: For certain minimally manipulated human cell and tissue products, you may use an alternatively formatted NDC approved for use by the relevant center director.\n\n4.3.4 Outermost Package -- Quantity Released\n\nYou should enter the quantity of the drug that the establishment manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed for commercial distribution17 during the relevant time period. This quantity should be based on the number of units measured by the drug's outermost packaging. We request that you provide this amount based on the month in which the drug was released.18 For months in which a drug was released, you should include a positive (non-zero) integer; for months in which no drug was released, you can leave the field blank or enter a zero.

If a listed drug is not subject to an approved application for which an annual report is required under 21 CFR 314.81, then you should leave this field blank.\n\n5.2.6 Outermost Package -- Package Type\n\nYou should enter the package type associated with the NDC for which you are submitting data. Values entered here should adhere to the FDA package types as outlined in the portal or the CSV template file.\n\n5.2.7 Source NDC\n\nFor drugs listed under REPACK or RELABEL, you should provide the source NDC in the appropriate format (i.e., using hyphens between the labeler code, the product code, and the package code) using the 10-digit NDC assigned to the drug received by the repacker or relabeler for repacking or relabeling. Appropriately formatted NDCs should have one of the following configurations: 4-4-2 (e.g.,1234-5678-90), 5-4-1 (e.g., 12345-6789-1), 5-3-2 (e.g., 12345-678-90). This configuration is used to identify the drug that was repacked or relabeled, so that FDA can avoid double counting this drug when analyzing the data.\n\n5.2.8 Innermost Package -- Quantity Released\n\nYou should use this field for multi-level packaged drugs only. You should enter the quantity of the drug that the establishment manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed for commercial distribution during the relevant time period. This quantity should be based on the number of units measured by the drug's innermost packaging. We request that you provide this amount based on the month in which the drug was released. For months in which a drug was released, you should include a positive (non-zero) integer; for months in which no drug was released, you can leave the field blank or enter a zero.

47,"As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?","['--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: Step 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = 8.75 g / 125 g = 7%.\n\nBecause 7% is less than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength apple juice (11.5 Brix value), the added sugar from the apple juice ingredient in this hypothetical example is zero even though the starting ingredient is a concentrated apple juice.\n\nHypothetical example 2 (with drying step where water is removed):Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA product formulation contains a single juice ingredient (20% single strength apple juice at 11.5 Brix) in the wet formulation (prior to drying). The blended wet formulation has a water content of 50% (i.e., a solids content of 50%). The product goes through a drying step. The finished product has a water content of 10% (i.e., a solids content of 90%) and a serving size of 40 g.\n\nStep 1: The amount of total sugars contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving.\n\nBecause there is water loss during manufacturing, in this method we calculate the amount of wet formulation needed to yield 40 g serving size finished product.\n\nSolids content in the finished product g = 40 x 90% = 36 g.\n\nBecause the solids prior to drying is 50% (moisture = 50%), the starting wet formulation prior to drying that yielded the 40 g serving size finished product is 72 g (36 g / 50%).\n\nThe amount of total sugar contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving (based on wet formulation weight percentage) = 72 g (\\times) 20% (\\times) 11.5% = 1.656 g.\n\nStep 2: The water content of the finished product = weight per serving (\\times)moisture content = 40 g (\\times) 10% = 4 g.\n\nStep 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = (1.656 g/ 4 g) (\\times) 100 = 41.4%.\n\nSince 41.4% is greater than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength apple juice (11.5 Brix value), you would need to calculate the amount of sugars from the apple juice ingredient (41.4% sugar) that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent apple (11.5% sugar). Please note that, in this hypothetical example, even though the starting juice is a single strength juice, because of the concentration during processing, the amount of added sugars from the apple juice is not zero. You may use the method described in Q&A 11 or other alternative methods to determine the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient.\n\n13. The regulation says in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii) that added sugars are a ""statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving, except that label declaration of added sugars content is not required for products that contain less than 1 gram of added sugars in a serving if no claims are made about sweeteners, sugars, added sugars, or sugar alcohol content."" What does FDA consider to be a ""sweetener?"" Do sweeteners include sugar alcohols and other low-calorie sweeteners?\n\nWe have used the term ""sweetener"" to refer to ingredients that provide sweetness to a food regardless of whether they provide calories (43 FR 43248, September 22, 1978; 56 FR 60437 to 60438, November 27, 1991; and 58 FR 2326 to 2327, January 6, 1993). We have not changed our approach to the use of this term. Therefore, we consider both caloric and non-caloric sweeteners, including sugar alcohols, to be sweeteners for the purposes of this regulation.\n\nSome ingredients contain mono- and disaccharides (DP1 and DP2 (one and two degrees of polymerization)) that are created through processes such as hydrolysis. Do the mono- and disaccharide portions of ingredients that are created through hydrolysis need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33832), we said that, other than sugar syrup types of products where the sugars are specifically and purposely produced via hydrolysis, we do not have information suggesting that sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates results in significant increase in the sugar content of foods. We did not receive any comments or other information suggesting that these sugars should be captured under the added sugars declaration, and we did not include sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis in our definition of added sugars (id.). Therefore, such sugars would not be declared as added sugars on the label. We also explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, since hydrolysis was purposely used by the manufacturer to increase the sugar content of the product (id.).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33835), we also said that, in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Report (2015 DGAC Report).\n\nManufacturers may purposely employ methods, such as hydrolysis, for a number of reasons, some of which result in an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides with DP1 and DP2. Ingredients such as maltodextrin and corn syrup solids are hydrolyzed to achieve various degrees of dextrose equivalence (DE). The higher the DE, the lower the degree of polymerization, and the sweeter the ingredient becomes. Maltodext (21 CFR 184.1444) are ingredients with a DE less than 20, and corn syrup (21 CFR 168.120, 168.121, and 184.1865) are ingredients with a DE of 20 or higher. Depending on the manufacturing process, different maltodextrin and corn syrup will have different DE and different amounts of mono- and disaccharides. Although maltodext are not used primarily for sweetening purposes, depending on the DE, some can contain 8-9% mono and disaccharides and can contribute to sweetness. We also understand that the hydrolysis process to manufacture maltodextrin and corn syrup are controlled so that the desired DE can be consistently achieved. This indicates that some maltodext and corn syrup solids are manufactured purposely to contain certain levels of mono- and disaccharides. Information that is publicly available (e.g., online product specification sheets and reference materials) indicates that manufacturers have knowledge of the level of mono- and disaccharides created during the processing of ingredients through controlled hydrolysis.\n\nMaltodext, corn syrups, and other ingredients with mono-and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis are widely used by manufacturers and are present in many different types of food products (47 FR 36443 at 36444, September 20, 1982). The sugars contributed by these ingredients are consistent with the concept of empty calories as described in the 2015 DGAC Report because they supply sugars and calories to the diet when they are added as an ingredient to foods. We explained in the Nutrition Facts label final rule that small amounts of added sugars that are contributed to the diet by a wide variety of foods can add up over the course of the day and can make it difficult for an individual to eat sufficient amounts of foods from the basic food groups to meet nutrient needs without exceeding the amount of calories they need in a day for weight maintenance (81 FR 33742 at 33759). As such, when an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis (e.g. maltodextrin or corn syrup) is added to a food during processing, those mono- and disaccharides contributed by the ingredient need to be declared as added sugars on the label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(9)(iii).\n\nShould sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch and other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g., beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label?\n\nYes. Sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch or other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g. beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods need to be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label because the sugars created through controlled hydrolysis add empty calories to the diet (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii); 81 FR 33742 at 33831 through 33832 (comment 201 and response), 33835 (comment 207 and response)).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, because the manufacturer purposely used hydrolysis to increase the product\'s sugar content (81 FR 33742 at 33832).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: Step 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n\na) Single strength apple juice has a Brix value of 11.5 (21 CFR 101.30). You may use the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration in a single strength apple juice or other information such as data obtained through chemical analysis, information from databases, or reference documents (see response to Q&A 9). Therefore, the sugar concentration in a single strength apple juice is 11.5% (based on weight).\n\nb) Determine the density of single strength apple juice with a Brix value of 11.5. You can either measure the density or look up references that convert Brix values to densities.\n\nc) The amount of sugars in 240 ml serving size of single strength apple juice of the same type = 240 ml x density (g/ml) x 11.5 % (or.115).\n\nStep 3: The weight of added sugars (in grams) is the weight of sugars obtained from step 1 minus that from step 2.\n\n11. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit juice blend containing the juices of multiple fruit types that is reconstituted above 100 percent where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)?\n\nIf the juice blend is reconstituted such that the amount of sugar in the finished product is equal to or less than what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice (e.g., less than 100% juice), the added sugar declaration would be zero.\n\nIf the juice blend is reconstituted such that the amount of sugar in the finished product is greater than what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final juice blend.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished juice blend product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the juice blend were reconstituted to single strength juice of the same type (i.e., the weight of sugars in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type). The single strength juice of the same type is a juice that contains the same ratios of the apple, mango, and pear juices in our hypothetical example.\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you can make a single strength juice blend with the same ratios of the three juices and measure the amount of total sugars per 240 ml serving size.\n\nYou can also calculate the sugar weight in the theoretical single strength juice blend of the same type by the following method:\n\na) Calculate the ratios of the three juices in your formulation based on weight.\n\nTo obtain the weight-based ratios of the three juices in this hypothetical juice blend example, you need to first determine the weight-based concentration factors for the three types of juice. The weight-based concentration factor is the ratio of the Brix values between the concentrate and the single strength juice. For example, the weight-based concentration factor for the apple juice in the hypothetical example is 70 / 11.5 = 6.087. Using a similar calculation, the weight based concentration factor for the mango juice is 5.385 and the weight based concentration factor for the pear juice is 5.833.\n\nBecause the hypothetical juice blend formulation has 10% apple juice concentrate (70 Brix), 10% mango juice concentrate (70 Brix), and 20% pear juice concentrate (70 Brix), the theoretical single strength juice blend of the same type would have the following ratios of single strength apple juice, single mango juice, and single pear juice:\n\nPercentage apple juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) apple juice concentration factor; percentage mango juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) mango juice concentration factor; percentage pear juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) pear juice concentration factor\n\nOr\n\n10% (\\times) 6.087; 10% (\\times) 5.385; 20% (\\times) 5.833\n\nOr\n\n0.6087; 0.5385; 1.167_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nThe above ratios for the three types of juice can be converted to percentage-based ratios with the sum of the ratios being 100%. The sum of the ratios is 100% because all of the sugars in the juice blend are from the three types of juices.\n\nTherefore:\n\nSingle apple juice: single strength mango juice: single strength pear juice =\n\n({)[0.6087 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (}):\n\n({)[0.5385 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (}):\n\n({)[1.167 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (})\n\nOr\n\n26.30%: 23.27%: 50.42%\n\nb) Calculate the theoretical Brix value of the single strength juice blend of the same type juice with the same ratios of the three juices.\n\nThe theoretical Brix value of the juice blend is the sum of the multiplication products of the Brix value and the percentage contribution (the ratio percentage from step 2a) for each type of juice.\n\n(Single strength apple juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single strength apple juice) + (single strength mango juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single strength mango juice) + (single strength pear juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single pear juice) = theoretical Brix value of the hypothetical juice blend.\n\n11.5% (\\times) 26.31% + 13% (\\times) 23.27% + 12% (\\times) 50.42% = 12.10%.\n\nc) Determine the density of single strength juice blend with a Brix value of 12.10. You can either experimentally measure the density or look up references that convert Brix values to densities.\n\nd) The amount of sugars in 240 ml serving size of the theoretical single strength juice blend of the same type with the same ratios of the three types of juice = 240 ml (\\times) density (g/ml) (\\times) 12.10 %.\n\nStep 3: The weight of added sugars (in grams) is the weight of sugars obtained from step 1 minus that from step 2.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: The definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n\nThe determination of the amount of added sugars contributed by a powdered fruit or vegetable juice that is added as an ingredient to a product and that is not reconstituted to single strength juice during processing (e.g., that is added to a pureed fruit or to a yogurt) would be the same as the determination of the sugars contributed by a liquid or frozen fruit or vegetable juice concentrate. In our response to question 11, we have suggested that when calculating the added sugars declaration for a product containing concentrated fruit or vegetable juice, the total moisture content of the finished product can be considered to go towards reconstitution of the fruit juice concentrate in the formulation. Thus, the total moisture content of a finished product formulated with powdered fruit or vegetable juice concentrates can be considered to contribute towards the dilution of the powdered fruit or vegetable juice. Further, the sugars contributed by the powdered fruit or vegetable juice that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type must be declared as added sugars on the label, as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule.\n8. Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates? We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12). We require that, when a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)). If you use Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 to calculate the amount of added sugars in a product containing juice concentrate, you must document this information in the records regarding the amount of added sugars added to the food during processing (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). If you use the amount of sugars present in a single strength juice and/or a juice concentrate, that is determined through chemical analysis or other available information, when calculating the amount of added sugars in a product containing fruit juice concentrate, you must document the source of the information and/or the amount of sugars determined through chemical analysis in the records that you make and keep (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). If a diluted juice concentrate slightly exceeds the amount of sugar that would be found in the same volume of the same type of 100 percent fruit juice, manufacturers should document the average and consistency with cGMPs in the records that they make and keep.\n9. Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis? The amount of added sugars declared on the label must be in grams (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The added sugars definition includes sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. For juice, the serving size is based on volume (e.g., 8 oz. or 240 ml) while the amount of added sugars per serving is based on weight. Therefore, when calculating the weight of added sugars per serving, you may need to consider the densities of both the finished juice product and the single strength juice of the same type. You may choose to arrive at the gram amount of added sugars in different ways. Please see our responses to questions 11 and 12 for examples of how to calculate the amount of added sugars in products containing concentrated fruit juices on both a volume and weight basis.\n10. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit or vegetable juice (juice made from a single type of fruit or vegetable) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength juice where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)? In the hypothetical example below, we provide three general steps to calculate the amount of added sugars (in grams) for an apple juice product (240 ml serving size) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength apple juice. The product in this hypothetical example is reconstituted to have juice soluble solids above the minimum Brixrequirement in 21 CFR 101.30 where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9). Therefore, all sugars in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice must be declared as added sugars. The apple juice example here uses the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration. This example is provided solely to demonstrate one method of calculating the added sugars content of the product. You can use alternate methods.\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: 3. Do I need to take into consideration sugars from ingredients that are used in formulating my product when determining the added sugars declaration for a serving of my product?\n\nIngredients containing free mono- and disaccharides that meet our definition of added sugars need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (e.g. sugars from cane sugar and concentrated fruit juice added to sweeten an apple sauce). Manufacturers may need to work with ingredient suppliers to determine the amount of added sugars provided by ingredients used in formulating food products.\n\n4. Do the sugars in dried fruits meet the definition of added sugars?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we responded to comments on dried fruits (see response to comment 212, 81 FR 33742 at 33837). We said that dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them should not be considered to contain added sugars because they are essentially a dehydrated whole fruit and still retain the nutrients and other components of a whole fruit (e.g. diced dried apples). However, if additional sugar is added to a dried fruit, the sugar added to the dried fruit must be declared on the label as added sugars (81 FR 33742 at 33837).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5. Are the sugars used in the production of vinegar added sugars?\n\nIn the production of vinegar, naturally occurring sugars are first fermented into alcohol and then a secondary fermentation occurs in which alcohol is converted to vinegar. For most vinegar products, no sugars remain in the final product. Vinegars that do not contain any sugars in the finished food would not need an added sugars declaration. However, we are aware of some vinegars (e.g., balsamic vinegar) that are made using ingredients that are often used as sweeteners in foods, and that are similar to concentrated fruit juices (e.g., grape must). According to the definition of added sugars, sugars found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type are added sugars. Therefore, fruit juices that are concentrated before or during processing of some vinegars contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars. To the extent that sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are present in the finished product, the added sugars must be declared on the label and in labeling, as required in our Nutrition Facts label final rule. We understand that the manufacturing of vinegar involves several steps, and manufacturers need to consider the impact of these steps (e.g. potential concentration due to water loss when aged in wooden barrels) on the final added sugars declaration.\n\n6. The definition of added sugars excludes the ""fruit component of fruit spreads."" What constitutes the ""fruit component"" of a non-standardized fruit spread?\n\nPlease see our response to question 1 above. The fruit component of a non-standardized fruit spread would include whole fruits, pieces of fruit, dried fruit, fruit or vegetable pures (single strength or concentrated), fruit pulps, single strength juices, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders that are not made from fruit or vegetable juices.\n\n7. Do sugars found in fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the form of the fruit or vegetable (e.g., concentrated fruit and vegetable pures, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders) need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833), we explained that we excluded from the definition of ""added sugars"" whole fruit, fruit pieces, dried fruit, pulps, and pures because they are nutrient rich and maintain the basic properties of a fruit when added to foods and are not considered to contain added sugars (see response to comment 208, 81 FR 33742 at33835). We also explained that sugars from 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, and sugars from certain fruit and vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under certain regulations, fruit juice concentrates used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, and preserves under our standards of identity, and 100 percent juice concentrate sold directly to consumers (e.g. frozen orange juice concentrate) are excluded from the definition of ""added sugars.""\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833 through 33834), we explained that, while foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices can be a part of a healthful diet, the sugars added to the foods by the concentrated fruit or vegetable juice provide additional calories. Over the course of the day, small amounts of calories in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages can add up and make it difficult to balance the amount of calories expended (81 FR 33742 at 33834). For these reasons, we consider foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices to be sugar-sweetened foods (id).\n\nWe also explained that in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report (Ref. 1) (81 FR 33742 at 33835).\n\nWe are applying these same guiding principles when determining when the sugars in an ingredient are added sugars. Concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes, and some fruit and vegetable powders are essentially whole fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the physical form of the fruit or vegetable and to remove moisture. They maintain the basic properties of a whole fruit or vegetable, even if the peel and seeds may be removed. Their composition and use is more consistent with that of whole fruits or vegetables, dried fruits or vegetables, pulps and pureses than that of concentrated fruit juices, which are commonly used by industry in place of sugars. Therefore, the sugars in concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes and some fruit and vegetable powders contribute to the diet the same way that sugars found in whole fruits or vegetables do, and do not have to be declared as added sugars on the label. However, we consider sugars in powders made from fruit and vegetable juices to be the same as those found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices because such powders are essentially concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that have all moisture removed. Therefore, some or all sugars contributed by a powder made from fruit or vegetable juices must be declared as added sugars on the label as required by the Nutrition Facts label final rule, depending on the degree of reconstitution in the finished food.\n\nThe definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals'

The amount of added sugars is based on the finished product composition. Juice (fruit or vegetable) ingredients are unique in that the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient depends on whether the juice ingredient is concentrated, and thus, contains sugar in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. We realize that food formulation is complex and manufacturers can use different ingredients or alternative formulas to achieve the same finished product composition. For example, you may use 100% fruit juice and dry sugar in a baking application. You also may have an alternative formulation that uses concentrated fruit juice and liquid syrup to achieve the same product composition. When water or other wet ingredients containing water (e.g. milk, syrup, egg, diluted wines and cider with less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, etc.) are added to a formulation containing concentrated juice and other ingredients during processing, the amount of moisture that goes towards reconstituting the juice or towards wetting or reconstituting other ingredients is not known. Furthermore, if the water added during formulation is divided among the ingredients when determining the amount of reconstitution or wetting that has occurred, different formulations of the same finished food could have different calculated added sugar amounts. Therefore, we considered an approach that we believe would provide a reasonable estimate of the added sugars content of a multi-ingredient product that includes concentrated fruit juice as an ingredient (e.g. a bakery product, marinade, or diluted wines and cider with less than 7 percent alcohol by volume). When concentrated juices are used in the formulation, we believe that it is practical to use all of the moisture in the formulation towards reconstitution of the concentrated juice when calculating the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product. It is also possible that the initial juice ingredient in the formulation (either diluted, 100%, or concentrated) is further concentrated during processing due to loss of water (e.g., during drying or baking). Because the amount of added sugars is based on the finished product composition, you should account for the loss of water during processing to reflect the concentration of the juice ingredient after processing. Considering the complexity of food formulation and processing, we believe it is also appropriate to use the moisture content of the finished product towards reconstitution of the juice soluble solids when the product is subject to water loss during processing. This approach is consistent with our approach for the use of all of the moisture in the formulation towards reconstitution of concentrated juices when calculating the added sugars content of an ingredient. The following general approach can be used to calculate the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation. This general approach applies when there is either dilution or concentration during manufacturing.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nStep 1: Determine the amount of total sugars contributed by the juice ingredient.\n\nStep 2: Determine the water content (i.e., the moisture content) of the finished product.\n\nStep 3: Determine the sugar concentration of the juice ingredient with the assumption that all of the water in the finished product can be used to reconstitute the juice ingredient.\n\nStep 4: Compare this sugar concentration of juice ingredient with that of the theoretical single strength juice of the same type.\n\n(a) If the sugar concentration is less than, or the same as, the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type, the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient is zero.\n\n(b) If the sugar concentration is greater than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type, you may use the method described in Q&A 11 or other alternative methods to determine the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient.\n\nStep 5: The amount of total added sugar per serving is the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient determined from step 4(b) plus added sugars from other ingredients (e.g., cane sugar), if any, in the formulation.\n\nIf you use multiple juice ingredients in your formulation, you may follow the same general steps above except that in step 4(b) you would need to use the method described in Q&A 12 or other alternative methods to determine the amount of added sugars from the multiple juice ingredients.\n\nTo demonstrate the general approach described above, we provide two hypothetical examples below. In these hypothetical examples, we use the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration.\n\nHypothetical example 1:\n\nA product formulation contains a single juice ingredient (5% apple juice at 70 Brix value). The finished product has a serving size of 250 gm and a moisture content of 50%.\n\nStep 1: The amount of total sugars in the juice ingredient = weight per serving (\\times) percentage apple juice concentrate (\\times) % sugar in apple juice concentrate = 250 g (\\times) 5% (\\times) 70% = 8.75 g.\n\nStep 2: The water content or the moisture content of the finished product = weight per serving (\\times) moisture content = 250 g (\\times) 50% = 125 g.\n\nStep 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = 8.75 g / 125 g = 7%.\n\nBecause 7% is less than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength apple juice (11.5 Brix value), the added sugar from the apple juice ingredient in this hypothetical example is zero even though the starting ingredient is a concentrated apple juice.\n\nHypothetical example 2 (with drying step where water is removed):Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA product formulation contains a single juice ingredient (20% single strength apple juice at 11.5 Brix) in the wet formulation (prior to drying). The blended wet formulation has a water content of 50% (i.e., a solids content of 50%). The product goes through a drying step. The finished product has a water content of 10% (i.e., a solids content of 90%) and a serving size of 40 g.\n\nStep 1: The amount of total sugars contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving.\n\nBecause there is water loss during manufacturing, in this method we calculate the amount of wet formulation needed to yield 40 g serving size finished product.\n\nSolids content in the finished product g = 40 x 90% = 36 g.\n\nBecause the solids prior to drying is 50% (moisture = 50%), the starting wet formulation prior to drying that yielded the 40 g serving size finished product is 72 g (36 g / 50%).\n\nThe amount of total sugar contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving (based on wet formulation weight percentage) = 72 g (\\times) 20% (\\times) 11.5% = 1.656 g.\n\nStep 2: The water content of the finished product = weight per serving (\\times)moisture content = 40 g (\\times) 10% = 4 g.\n\nStep 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = (1.656 g/ 4 g) (\\times) 100 = 41.4%.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals""

Burnham,\n\n(240-402-2030). This guidance represents the agency\'s current thinking on reducing microbial food safety hazards in juice. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. This guidance document supercedes ""Warning and Notice Statement: Labeling of Juice Products Small Entity Compliance Guide,"" September 18, 1998.\n\nBackground\n\nIn the Federal Register of July 8, 1998 (63 FR 37030), the Food and Drug Administration\n\n(FDA) published a final rule requiring a warning label on any juice that has not been\n\nprocessed to prevent, reduce, or eliminate pathogenic microorganisms that may be present\n\n(the ""juice labeling rule""). In this guidance document, juice means any juice or juice\n\ningredient in a beverage, as defined by 21 CFR 120.1(a). Under 21 CFR 101.17(g), any juice or\n\njuice ingredient that is not processed to reduce pathogens by 100,000-fold (i.e., attain a 5-log\n\nreduction in the pertinent pathogenic microorganism) must bear a warning label. Becauselabeling may have limited effectiveness (i.e., it must be read and be understood), the warning label was intended to provide a measure of public safety until final Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations for juice could be established and implemented.\n\nIn the Federal Register of January 19, 2001 (66 FR 6138), FDA published a final rule requiring the application of HACCP principles to the processing of any juice or juice ingredient in a beverage (the ""juice HACCP rule""). Juice produced in a retail establishment, i.e., a facility that produces juice that is only sold directly to consumers, is exempt from the HACCP requirements. Like the juice labeling rule, the juice HACCP rule utilizes the standard of a 5-log reduction in the pertinent pathogenic microorganism. Specifically, under $120.24(a), juice processors must establish control measures that will produce such a reduction.\n\nAfter the publication of the juice labeling rule, FDA\'s scientific understanding of how to attain effectively a 5-log pathogen reduction evolved, as discussed in the preamble and as reflected in the requirements of the juice HACCP rule.\n\nPurpose of this Guidance\n\nThe purpose of this guidance document is to provide guidance to those juice processors not yet subject to the juice HACCP rule (e.g., small and very small processors who are not subject to the juice HACCP rule until January 21, 2003 and January 20, 2004, respectively) who are performing a 5-log pathogen reduction to attain exemption from the warning label requirement. This guidance document also provides guidance to processors at retail who are not subject to the juice HACCP rule and who are performing a 5-log pathogen reduction to attain exemption from the warning label requirement. FDA encourages those processors to operate consistently with this guidance in terms of 5-log pathogen reduction treatments because this guidance is based upon FDA\'s current scientific knowledge. In part, this guidance supercedes the previous 5-log pathogen reduction guidance in the juice labeling rule and FDA\'s guidance document, ""Warning and Notice Statement: Labeling of Juice Products Small Entity Compliance Guide"" (the ""small entity compliance guide"") (Ref. 1), because these documents no longer reflect FDA\'s current thinking.\n\nFDA Recommendations\n\nFDA\'s current scientific understanding of how to attain effectively a 5-log pathogen reduction is based on information obtained from public meetings, discussions, comments to the juice HACCP proposed rule (63 FR 20450), and recommendations from the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food (NACMCF) (Refs. 2 and 3). To assist juice processors in attaining a 5-log pathogen reduction consistent with current scientific knowledge, Table 1 compares FDA\'s previous and current recommendations for achieving the 5-log pathogen reduction. The following questions and answers provide additional guidance in terms of FDA\'s current recommendations for the 5-log reduction:Question: When in the process should the 5-log pathogen reduction treatment be applied? Answer: Based upon current scientific understanding, FDA recommends that the 5-log pathogen reduction and final product packaging occur under one firm\'s control, in a single production facility that is operating under current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) and immediately before or immediately after packing. This recommendation is for both citrus and non-citrus juices. Although good agricultural practices (GAPs) and CGMPs at the farming and harvesting stages are encouraged, they should not be counted towards the 5-log pathogen reduction. The basis for this recommendation is discussed in more detail in the juice HACCP rule (66 FR 6138 at 6166). Question: What should be treated? Answer: FDA recommends that juice processors use treatments that directly contact all pathogens that may be present in or on the fruit or vegetables being processed. For most products, this means that the treatments should be performed on the juice after it is expressed. For citrus juices only, effective surface treatment of the citrus fruit may constitute direct contact with all pathogens, and thus, processors may consider counting such treatment toward the 5-log pathogen reduction. If surface treatments are used on citrus fruits to achieve the 5-log pathogen reduction, FDA recommends that the treatment be applied to undamaged, tree-picked fruit (i.e., culled fruit that is U.S. Department of Agriculture choice or higher quality), that has been cleaned. (Note: There is no current USDA standard for choice or higher quality. FDA will consider undamaged tree-picked citrus fruit to meet the definition of ""culled"" for purposes of compliance with the juice HACCP regulation). The basis for this recommendation is discussed in more detail in the juice HACCP rule (66 FR 6138 at 6171).\n\nSummary\n\nSmall and very small processors (as defined in 21 CFR 120.1(b)) who do not treat their juice to achieve the 5-log pathogen reduction should continue to comply with the juice labeling rule. All other juice processors are now required by the juice HACCP regulation (21 CFR Part 120) to apply HACCP principles to their processing operations and to have, in any resulting HACCP plan, measures to achieve a 5-log reduction in pathogens. Based upon FDA\'s current knowledge, processing juice in accordance with the recommendations in the small entity compliance guide for the juice labeling rule may not reduce pathogens to an acceptable level. Therefore, juice processors claiming exemption from the warning label requirement on the basis of the 5-log pathogen reduction provision of 21 CFR 101.17(g)(7) should consider the principles in this guidance. On August 31, 2001, FDA published a guidance document, ""The Juice HACCP Regulation: Questions and Answers"" to provide additional information on the juice HACCP rule, including assistance in achieving a 5-log pathogen reduction. As a follow-up to that document, FDA plans to publish additional information in question and answer format that processors may find useful, as well as additional guidance documents including, ""Guidancefor Industry: Juice HACCP Hazards and Control Guide"" and ""Guidance on Bulk Transport of Juice Concentrates and Certain Shelf Stable Juices.""

This rule is effective on March 23, 2020.\n\nThe prescription or over-the-counter status of a biological product with an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act will not change when the approved application is deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act on March 23, 2020.\n\nExamples of biological products approved under the FD&C Act are listed in the Appendix to the Transition Policy Final Guidance. To enhance transparency and facilitate planning for the transition date, FDA is posting on the FDA website (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/deemed-be-license-provision-bpci-act) a preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act (as of December 31, 2019) that will be affected by the transition provision, and FDA intends to periodically update the list before the transition date (see Q3 below). Shortly after the transition date, FDA intends to post a final list of approved applications under the FD&C Act that have been deemed to be licenses under the PHS Act.\n\nDoes the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA\'s list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n\nFDA interprets the transition provision to mean that the holder of an approved application for a biological product does not need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA. Specifically, FDA interprets section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act to mean that an approved application under the FD&C Act for a biological product will be ""deemed to be a license"" for the biological product on the transition date by operation of the statute.10\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe statute is silent regarding the process for accomplishing the transition of approved NDAs to deemed BLAs. FDA intends to send a letter to such application holders on March 23, 2020, advising that the approved NDA was deemed to be a BLA at 1200 am Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on March 23, 2020, and no longer exists as an NDA. (If the NDA is approved on March 23, 2020, the approved NDA will be deemed to be a BLA immediately after approval.) In the letter, FDA also will notify the application holder that it has been issued a license that authorizes the application holder to manufacture the biological product within the meaning of section 351 of the PHS Act and to introduce the biological product or deliver the biological product for introduction into interstate commerce (see Q6 below). The letter also will remind application holders that they will need to ensure that the listing information for the biological product is updated in FDA\'s electronic Drug Registration and Listing System (eDRLS) between March 23, 2020, and June 30, 2020, to reflect a change in the prefix of the application number (from ""NDA"" to ""BLA"") (see 21 CFR 207.57(b)). FDA notes that the deeming of an approved NDA to be a BLA and the corresponding update of the eDRLS listing information for the biological product to change the prefix for the application number will not result in the need for a new National Drug Code (NDC) number with a new product code. Accordingly, in the absence of other changes made by the application holder that would require a new NDC number, biological products approved under the FD&C Act will retain their current NDC number after the NDA is deemed to be a BLA. This will provide consistency for manufacturers and for the databases and pharmacy systems that track drug and biological products.\n\nTo enhance transparency and facilitate planning for the transition date, FDA is posting on the FDA website a preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act (as of December 31, 2019) that will be affected by the transition provision, and FDA intends to periodically update the list before the transition date (see Q1 above). Biological products approved in NDAs that are deemed to be BLAs will be removed from FDA\'s Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book) on March 23, 2020, and will be listed in FDA\'s Lists of Licensed Biological Products with Reference Product Exclusivity and Biosimilarity or Interchangeability Evaluations (the Purple Book) and the CDER Therapeutic Biologics Products list on or shortly after the March 23, 2020, transition date.\n\n2.2 Who should an application holder contact if it believes that its approved NDA should or should not be included on FDA\'s preliminary list of approved applications for biological products that will be affected by the transition provision?\n\nIf an application holder or other person reviews, on FDA\'s website, the preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act that will be affected by the transition provision and believes that an approved NDA should be added to the list or should not be included on the list, the application holder or other person should submit a comment to the public docket established for this guidance and the preliminary list. For information on submission of comments to the public docket, please refer to the Federal Register (FR) Notice of Availability of this guidance.\n\nQ4.: How will FDA notify the sponsor of a proposed biological product who seeks to obtain approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act that the planned application would need to be approved under the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2020?\n\nFDA provided notice to sponsors of proposed biological products intended for submission in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act that they will be affected by the transition provision through the Biosimilars Q&A Guidance, as well as through FDA\'s draft guidance for industry Implementation of the ""Deemed to be a License"" Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (March 2016) (Transition Policy Draft Guidance) and the Biosimilars Q&A Draft Guidance. In the Biosimilars Q&A Guidance, FDA initially stated its interpretation of the statutory term ""protein"" in the amended definition of ""biological product"" (see Q1 above and Biological Product Definition Final Rule). In the Transition Policy Final Guidance, FDA provides recommendations to sponsors of proposed protein products intended for submission in an application that may not receive final approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2020, to facilitate alignment of product development plans with FDA\'s interpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.11 FDA recommends that sponsors of development programs for proposed protein products evaluate whether a planned submission under section 505 of the FD&C Act would allow adequate time for approval of the application prior to March 23, 2020, considering, among other things, whether the submission may require a second cycle of review and, for certain types of applications, whether unexpired patents or exclusivity may delay final approval. If a sponsor is unsure whether its proposed product may receive approval under the FD&C Act by March 23, 2020, the sponsor should consider submitting a BLA under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act instead. For additional information, please see the Transition Policy Final Guidance.\n\nFootnote 11: After FDA issued the Transition Policy Final Guidance, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 was enacted. Section 607 of this Act amended section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act to provide that FDA will continue to review an application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act after March 23, 2020, so long as that application was submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act, is filed not later than March 23, 2019, and is not approved as of March 23, 2020. If such an application is approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act before October 1, 2022, it will be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act upon approval (see section 7002(e)(4)(B)(iii) and (vi) of the BPCI Act).\n\nB.: Applications for Biological Products Submitted Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act on or Before the Transition Date\n\nQ5.: When will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the application number that will be used for its deemed BLA?\n\nFDA intends to assign the same application number used for the approved NDA to the deemed BLA on the March 23, 2020, transition date. As a hypothetical example, NDA 012345 would be deemed to be BLA 012345 on the transition date. This approach is intended to minimize burden on holders of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act who are preparing submissions to their applications around the transition date and to facilitate the administrative conversion of any pending supplements to such applications (see the Transition Policy Final Guidance for additional information regarding such supplements). The use of a predictable application numbering system for deemed BLAs is also expected to facilitate preparation and submission of a 351(k) BLA for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeableproduct that references a product licensed in a deemed 351(a) BLA as a reference product. The FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date will include the product\'s BLA number.\n\nWhen will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the license number that will apply to its deemed BLA(s)?\n--------------------\nContext title: The “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'

You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the\n\napplicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff\n\nresponsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes FDA\'s interpretation of the provision of the Biologic\'s Price Competition\n\nand Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) under which an application for a biological product\n\napproved under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21\n\nU.S.C. 355) as of March 23, 2020, will be deemed to be a license for the biological product\n\nunder section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262) on March 23, 2020. Specifically, this guidance describes FDA\'s interpretation of the ""deemed to be a license""\n\nprovision in section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act for biological products that are approved under\n\nsection 505 of the FD&C Act as of March 23, 2020 (the transition date). This guidance also\n\nprovides recommendations to sponsors of proposed protein products intended for submission in\n\nan application that may not receive final approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or\n\nbefore March 23, 2020, to facilitate alignment of product development plans with FDA\'s\n\ninterpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.\n\nAlthough the majority of therapeutic biological products have been licensed under section 351 of\n\nthe PHS Act, some protein products historically have been approved under section 505 of the\n\nFD&C Act (see the Appendix to this guidance for examples of such products). On March 23,\n\n2010, the BPCI Act was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n\n(Public Law 111-148). The BPCI Act clarified the statutory authority under which certain\n\nprotein products will be regulated by amending the definition of a ""biological product""2 in\n\nsection 351(i) of the PHS Act to include a ""protein (except any chemically synthesizedpolypeptide),""3 and describing procedures for submission of a marketing application for certain biological products.\n\nFootnote 3: FDA has described its interpretation of the statutory terms “protein” and “chemically synthesized polypeptide” in the amended definition of “biological product” in guidance. See draft guidance for industry New and Revised Draft Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act (Revision 2). When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic. FDA’s guidances for industry are available on the FDA Drugs guidance web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs web guidance page. In addition, in the Federal Register of December 12, 2018, FDA also has issued a proposed rule to amend its regulation that defines “biological product” to incorporate changes made by the BPCI Act, and to provide its interpretation of the statutory terms “protein” and “chemically synthesized polypeptide.” When final, this regulation will codify FDA’s interpretation of these terms.\n\nThe BPCI Act requires that a marketing application for a ""biological product"" (that previously could have been submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act) must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act; this requirement is subject to certain exceptions during a 10-year transition period ending on March 23, 2020 (see section 7002(e)(1)-(3) and (e)(5) of the BPCI Act and section II of this guidance). On March 23, 2020 (i.e., the transition date), an approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act (see section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act). This guidance sets forth FDA\'s current interpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nBPCI Act\n\nThe BPCI Act amended the PHS Act and other statutes to create an abbreviated licensure pathway in section 351(k) of the PHS Act for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product (see sections 7001 through 7003 of the BPCI Act). The objectives of the BPCI Act are conceptually similar to those of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417) (commonly referred to as the ""Hatch-Waxman Amendments""), which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of drug products under section 505(b)(2) and 505(j) of the FD&C Act. An abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products can present challenges given the scientific and technical complexities that may be associated with the generally larger and typically more complex structure of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured. Most biological products are produced in a living system such as a microorganism, or plant or animal cells, whereas small molecule drugs are typically manufactured through chemical synthesis.\n\nSection 351(k) of the PHS Act, added by the BPCI Act, sets forth, among other things, the requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product and an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product. Section 351(i) defines ""biosimilarity"" to mean that ""the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components"" and that ""there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product"" (section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act). A 351(k) application must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based upon data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies, unless FDA determines, in its discretion, that certain studies are unnecessary in a 351(k) application (see section 351(k)(2) of the PHS Act). To meet the standard for ""interchangeability,"" an applicant must provide sufficient information to demonstrate biosimilarity, and also to demonstrate that the biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, if the biological product is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch (see section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act). Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nThe BPCI Act also includes, among other provisions:\n\nA 12-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which approval of a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be made effective (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nA 4-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be submitted (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry'

This approach is intended to minimize burden on holders of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act who are preparing submissions to their applications around the transition date and to facilitate the administrative conversion of any pending supplements to such applications (see the Transition Policy Final Guidance for additional information regarding such supplements). The use of a predictable application numbering system for deemed BLAs is also expected to facilitate preparation and submission of a 351(k) BLA for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeableproduct that references a product licensed in a deemed 351(a) BLA as a reference product. The FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date will include the product\'s BLA number.\n\nWhen will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the license number that will apply to its deemed BLA(s)?\n\nThe FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be an approved BLA will include the U.S. license number assigned to the application holder. Each establishment that is listed in the approved NDA as currently involved in the manufacture of the biological product on the transition date will be considered a licensed establishment on that date (see section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act; see also section 7002(e)(4)(B)(iii) of the BPCI Act). FDA does not intend to conduct pre-license inspections of manufacturers of the transitioning biological products because FDA interprets section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act to mean that an approved application under the FD&C Act for the biological product will be ""deemed to be a license"" on the transition date by operation of the statute.12 Moreover, the establishments will have been inspected in connection with the previously approved NDAs under the FD&C Act (see Q16 below for information on establishment inspections related to certain supplements to a deemed 351(a) BLA).\n\nFootnote 12: See also footnote 10 in the response to Q2.\n\nFDA issues only one U.S. license number per BLA holder, regardless of the number of licensed biological products manufactured by that BLA holder under separate BLAs. Accordingly, if an NDA holder is also a BLA holder and has been assigned a U.S. license number for another biological product, the NDA holder will not be issued a different U.S. license number when its approved NDA for a biological product is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date.\n\nSection 351(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the PHS Act requires that each package of a biological product is plainly marked with, among other things, the applicable license number of the manufacturer of the biological product in order for the biological product to be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce. To minimize possible disruption in the distribution of biological products in the United States and to minimize burden on holders of deemed BLAs, FDA intends to adopt a compliance policy for the labeling of biological products that are the subject of deemed BLAs (see Q14 and section IV below for additional information on the compliance policy for labeling of biological products in deemed BLAs).\n\nWill an approved NDA for a biological product be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA or a 351(k) BLA?\n\nFDA interprets the transition provision, along with the applicable provisions of the FD&C Act and the PHS Act, to mean that an approved NDA, including an application submitted through the pathway described by section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act (505(b)(2) application), will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA on the transition date.\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act is directed primarily to the submission of an application for a biological product during the transition period ending on March 23, 2020, and does not explicitly state whether an approved NDA will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA or a 351(k) BLA. The Agency\'s interpretation that an approved NDA submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA is based on the shared requirement that both types of applications contain full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (or, for a 351(a) BLA, safety, purity, and potency). We expect that the measures FDA has taken to minimize differences in the review and approval of products in marketing applications submitted under section 351(a) of the PHS Act and section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act will facilitate implementation of the statutory provision under which an approved NDA will be deemed to be a BLA.\n\nThe Agency\'s interpretation that an approved 505(b)(2) application will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA reflects the shared requirement that both types of applications contain full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (or, for a 351(a) BLA, safety, purity, and potency).13 This approach also reflects the Agency\'s view that it is more appropriate to regulate a biological product approved through the 505(b)(2) pathway that may be intended to differ in certain respects (e.g., different strength, dosage form, or route of administration or approved conditions of use) from a previously approved product under the statutory and regulatory framework for 351(a) BLAs, as such differences are not permitted under the statutory framework for 351(k) BLAs. Moreover, FDA\'s approval of a 505(b)(2) application reflects the Agency\'s evaluation of the data against a different statutory standard than a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: A 505(b)(2) application is an NDA that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use (e.g., FDA’s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug or published literature).\n\nWill an approved NDA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing be deemed to be a BLA?*\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) states that an ""approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the [FD&C Act]"" will be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date. Accordingly, FDA interprets the statute to mean that an approved NDA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing, but for which FDA has not withdrawn approval of the application, will be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date. The holder of an NDA for a discontinued product must comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for its application before the transition date, and after its application is deemed to be a BLA. These requirements include, for example, postmarketing reporting of adverse drug experiences and, if appropriate, the submission of proposed revisions to product labeling. If the holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing seeks to reintroduce the product to the market, the BLA holder should consult with the relevant FDA review division before submitting a supplement to the deemed BLA, to discuss any data and information that may be needed.\n\nHow will the transition on March 23, 2020, affect the annual program fee for an approved NDA for a biological product?\n\nUnder section 736(a)(2) of the FD&C Act, a person named as the applicant in a human drug application (which refers to an NDA or a 351(a) BLA, subject to applicable statutory exceptions) is assessed an annual prescription drug program fee. A prescription drug program fee is assessed each fiscal year for each prescription drug product identified in a human drug application approved as of October 1 of the fiscal year, with certain exceptions described by statute. For more information about the prescription drug program fee, consult the FDA guidance for industry Assessing User Fees Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017 (May 2018).\n\nIn general, sponsors of biological products for which annual prescription drug program fees are assessed prior to the transition, and that are deemed to be licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act on the transition date, will continue to be assessed prescription drug program fees for such products after the transition, subject to applicable statutory requirements and exceptions.\n\nIf an applicant withdraws an NDA that is tentatively approved on or before the transition date, or otherwise pending with FDA, and submits an application for the same product under section 351(a) of the PHS Act, will an additional PDUFA application fee be assessed?\n\nAn applicant (or the applicant\'s licensee, assignee, or successor) will not be charged a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) application fee for the submission of an application under section 351(a) of the PHS Act if all of the following circumstances are satisfied (see section 736(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act):\n\nThe applicant previously submitted an NDA for the same product and paid the associated PDUFA application fee for the NDA.\n\nThe NDA was accepted for filing. (Note that an NDA for a biological product will not be accepted for filing after the transition date.)\n\nThe NDA was not approved14 or was withdrawn (without a waiver). Footnote 14: An NDA that is tentatively approved is notan approved NDA (see 21 CFR 314.105(a)).\n\nFor questions regarding user fees, please contact the User Fee Staff at\n--------------------\nContext title: The “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA\'s list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: The holders of deemed BLAs may be required to report or provide different information than is required for biological products under the FD&C Act. In the sections below, we highlight such requirements, namely lot release, biological product distribution reports, notification of manufacturing problems involving distributed products, and establishment standards for ""non-specified biological products.""Additionally, as with all biological products, FDA may recommend changes to the control strategy throughout the product life cycle to modernize control strategies, to address product-specific issues, and to help ensure that biological products remain safe, pure, and potent for their approved conditions of use. Furthermore, as with all biological products, these changes may be recommended as a result of postapproval or surveillance inspections, which are independent of a submission and generally expected to be similar for a biological product whether approved in an NDA prior to the transition date or licensed in a BLA. For inspections related to CMC supplements see Q16 below.\n\nFDA is committed to working with application holders to minimize any potential burden, and encourages application holders with any CMC-related questions to contact OPQ/Office of Program and Regulatory Operations (OPRO) at CDER-OPQ-Inquiries@fda.hhs.gov.\n\niv.1.1 Lot Release\n\nFDA may require that a BLA holder submit samples and CMC data for each lot of product for FDA review and release (see 21 CFR 610.2). However, FDA generally does not anticipate that lot release requirements will apply for biological products approved in NDAs that are deemed to be BLAs.\n\nIn 1995, FDA announced the elimination of lot-by-lot release for licensed well-characterized therapeutic recombinant DNA-derived and monoclonal antibody biotechnology products (see the 1995 (Federal\\,Register) notice ""Interim Definition and Elimination of Lot-by-Lot Release For Well-Characterized Therapeutic Recombinant DNA-Derived and Monoclonal Antibody Biotechnology Products; Notice,"" (60 FR 63048, December 8, 1995)). FDA subsequently amended 21 CFR 601.2 to specify, instead of the term ""well characterized biotechnology product,"" the categories of products to which lot-by-lot release would not be necessary (see ""Elimination of Establishment License Application for Specified Biotechnology and Specified Synthetic Biological Products,"" 61 FR 24227, May 14, 1996). Most of the biological products subject to the transition provision will meet the description of products for which lot-by-lot release is not required. Furthermore, for biological products that do not fall into the categories specified in 21 CFR 601.2, FDA generally does not anticipate that lot-by-lot release will be needed. As stated in the December 1995 (Federal\\,Register) notice:\n\n[O]nce a company has demonstrated its ability to consistently produce acceptable lots, and has procedures in place that will prevent the release of lots that do not meet release specifications, it is not necessary for FDA to verify that each manufactured lot is acceptable for release.19\n\nFDA generally considers application holders for biological products subject to the transition provision as having demonstrated the ""ability to consistently produce acceptable lots"" and as having ""procedures in place that will prevent the release of lots that do not meet release specifications"" based on product history.\n\n4.2.2 Product Distribution Reports\n\nFDA anticipates that all biological product application holders will have adequate records of the product distributed to the market. Although the frequency and content of distribution reporting required for products regulated under the FD&C Act and PHS Act differ, FDA expects these differences will present minimal burden to holders of deemed BLAs.\n\nApplication holders of biological products affected by the transition provision should be aware that 21 CFR 600.81, which covers product distribution reporting for licensed BLAs, requires submission of more granular distribution data than is required for approved NDAs under 21 CFR 314.81. However, FDA anticipates that affected application holders will generally already have the distribution information specified in 21 CFR 600.81. Additionally, 21 CFR 600.81 requires reporting every 6 months, in contrast to annual reporting. However, holders of deemed BLAs may request at any time, including within the first 6 months of being deemed a BLA, a waiver to provide product distribution reports annually (e.g., to align with the timing of the holder\'s Annual Report) rather than every 6 months (21 CFR 600.90). The requirements for a waiver request are described in 21 CFR 600.90.\n\n4.2.3 Notification of Manufacturing Problems Involving Distributed Products\n\nRegardless of whether a biological product has been approved under the FD&C Act or licensed under the PHS Act, application holders are required to report certain events that have the potential to affect the safety, purity, or potency of a distributed product. Under the FD&C Act, reporting of such events is through a field alert report (FAR) (see 21 CFR 314.81(b)(1)), while under the PHS Act, reporting is through a biological product deviation report (BPDR) (see 21 CFR 600.14). FDA expects the change in reporting between FAR and BPDR will present minimal burden to holders of deemed BLAs.\n\nIn particular, we note that under 21 CFR 600.14, application holders for biological products approved under the FD&C Act will be required, once the product is deemed to be licensed under a BLA, to report on events with the potential to affect the safety, purity, or potency of a distributed product by submission of BPDRs to CDER. Additionally, the BPDR is to be submitted as soon as possible but within 45 calendar days of acquiring information reasonably suggesting that a reportable event has occurred (rather than within 3 calendar days as is required in the case of a FAR). Finally, for any initial FAR submitted by the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product before March 23, 2020, the corresponding follow-up report is to be submitted as a BPDR if submitted on or after March 23, 2020.\n\n4.2.4 Establishment Standards for ""Non-Specified Biological Products""\n\nBiological products that do not fall within the specified categories of biological products described in 21 CFR 601.2 (""non-specified biological products"") are subject to certain additional CMC-related requirements under the PHS Act when seeking marketing approval in a BLA or BLA supplement (see establishment standards described in 21 CFR 600.10, 600.11, 600.12 and 600.13). These requirements differ in some respects from establishment standards under the FD&C Act; however, FDA expects the practical implications for transition biological products tobe minimal. As a preliminary matter, we note that an approved NDA for a biological product will be deemed to be a license (i.e., an approved BLA) for the biological product by operation of the BPCI Act. Accordingly, certain premarket approval requirements may not be applicable unless the application holder seeks approval of a supplement to the deemed BLA and the requirement applies to the supplement (see Q16 below). Moreover, as provided in 21 CFR 601.2, the additional requirements described above are not applicable to the ""specified categories"" of biological products described in that section of the regulations, and many transition biological products will fall within those identified categories of biological products, for which such additional requirements would not be applicable.\n\nQ16. What is required for CMC changes submitt d in a PAS or changes being effected supplements submitted to deemed 351(a) BLAs?\n\nFDA requires applicants or application holders of biological products--whether approved under the FD&C Act or licensed under the PHS Act--to notify FDA about each change in the conditions established in an approved application. The types of reporting categories for biological products generally are the same for an NDA (see 21 CFR 314.70) and for a BLA (see 21 CFR 601.12), and in both cases, the applicant or application holder is expected to demonstrate that the postchange product continues to be of acceptable quality as it may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. Overall, the nature and type of data required to support such a demonstration has historically been similar for biological products approved under the FD&C Act or licensed under the PHS Act.\n\nHowever, there are limited differences with respect to the type, timing, and evaluation of certain data in submissions, and verification of these data during the review cycle and inspection varies. For example, validation data would be required to be submitted in BLA supplements to support certain postapproval changes (21 CFR 601.12). In another example, for biological products that do not fall within the specified categories of biological products described in 21 CFR 601.2 (""non-specified biological products""), compliance with the establishment standards set forth under 21 CFR 600.10, 600.11, 600.12, and 600.13 may be required for a BLA supplement to support certain postapproval changes (e.g., addition of a new facility).\n\nApplication holders that intend to propose manufacturing changes are encouraged to contact OPQ/OPRO at CDER-OPO-Inquiries@fda.hhs.gov. FDA is committed to working with application holders to minimize any potential burden.\n\nv.1.1 Data Necessary to Support a Process or Manufacturing Site Change\n--------------------\nContext title: The “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA\'s list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: The term applicant means the owner, holder, or sponsor of a new drug application (NDA) or biologics license application (BLA).\n\nContents\n\nThe term application includes both NDAs and BLAs.\n\nThe term drug includes drug and biologic products.\n\nThe term final dosage form means, with respect to a prescription drug product, a finished dosage form which is approved for administration to a patient without substantial further manufacturing.5 Substantial further manufacturing does not include packaging.6 FDA generally considers a product to be in final dosage form unless one or more of the following operations is required but has yet to be performed: mixing, granulating, milling, molding, lyophilizing, tableting, encapsulating, coating, sterilizing, and filling sterile, aerosol, or gaseous drugs into dispensing containers.\n\nThe term human drug application means an application for (1) approval of a new drug submitted under section 505(b) of the Act or (2) license of a biological drug product under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act).7 For purposes of this guidance, the term human drug application does not include the following:\n\nFootnote 5: Section 735(4) of the Act.\n\nFootnote 6: See section 735(5) of the Act.\n\nFootnote 7: Section 735(1) of the Act.\n\nA supplement to such an application\n\nAn application with respect to whole blood or a blood component for transfusion\n\nAn application with respect to a bovine blood product for topical application licensed before September 1, 1992\n\nAn application for an allergenic extract product\n\nAn application for a device licensed under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act\n\nAn application with respect to a large volume parenteral drug product approved before September 1, 1992\n\nAn application for a license of a biological product for further manufacturing use only\n\nAn application submitted by a State or Federal Government entity for a drug that is not distributed commercially8 Footnote 8: Id.\n\nThe term person means the person subject to fees and includes any affiliates of that person.9 The term person includes an individual, partnership, corporation, and association.10 This document will also use the term person when referring to an applicant.

Each is addressed in a separate waiver guidance. Specifically, for companies participating in the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, see the guidance document, User Fee Waivers for FDC and Co-Packaged HIV Drugs for PEPFAR. For companies submitting combination products under 21 Code of Federal Regulations 3.2(e), see the guidance for industry and FDA staff on Application User Fees for Combination Products. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance Web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nThe applicant is a small business submitting its first human drug application to the Secretary for review.\n\nThe Act also provides for waiver or reduction of user fees if the fees would exceed the anticipated present and future costs incurred by the Secretary in conducting the process for the review of human drug applications for the person. Fees-exceed-the-costs waivers and reductions are not addressed in this guidance document.13\n\nFootnote 13: There is a separate guidance document that discusses the Agency’s current thinking on the fees-exceed-the-costs waiver provision. For more information, see the guidance document, Fees-Exceed-the-Costs Waivers Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, and its addendum at the guidance Web page.\n\nAppendix A Public Health\n\nUnder section 736(d)(1)(A) of the Act, an applicant may qualify for a waiver of or reduction in application, product, and/or establishment fees if the waiver or reduction is necessary to protect the public health. Under this provision, FDA may grant a public health waiver of or reduction in user fees if the Agency finds that the following two criteria are met:\n\nThe product protects the public health; and\n\nThe applicant shows that a waiver or reduction is necessary to continue an activity that protects the public health.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTo qualify for a waiver or reduction in user fees under this provision, an applicant must meet both criteria.\n\n2.2.2 Does the product protect the public health?\n\nFor user fee purposes, a product that has been approved for marketing in the United States is not automatically deemed to be a product that protects the public health. In evaluating whether a product protects the public health, the Agency asks the following questions:\n\nIs the drug product a significant improvement (or does it have the potential to be a significant improvement if the drug product is not yet approved) compared to other marketed products, including other dosage forms or routes of administration and non-drug products or therapies?\n\nAre there treatment alternatives? The existence of alternatives would weigh against a determination that a product is necessary to protect the public health.\n\nIs the drug product designated as a priority drug,14 has it been granted fast track status,15 or has it been determined to be a new molecular entity? Affirmative answers to these questions usually indicate that a product protects the public health. Other questions the Agency may consider include:\n\nFootnote 14: Further information regarding priority drugs can be found in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research’s (CDER’s) Manual of Policies and Procedures (MAPP) 6020.3R, Review Classification Policy: Priority (P) and Standard (S). MAPP 6020.3R is available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov, search by MAPP number.\n\nFootnote 15: Further information regarding fast track status can be found in CDER’s guidance for industry on Fast Track Development Programs — Designation, Development, and Application Review.\n\nDoes the drug product demonstrate an increased effectiveness in the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of disease?\n\nDoes it eliminate or substantially reduce a treatment-limiting drug reaction?\n\nDoes the drug product enhance patient adherence to treatment?\n\nHas the drug product shown potential evidence of safety and effectiveness for a new or underserved subpopulation (e.g., treatment for a drug resistant microbe or response to a homeland security concern)?\n\nIs the drug product intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition?\n\nDoes the drug product address unmet medical needs or demonstrate the potential to do so?\n\nIs the product designated as a drug for a rare disease or condition under section 526 of the Act (i.e., does it have an orphan designation)?Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the product is approved, is it available to the public? There is no benefit to the public health if a product is not made available to the public.16 Footnote 16: We would consider products stockpiled for homeland security concerns as available to the public for user fee waiver purposes.\n\nIs the waiver or reduction necessary to continue an activity that protects the public health?\n\nTo determine whether a waiver of or reduction in user fees is necessary to continue an activity that protects the public health, the Agency considers not only the benefit to the public health, but also whether the waiver or reduction is necessary. The legislative history of PDUFA I states that FDA may waive or reduce fees unless such a waiver or reduction is not necessary to protect the public health, or it is apparent that the fee will not be a disincentive to innovation.17 It also expressly notes that FDA should consider the ""limited resources"" of the applicant when evaluating a request for a fee waiver or reduction under section 736(d).18 Therefore, the Agency believes that a financial test is appropriate for the public health waiver provision. The Agency considers the relationship between the annualized cost of user fees and the financial resources of the applicant, including affiliates, requesting the waiver or reduction. The financial considerations are discussed in section IV.C below.\n\nFootnote 17: House Report 102-895 (1992) at 17.\n\nBarrier to Innovation\n\nUnder section 736(d)(1)(B) of the Act, an applicant may qualify for a waiver of or reduction in application, product, and/or establishment fees when the assessment of the fees would present a significant barrier to innovation because of limited resources available to the applicant or other circumstances. Under this provision, FDA may grant a waiver of or reduction in user fees if:\n\nThe product or other products or technologies under development by the applicant are innovative; and\n\nThe fee(s) would be a significant barrier to the applicant\'s ability to develop, manufacture, or market innovative products or to pursue innovative technology.\n\nTo qualify for a waiver or reduction in user fees under this provision, an applicant must meet both criteria.\n--------------------\nContext title: User Fee Waivers, Reductions, and Refunds for Drug and Biological Products'

What is required for CMC changes submitt d in a PAS or changes being effected supplements submitted to deemed 351(a) BLAs?\n\nFDA requires applicants or application holders of biological products--whether approved under the FD&C Act or licensed under the PHS Act--to notify FDA about each change in the conditions established in an approved application. The types of reporting categories for biological products generally are the same for an NDA (see 21 CFR 314.70) and for a BLA (see 21 CFR 601.12), and in both cases, the applicant or application holder is expected to demonstrate that the postchange product continues to be of acceptable quality as it may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product.

In another example, for biological products that do not fall within the specified categories of biological products described in 21 CFR 601.2 (""non-specified biological products""), compliance with the establishment standards set forth under 21 CFR 600.10, 600.11, 600.12, and 600.13 may be required for a BLA supplement to support certain postapproval changes (e.g., addition of a new facility).\n\nApplication holders that intend to propose manufacturing changes are encouraged to contact OPQ/OPRO at CDER-OPO-Inquiries@fda.hhs.gov. FDA is committed to working with application holders to minimize any potential burden.\n\nv.1.1 Data Necessary to Support a Process or Manufacturing Site Change\n\nSupplements to applications for biological products subject to the transition provision that remain under review after the transition date, including supplements submitted prior to the transition date, must comply with 21 CFR 601.12 and other applicable regulations. Applicants should also consult relevant guidances for biological products. A supplement submitted to a deemed BLA to support process or manufacturing site changes must contain, for the lots manufactured using the postchange process, manufacturing process validation data (see 21 CFR 601.12). Specifically, process validation for a BLA should be performed at commercial manufacturing scale, prior to submission of a supplement. Process validation information should be included in the supplement as this may affect submission and implementation timelines of the changes for commercial distribution.\n\nA supplement requesting approval of a proposed change to the manufacturing site for a biological product also must assess the effects of the change and contain sufficient information to support the safety, purity, and potency of material manufactured with the change (21 CFR 601.12(a)(2); compare 21 CFR 314.70). In assessing the effects of the change, information demonstrating comparability of the pre and postchange material should also be submitted, consistent with the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process (June 2005) and the recommendations below.\n\nComparability data.\n\nThe type and amount of data needed to support a comparability exercise depends on the extent of the changes and the potential risk to product quality. A robust control strategy for drug substance and drug product is critical in generating comparability data. For example, a potency assay that is accurate, precise, and reliable will facilitate the review of manufacturing changes. In some cases, in addition to the typical battery of release tests, extended characterization may be necessary for comparison, in particular for process changes that may affect purity, potency, or safety of the product.\n\nBatch analysis data.\n\nAppropriate stability data.\n\nGenerally, limited real-time stability data for the postchange product and comparability study results, including stability data under accelerated and stressed storage conditions, are sufficient to leverage existing stability data to support the shelf life of the postchange product.\n\nAs with all biological products, FDA may recommend changes to the control strategy throughout the product life cycle to modernize outdated assays, to address product-specific issues, and to help ensure that biological products remain safe, pure, and potent for their approved conditions of use.\n\nvi.2.2 Facility Inspections Related to Certain Supplements to a Deemed 351(a) BLA\n\nWhether a biological product is regulated under the FD&C Act or the PHS Act, application holders for biological products should be ready for FDA inspections to assure such compliance with the conditions of approval.\n\nAfter March 23, 2020, supplements submitted to deemed BLAs, including supplements submitted prior to the transition date but with an action date after the transition date, must comply with the inspection requirements as specified in the relevant regulations in 21 CFR part 600.\n\nIn particular, supplements for site changes where facilities are added to the license or supplements for major manufacturing changes may be subject to an inspection. FDA intends to contact the holder of a deemed BLA to schedule any such inspection during the review of the supplement. After March 23, 2020, holders of deemed BLAs that submit a site change or major manufacturing change supplement are advised that, as with the holder of any BLA, they should be ready for an inspection while in operation and manufacturing the product for which the change is requested during the supplement review timeframe.\n\nQ17. Can the application holder for a deemed 351(a) BLA for a biological product originally approved through the 505(b)(2) pathway submit a supplement that relies, in part, on FDA\'s finding of safety, purity, and potency for another licensed biological product?\n\nSupplements to a deemed 351(a) BLA, like any supplement to any 351(a) BLA, must meet the requirements of section 351(a) of the PHS Act. The holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product originally approved through the 505(b)(2) pathway may not, for example, submit an efficacy supplement to the deemed 351(a) BLA that relies on FDA\'s finding of safety, purity, and potency for another licensed biological product (e.g., for a newly approved indication or other condition of use for a related biological product).\n\nThere might be instances where there is a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a stand-alone NDA or a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a 505(b)(2) application that would be administratively converted to a pending efficacy supplement to the corresponding deemed 351(a) BLA on the transition date. To obtain approval under section 351(a) of the PHS Act, the applicant may need to amend the administratively converted supplement to provide the scientific data necessary to meet the requirements of section 351(a) of the PHS Act, or a right of reference to such data, for the change proposed in the supplement.\n\nQ18. Can a biological product approved in an NDA that is deemed to be a 351(a) BLA on the transition date subsequently be a ""reference product"" for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product?\n\nA biological product approved in an NDA (including a 505(b)(2) application) that is deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act may be a reference product for a 351(k) BLA. The term ""reference product"" is defined as the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in an application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act (see section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nSponsors may request advice from FDA regarding proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product development programs that identify a biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as the intended reference product. A sponsor will be able to submit a 351(k) BLA that references the biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as its reference product after the NDA for the biological product is deemed to be a 351(a) BLA.\n\nQ19. Can an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a ""deemed"" 351(a) BLA seek a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act to another biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act?\n\nAny person (including an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a ""deemed"" 351(a) BLA) may seek to establish the biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product to another biological product licensed or deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. FDA intends to work with applicants to address scientific or regulatory issues that may arise in the context of these 351(k) development programs, and to provide additional procedural information. Any sponsor or applicant may contact the relevant review division within the Office of New Drugs in FDA\'s CDER to request advice on a 351(k) development program.\n\nD. Transition of Biological Products from the Orange Book to the Purple Book\n\nQ20.

On occasion, the Agency may request such documents when pursuing an audit trail of a possible violation. Under these circumstances, it is the laboratory's prerogative to cooperate or refuse without fear of reprisal. The requests should be specific and pertinent to the inspection. The Agency discourages investigators from making vague requests to see documents with no specific purpose in mind.\n* Should the Form-FD-483, Notice of Observations issued by the FDA investigator reflect current practices only; and should it include practices that were corrected during the course of the inspection?\n\nThe FD-483 can include historical practices, which may have affected the scientific validity of the nonclinical study in question even though subsequent correction may have occurred. Any corrective action taken by the facility will be noted by the investigator in the establishment inspection report.\n* At time of the observation, the management should discuss any differing opinions and attempt to clarify the investigator's perceptions or observations. The management may also, at the conclusion of the inspection, offer to explain what the management considers to be erroneous 483 observations. Should the matter in question remain unresolved, a written objection should be sent to the local FDA district director or a meeting with district personnel should be requested to attempt to resolve the issue.\n* What is the procedure for correcting errors in the FDA investigator's inspection report? Such errors can be damaging to the laboratories since the reports are ultimately available through FOI.\n\nIf in fact an error is made in an investigator's report, the matter should be immediately brought to the attention of FDA district management. If district management agrees with the complaint, the report will be amended and amended reports will be sent to all outside persons who may have received the erroneous report. It should be stressed, however, that the time to change what a facility believes is an erroneous conclusion is when the FD-483 is discussed with laboratory management because as soon as the FD-483 is presented to management, it becomes available for public disclosure.\n18. Does refusal to allow the FDA investigator access to certain information, which the laboratory sincerely believes is not subject to FDA jurisdiction, constitute a refusal of inspection? How can a disagreement of this kind be resolved? Refusal to permit access to records which are associated with a study being audited or which preclude a judgement being made regarding compliance with GLPs, is considered a refusal of inspection with certain ensuing consequences. However, a facility may legitimately question FDA authority to review certain documents. Such objections and the reasons therefore, should be presented in writing or by telephone to the FDA district office management where the investigator is based. Each case will be individually reviewed both in the field and, if necessary at headquarters and a decision will be communicated to the inspected facility.\n19. Will inspections and audits of foreign laboratories be carried out? Who pays for these inspections? Inspections are being conducted of foreign facilities, which have engaged in nonclinical studies, which have been submitted to FDA in support of a marketing permit. FDA pays for travel and other expenses associated with such inspections.\n20. In order for foreign laboratories to comply with the GLPs, do protocols, standard operating procedures, records, etc. have to be in English? Do FDA investigators bring interpreters with them to review records and data? Submissions to FDA in support of a marketing application for a FDA regulated product must be in English. Review of source documents at the site of the foreign facility may necessitate review of documents written in the language of the country of origin. FDA does not employ interpreters to accompany investigators on foreign inspections. It has been our experience that persons associated with the laboratory are normally fluent in the English language.\n21. What kind of training does an FDA investigator have which qualifies him/her to conduct a GLP inspection or data audit? Does the investigator draw conclusions from his observations regarding the competence of the laboratory or quality of the studies? Along with education in one of the natural or physical sciences, the individuals selected to conduct GLP inspections generally have had considerable experience inspecting facilities involved in drug manufacturing, biologics production, medical device assembly, food processing, and a range of other operations on products regulated by the Agency. In addition, the investigators conducting nonclinical laboratory inspections (GLPs) have undergone intensive training in the normal operating procedures of nonclinical testing facilities. This training which includes a full review of the Agency's policies and of the GLP regulations National Center for Toxicological Research accomplished at FDA's National located in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. Field investigators are encouraged to contact any resource within the Agency, i.e., scientists and other personnel of the various bureaus to resolve scientific questions that may arise during an inspection. Bureau scientists and not the investigators, draw conclusions regarding the competence of the laboratory of the quality of the study\n22. Does a laboratory manager have the right to ask for the FDA investigator's educational and experience qualifications prior to a GLP inspection?\n\nYes, questions regarding the formal training, educational experience, and on-the-job training of an individual investigator may be addressed to the investigator prior to a GLP inspection.\n23. What can a laboratory manager do when he encounters an FDA investigator who is overly antagonistic or uncertain as to what he is looking for?\n\nThe Agency makes every effort to promote a professional attitude in its investigators including special training and selection of investigators for this program. However, if in the judgement of the laboratory manager there is a question as to the qualifications or attitude of the investigator, the local FDA district office director should be contacted.\n24. What assurance does a firm have that confidential or trade secret information given to the FDA investigator will be safeguarded by the Agency? What happens when an FOI request for the inspection report is received by FDA?\n\nSection 301(j) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits any employee from revealing for his/her advantage any information obtained in the course of carrying out his/her duties. Trade secrets and confidential commercial information are deleted from documents before they are released under FOI. Inspected firms may help by identifying information, which they consider to be confidential when it is given to the investigator. FDA will however, exercise its own judgment, in accordance with its FOI regulations as to whether such information may properly be classified as confidential.\n25. How can copies of inspection reports be obtained under FOI?\n\nInspection reports may be obtained by making a request under FOI to:\n\nFreedom of Information Staff, HFI-35\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, Maryland 20857\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit Comments Online (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-1976-N-0476-0380)\n\nYou can submit online or written comments on any guidance at any time (see 21 CFR 10.115(g)(5))\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll written comments should be identified with this document's docket number: FDA-1976-N-0476-0380\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-1976-N-0476-0380).\n\nSearch for FDA\n\nGuidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n--------------------\nContext: 2 What Actions Can FDA Take to Address Clinical Investigator Misconduct?\n\nIf an inspection conducted by FDA reveals that a clinical investigator has committed violations of FDA\'s regulations, FDA generally will notify the investigator of the violations and take appropriate follow-up action. This notification may consist of the Form FDA 483 (Inspectiona1 Observations) issued at the close of this inspection, or it may be in the form of a Warning Letter. In some cases, an investigator\'s agreement to correct the violations may be sufficient to resolve the matter. Where FDA finds that there have been serious violations of the investigator\'s obligations, and corrective action by the investigator cannot resolve the matter, FDA may conclude that it is appropriate to initiate an enforcement action against the investigator. First, if the inspectional findings indicate that the investigator has repeatedly or deliberately violated FDA regulations or repeatedly or deliberately submitted false information, FDA may move to disqualify the investigator from conducting future studies regulated by FDA. Second, FDA may initiate a civil or criminal enforcement action in federal court. Such actions can take several months and frequently years to complete.\n\nTo disqualify a clinical investigator, FDA must go through an administrative process involving an opportunity for hearing (21 CFR 312.70). When a Center (i.e., CBER or CDER) has reviewed the inspectional findings and determined that there is evidence of repeated or deliberate violations or repeated or deliberate submission of false information, and that the pattern or severity of the misconduct warrants agency action, the Center issues a Notice of Initiation of Disqualification Proceedings and Opportunity to Explain (NIDPOE) letter, which furnishes the investigator with written notice of the matter and offers the investigator an opportunity to explain the matter in writing, or, at the option of the investigator, in an informal conference. If an informal conference is held, the investigator may bring an attorney. If, after hearing the investigator\'s explanation, the Center still believes that the investigator\'s actions meet the threshold for disqualification, the Center must offer the investigator an opportunity for a regulatory hearing, whose procedures are governed by 21 CFR Part 16 (21 CFR 312.70). The investigator may enter into a consent agreement or may request a hearing. At a regulatory hearing, the investigator may offer the testimony of witnesses, documentary evidence, and supporting briefs. After the hearing, the presiding officer issues a report or decision on whether the investigator has repeatedly or deliberately violated the regulations and should be disqualified.\n\nThe report is forwarded to the Commissioner, who then issues a Commissioner\'s decision on disqualification (21 CFR Part 16). The investigator may appeal the Commissioner\'s decision in federal court. A disqualification proceeding generally takes many months or years to complete.\n\nHow Can FDA Protect Human Subjects Following the Discovery of Clinical Investigator Misconduct?\n\nInitiation of an enforcement action in federal court or a disqualification proceeding does not by itself halt an investigator\'s participation in clinical trials. Until an investigator is disqualified by FDA, the investigator remains free to participate in ongoing and new clinical investigations. There are, however, instances in which the investigator\'s misconduct appears to pose an ongoing risk to the safety and welfare of the human subjects under the care of that investigator. For example, where an investigator is found to have failed to monitor subjects for signs of serious toxicity associated with the experimental therapy, or falsified eligibility data, FDA may conclude that subjects under that investigator\'s care are at risk. Under such circumstances, protection of subjects may demand a more rapid intervention than would be offered by an enforcement action or a disqualification proceeding. As discussed above, an effective means of acting promptly to protect human subjects after the discovery of serious investigator misconduct is to impose a clinical hold on those studies or study sites involving the investigator.\n\n3 Use of Clinical holds to Protect Human Subjects\n\nWhat Is a Clinical Hold?\n\nA clinical hold is an order by FDA that immediately suspends or imposes restrictions on an ongoing or proposed clinical study. FDA has promulgated regulations authorizing clinical holds for studies involving drugs and biological products (21 CFR 312.42). Section 312.42(a) provides the scope and effect of a clinical hold order:\n\nA clinical hold is an order issued by FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. The clinical hold order may apply to one or more of the investigations covered by an IND. When a proposed study is placed on clinical hold, subjects may not be given the investigational drug. When an ongoing study is placed on clinical hold, no new subjects may be recruited to the study and placed on the investigational drug; patients already in the study should be taken off therapy involving the investigational drug unless specifically permitted by FDA in the interest of patient safety.\n\nA clinical hold may be complete or partial.3 Delay or suspension of all clinical work under an IND is considered a complete clinical hold. Delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work under an IND is considered a partial clinical hold. A partial clinical hold could, for example, be imposed to delay or suspend one of several protocols in an IND, a part of a protocol, or a specific study site in a multi-site investigation.\n\nFDA\'s regulation authorizing clinical holds on studies of drugs and biological products sets forth grounds for imposing a hold. Those grounds vary depending on the nature of the study.4 For all types of studies, however, FDA may impose a clinical hold if it finds that ""[h]uman subjects are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury"" (21 CFR 312.42(b)(1)(i), (b)(2)(i), (b)(3)(i)(A), (b)(3)(ii)(E)(2), (b)(4)(i), (b)(5)(i), (b)(6)(i)).\n\nFootnote 4: The types of studies covered by § 312.42 include: Phase 1 studies, § 312.42(b)(1), Phase 2 and 3 studies, § 312.42(b)(2), proposed and ongoing treatment use, § 312.42(b)(3)(i)(iii), studies that are not designed to be adequate and well-controlled, § 312.42(b)(4), studies involving an exception from informed consent under § 50.24, § 312.42(b)(5), and studies involving an exception from informed consent under § 50.23, § 312.42(b)(6).\n\nUnder What Circumstances Would FDA Consider Imposing A Clinical Hold Following Discovery Of Clinical Investigator Misconduct?\n\nFDA believes that, in some situations, clinical investigator misconduct may be sufficiently serious to conclude that human subjects under that investigator\'s care are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury. FDA anticipates that the use of clinical holds in instances of misconduct will be infrequent. In this section, FDA provides guidance on the circumstances in which the agency could reach such a conclusion and impose a clinical hold on the study or study sites in which an investigator is involved. Still, FDA may impose a clinical hold on a study or study site whenever it finds that human subjects are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury. The grounds for imposition of a clinical hold need not include a finding of misconduct or a violation of a regulation.\n\n1.1.1 Before an enforcement action is initiated\n\nAfter FDA obtains evidence about investigator misconduct, but before a decision to bring an enforcement action in federal court or to issue a NIDPOE letter has been made, there may or may not be reason to believe that human subjects under the care of the investigator are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury. At this stage in an inquiry into investigator misconduct, FDA would consider two factors in deciding whether to issue a clinical hold.\n\nFirst, FDA would look at the nature of the violation and its significance for the rights, safety and welfare of human subjects. Certain types of violations may pose such a significant threat to subjects in the trial that suspending that part of the trial under the investigator is justified, even where the investigation into the violations is at an early stage. For example, FDA may conclude that suspending the trial is necessary to protect subjects from a significant and unreasonable risk of illness or injury, if FDA finds evidence of one or more of the following.\n\n?? Failure to report serious or life-threatening adverse events;* 27Serious protocol violations, such as enrolling subjects who do not meet the entrance criteria because they have conditions that put them at increased risk from the investigational drug, or failing to carry out critical safety evaluations;\n* Falsification of consent forms;\n- Repeated or deliberate failure to disclose serious risks of the investigational drug in the informed consent process;\n* 27Falsification of study safety data;\n* 27Failure to obtain IRB review and approval for significant protocol changes; and\n* 27Failure to adequately supervise the clinical trial such that human subjects are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury.\n\nConversely, some types of violations would be less likely to justify a clinical hold at an early stage in FDA\'s investigation. For example, certain kinds of record-keeping violations would be unlikely to suggest such a significant risk of illness or injury to subjects in the trial that a clinical hold would be justified.\n--------------------\nContext title: The Use of Clinical Holds Following Clinical Investigator Misconduct Guidance for Industry and Clinical Investigators'

By doing so, the investigator has the opportunity to evaluate the manufacturer's position and consult, as needed, with Agency experts. The Agency may not\n\n[474] accept a request for dispute resolution concerning a disagreement that was not initially raised by the manufacturer during the inspection unless a manufacturer can provide a reasonable\n\n[475] explanation why it did not present relevant information during the inspection.\n\n[476] V. Communication of Dispute Resolution Decisions\n\n[477] FDA believes that decisions made in the dispute resolution process, along with all supporting documentation, should be publicly available consistent with FDA's disclosure regulations (21 CFR Part 20) and applicable statutes, unless the decisions involve information that would otherwise be withheld under these regulations and statutes. The Agency will redact, as appropriate, any documents requested through the Freedom of Information process.\n\n[478] When appropriate, a summary of the relevant issues and Agency views will be provided in a question and answer format and posted on the FDA Web site with all identifying information\n\n[479] excluded.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n--------------------\nContext: When appropriate, the consent process must describe the consequences of a subject\'s decision to withdraw from the clinical investigation and the procedures for orderly termination of participation by the subject (21 CFR 50.25(b)(4)). For example, when withdrawal from a clinical investigation may adversely affect the subject, the informed consent process must explain the withdrawal procedures that are recommended in order to ensure the subject\'s safety and should specifically state why the withdrawal procedures are important to the subject\'s welfare. For some clinical investigations, an intervention should be withdrawn gradually, or the investigator may recommend follow-up to ensure the subject\'s safety when an investigational intervention is prematurely terminated due to a subject\'s withdrawal. In these cases, the consent process must explicitly inform the subject of the potential adverse effects of premature termination of the investigational intervention. Prospective subjects should be made aware of the number of visits and approximate time required for participation in the study to help them determine if they are able to make the commitment to complete the study. When appropriate, it may be reasonable to counsel prospective subjects that they should not participate in the trial if they do not foresee staying in the study. If applicable, the consent process must explain whether a subject who withdraws early will receive future study payments.40 The subject should also be informed as to how the data that have already been collected will be handled (see also sectionIII.2.8, ""Voluntary Participation"").\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nProviding Significant New Findings to Subjects\n\nA statement that significant new findings developed during the course of the research which may relate to the subject\'s willingness to continue participation will be provided to the subject. (21 CFR 50.25(b)(5))\n\nThe consent process must, when appropriate, include a statement that significant new findings that may relate to the subject\'s willingness to continue participation, such as new risk information, will be provided to the subject (21 CFR 50.25(b)(5)). Significant new findings may include an unexpected adverse event, an adverse event occurring at greater frequency or severity than previously stated in the consent process, results from interim analyses (in some cases), additional alternative procedures or courses of treatment that become available during the course of the clinical investigation, and information from other clinical trials about the effectiveness of the investigational product, the comparator, or other products for the same indication. FDA encourages the inclusion of this statement in the consent form for clinical investigations where knowledge of risk is limited, for example, clinical investigations involving the first use of an investigational product in humans, novel therapies, and new molecular entities, or complex clinical investigations that involve significant risk. Where there are significant new findings, the IRB should consider whether enrolled subjects should be contacted to determine if this information impacts their decision to continue participation in the clinical investigation (see Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nii.4.6 Number of Subjects\n\nThe approximate number of subjects involved in the study. (21 CFR 50.25(b)(6))\n\nWhen appropriate, the informed consent process must state the approximate number of subjects involved in the clinical investigation (21 CFR 50.25(b)(6)). For example, a subject\'s decision whether or not to participate in the study may be influenced by knowledge that the clinical investigation is a small initial trial of the product (such as a phase 1 or 2 drug clinical investigation or a device feasibility clinical investigation where only a small number of subjects participate).\n\nElement of Informed Consent for ""Applicable Clinical Trials""41\n\nFootnote 41: For further information, see FDA’s “Guidance for Sponsors, investigators, and Institutional Review Boards, Questions and Answers on Informed Consent Elements, 21 CFR §50.25(c)” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/questions-and-answers-informed-consent-elements-21-cfr-ss-5025c?source=govdelivery.\n\n_When seeking informed consent for applicable clinical trials, as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A), the following statement shall be provided to each clinical trial subject in informed consent documents and processes. This will notify the clinical trial subject that clinical trial information has been or will be submitted for inclusion in the clinical trial registry databank under paragraph (j) of section 402 of the Public Health Service Act. The statement is: ""A description of this clinical trial will be available on https://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. Law. This Web site will not include information that can identify you. At most, the Web site will include a summary of the results. You can search this Web site at any time."" (21 CFR 50.25(c))\n\nAll informed consent forms for ""applicable clinical trials""42 initiated on or after March 7, 2012, must contain the above quoted statement, which cannot be modified (21 CFR 50.25(c)).43 However, additional explanation may be provided, if appropriate. For example, with respect to clinical trials involving investigational devices, an additional statement could be added that information about device trials might not be made publicly available until after a product is cleared or approved by FDA.\n\nFootnote 42: For the definition of “applicable clinical trial,” see 42 USC 282(j)(1)(A) and 42 CFR 11.10(a). It is the responsibility of sponsors and investigators to determine if their clinical trial meets the definition of an “applicable clinical trial” and to ensure compliance with the most current applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Information on “applicable clinical trials” is available at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/manage-recs/fdaaa.\n\nFootnote 43: Note that this statement is not required for child assent.\n\nFootnote 44: 21 CFR 56.109(c) states, “An IRB shall require documentation of informed consent in accordance with section 50.27 of this chapter, except as follows: “(1) The IRB may, for some or all subjects, waive the requirement that the subject, or the subject’s legally authorized representative, sign a written consent form if it finds that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside the research context; or “(2) The IRB may, for some or all subjects, find that the requirements in 50.24 of this chapter for an exception from informed consent for emergency research are met.”\n\nDocumentation of Informed Consent\n\nRequirement for Written Documentation of Informed Consent\n\n[label=()]\n\nExcept as provided in SS 56.109(c), informed consent shall be documented by the use of a written consent form approved by the IRB and signed and dated by the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative at the time of consent. A copy shall be given to the person signing the form. (21 CFR 50.27(a))\n\nInformed consent must be documented by a signed and dated written consent form except under two specific circumstances as described in FDA\'s regulations at 21 CFR 56.109(c)44 (21 CFR 50.27). Whenwritten informed consent is required, the use of electronic, including digital, signatures are permitted under FDA\'s regulations, provided it is in compliance with applicable regulations.45\n\nFootnote 45: See 21 CFR part 11, “Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures” and FDA guidance entitled, “Guidance for Industry Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures – Scope and Application,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/part-11-electronic-records-electronic-signatures-scope-and-application.\n\nIn the event that an IRB waives the requirement for documentation of informed consent (under 21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)), FDA recommends that the elements of informed consent be reviewed verbally with the subject or the subject\'s LAR. Additionally, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects with a written statement regarding the clinical investigation (21 CFR 56.109(d)). See section III. E.2, ""Alternative Methods of Obtaining Informed Consent"" below for additional information regarding documentation of consent. FDA recommends that when an IRB waives the documentation requirement for informed consent in circumstances where there is minimal risk of harm under 21 CFR 56.109(c)(1), the consent process and discussion be described and noted in subject case histories required to be maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3).46\n\nFootnote 46: Documentation requirements related to emergency research, as mentioned in 21 CFR 56.109(c)(2), can be found in 21 CFR 50.24. Discussion of these studies is in a separate guidance, “Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors; Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/exception-informed-consent-requirements-emergency-research.\n\nFootnote 47: For additional information on alternative methods of obtaining informed consent, please see “Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Investigators, and Sponsors, Use of Electronic Informed Consent in Clinical Investigations,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-electronic-informed-consent-clinical-investigations-questions-and-answers, and FDA’s MyStudies Application (App) at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/science-and-research-drugs/covid-mystudies-application-app.\n\n2.2.2 Alternative Methods of Obtaining Informed Consent\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n--------------------\nContext: whether informed consent documents were signed by the subject or the subjects\' legally-authorized representative prior to entry in the study (i.e., performance of any study-related procedures);\n\nwhether authority to conduct aspects of the study was delegated, and if so, how the conduct of the study was supervised by the clinical investigator2;\n\nwhere specific aspects of the investigation were performed;\n\nhow the study data were obtained and where the study data were recorded;\n\naccountability for the investigational product, including shipping records and disposition of unused investigational product;\n\nwhether the clinical investigator disclosed information regarding his financial interests to the sponsor and/or interests of any subinvestigator(s), spouse(s) and dependent children3;\n\nthe monitor\'s communications with the clinical investigator;\n\nthe monitor\'s evaluations of the progress of the investigation; and\n\ncorrective actions in response to previous FDA inspections, if any, and regulatory correspondence or sponsor and/or monitor correspondence.\n\nFootnote 2: Clinical investigators either conduct a clinical trial or are the responsible party of a team of investigators. See 21 CFR 312.3 and 812.3(i). The clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects under the investigator’s care. See 21 CFR 312.60 and 812.100. For further information, refer to “Guidance for Industry: Investigator Responsibilities — Protecting the Rights, Safety, and Welfare of Study Subjects”: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM187772.pdf.\n\nFootnote 3: See generally 21 CFR part 54 for requirements related to financial disclosures by clinical investigators and “Guidance for Industry - Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators”: http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126832.htm.\n\nThe FDA investigator also may audit the study data by comparing the data filed with the agency or the sponsor, if available, with records related to the clinical investigation. Such records may include the case report forms and supporting source documentation including signed and dated consent forms and medical records including, for example, progress notes of the physician, the subject\'s hospital chart(s), and the nurses\' notes. These records may be in hard copy and/or an electronic format. For electronic records and/or electronic signatures, the FDA investigator may gather information to determine whether 21 CFR part 11 requirements have been met.4FDA may also examine subjects\' medical records that are part of the clinical investigation and predate the study to verify whether the condition under study was in fact diagnosed, the study eligibility criteria were met, and whether the subject received any potentially interfering medication prohibited by the protocol. The FDA investigator may also review subjects\' records covering a period after completion of study-related activities to determine if there was proper follow-up as outlined in the protocol, and if the clinical investigator submitted all reportable adverse events (including all clinical signs and symptoms). See 21 CFR 312.64(b) and 812.150(a). For more information about the procedures FDA uses during inspections of clinical investigator sites, see FDA\'s Compliance Program Guidance Manual (CPGM), Bioresearch Monitoring, Clinical Investigators and Sponsor-Investigators, Program 7348.811.5\n\nFootnote 5: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ICECI/EnforcementActions/BioresearchMonitoring/ucm133773.pdf.\n\nV International Inspections\n\nFDA\'s inspection of clinical investigators is not limited to the United States (U.S.). International inspections are generally conducted when the studies are part of a marketing application submitted to FDA and provide data critical to decision-making on product approval. See FDA\'s CPGM, Program 7348.811, ""Clinical Investigators and Sponsor-Investigators.""6 Such assignments include studies that are conducted under an FDA investigational new drug application (IND), as well as studies at non-U.S. sites that are not conducted under an IND or under an investigational device exemption (IDE).\n\nFootnote 6: Ibid.\n\nStudies Involving Investigational Drugs and Biologies\n\nFDA inspects clinical investigators conducting foreign trials, either under an IND or in support of an IND, a new drug application (NDA) or a biologics license application (BLA). Although sponsors of clinical trials conducted outside the U.S. are not required to file an IND, sponsors submitting foreign clinical studies not conducted under an IND to FDA must comply with requirements in 21 CFR 312.120. If a clinical investigator conducts a study under an IND outside of the U.S., the clinical investigator is subject to FDA regulations, including applicable provisions in 21 CFR parts 50, 56, and 312. FDA validates the authenticity and accuracy of data and confirms compliance during an inspection, which is performed under the circumstances listed above in section III.\n\nWhen FDA considers whether to accept non-U.S., non-IND clinical studies in support of an IND, NDA, or BLA, an FDA inspection may help in determining whether the study was conducted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120. Specifically, the inspection will evaluate whether the following criteria are met:\n\nThe study is well-designed and well-conducted.\n\nThe study is conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), which is defined as a standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials in a way that provides assurance that the data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects are protected.\n\nThe study has been reviewed and approved (or provision of a favorable opinion) by an independent ethics committee (IEC) prior to study initiation, continuing review of an ongoing study by an IEC, and the freely given and documented informed consent of the subject (or the subject\'s legally authorized representative if the subject is unable to provide consent) prior to any study-specific procedures.\n\nStudies Involving Investigational Devices\n\nFDA\'s inspection of clinical investigators conducting foreign trials includes device trials in support of a premarket approval application (PMA) or a premarket notification (510(k)) submission.\n\nFor device studies conducted outside the U.S., FDA will accept research in support of a PMA, but which has not been conducted under an IDE, if certain conditions are met. An FDA inspection may help in determining whether the study was conducted in accordance with 21 CFR 814.15. Specifically, the inspection will evaluate whether the following criteria are met:\n\nthe data are valid; and\n\nthe studies are conducted in conformance with the ""Declaration of Helsinki,""7 or the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords greater protection to the human subjects. FDA validates the authenticity and accuracy of data and confirms compliance during an inspection, which is performed under the circumstances listed above in section III. The FDA investigator may request documentation as to whether the study was conducted under the laws and regulations of the non-U.S. country and/or the Declaration of Helsinki, whichever accords greater protection to human subjects.\n\nFootnote 7: 21 CFR part 814 refers to the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 1983. There have been subsequent revisions of the Declaration, but FDA has not officially adopted subsequent versions.\n\nVI What happens after an inspection?\n\nAt the end of an inspection, the FDA investigator conducts an exit interview with the clinical investigator or his/her representative. At this interview, the FDA investigator who conducted the inspection reviews and discusses the findings from the inspection and, if deficiencies were found, issues a written Form FDA 483 (Inspectional Observations; 483) to the clinical investigator or his/her representative. The 483 describes any inspectional observations that, in the opinion of the FDA investigator conducting the inspection, represent deviations from applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nSome common deficiencies that have been observed by FDA investigators during a clinical investigator inspection include:* failure to follow the investigational plan and signed investigator statement/agreement (e.g., failure to conduct or supervise the study in accordance with the relevant, current protocol(s)). See 21 CFR 312.60 and 812.110(b).\n* protocol deviations (e.g., failure to appropriately document and report any medically necessary protocol deviations). See 21 CFR 312.66 and 812.150(a)(4).\n* inadequate recordkeeping. See 21 CFR 312.62 and 812.140(a).\n* inadequate accountability for the investigational product. See 21 CFR 312.62(a) and 812.140(a)(2).\n* inadequate subject protection, including informed consent issues. See 21 CFR part 50, 312.60, and 812.100.\n\nThe clinical investigator may respond to the 483 observations orally during the exit interview and/or respond in writing after the inspection. If the clinical investigator chooses to respond in writing to the deficiencies listed on the 483, the response should be directed to the FDA District Office listed in the upper left corner of the 483.8 (A list of FDA District Offices is also posted on FDA\'s website (http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/Inspections/IOM/ucm124008.htm)).\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Inspections of Clinical Investigators Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 10: Section 301 (21 U.S.C. 331) provides in pertinent part: “The following acts and the causing thereof are hereby prohibited:... (e) The refusal to permit access to or copying of any record as required by section... 704(a).... (f) The refusal to permit entry or inspection as authorized by section 704.” Section 303 (21 U.S.C 333) provides penalties for violations of Section 301.\n\n3 Delay of Inspections\n\nDelays may occur for many reasons, some of which are beyond the control of the facility. However, where an owner, operator, or agent causes the delay of an inspection, this may cause the drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act.\n\n4 Delay Scheduling Pre-announced Inspections\n\nThe FD&C Act does not require FDA to pre-announce its inspections. Therefore, FDA usually does not pre-announce for-cause and routine surveillance inspections. It is, however, FDA'sgeneral practice to contact the firm before an investigator arrives at the inspection site for pre-approval and pre-license inspections, and most inspections of foreign facilities of drug products. This pre-announcement, although not required, is intended to facilitate the inspection process and ensure that appropriate records and personnel will be made available.\n\nFDA's efforts to schedule pre-announced inspections include sending correspondence to the facility's point of contact e-mail address, including the facility's U.S. agent if the facility is a foreign facility. FDA will make reasonable accommodations for local conditions, such as weather or security situations, holidays, and other non-work days, and, where appropriate, scheduled manufacturing campaigns. Examples of delay in scheduling a pre-announced inspection that may cause drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n\nA facility will not agree to a proposed inspection start date and does not give a reasonable explanation for its failure to do so.\n\nAfter scheduling an inspection, a facility requests a later start date without giving a reasonable explanation.\n\nA facility fails to respond following FDA's attempt to contact the facility's designated contact(s).\n\nAn example of a potentially reasonable explanation that might result in the drugs not being deemed adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act includes, but is not limited to:\n\nManufacturing at the facility is not on-going, for example running only one manufacturing campaign per month and the facility requests a different date than that proposed by or agreed to by FDA so that manufacturing will occur during the FDA inspection of the facility.\n\n2 Delay During an Inspection\n\nAn FDA inspection is intended to enable the Agency to review a facility's compliance with certain laws and regulations. In a drug facility, FDA has broad authority to inspect things that bear on whether the drugs are adulterated, misbranded, or are otherwise in violation of the FD&C Act. Actions by a facility's owner, operator, or agent before or after the beginning of an inspection that impede an FDA investigator at the inspection site from performing the inspection in a reasonable manner may be considered delaying the inspection. FDA is aware that its appearance on-site may initially cause some minor confusion and/or inconveniences to the facility's employees. Minor delays that result from good faith efforts by the facility to comply with FDA requests generally would not be considered unreasonable. Examples of delays during an inspection that may cause drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n\nA facility does not allow the FDA investigator access to an area of the facility until a specific future date or time even though the area is operational and is an area of the inspection site that FDA has authority to inspect, without giving a reasonable explanation.\n\n2.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA facility leaves the FDA investigator in a conference room without access to necessary documentation or responsible individuals for an unreasonable period of time that interferes with the investigator's ability to complete the inspection.\n\nAn example of a potentially reasonable explanation that might result in the drugs not being deemed adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act includes, but is not limited to:\n\nA facility does not provide the FDA investigator access to aseptic processing areas until the investigator accommodates the facility's documented governing procedures.\n\nDelay Producing Records\n\nA critical aspect of FDA's preparation for inspection and inspection of drug facilities is the review and collection of hardcopy and electronic records, files, and papers bearing on whether the drugs are adulterated, misbranded, or are otherwise in violation of the FD&C Act. For example, records may be reviewed to verify compliance, but may also need to be collected to document evidence of deviations, interstate commerce, product labeling and promotion, and to identify the party or parties responsible for a variety of actions. Although FDA recognizes that facilities require a reasonable amount of time to produce records requested, especially if the records are maintained at a different site, a delay in producing records to FDA without reasonable explanation may be considered delaying the inspection. Examples of delays in producing records that may cause drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n\nDuring an inspection, the FDA investigator requests, within a specific, reasonable timeframe, records that FDA has authority to inspect, but the facility fails to produce the requested records within the timeframe requested by FDA, without reasonable explanation.\n\nFDA requests records pursuant to section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, but the facility fails to produce the requested records in a timely manner, without reasonable explanation.\n\nExamples of potentially reasonable explanations that might result in the drugs not being deemed adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n\nThe FDA investigator requests translation of the records into English, and the translation is not readily available.\n\nThe records requested are not available at that time because they are being used for a manufacturing operation that is in progress.\n\nThe volume of the records requested is sufficiently large as to require reasonable time to compile.\n\nIn instances where the facility provides a reasonable explanation for delaying production of records, the facility should also ensure that the resulting delay is of a reasonable duration.\n\nIV Denial of Inspection\n\nFDA interprets the word deny to include active behavior by the owner, operator, or agent of a drug facility to prevent an authorized representative of the FDA from conducting an inspection or to prevent FDA from completing an inspection. This includes statements or physical actions intended to avoid inspection or to mislead, deceive, or impede the investigator. Examples of behavior that may constitute a denial that may cause drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n\nA facility rejects FDA's attempt to schedule a pre-announced inspection.\n\nUpon arrival at the facility, the facility does not allow the FDA investigator to begin the inspection.\n\nA facility does not allow the FDA investigator to inspect the facility because certain staff members are not present, without a reasonable explanation.\n\nA facility does not allow the FDA investigator to inspect the facility by falsely alleging the facility does not manufacture, process, pack, or hold drugs.\n\nA facility sends staff home for the day and tells the FDA investigator that the facility is not producing any product.\n\nExamples of potentially reasonable explanations that might result in the drugs not being deemed adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n\nAt the beginning of an unannounced inspection, appropriate personnel are not immediately available to accurately answer the FDA investigator's questions.\n\nThe FDA investigator arrives for an unannounced inspection, but the facility is closed due to scheduled maintenance.\n\nV Limiting of Inspection\n\nAn owner, operator, or agent of a drug facility who prevents an authorized representative of the FDA from conducting an inspection to the extent allowable under the law may be viewed as limiting inspection under section 501(j). Below are examples of behavior that FDA considers to constitute a limitation that may cause drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act.\n\nLimiting Access to Facilities and/or Manufacturing Processes\n\nPreventing an authorized representative of the FDA reasonable access to an area of the site that FDA is entitled to inspect may be considered limiting the inspection. This includes the refusal to disclose or permit observation of the manufacturing processes. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\nA facility orders the discontinuation of all manufacturing for the duration of the FDA inspection without a reasonable explanation.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA facility states that direct observation of the manufacturing process, in whole or in part, must be limited to an unreasonably short amount of time, thus preventing FDA from inspecting the facility as is usual and customary.\n\nA facility limits direct observation of portions of the manufacturing process without reasonable explanation.\n\nA facility unreasonably restricts entry to a particular portion of the facility without reasonable explanation.\n\nStaff at a facility causes the FDA investigator to leave the premises before the inspection is completed.\n\nExamples of potentially reasonable explanations that might result in the drugs not being deemed adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n--------------------\nContext title: Circumstances that Constitute Delaying, Denying, Limiting, or Refusing a Drug Inspection Guidance for Industry""]",['The FD-483 is the written notice of objectionable\n\npractices or deviations from the regulations that is prepared by the FDA investigator at the end of the inspection.

At Step 4 of the Process the final draft is recommended for adoption to the regulatory bodies of the European Union, Japan and USA.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n1 Introduction\n\nObjective\n\nThis document (Guide) is intended to provide guidance regarding good manufacturing practice (GMP) for the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) under an appropriate system for managing quality. It is also intended to help ensure that APIs meet the requirements for quality and purity that they purport or are represented to possess.\n\nIn this Guide ""manufacturing"" is defined to include all operations of receipt of materials, production, packaging, repackaging, labelling, relabelling, quality control, release, storage and distribution of APIs and the related controls. In this Guide the term ""should"" indicates recommendations that are expected to apply unless shown to be inapplicable or replaced by an alternative demonstrated to provide at least an equivalent level of quality assurance. For the purposes of this Guide, the terms ""current good manufacturing practices"" and ""good manufacturing practices"" are equivalent.\n\nThe Guide as a whole does not cover safety aspects for the personnel engaged in the manufacture, nor aspects of protection of the environment. These controls are inherent responsibilities of the manufacturer and are governed by national laws.\n\nThis Guide is not intended to define registration/filing requirements or modify pharmacopoeial requirements. This Guide does not affect the ability of the responsible regulatory agency to establish specific registration/filing requirements regarding APIs within the context of marketing/manufacturing authorizations or drug applications. All commitments in registration/filing documents must be met.\n\nRegulatory Applicability\n\nWithin the world community, materials may vary as to the legal classification as an API. When a material is classified as an API in the region or country in which it is manufactured or used in a drug product, it should be manufactured according to this Guide.\n\nScope\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: Equipment and system integration: Aspects of equipment design and system integration that are shown to be critical to output material quality and its control should be described and justified in the context of the overall control strategy.\n\nA summary of the control strategy should be provided in CTD section 3.2.S.2.6 or 3.2.P.2.3 with links or references to the CTD sections that contain the detailed information to enable the understanding and evaluation of the manufacturing process and how it is controlled.\n\nBatch Description and Batch Size\n\nThe approach to define batch size (see examples in Section 2.2) and the proposed commercial batch size or range should be described in the dossier.\n\nIf a range is proposed, it should be justified, and the approach for achieving the range should be described (see Section 2.2). Changes in batch size within the approved batch size range can be managed within the PQS. Any post-approval change beyond the approved range should be supported by data (Section 3.2) and appropriately managed (i.e., prior approval or notification).\n\nA suitable quantitative metric with acceptance criteria should be defined within the PQS to establish batch-to-batch consistency and system robustness. For example, when a batch size is defined by the amount of collected material, the amount of diverted materials relative to that of collected materials for each batch should be considered.\n\nThe actual intended size of a given batch should be defined before manufacturing begins.\n\nProcess Models\n\nThe level of detail provided in the dossier regarding model development, validation, and maintenance over the lifecycle should be commensurate with the model type and impact category. The process model should be specific for the defined system (e.g., equipment, layout, connections). Information to support models used as part of commercial manufacturing should be available during site inspection and maintained at or be accessible to the manufacturing site. Refer to Points to Consider: ICH-Endorsed Guide for ICH Q8/Q9/Q10 Implementation for regulatory expectations on process models.\n\nDrug Substance and Drug Product Stability\n\nRegulatory expectations for the stability data package generally do not differ between CM and batch manufacturing modes (refer to ICH Q1A, ICH Q5C). Batches used to generate primary stability data should be manufactured using a manufacturing process and equipment representative of the commercial process. Primary stability batches should incorporate the variability described in the ICH stability guidelines (e.g., different drug substance batches).\n\nAdditionally, for chemical drug substances or drug products:\n\nStability batches could be obtained with a single start-up/shutdown sequence provided the aforementioned variability is incorporated into the batches (e.g., by introducing different batches of drug substances in a sequential manner).\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_Q13_Step4_Guideline_2022_1116'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: A control strategy can include, but is not limited to, the following:\n\nControl of input material attributes (e.g., drug substance, excipients, primary packaging materials) based on an understanding of their impact on processability or product quality;\n\nProduct specification(s);\n\nControls for unit operations that have an impact on downstream processing or product quality (e.g., the impact of drying on degradation, particle size distribution of the granulate on dissolution);\n\nIn-process or real-time release testing in lieu of end-product testing (e.g. measurement and control of CQAs during processing);\n\nA monitoring program (e.g., full product testing at regular intervals) for verifying multivariate prediction models.\n\nA control strategy can include different elements. For example, one element of the control strategy could rely on end-product testing, whereas another could depend on real-time release testing. The rationale for using these alternative approaches should be described in the submission.\n\nAdoption of the principles in this guideline can support the justification of alternative approaches to the setting of specification attributes and acceptance criteria as described in Q6A and Q6B.\n\nProduct Lifecycle Management and Continual Improvement\n\nThroughout the product lifecycle, companies have opportunities to evaluate innovative approaches to improve product quality (see ICH Q10).\n\nProcess performance can be monitored to ensure that it is working as anticipated to deliver product quality attributes as predicted by the design space. This monitoring could include trend analysis of the manufacturing process as additional experience is gained during routine manufacture. For certain design spaces using mathematical models, periodic maintenance could be useful to ensure the model's performance. The model maintenance is an example of activity that can be managed within a company's own internal quality system provided the design space is unchanged.\n\nExpansion, reduction or redefinition of the design space could be desired upon gaining additional process knowledge. Change of design space is subject to regional requirements.\n\nSubmission of Pharmaceutical Development and Related Information in Common Technical Documents (CTD) Format\n\nPharmaceutical development information is submitted in Section P.2 of the CTD. Other information resulting from pharmaceutical development studies could be accommodated by the CTD format in a number of different ways and some specific suggestions are provided below. However, the applicant should clearly indicate where the different information is located. In addition to what is submitted in the application, certain aspects (e.g., product lifecycle management, continual improvement) of this guideline are handled under the applicant's pharmaceutical quality system (see ICH Q10).\n\nQuality Risk Management and Product and Process Development\n--------------------\nContext title: Q8(R2) Guideline""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: Manufacturing Facilities and Equipment:A robust facility infrastructure can facilitate reliable supply; it includes suitable equipment and well-designed facilities for manufacturing (including packaging and testing). Robustness can be affected by multiple factors, such as an aging facility, insufficient maintenance or an operational design that is vulnerable to human error. Risks to supply can be reduced by addressing these factors, as well as through the use of modern technology, such as digitalization, automation, isolation technology, amongst others.\n\nOversight of Outsourced Activities and Suppliers:Quality system governance includes assuring the acceptability of supply chain partners over the product lifecycle. Approval and oversight of outsourced activities and material suppliers is informed by risk assessments, effective knowledge management, and an effective monitoring strategy for supply chain partner performance. A successful manufacturing partnership is strengthened by appropriate communication and collaboration mechanisms (See Section 2.7 of ICH Q10). When substantial variability is identified in the quality and safety of supplied materials or in the services provided, enhanced review and monitoring activities are justified. In some cases, it may be necessary to identify a new supply chain entity (e.g., a pre-qualified alternative option) to perform a function.\n\nNote that the guidance in Annex II.2, in relation to the application of quality risk management as part of Regulatory Operations, can be useful to consider in the context of product availability risks.\n\n7 Definitions\n\nDecision Maker(s):Person(s) with the competence and authority to make appropriate and timely quality risk management decisions.\n\nDetectability:\n\nThe ability to discover or determine the existence, presence, or fact of a hazard.\n\nHarm:\n\nDamage to health, including the damage that can occur from loss of product quality or availability.\n\nHazard:\n\nThe potential source of harm (ISO/IEC Guide 51:2014).\n\nHazard Identification:\n\nThe systematic use of information to identify potential sources of harm (hazards) referring to the risk question or problem description.\n\nProduct Lifecycle:\n\nAll phases in the life of the product from the initial development through marketing until the product\'s discontinuation.\n\nQuality:\n\nThe degree to which a set of inherent properties of a product, system or process fulfills requirements (see ICH Q6A definition specifically for ""quality"" of drug substance and drug (medicinal) products.)\n\nQuality Risk Management:\n\nA systematic process for the assessment, control, communication and review of risks to the quality of the drug (medicinal) product across the product lifecycle.\n\nQuality System:\n\nThe sum of all aspects of a system that implements quality policy and ensures that quality objectives are met.\n\nRequirements:\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_Q9(R1)_Guideline_Step4_2023_0126_0'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: Contaminants should be strictly avoided and/or suitably controlled with appropriate in-process acceptance criteria or action limits for drug substance or drug product. New contaminants should be evaluated to assess their potential impact on the quality, safety and efficacy of the product.\n\n3.  Specifications (2.2.3)\n\nThe tests and analytical procedures chosen to define drug substance or drug product specifications alone are generally not considered adequate to assess the impact of manufacturing process changes since they are chosen to confirm the routine quality of the product rather than to fully characterize it. The manufacturer should confirm that the specifications after the process change are appropriate to ensure product quality. Results within the established acceptance criteria, but outside historical manufacturing control trends, might suggest product differences that warrant additional study or analysis. Modification, elimination, or addition of a test (i.e., in the specification) might be indicated where data suggest that the previous test is no longer relevant for routine batch analysis of the postchange product. For example, the elimination of bovine serum from the cell culture process would remove the need for related analyses. However, a widening of the acceptance criteria is generally not considered appropriate unless justified. In some cases, additional tests and acceptance criteria on the relative amount of specific new impurities might be appropriate if the impurity profile is different following the manufacturing process changes. When evaluating both the test methods and acceptance criteria for the postchange product, it is important to consider the general principles for setting specifications as defined in Q6B, i.e., the impact of the changes on the validated manufacturing process, characterization studies, batch analysis data, stability data, and nonclinical and clinical experience.\n\n4.  Stability (2.2.4)\n\nFor certain manufacturing process changes, even slight modifications of the production procedures might cause changes in the stability of the postchange product. Any change with the potential to alter protein structure or purity and impurity profiles should be evaluated for its impact on stability, since proteins are frequently sensitive to changes, such as those made to buffer composition, processing and holding conditions, and the use of organic solvents. Furthermore, stability studies might be able to detect subtle differences that are not readily detectable by the characterization studies. For example, the presence of trace amounts of a protease might only be detected by product degradation that occurs over an extended time period; or, in some cases, divalent ions leached from the container closure system might change the stability profile because of the activation of trace proteases not detected in stability studies of the prechange product. Therefore, real-time/real temperature stability studies on the product potentially affected by the change should be initiated, as appropriate.\n\nAccelerated and stress stability studies are often useful tools to establish degradation profiles and provide a further direct comparison of prechange and postchange product. The results thus obtained might show product differences that warrant additional evaluation and also identify conditions indicating that additional controls should be employed in the manufacturing process and during storage to eliminate these unexpected differences. Appropriate studies should be considered to confirm that suitable storage conditions and controls are selected.\n\nICH Q5C and Q1A(R) should be consulted to determine the conditions for stability studies that provide relevant data to be compared before and after a change.\n\nManufacturing Process Considerations (2.3)\n\nA well-defined manufacturing process with its associated process controls ensures that acceptable product is produced on a consistent basis. Approaches to determining the impact of any process change will vary with respect to the specific process, the product, the extent of the manufacturer's knowledge of and experience with the process, and development data generated. The manufacturer should confirm that the process controls in the modified process provide at least similar or more effective control of the product quality, compared to those of the original process.\n\nA careful consideration of potential effects of the planned change on steps downstream and quality parameters related to these steps is extremely important (e.g., for acceptance criteria, in-process specification, in-process tests, in-process hold times, operating limits, and validation/evaluation, if appropriate). This analysis will help identify which tests should be performed during the comparability exercise, which in-process or batch release acceptance criteria or analytical procedures should be reevaluated, and which steps should not be impacted by the proposed change. For example, analysis of intermediates might suggest potential differences that should be evaluated to determine the suitability of existing tests to detect these differences in the product. The rationale for excluding parts of the process from this consideration should be justified.\n\nWhile the process will change and the associated controls might be redefined, the manufacturer should confirm that prechange and postchange product are comparable. To support the comparison, it is often useful to demonstrate, for example, that specific intermediates are comparable or that the modified process has the capability to provide appropriate levels of removal for process- and product-related impurities, including those newly introduced by the process change. To support process changes for approved products, data from commercial-scale batches are generally indicated.\n\nThe process assessment should consider such factors as the criticality of the process step and proposed change, the location of the change and potential for effects on other process steps, and the type and extent of change. Information that can aid this assessment is generally available from several sources. The sources can include knowledge from process development studies, small scale evaluation/validation studies, experience with earlier process changes, experience with equipment in similar operations, changes in similar manufacturing processes with similar products, and literature. Although information from external sources is useful to some extent, it is within the context of the specific manufacturing process and specific product that the change should be assessed.\n\nWhen changes are made to a process, the manufacturer should demonstrate that the associated process controls, including any new ones, provide assurance that the modified process will also be capable of providing comparable product. The modified process steps should be reevaluated and/or revalidated, as appropriate. The in-process controls, including critical control points and in-process testing, should ensure that the postchange process is well controlled and maintains the quality of the product. Typically, reevaluation/revalidation activities for a simple change might be limited to the affected process step if there is no evidence to indicate that there is an impact on the performance of subsequent (downstream) process steps or on the quality of the intermediates resulting from the subsequent steps. When the change considered affects more than a single step, more extensive analysis of the change and resultant validation might be appropriate.\n\nDemonstration of state of control with the modified/changed manufacturing process might include, but is not limited to, such items as:\n\nEstablishment of modified specifications for raw, source and starting materials, and reagents;\n\nAppropriate bioburden and/or viral safety testing of the postchange cell banks and cells at the limit of in vitro cell age for production;\n\nAdventitious agent clearance;\n\nRemoval of product- or process-related impurities, such as residual host cell DNA and proteins; and\n\nMaintenance of the purity level.\n\nFor approved products, an appropriate number of postchange batches should be analyzed to demonstrate consistent performance of the process.\n\nTo support the analysis of the changes and the control strategy, the manufacturer should prepare a description of the change that summarizes the prechange and the postchange manufacturing process and that clearly highlights modifications of the process and changes in controls in a side-by-side format.\n\nDemonstration of Comparability During Development (2.4)\n\nDuring product development, it is expected that multiple changes in the manufacturing process will occur that could impact drug product quality, safety, and efficacy. Comparability exercises are generally performed to demonstrate that nonclinical and clinical data generated with prechange product are applicable to postchange product in order to facilitate further development and, ultimately, to support the marketing authorization. Comparability studies conducted for products in development are influenced by factors such as the stage of product development, the availability of validated analytical procedures, and the extent of product and process knowledge, which are limited at times due to the available experience that the manufacturer has with the process.\n\nWhere changes are introduced in development before nonclinical studies, the issue of assessing comparability is not generally raised because the manufacturer subsequently conducts\n--------------------\nContext title: Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological:Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process""]","['Yes.

The title, ""Supplement Facts,"" must be larger than all other print in the panel and, unless impractical, must be set full width of the panel. The title and all headings must be bolded to distinguish them from other information.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n36. How must I present the information in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n\nYou must present all information using the following:\n\na. A single easy-to-read type style;\n\nb. All black or one color type, printed on a white or neutral contrasting background, whenever practical;3. Upper- and lowercase letters, except that you may use all uppercase lettering on small packages (i.e., packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches); d. At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text); and e. Letters that do not touch.\n37. What are the type size requirements for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n\nExcept as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must set information other than the title, headings, and footnotes in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. You also must use a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label for the title ""Supplement Facts."" You may set the column headings and footnotes in type no smaller than 6 point type. See the section on ""Special Labeling Provisions"" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nMust I use hairlines in the Supplement Facts panel?\n\nExcept for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must use a hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text to separate each dietary ingredient from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it. FDA has provided an exception for certain packages with space constraints. See the section on ""Special Labeling Provisions"" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nHow closely must I follow the ""Examples of graphic enhancements used by the FDA"" in appendix B to Part 101?\n\nYou are not required to follow Appendix B to Part 101. Appendix B and its specifications are a model, which FDA has suggested in the interest of uniformity of presentation. For example, 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(i) requires the use of an ""easy-to-read"" type style, not specifically Helvetica type, as suggested in Appendix B.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)(9)\n\nHow do I provide nutrition labeling when my product contains two or more packets of supplements (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening)?\n\nYou may present the information for each packet (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening) in an individual nutrition label or you may use an aggregate nutrition label. For two packets, this would consist of five columns. List all of the dietary ingredients in the first column. List the amounts and percents of the morning packet in the second and third columns and similar information for the evening packet in the fourth and fifth columns (see the illustration of aggregate nutrition labeling in 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iii)).\n\nCompliance\n\nWhat kind of samples will FDA collect to determine compliance with 21 CFR 101.36?\n\nFDA will collect a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller. FDA will randomly select these packages.\n\nWhat if it is not technically feasible for me to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements?\n\nFDA may permit you to use an alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9). If your firm needs such special allowances, you must make your request in writing to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(f)(2)\n\nMust dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?\n\nFor dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value.\n\nExemptions\n\nWhat are the circumstances in which my dietary supplement products would be exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements? Your dietary supplement product is not required to have a ""Supplement Facts"" panel if: a. Your firm is a small business that has not more than $50,000 gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers or not more than $500,000 per year from total sales in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1); b. You sell less than 100,000 units of the product annually, your firm has fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(2) andyou file an annual notification with FDA as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(18)(iv); or c. You ship the product in bulk form, do not distribute it to consumers in such form, and you supply it for use in the manufacture of other dietary supplements in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(3). The two exemptions for small businesses and low-volume products (a. and b. above) are available to you only if your products\' labels bear no claims or other nutrition information.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(h)(1) - (3)\n\nSpecial Labeling Provisions\n\nWhat are small packages?\n\nSmall packages are those packages having less than 12 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)\n\nWhat is the telephone provision for small packages?\n\nIn lieu of a ""Supplement Facts"" panel, you may print labels for small packages with a telephone number or address that consumers can use to obtain nutrition information. You may use a telephone number or an address in place of the ""Supplement Facts"" panel only if you place no claims or other nutrition information on the product label.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size that I may use for small packages?\n\nYou may use a type size no smaller than 4-5 point for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on the labels of small packages.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(i)\n\nMay I use a tabular or linear format for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on a small package?\n\nYes. You may use a tabular format on small packages. You also may present ""Supplement Facts"" information in a linear (i.e., string) fashion if the label will not accommodate the ""Supplement Facts"" panel in a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j) (13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display.)\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n\nWhat are intermediate-sized packages?\n\nIntermediate-sized packages are those packages having from 12 to 40 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(ii)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size for intermediate-sized packages?The ""Supplement Facts"" panel on the labels of intermediate-sized packages must use type size no smaller than 6 point, except that type no smaller than 4-5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches that list more than 16 dietary ingredients. Also, 4-5 point type may be used on packages with less than 20 square inches that list more than 8 dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the type size used in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on an inner container may be as small as needed to accommodate all required information if the ""Supplement Facts"" on the outer container meets these type size requirements.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv)\n51. May I use a tabular or linear format for the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on an intermediate-sized package? You may use a tabular format on an intermediate-sized package if the package shape or size cannot accommodate vertical columns. You may use a linear format if the label will not accommodate a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n52. May I abbreviate on the labels of intermediate- sized packages? You may use the abbreviations in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B) in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel for small and intermediate-sized packages, e.g, ""Serv size"" for ""Serving Size"" and ""Servings"" for ""Servings Per Container.""\n\n21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B)\n53. Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

A mineral;\n\nAn herb or other botanical;\n\nAn amino acid;\n\nA dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or\n\nA concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or a combination of any ingredient mentioned above. Further, dietary supplements are products intended for ingestion, are not represented for use as a conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or the diet, and are labeled as dietary supplements. The complete statutory definition is found in section 201(ff) of Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321).\n\nWhat label statements are required on the containers and packages of dietary supplements? Five statements are required: 1) the statement of identity (name of the dietary supplement), 2) the net quantity of contents statement (amount of the dietary supplement), 3) the nutrition labeling, 4) the ingredient list, and 5) the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor.\n\n21 CFR 101.3(a), 21 CFR 101.105(a), 21 CFR 101.36, 21 CFR 101.4(a)(1), and 21 CFR 101.5\n\nWhere do I place the required label statements? You must place all required label statements either on the front label panel (the principal display panel) or on the information panel (usually the label panel immediately to the right of the principal display panel, as seen by the consumer when facing the product), unless otherwise specified by regulation (i.e., exemptions).\n\n21 CFR 101.2(b) and (d), 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13) and (j)(17), 21 CFR 101.36(g), (i)(2) and (i) (5)\n\nWhat label statements must I place on the principal display panel? You must place the statement of identity and the net quantity of contents statement on the principal display panel. Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, you must place this information on each alternate principal display panel.\n\n21 CFR 101.1, 21 CFR 101.3(a) and 21 CFR 101.105(a)\n\nHow do I locate the principal display panel? The principal display panel of the label is the portion of the package that is most likely to be seen by the consumer at the time of display for retail purchase. Many containers are designed with two or more different surfaces that are suitable for use as the principal display panel. These are alternate principal display panels.\n\n6 What label statements must I place on the information panel?\n\nYou must place the ""Supplement Facts"" panel, the ingredient list, and the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor on the information panel if such information does not appear on the principal display panel, except that if space is insufficient, you may use the special provisions on the ""Supplement Facts"" panel in 21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(iii) and (i)(5). See questions 46 and 56 in Chapter IV for more details.\n\n7 Where is the information panel?\n\nThe information panel is located immediately to the right of the principal display panel as the product is displayed to the consumer. If this panel is not usable, due to package design and construction (e.g. folded flaps), the panel immediately contiguous and to the right of this part may be used for the information panel. The information panel may be any adjacent panel when the top of a container is the principal display panel.\n\n8 What name and address must I list on the label of my product?\n\nYou must list the street address if it is not listed in a current city directory or telephone book, the city or town, the state, and zip code. You may list the address of the principal place of business in lieu of the actual address.\n\n9 May I place intervening material on the information panel?\n\nNo. You may not place intervening material, which is defined as label information that is not required (e.g., UPC bar code), between label information that is required on the information panel.\n\nWhat type size, prominence and conspicuousness am I required to use on the principal display panel and the information panel?\n\nYou are required to use a print or type size that is prominent, conspicuous and easy to read. The letters must be at least one-sixteenth (1/16) inch in height based on the lower case letter ""o,"" and not be more than three times as high as they are wide, unless you petition for an exemption in accordance with 21 CFR 101.2(f). The lettering must contrast sufficiently (it does not need to be black and white) with the background so as to be easy to read. See Chapter IV for the type size requirements for the nutrition label.\n\nDo I need to specify the country of origin if my product, or the ingredients in my product, is not from the United States?\n\nYes. Unless excepted by law, the Tariff Act requires that every article of foreign origin (or its container) imported into the United States conspicuously indicate the English name of the country of origin of the article.\n\nSection 304, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 304)\n* 12.Who regulates the statement ""Made in the U. S. A.""? FDA does not have regulatory authority over such statements. The U.S. Customs Service regulates country of origin marking (i.e., ""Made in the U.S.A."") as authorized by the Tariff Act of 1930. Their website is www.customs.ustreas.gov.\n* 13.How do I obtain a UPC bar code? The UPC bar code may be obtained from the Uniform Code Council. Their website is www.uc-council.org. Click on the button that says ""I Need a UPC Bar Code.""\n* 14.Must expiration dating be included on the label of dietary supplements? No. However, a firm may include this information if it is supported by valid data demonstrating that it is not false or misleading.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter I.

The final rule amends the labeling regulations for conventional foods and dietary supplements to provide updated nutrition information on the label to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices and set a compliance date of July 26, 2018, for manufacturers with $10 million or more in annual food sales, and July 26, 2019, for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales. We subsequently extended the compliance dates to January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021, respectively (83 FR 19619). We have prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28). This guidance document restates in plain language the revisions made in the final rule and is intended to help small entities comply with the requirements established in 21 CFR 101.9, 101.30, and 101.36.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in our guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nIn the remainder of this guidance, ""you"" and ""I"" refer to food manufacturers that are subject to the rule. Many answers in this guidance are followed by citations to show where a specific requirement can be found in either the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) or Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nII Who Is Subject to the Rule?\n\nYou are subject to the rule if you manufacture food that is subject to our nutrition labeling requirements. The nutrition labeling requirements apply to both conventional foods under 21 CFR 101.9(a) and dietary supplements under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(6).\n\nIII What Foods Are Covered by the Rule?\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for the General Food Supply?\n\nYes. Foods for the general food supply are foods eaten by persons 4 years of age and older.\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for Infants and Young Children 1 Through 3 Years of Age?\n\nYes. Foods, other than infant formula, represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age are subject to nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(j)(5)(i)). Manufacturers of foods represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months and/or children 1 through 3 years of age must use the Reference Daily Intakes (RDIs) and Daily Reference Values (DRVs) that are specified for this intended group when calculating percent Daily Values (DVs) for labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)). The previous categories of ""infants"" (or ""infants 7 to 12 months"") and ""children less than 4 years"" have been changed to ""infants through 12 months"" and ""children 1 through 3 years of age"" throughout 21 CFR 101.9.\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Foods for Pregnant Women and Lactating Women?\n\nYes. Manufacturers of foods represented or purported to be specifically for pregnant women and lactating women must use the RDIs and DRVs that are specified for this intended group when calculating percent DVs for labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)).\n\nDoes the Rule Cover Dietary Supplements?\n\nYes. Section 201(f) of the FD&C Act defines ""food"" as: ""(1) articles used for food or drink for man or other animals, (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article."" Further, section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act explains that dietary supplements are deemed to be foods within the meaning of the FD&C Act except for the purposes of sections 201(g) (definition of ""drug"") and 417 (reportable food registry) of the FD&C Act. Nutrition labeling information for food must be provided for all products intended for human consumption and offered for sale, unless an exemption is provided (21 CFR 101.9(a)). As dietary supplements fall under the definition of ""food,"" they are therefore subject to nutrition labeling. Specific nutrition labeling requirements and guidelines for dietary supplements can be found in 21 CFR 101.36.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNaturally-occurring sugars found in whole fruits and vegetables or dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them.\n\nThe amount of added sugars declared on the label should never exceed the amount of total sugars on the label.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(i) Do Honey, Maple Syrup, and Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n\nIn the Federal Register of June 20, 2019 (84 FR 28726), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled ""The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products,"" which provides clarity on the labeling of added sugars for such products (Ref. 1). In that guidance, we discuss section 12516 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (""the Farm Bill""), which states that the food labeling requirements cannot require the declaration ""Includes Xg Added Sugars"" in a serving of these single-ingredient products. While these products are not required to have this declaration of the gram amount of added sugars, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet, so the percent DV for added sugars must still be included consistent with 21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii). We stated that we intend to exercise enforcement discretion by permitting the use of the ""+"" symbol immediately following the percent DV declaration for added sugars on packages and containers of single-ingredient sugars and syrups. This symbol would lead to a footnote inside the Nutrition Facts label, explaining the amount of added sugars that one serving of the product contributes to the diet, as well as the contribution of a serving of the product toward the percent DV for added sugars. This symbol and footnote are not required; however, we encourage you to use them.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(ii) Do Added Sugars in Dried Cranberry Products and Cranberry Beverage Products Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels'

Can the term ""dietary supplement"" by itself be considered the statement of identity?\n\nYes. This term describes the basic nature of a dietary supplement and therefore is an ""appropriately descriptive term"" that can be used as the product\'s statement of identity. The statement of identity for a dietary supplement may therefore consist simply of the term ""dietary supplement,"" or ""dietary supplement"" may be part of a longer statement of identity (e.g., ""cod liver oil liquid dietary supplement""). In either case, the word ""dietary"" may be deleted and replaced by another appropriately descriptive term identifying the contents of the product, such as ""calcium supplement,"" ""herbal supplement"", or ""herbal supplement with vitamins.""\n\n21 CFR 101.3(g)\n\n4. Should I make the statement of identity stand out?\n\nYes. You must make the statement of identity one of the most important features on the principal display panel. To do this, you must use bold type and a type size reasonably related to the most prominent printed matter on the front panel of your label.\n\n21 CFR 101.3(d)\n\n5. How should I place the statement of identity on the principal display panel?\n\nYou must place the statement of identity of your dietary supplement product in lines generally parallel to the base of the package.\n\n21 CFR 101.3(d)\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter II.

If the principal display panel of your product is 5square inches or less, the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent does not apply when the declaration of net quantity of contents meets the other requirements of 21 CFR 101.105(f)\n3. How must I express the net quantity of contents statement on my label? You must express the net quantity of contents statement in either weight, measure, numerical count or a combination of numerical count and weight or measure. When you express this quantity as a weight or measure, you must specify both metric (grams, kilograms, milliliters, or liters) and U.S. Customary System (ounces, pounds, or fluid ounces) terms. Public Law 102-329, August 3, 1992 and 21 CFR 101.105\n4. Why must I calculate the area of the principal display panel? You must calculate the area of the principal display panel (calculated in square inches or square centimeters) to determine the minimum type size that is permitted for the net quantity of contents statement.\n5. How do I calculate the area of the principal display panel? You may calculate the area of the principal display panel for rectangular or square shaped packages by multiplying the height by the width (both in inches or both in centimeters), and for cylindrical shaped packages by multiplying 40% of the circumference by the height. For example, a rectangular package that is 8 inches high and 6 inches wide would have a principal display panel of 48 square inches. A cylindrical package having a circumference of 10 inches and a height of 2 inches would have a principal display panel of 8 square inches.\n6. Am I required to place the net quantity of contents statement conspicuously and prominently on my product labels? Yes. You are required to use a print style that is prominent, conspicuous, and easy to read, with letters not more than three times as high as wide. Use letters that contrast sufficiently with the background.\n7. What is the minimum type size that I can use for the net quantity of contents statements? The smallest type size permitted for the net quantity of contents statement is based on the size of the principal display panel. You may determine the height of the type by measuring the height of upper case letters, when only upper case letters are used, or the height of a lower case letter ""o,"" or its equivalent, when mixed upper and lower case letters are used. The table below sets out the minimum type size in inches (in.), with metric equivalents (millimeters (mm) and centimeters (cm)) in parentheses.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\nMinimum Type Size & Area of Principal Display Panel \\ \\hline\n1/16 in.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , How do I provide the ""Supplement Facts"" panel if my dietary supplements are sold from bulk containers?\n--------------------\nContext: (21 CFR 111.425)\n\nWhat does the DS CGMP rule require me to do when holding components, dietary supplements, packaging, and labels?\n\nThe DS CGMP rule requires you to:\n\nHold components and dietary supplements under appropriate conditions of temperature, humidity, and light so that the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the components and dietary supplements are not affected (21 CFR 111.455(a));\n\nHold packaging and labels under appropriate conditions so that the packaging and labels are not adversely affected (21 CFR 111.455(b));\n\nHold components, dietary supplements, packaging, and labels under conditions that do not lead to the mix-up, contamination, or deterioration of components, in-process materials, dietary supplements, packaging, and labels (21 CFR 111.455(c));\n\nWhat does the DS CGMP rule require me to do when holding in-process materials? The DS CGMP rule requires you to:\n\nIdentify and hold in-process material under conditions that protect against mix-up, contamination, and deterioration (21 CFR 111.460(a)); and\n\nHold in-process material under appropriate conditions of temperature, humidity, and light (21 CFR 111.460(b)).\n\nWhat container-closure system does the DS CGMP rule require me to use to hold reserve samples of packaged and labeled dietary supplements? The DS CGMP rule requires you to use the following container-closure systems to hold reserve samples of dietary supplements:\n\nIf you are distributing a packaged and labeled dietary supplement, the DS CGMP rule requires you to keep the reserve samples in a container-closure system that is the same as the container-closure system in which the dietary supplement is (\\bigstar) distributed.\n\nIf you are distributing a dietary supplement for packaging and labeling, the DS CGMP rule requires you to keep the reserve samples in a container-closure system that provides essentially the same characteristics to protect against contamination or deterioration as the one in which you distributed the dietary supplement for packaging and labeling elsewhere. For example, if you distribute product in bulk using a polyethylene bottle that can hold 50 kilograms of the product, and there is an air space above the product, you would hold the reserve samples in a polyethylene bottle with an air space. However, you would use a bottle sized to fit the smaller amount you are holding in reserve. (21 CFR 111.83(b)(1); 21 CFR 111.465(a)(2); 72 FR 34752 at 34904)\n\nHow does the DS CGMP rule require me to hold reserve samples of packaged and labeled dietary supplements? The DS CGMP rule requires you to hold reserve samples under conditions consistent with product labels or, if no storage conditions are recommended on the label, under ordinary storage conditions. For example, if the product label states ""Keep this product refrigerated,"" you would store the reserve sample in a refrigerator. (21 CFR 111.465(a)(1))\n\nHow long does the DS CGMP rule require me to hold reserve samples of packaged and labeled dietary supplements? The DS CGMP rule requires you to hold reserve samples of packaged and labeled dietary supplements for: * One year past the shelf life date (if shelf life dating is used); or * Two years from the date of distribution of the last batch of dietary supplements associated with the reserve sample. (21 CFR 111.83(b)(3) and 111.465(b))\n\nWhat does the DS CGMP rule require me to do when distributing dietary supplements? The DS CGMP rule requires you to distribute dietary supplements under conditions that will protect the dietary supplements against contamination and deterioration. (21 CFR 111.470)\n\n1. What does the DS CGMP rule require me to do with a returned dietary supplement?\n\nThe DS CGMP rule requires you to identify and quarantine a returned dietary supplement until quality control personnel conduct a material review and make a disposition decision.\n2. When does the DS CGMP rule require me to destroy, or otherwise suitably dispose of, a returned dietary supplement? The DS CGMP rule requires you to destroy, or otherwise suitably dispose of, any returned dietary supplement unless the outcome of a material review and disposition decision is that quality control personnel approve the salvage of the returned dietary supplement for redistribution, or approve the returned dietary supplement for reprocessing. (21 CFR 111.515)\n3. When may I salvage a returned dietary supplement? You may salvage a returned dietary supplement only if quality control personnel conduct a material review and make a disposition decision to allow the salvage. (21 CFR 111.520)\n4. What does the DS CGMP rule require me to do with a returned dietary supplement that quality control personnel approve for reprocessing? The DS CGMP rule requires that:\n\nYou ensure that any returned dietary supplements that are reprocessed meet all product specifications established for the finished batch to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement(21 CFR 111.525(a)); and\n\nQuality control personnel approve or reject the release for distribution of any returned dietary supplement that is reprocessed (21 CFR 111.525(b)).\n\nWhen does the DS CGMP rule require me to conduct an investigation of my manufacturing processes and other batches following the return of a product? The DS CGMP rule requires you to conduct an investigation of your manufacturing processes and each of those other batches to determine compliance with specifications if the reason for a dietary supplement being returned implicates other batches. (21 CFR 111.530)\n\nXIX. Subpart 0 - Product Complaints\n\nWhat are some examples of product complaints? Examples of product complaints are: foul odor, off taste, illness or injury, disintegration time, color variation, tablet size or size variation, under-filled container, foreign material in a dietary supplement container, improper packaging, mislabeling, or dietary supplements that are superpotent, subpotent, or contain the wrong ingredient, or contain a drug or other contaminant (e.g., bacteria, pesticide, mycotoxin, glass, lead). (21 CFR 111.3)\n\nDoes the DS CGMP rule establish requirements for handling complaints about the inherent safety of a dietary supplement?No (72 FR 34752 at 34763 and 34765). However, we encourage firms to investigate all complaints in a consistent way, regardless of whether the complaints relate to the quality of the dietary supplement or to the inherent safety of a dietary ingredient (72 FR 34752 at 34910). We also note that manufacturers, packers, and distributors whose names appear on the label of dietary supplements marketed in the United States are required to submit to FDA any report received of a serious adverse event associated with such dietary supplement when used in the United States (section 761 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the Act) (21 U.S.C. 379aa-1)) (see also question 8 below).\n\nWhat does the DS CGMP rule require me to do during the review and investigation of a product complaint? The DS CGMP rule requires that: * A qualified person review all product complaints to determine whether the product complaint involves a possible failure of a dietary supplement to meet any of its specifications, or any other requirements of part 111, including those specifications and other requirements that, if not met, may result in a risk of illness or injury (21 CFR 111.560(a)(1)); * A qualified person investigate the product complaint if it is determined that the product complaint does involve such a failure (21 CFR 111.560(a)(2)); * Quality control personnel review and approve decisions about whether to investigate a product complaint and review and approve the findings and follow-up action of any investigation performed (21 CFR 111.560(b)); and * The review and investigation of the product complaint extend to all relevant batches and records (21 CFR 111.560(c)).\n\nAm I subject to the requirements for product complaints if I am a packager, labeler, or distributor rather than a manufacturer? Yes. The DS CGMP rule requires any person in the manufacturing chain who receives a product complaint to comply with the requirements for product complaints (21 CFR 111.1; 72 FR 34752 at 34909). This is true regardless of the source of the product complaint - i.e., regardless of whether you receive the complaint from a consumer or from another firm in the manufacturing chain (72 FR 34752 at 34909).\n\nWhat should I do if I am a packager, labeler, or distributor and I conclude that the problem in a product complaint is unrelated to any process under my control? We recommend that you contact the manufacturer so that the manufacturer can determine whether the product complaint involves a possible failure of a dietary supplement to meet any of its specifications, or any other requirements of part 111, including those specifications and other requirements that, if not met, may result in a risk of illness or injury.\n\n(72 FR 34752 at 34909)Am I subject to the requirements for product complaints if I manufacture dietary ingredients rather than dietary supplements?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements']","['The retailer must display a ""Supplement Facts"" panel clearly at the point of purchase (e.g. on a counter card, sign, tag affixed to the product, or some other appropriate device).

52,"As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?","['--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: The intent of ICH Q7 is that samples be retained for the period of time that the API could be in the market in order to investigate any problems and/or product complaints. Based on accepted industry practice at the time ICH Q7 was written, it was not anticipated that a manufacturer would set a retest date longer than 3 years. It is a basic GMP principle that reserve samples be retained for the entire period the material is available on the market. For example, if a company sets a retest date of 5 years and the API is completely distributed immediately after manufacturing, it is not intended that the reserve sample be destroyed before the 5-year retest date is reached.\n\nWhy does ICH Q7 permit the use of a packaging system for reserve/retention samples that is ""more protective than the marketed packaging system"" (ICH Q7, paragraph 11.72)?\n\nUnlike stability samples, the purpose of the reserve/retention sample is not to represent the quality of the batch in the market place but to allow future evaluation of the quality of the original API batch (e.g., in evaluation of potential counterfeits). Therefore, reserve/retention samples may be stored in packaging (and conditions) that better preserve the original state of the API.\n\nValidation (12)\n\nIs the lifecycle approach to process validation acceptable for APIs under ICH Q7?\n\nYes, ICH Q7 does not preclude the lifecycle approach (ICH Q7, paragraph 12.10; ICH Q10; ICH Q11).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCan the range of a process parameter be expanded based only on a process deviation(s)?\n\nNo. However, information from the investigation into a process deviation(s) can be used to support expanding the range of a process parameter. Additional work and studies are normally needed to adequately demonstrate that the expanded range for the process parameter consistently produces API of the necessary quality (ICH Q7, paragraphs 2.16, 12.11, 13.13).\n\nWould additional process validation studies be needed to support a change in the source of an API starting material?\n\nAny change in the API starting material should be assessed for impact on the API manufacturing process and the resulting API quality (ICH Q7, paragraph 7.14). Additional validation studies of the API process may be warranted if the change in the API starting material is deemed significant. In most cases, validation would be expected for a different source of the starting material unless otherwise justified (ICH Q7, paragraphs 12.1, 13.13).\n\nIs a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n\nProspective validation is normally expected for processes introduced since the publication of ICH Q7. The concept of retrospective validation remains acceptable as an exception for existing, well-established products prior to the implementation of ICH Q7 (ICH Q7, paragraph 12.44).\n\nIf regulatory discussions redefine a step as critical, which had previously been considered noncritical, a protocol describing retrospective analysis of data together with the commitment for concurrent or prospective validation may be an option.\n\nRegardless of the type of validation, the quality system should confirm the ongoing robustness of the process (e.g., product quality review).\n\nChange Control (13)\n\nWho is responsible for notifying the drug product manufacturer about relevant changes in API manufacturing?\n\nEach party in the supply chain is responsible for transferring information related to quality or regulatory changes to the next customer in the supply chain. The intention is that the information is transferred along the supply chain to the drug product manufacturer in a timely manner (ICH Q7, paragraphs 13.17, 17.60).\n\nRejection and Reuse of Materials (14)\n\nShould rejected materials be stored under physical and secure segregation? ICH Q7 does not specify a need for physical and secure segregation. Both paragraphs 4.14 and 10.11 of ICH Q7 include the provision for the use of alternative control systems for storage of rejected material. Whatever control system is used, the purpose should be to prevent the unintentional or unauthorized use of the rejected material (ICH Q7, paragraphs 7.44, 10.11, section XIV.A (14.1)).\n\nDoes the definition of expiry date in ICH Q7 preclude the rework or reprocess of an expired API? According to the definition, material should not be used after the expiry date. The original intent of this definition in ICH Q7 was that expired API should not be used in drug product formulation. It may be acceptable to reprocess (ICH Q7, section XIV.B (14.2)) or rework (ICH Q7, section XIV.C (14.3)) the expired API where the API manufacturer has all related historical GMP documentation and additional stability data on the reworked or reprocessed API. There may be registration/filing considerations that are beyond the scope of ICH Q7 in addition to the GMP considerations.\n\nIs validation expected for the recovery of material from mother liquor? It depends. Recovery of material(s) from mother liquor is a process, and the need for validation should be assessed as for any other process step (ICH Q7, paragraph 14.40). Recovery of material from mother liquor in any process step that must be controlled within predetermined criteria to ensure the API meets its specification is, by definition, a critical process step and should be validated. For example, recovery of API from mother liquor would be considered a critical process step and should be validated (ICH Q7, paragraphs 12.11, 12.12, 14.41, 14.43 -- see Glossary (section 20) for definitions of critical, materials, mother liquor, and validation).\n\nComplaints and Recalls (15)\n\nCan quality defects of released APIs that are identified by another entity belonging to the same company be handled outside of the API manufacturer\'s complaint procedure? Yes. After the release of an API for further use, any identified quality defect should be investigated and addressed according to the API manufacturer\'s complaint system or equivalent (i.e., nonconformance, deviations, etc.) (ICH Q7, paragraphs 15.10 to 15.12). Where equivalent systems are used, such defects should be categorized in a manner that provides clear visibility that the defect was discovered after being released by the API site.\n\nMust a quality related return, at the request of the API manufacturing site, from another site within the same company be recorded as a ""recall""? No, provided that no portion of the batch left direct control of the company for sale or use. The return must be clearly visible in the API site\'s quality system as a return triggered by the API manufacturing site so this fact is clear in quality system trend reporting and in the product quality review (ICH Q7, paragraphs 2.50, 15.13, 15.14).\n\nContract Manufacturers (Including Laboratories) (16)\n\nDoes ICH Q7 preclude a contract manufacturer\'s independent quality unit from performing the main responsibilities as described in ICH Q7, paragraph 2.22? No. The original intent of section II.B (2.2) was to distinguish the main responsibilities (e.g., batch record review, review of nonconformances and investigations, sampling, testing, release or rejection of intermediate or API) of the independent quality unit from other departments within a company. Contract manufacturers are expected to have an independent quality unit that meets the responsibilities defined in ICH Q7, section II.B (2.2) for all activities performed. Given the potential complexity of outsourcing contract manufacturing arrangements, GMP responsibilities should be clearly defined between both parties in detail in a written agreement (ICH Q7, paragraph 16.12). However, the overall responsibility for API quality must not be delegated.6 Footnote 6: See 21 U.S.C. 351 (“the term ‘current good manufacturing practice’ includes the implementation of oversight and controls over the manufacturer of drugs to ensure quality, including managing the risk of and establishing the safety of raw materials, materials used in the manufacturing of drugs, and finished drug products.”).\n\nWhich outsourced activities are covered by ICH Q7? In the context of ICH Q7, contract manufacturing is the outsourced activity. The term outsourced activities, as defined and described in ICH Q10, section III.G (2.7) and Glossary (section VI (5)), aligns with the description of contract manufacturer in ICH Q7, section XVI (16). ICH Q7 defines manufacture as ""all operations of receipt of materials, production, packaging, repackaging, labeling, relabeling, quality control, release, storage, and distribution of APIs and related controls.""""Related controls"" include any activities or services necessary to support production (e.g., maintenance, calibration). ICH Q7 applies to any activities performed by the original manufacturer or the company that is performing the activity on behalf of the original manufacturer.\n\n16.3: What is meant by ""where subcontracting is allowed"" (ICH Q7, paragraph 16.14)?\n\nSubcontracting as used in ICH Q7, paragraph 16.14 refers to the contract acceptor further contracting out a specific activity to another party (third party). This should only be done when the written and approved contract, as described in ICH Q7, paragraph 16.12, specifically allows for such subcontracting. Even when subcontracting is allowed, the original contract given should approve specific subcontracting before it occurs as stated in ICH Q7, paragraph 16.14.\n\nQ.: Agents, Brokers, Traders, Distributors, Repackers, and Relabelers (17)\n\n17.1: What does ICH Q7 mean by ""agents, brokers, traders, distributors, repackers, or relabelers""?\n\nRegardless of what terms are used in different regions, ICH Q7 applies to all parties in the supply chain after the original API/intermediate manufacturer to the drug product manufacturer, in order to maintain the integrity, traceability, and transparency of the supply chain (ICH Q7, section XVII.A (17.1)).\n\n17.2: Could a distributor of an API engage a contract manufacturer for production steps?\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: An exception can be made for retrospective validation for well established processes that have been used without significant changes to API quality due to changes in raw materials, equipment, systems, facilities, or the production process. This validation approach may be used where:\n\nCritical quality attributes and critical process parameters have been identified;\n\nAppropriate in-process acceptance criteria and controls have been established;\n\nThere have not been significant process/product failures attributable to causes other than operator error or equipment failures unrelated to equipment suitability; and\n\nImpurity profiles have been established for the existing API.\n\nBatches selected for retrospective validation should be representative of all batches made during the review period, including any batches that failed to meet specifications, and should be sufficient in number to demonstrate process consistency. Retained samples can be tested to obtain data to retrospectively validate the process.\n\nProcess Validation Program\n\nThe number of process runs for validation should depend on the complexity of the process or the magnitude of the process change being considered. For prospective and concurrent validation, three consecutive successful production batches should be used as a guide, but there may be situations where additional process runs are warranted to prove consistency of the process (e.g., complex API processes or API processes with prolonged completion times). For retrospective validation, generally data from ten to thirty consecutive batches should be examined to assess process consistency, but fewer batches can be examined if justified.\n\nCritical process parameters should be controlled and monitored during process validation studies. Process parameters unrelated to quality, such as variables controlled to minimize energy consumption or equipment use, need not be included in the process validation.\n\nProcess validation should confirm that the impurity profile for each API is within the limits specified. The impurity profile should be comparable to or better than historical data and, where applicable, the profile determined during process development or for batches used for pivotal clinical and toxicological studies.\n\nPeriodic Review of Validated Systems\n\nSystems and processes should be periodically evaluated to verify that they are still operating in a valid manner. Where no significant changes have been made to the system or process, and a quality review confirms that the system or process is consistently producing material meeting its specifications, there is normally no need for revalidation.\n\nCleaning Validation\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 4: Specifications must be scientifically sound and appropriate (§ 211.160(b)), test procedures must be validated as to their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility (§ 211.165(e)), and the suitability of the test procedures under actual conditions of use must be documented (§ 211.194(a)(2)). For products that are the subjects of new drug applications (NDAs), abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), or investigational new drug applications (INDs), specifications are contained in the application or DMF. Specifications for nonapplication products may be found in official compendia or established by the manufacturer.\n\nBoth finished pharmaceuticals and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are to be manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practice under section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act. Current good manufacturing practice for APIs includes the performance of scientifically sound raw material testing, in-process monitoring, release and stability testing, process validation, and adequate investigations of any OOS result obtained from such testing. All citations to part 211 in this document pertain to finished pharmaceuticals, but these referenced regulatory requirements are also consistent with Agency guidance on CGMP for APIs with respect to laboratory controls, which include out-of-specification investigations. See FDA'sguidance for industry Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (September 2016) (ICH Q7) for specific recommendations.5\n\nFootnote 5: We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the CDER guidance page at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/guidances-drugs.\n\nThe responsibility of a contract testing laboratory in meeting these requirements is equivalent to that of a manufacturing firm.\n\nIII Identifying and Assessing OOS Test Results -- Phase I: Laboratory Investigation\n\nFDA regulations require that an investigation be conducted whenever an OOS test result is obtained (SS 211.192).6 The purpose of the investigation is to determine the cause of the OOS result. The source of the OOS result should be identified either as an aberration of the measurement process or an aberration of the manufacturing process. Even if a batch is rejected based on an OOS result, the investigation is necessary to determine if the result is associated with other batches of the same drug product or other products. Batch rejection does not negate the need to perform the investigation. The regulations require that a written record of the investigation be made, including the conclusions and follow-up (SS 211.192).\n\nFootnote 6: Although the subject of this document is OOS results, much of the guidance may be useful for examining results that are out of trend.\n\nTo be meaningful, the investigation should be thorough, timely, unbiased, well-documented, and scientifically sound. The first phase of such an investigation should include an initial assessment of the accuracy of the laboratory's data. Whenever possible, this should be done before test preparations (including the composite or the homogenous source of the aliquot tested) are discarded. This way, hypotheses regarding laboratory error or instrument malfunctions can be tested using the same test preparations. If this initial assessment indicates that no causative errors were made in the analytical method used to arrive at the data, a full-scale OOS investigation should be conducted. For contract laboratories, the laboratory should convey its data, findings, and supporting documentation to the manufacturing firm's quality unit (QU). The manufacturing firm's QU should then initiate the Phase 2 (full-scale) OOS investigation, whenever no clearly causative laboratory error was identified.\n\nResponsibility of the Analyst\n\nThe first responsibility for achieving accurate laboratory testing results lies with the analyst who is performing the test. The analyst should be aware of potential problems that could occur during the testing process and should watch for problems that could create inaccurate results.\n\nIn accordance with the CGMP regulations in SS 211.160(b)(4), the analyst should ensure that only those instruments meeting established performance specifications are used and that all instruments are properly calibrated.\n\nCertain analytical methods have system suitability requirements, and systems not meeting these requirements should not be used. For example, in chromatographic systems, reference standard solutions may be injected at intervals throughout chromatographic runs to measure drift, noise, and repeatability. If reference standard responses indicate that the system is not functioning properly, all of the data collected during the suspect time period should be properly identified and should not be used. The cause of the malfunction should be identified and, if possible, corrected before a decision is made whether to use any data prior to the suspect period.\n\nAnalysts should check the data for compliance with test specifications before discarding test preparations or standard preparations. When unexpected results are obtained and no obvious explanation exists, test preparations should be retained, if stable, and the analyst should inform the supervisor. An assessment of the accuracy of the results should be started immediately.\n\nIf errors are obvious, such as the spilling of a sample solution or the incomplete transfer of a sample composite, the analyst should immediately document what happened. Analysts should not knowingly continue an analysis they expect to invalidate at a later time for an assignable cause (i.e., analyses should not be completed for the sole purpose of seeing what results can be obtained when obvious errors are known).\n\nResponsibilities of the Laboratory Supervisor\n\nOnce an OOS result has been identified, the supervisor's assessment should be objective and timely. There should be no preconceived assumptions as to the cause of the OOS result. Data should be assessed promptly to ascertain if the results might be attributed to laboratory error, or whether the results could indicate problems in the manufacturing process. An immediate assessment could include re-examination of the actual solutions, test units, and glassware used in the original measurements and preparations, which might provide more credibility for laboratory error hypotheses.\n\nThe following steps should be taken as part of the supervisor's assessment:\n\nDiscuss the test method with the analyst; confirm analyst knowledge of and performance of the correct procedure.\n\nExamine the raw data obtained in the analysis, including chromatograms and spectra, and identify anomalous or suspect information.\n\nVerify that the calculations used to convert raw data values into a final test result are scientifically sound, appropriate, and correct; also determine if unauthorized or unvalidated changes have been made to automated calculation methods.\n\nConfirm the performance of the instruments.\n\nDetermine that appropriate reference standards, solvents, reagents, and other solutions were used and that they met quality control specifications.\n\nEvaluate the performance of the test method to ensure that it is performing according to the standard expected based on method validation data and historical data.\n\nFully document and preserve records of this laboratory assessment.\n\nThe assignment of a cause for OOS results will be greatly facilitated if the retained sample preparations are examined promptly. Hypotheses regarding what might have happened (e.g., dilution error, instrument malfunction) should be tested. Examination of the retained solutions should be performed as part of the laboratory investigation.\n\nExamples:\n\nSolutions can be re-injected as part of an investigation where a transient equipment malfunction is suspected. Such hypotheses are difficult to prove. However, reinjections can provide strong evidence that the problem should be attributed to the instrument, rather than the sample or its preparation.\n\nFor release rate testing of certain specialized dosage form drugs that are not destroyed during testing, where possible, examination of the original dosage unit tested might determine whether it was damaged during laboratory handling in a way that affected its performance. Such damage would provide evidence to invalidate the OOS test result, and a retest would be indicated.\n\nFurther extraction of a dosage unit, where possible, can be performed to determine whether it was fully extracted during the original analysis. Incomplete extraction could invalidate the test results and should lead to questions regarding validation of the test method.\n\nIt is important that each step in the investigation be fully documented. Laboratory management should ascertain not only the reliability of the individual value obtained, but also the significance these OOS results represent to the laboratory quality assurance program. Laboratory management should be especially alert to developing trends. As part of an effective quality system, a firm's upper management should appropriately monitor these trends and ensure that any problematic areas are addressed.\n\nLaboratory error should be relatively rare. Frequent errors suggest a problem that might be due to inadequate training of analysts, poorly maintained or improperly calibrated equipment, or careless work. Whenever laboratory error is identified, the firm should determine the source of that error and take corrective action to prevent recurrence. To ensure full compliance with the CGMP regulations, the manufacturer also should maintain adequate documentation of the corrective action.\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigating Out-of-Specification (OOS) Test Results for Pharmaceutical Production - Level 2 revision Guidance for Industry""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: Prospective validation should normally be performed for all API processes as defined in 12.1. Prospective validation of an API process should be completed before the commercial distribution of the final drug product manufactured from that API. (12.42)\n\nConcurrent validation can be conducted when data from replicate production runs are unavailable because only a limited number of API batches have been produced, API batches are produced infrequently, or API batches are produced by a validated process that has been modified. Prior to the completion of concurrent validation, batches can be released and used in final drug product for commercial distribution based on thorough monitoring and testing of the API batches. (12.43)\n\nAn exception can be made for retrospective validation of well-established processes that have been used without significant changes to API quality due to changes in raw materials, equipment, systems, facilities, or the production process. This validation approach may be used where the following apply: (12.44)\n\nCritical quality attributes and critical process parameters have been identified\n\nAppropriate in-process acceptance criteria and controls have been established\n\nThere have not been significant process/product failures attributable to causes other than operator error or equipment failures unrelated to equipment suitability\n\nImpurity profiles have been established for the existing API\n\nBatches selected for retrospective validation should be representative of all batches produced during the review period, including any batches that failed to meet specifications, and should be sufficient in number to demonstrate process consistency. Retained samples can be tested to obtain data to retrospectively validate the process. (12.45)\n\nProcess Validation Program (12.5)\n\nThe number of process runs for validation should depend on the complexity of the process or the magnitude of the process change being considered. For prospective and concurrent validation, three consecutive successful production batches should be used as a guide, but there may be situations where additional process runs are warranted to prove consistency of the process (e.g., complex API processes or API processes with prolonged completion times). For retrospective validation, generally data from 10 to 30 consecutive batches should be examined to assess process consistency, but fewer batches can be examined if justified. (12.50)Critical process parameters should be controlled and monitored during process validation studies. Process parameters unrelated to quality, such as variables controlled to minimize energy consumption or equipment use, need not be included in the process validation. (12.51)\n\nProcess validation should confirm that the impurity profile for each API is within the limits specified. The impurity profile should be comparable to, or better than, historical data and, where applicable, the profile determined during process development or for batches used for pivotal clinical and toxicological studies. (12.52)\n\nPeriodic Review of Validated Systems (12.6)\n\nSystems and processes should be periodically evaluated to verify that they are still operating in a valid manner. Where no significant changes have been made to the system or process, and a quality review confirms that the system or process is consistently producing material meeting its specifications, there is normally no need for revalidation. (12.60)\n\nCleaning Validation (12.7)\n\nCleaning procedures should normally be validated. In general, cleaning validation should be directed to situations or process steps where contamination or carryover of materials poses the greatest risk to API quality. For example, in early production it may be unnecessary to validate equipment cleaning procedures where residues are removed by subsequent purification steps. (12.70)\n\nValidation of cleaning procedures should reflect actual equipment usage patterns. If various APIs or intermediates are manufactured in the same equipment and the equipment is cleaned by the same process, a representative intermediate or API can be selected for cleaning validation. This selection should be based on the solubility and difficulty of cleaning and the calculation of residue limits based on potency, toxicity, and stability. (12.71)\n\nThe cleaning validation protocol should describe the equipment to be cleaned, procedures, materials, acceptable cleaning levels, parameters to be monitored and controlled, and analytical methods. The protocol should also indicate the type of samples to be obtained and how they are collected and labeled. (12.72)\n\nSampling should include swabing, rinsing, or alternative methods (e.g., direct extraction), as appropriate, to detect both insoluble and soluble residues. The sampling methods used should be capable of quantitatively measuring levels of residues remaining on the equipment surfaces after cleaning. Swab sampling may be impractical when product contact surfaces are not easily accessible due to equipment design and/or process limitations (e.g., inner surfaces of hoses, transfer pipes, reactor tanks with small ports or handling toxic materials, and small intricate equipment such as micronizers and microfluidizers). (12.73)\n\nValidated analytical methods having sensitivity to detect residues or contaminants should be used. The detection limit for each analytical method should be sufficiently sensitive to detect the established acceptable level of the residue or contaminant. The method's attainable recovery level should be established. Residue limits should be practical, achievable, verifiable, and based on the most deleterious residue. Limits can be established based on the minimum known pharmacological, toxicological, or physiological activity of the API or its most deleterious component. (12.74)\n\nEquipment cleaning/sanitation studies should address microbiological and endotoxin contamination for those processes where there is a need to reduce total microbiological count or endotoxins in the API, or other processes where such contamination could be of concern (e.g., non-sterile APIs used to manufacture sterile products). (12.75)\n\nCleaning procedures should be monitored at appropriate intervals after validation to ensure that these procedures are effective when used during routine production. Equipment cleanliness can be monitored by analytical testing and visual examination, where feasible. Visual inspection can allow detection of gross contamination concentrated in small areas that could otherwise go undetected by sampling and/or analysis. (12.76)\n\nValidation of Analytical Methods (12.8)\n\nAnalytical methods should be validated unless the method employed is included in the relevant pharmacopoeia or other recognized standard reference. The suitability of all testing methods used should nonetheless be verified under actual conditions of use and documented. (12.80)\n\nMethods should be validated to include consideration of characteristics included within the ICH guidances on validation of analytical methods. The degree of analytical validation performed should reflect the purpose of the analysis and the stage of the API production process. (12.81)\n\nAppropriate qualification of analytical equipment should be considered before initiating validation of analytical methods. (12.82)\n\nComplete records should be maintained of any modification of a validated analytical method. Such records should include the reason for the modification and appropriate data to verify that the modification produces results that are as accurate and reliable as the established method. (12.83)\n\nChange Control (13)\n\nA formal change control system should be established to evaluate all changes that could affect the production and control of the intermediate or API. (13.10)\n\nWritten procedures should provide for the identification, documentation, appropriate review, and approval of changes in raw materials, specifications, analytical methods, facilities, support systems, equipment (including computer hardware), processing steps, labeling and packaging materials, and computer software. (13.11)\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAny proposals for GMP relevant changes should be drafted, reviewed, and approved by the appropriate organizational units and reviewed and approved by the quality unit(s). (13.12)\n\nThe potential impact of the proposed change on the quality of the intermediate or API should be evaluated. A classification procedure may help in determining the level of testing, validation, and documentation needed to justify changes to a validated process. Changes can be classified (e.g., as minor or major) depending on the nature and extent of the changes, and the effects these changes may impart on the process. Scientific judgment should determine what additional testing and validation studies are appropriate to justify a change in a validated process. (13.13)\n\nWhen implementing approved changes, measures should be taken to ensure that all documents affected by the changes are revised. (13.14)\n\nAfter the change has been implemented, there should be an evaluation of the first batches produced or tested under the change. (13.15)\n\nThe potential for critical changes to affect established retest or expiry dates should be evaluated. If necessary, samples of the intermediate or API produced by the modified process can be placed on an accelerated stability program and/or can be added to the stability monitoring program. (13.16)\n\nCurrent dosage form manufacturers should be notified of changes from established production and process control procedures that can affect the quality of the API. (13.17)\n\nXiv Rejection and Re-Use of Materials (14)\n\nRejection (14.1)\n\nIntermediates and APIs failing to meet established specifications should be identified as such and quarantined. These intermediates or APIs can be reprocessed or reworked as described below.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: Process Design: The commercial manufacturing process is defined during this stage based on knowledge gained through development and scale-up activities.\n\nProcess Qualification: During this stage, the process design is evaluated to determine if the process is capable of reproducible commercial manufacturing.\n\nContinued Process Verification: Ongoing assurance is gained during routine production that the process remains in a state of control.\n\nThis guidance describes activities typical of each stage, but in practice, some activities might occur in multiple stages.\n\nBefore any batch from the process is commercially distributed for use by consumers, a manufacturer should have gained a high degree of assurance in the performance of the manufacturing process such that it will consistently produce APIs and drug products meeting those attributes relating to identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency. The assurance should be obtained from objective information and data from laboratory-, pilot-, and/or commercial-scale studies. Information and data should demonstrate that the commercial manufacturing process is capable of consistently producing acceptable quality products within commercial manufacturing conditions.\n\nA successful validation program depends upon information and knowledge from product and process development. This knowledge and understanding is the basis for establishing an approach to control of the manufacturing process that results in products with the desired quality attributes. Manufacters should:\n\nUnderstand the sources of variation\n\nDetect the presence and degree of variation\n\nUnderstand the impact of variation on the process and ultimately on product attributes\n\nControl the variation in a manner commensurate with the risk it represents to the process and product\n\nEach manufacturer should judge whether it has gained sufficient understanding to provide a high degree of assurance in its manufacturing process to justify commercial distribution of the product. Focusing exclusively on qualification efforts without also understanding the manufacturing process and associated variations may not lead to adequate assurance of quality. After establishing and confirming the process, manufacturers must maintain the process in a state of control over the life of the process, even as materials, equipment, production environment, personnel, and manufacturing procedures change.9\n\nFootnote 9: The statute and regulations described in section III of this guidance explain the requirement that the methods and facilities used for the manufacturing of drugs be operated and administered under control sufficient to assure that the identity, strength, purity, and quality of a drug are as they purport or are represented to possess.\n\nManufacturers should use ongoing programs to collect and analyze product and process data to evaluate the state of control of the process. These programs may identify process or product problems or opportunities for process improvements that can be evaluated and implemented through some of the activities described in Stages 1 and 2.\n\nManufacturers of legacy products can take advantage of the knowledge gained from the original process development and qualification work as well as manufacturing experience to continually improve their processes. Implementation of the recommendations in this guidance for legacy products and processes would likely begin with the activities described in Stage 3.\n\nIII Statutory and Regulatory Requirements for Process Validation\n\nProcess validation for drugs (finished pharmaceuticals and components) is a legally enforceable requirement under section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B)), which states the following:\n\nA drug... shall be deemed to be adulterated... if... the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, its manufacture, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to or are not operated or administered in conformity with current good manufacturing practice to assure that such drug meets the requirements of this Act as to safety and has the identity and strength, and meets the quality and purity characteristics, which it purports or is represented to possess.\n\nFDA regulations describing current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) for finished pharmaceuticals are provided in 21 CFR parts 210 and 211.\n\nThe CGMP regulations require that manufacturing processes be designed and controlled to assure that in-process materials and the finished product meet predetermined quality requirements and do so consistently and reliably. Process validation is required, in both general and specific terms, by the CGMP regulations in parts 210 and 211. The foundation for process validation is provided in SS 211.100(a), which states that ""[t]here shall be written procedures for production and process control designed to assure that the drug products have the identity, strength, quality, and purity they purport or are represented to possess..."" (emphasis added). This regulation requires manufacturers to design a process, including operations and controls, which results in a product meeting these attributes.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nOther CGMP regulations define the various aspects of validation. For example, SS 211.110(a),\n\nSampling and testing of in-process materials and drug products, requires that control procedures "". (\\ldots) be established to monitor the output and to validate the performance of those manufacturing processes that may be responsible for causing variability in the characteristics of in-process material and the drug product"" (emphasis added). Under this regulation, even well-designed processes must include in-process control procedures to assure final product quality. In addition, the CGMP regulations regarding sampling set forth a number of requirements for validation: samples must represent the batch under analysis (SS 211.160(b)(3)); the sampling plan must result in statistical confidence (SS 211.165(c) and (d)); and the batch must meet its predetermined specifications (SS 211.165(a)).\n\nIn addition to sampling requirements, the CGMP regulations also provide norms for establishing in-process specifications as an aspect of process validation. Section 211.110(b) establishes two principles to follow when establishing in-process specifications. The first principle is that "". (\\ldots) in-process specifications for such characteristics [of in-process material and the drug product] shall be consistent with drug product final specifications (\\ldots)."" Accordingly, in-process material should be controlled to assure that the final drug product will meet its quality requirements. The second principle in this regulation further requires that in-process specifications ""(\\ldots) shall be derived from previous acceptable process average and process variability estimates where possible and determined by the application of suitable statistical procedures where appropriate."" This requirement, in part, establishes the need for manufacturers to analyze process performance and control batch-to-batch variability.10\n\nFootnote 10: The Agency further explains this principle in the preamble to the final rule on “Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacture, Processing, Packing, or Holding” (43 FR 45013 at 45052, September 29, 1978) (available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cder/dmpq/preamble.txt).\n\nThe CGMP regulations also describe and define activities connected with process design, development, and maintenance. Section 211.180(e) requires that information and data about product quality and manufacturing experience be periodically reviewed to determine whether any changes to the established process are warranted. Ongoing feedback about product quality and process performance is an essential feature of process maintenance.\n\nIn addition, the CGMP regulations require that facilities in which drugs are manufactured be of suitable size, construction, and location to facilitate proper operations (SS 211.42). Equipment must be of appropriate design, adequate size, and suitably located to facilitate operations for its intended use (SS 211.63). Automated, mechanical, and electronic equipment must be calibrated, inspected, or checked according to a written program designed to assure proper performance (SS 211.68).\n\nIn summary, the CGMP regulations require that manufacturing processes be designed and controlled to assure that in-process materials and the finished product meet predetermined quality requirements and do so consistently and reliably.\n\nIV Recommendations\n\nIn the following sections, we describe general considerations for process validation, the recommended stages of process validation, and specific activities for each stage in the product lifecycle.\n\nGeneral Considerations for Process Validation\n\nIn all stages of the product lifecycle, good project management and good archiving that capture scientific knowledge will make the process validation program more effective and efficient. The following practices should ensure uniform collection and assessment of information about the process and enhance the accessibility of such information later in the product lifecycle.\n\nWe recommend an integrated team approach11 to process validation that includes expertise from a variety of disciplines (e.g., process engineering, industrial pharmacy, analytical chemistry, microbiology, statistics, manufacturing, and quality assurance). Project plans, along with the full support of senior management, are essential elements for success.

The required unit of measure for vitamin D is ""mcg"" for both conventional foods and dietary supplements. It is also permissible to include the voluntary labeling of vitamin D in IU, in parentheses, next to the mandatory declaration in mcg units (81 FR 33742 at 33912-33913). The two major forms of vitamin D, vitamin D({}{2}) (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D({}{3}) (cholesterol), have been reported to exhibit identical responses in the body (Ref.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What do you mean by ""recognized antioxidant activity""?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:1]\n\n101.54(f) and (g) and 21 CFR 101.60(c)(1)(iii)(A) concerning dietary supplement use of certain nutrient content claims. This regulation is binding and has the full force and effect of law. FDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. Questions and Answers\n\n1. High Potency Claims\n\nWhat is the definition of ""high potency?""\n\nThe regulation states that the term ""high potency"" may be used in a claim on the label or in labeling to describe individual vitamins or minerals that are present at 100 percent or more of the Reference Daily Intakes (RDI) per reference amount customarily consumed (21 CFR 101.54(f)(1)(i)). This means a supplement may be labeled as ""high potency"" for each nutrient(s) that is present at 100% of the RDI per serving.\n2. How should the label or labeling describe the nutrients that are the subject of the high potency claim? When the term ""high potency"" is used to describe individual vitamins or minerals in a product that contains other nutrients, then the label or labeling must clearly identify which specific vitamins or minerals are being described as ""high potency."" For example, ""Botanical X with high potency vitamin E."" (21 CFR 101.54(f)(1)(ii))\n3. Can I name an entire product ""high potency"" when not all ingredients are present at 100% or greater? The term ""high potency"" may be used on the label or in labeling of a multi-ingredient product to describe the product (as opposed to describing the level of individual ingredients) if the product contains 100 percent or more of the RDI for at least two-thirds of the vitamins and minerals that are listed in 21 CFR 101.9(c) (8)(iv) and that are present in the product at 2 percent or more of the RDI. For example, ""High potency multivitamin, multimineral dietary supplement tablets."" (21 CFR 101.54(f)(2))\n4. Do any other requirements apply to the use of the term ""High potency"" in foods? Yes. If the nutrient that is the subject of a high potency claims is added to a food that is not a dietary supplement, then that fortification must be in accordance with the policy on food fortification in 21 CFR 104.20 (21 CFR 101.54(f)(3)).\n\n2. Antioxidant nutrient content claims\n\nIs an antioxidant claim a nutrient content claim?Yes. A claim that describes the level of antioxidant nutrients present in a food is a nutrient content claim and may be used on the label or in the labeling of a food when the conditions of use in the regulation are met (21 CFR 101.54(g)).\n\nCan I make an antioxidant nutrient content claim for any ingredient in a food? No. An antioxidant nutrient content claim can only be made for nutrients for which there is an RDI established in 21 CFR 101.9 (21 CFR 101.54(g)(1)).\n\nDoes the claim apply to all nutrients listed in 21 CFR 101.9? No. The nutrient that is the subject of the claim must have recognized antioxidant activity. That is, there must be scientific evidence that after it is eaten and absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, the substance participates in physiological, biochemical, or cellular processes that inactivate free radicals or prevent free radical-initiated chemical reactions (21 CFR 101.54(g)(2)).\n\nHow much of the nutrient must be present in each serving in order to use the antioxidant nutrient content claim? The antioxidant nutrient must meet the requirements for nutrient content claims in 21 CFR 101.54(b), (c), or (e) for ""High"" claims, ""Good source"" claims, and ""More"" claims, respectively. For example, to use a ""high"" claim, the food would have to contain 20% or more of the Daily Reference Value (DRV) or RDI per serving. For a ""good source"" claim, the food would have to contain between 10-19% of the DRV or RDI per serving (21 CFR 101.54(g)(3)).\n\nWhat special requirements apply to an antioxidant nutrient content claim for beta-carotene? Beta-carotene may be the subject of an antioxidant claim when the level of vitamin A present as beta-carotene in the food using the claim is sufficient to qualify for the claim. For example, if the claim is ""good source of antioxidant beta-carotene,"" then at least 10% of the RDI for vitamin A must be present as beta-carotene per serving (21 CFR 101.54(g)(3)).\n\nDoes the label claim have to include the name of the nutrient that is an antioxidant, or can the claim simply say ""antioxidants?"" The names of the nutrients that are the antioxidants must appear in the claim. For example, ""high in antioxidant vitamins C and E."" Alternatively, when used as part of a nutrient content claim, the term ""antioxidant"" or ""antioxidants"" (such as ""high in antioxidants""), may be linked by a symbol (such as an asterisk) that refers to the same symbol that appears elsewhere on the same panel of a product label followed by the name or names of the nutrients with the recognized antioxidant activity. If this is done, the list of nutrients must appear in letters of a type size height no smaller than the larger of one half of the type size of the largest nutrient content claim or 1/16 inch (21 CFR 101.54(g)(4)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:4]\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Nutrient Content Claims Definition for “High Potency” and Definition for “Antioxidant” for Use in Nutrient Content Claims for Dietary Supplements and Conventional Foods'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What do you mean by ""recognized antioxidant activity""?\n--------------------\nContext: Regarding dietary supplements, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium must be declared when they are present in a dietary supplement in quantitative amounts by weight that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling of foods in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c). (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAs for the phrase ""levels of significance,"" as used in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii) and 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and whether the phrase refers to statistical testing of hypotheses or mathematical concepts related to the degree of accuracy starting with the first nonzero digit, the phrase ""levels of significance"" refers to the degree of accuracy when rounding nutrients for purposes of declaring quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the label.\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c), provide specific rounding requirements for nutrients such as sodium. Before we issued the Nutrition Facts label final rule, sodium and potassium content was to be expressed as zero when the serving contained less than 5 milligrams (mg), to the nearest 5 mg increment when the serving contained less than or equal to 140 mg, and to the nearest 10 mg increment when the serving contained more than 140 mg. The Nutrition\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFacts label final rule amended 21 CFR 101.9(c)(5) to replace the requirements for the labeling of potassium with those of fluoride and amended 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) to establish an RDI for potassium and add it to the list of vitamins and minerals with RDIs. The requirements for declaring the quantitative amount of potassium are now the same as those for other vitamins and minerals with RDIs.\n\nThe RDIs for some vitamins and minerals are small numerical values (e.g., copper 0.9 mg). Nutrients with an RDI of less than 5 would not be able to be declared on the Supplement Facts label if they contain less than 2 percent of the RDI (e.g. 2 percent of the RDI for copper is 0.018 mg) and the amount is declared to the nearest mg or microgram (mcg) (e.g. if the amount of copper in a serving of the product is 0.017, but is rounded to zero). The vitamins and minerals with an RDI of less than 5 mg or mcg are thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, copper, and manganese. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest hundredth of a mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 5 mg or mcg, but less than 50 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest tenth of a mg or mcg per serving. The vitamins or minerals with an RDI of at least 5 mg or mcg but less than 50 mg or mcg are iron, vitamin D, vitamin E, niacin, biotin, pantothenic acid, zinc, chromium, and molybdenum. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest tenth of a mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg, but less than 250 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest mg or mcg. The vitamins or minerals with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg but less than 250 mg or mcg are vitamin C, vitamin K, iodine, and selenium. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the minerals with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg but less than 250 mg or mcg are vitamin C, vitamin K, iodine, and selenium. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 250 mg or mcg, but less than 500 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest 5 mg or mcg. The vitamins and minerals with an RDI of at least 250 mg or mcg, but less than 500 mg or mcg, are folate and\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:28]\n\n2.2 Recommendations for declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels using RDIs for adults and children (\\geq) 4 years\n\nThis table provides recommendations for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals using only the RDIs that have been established for adults and children 4 years of age and older. Our regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv), provide RDIs for infants through 12 months, children 1 through 3 years, and pregnant and lactating women. The declaration recommendations provided in this guidance can also be applied to the RDIs for these subpopulations.\n\nVII References\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance document provides step-by-step instructions to manufacturers of retail food products marketed in the United States on how they may convert the previous units of measure for certain nutrients to the new units in the updated Nutrition Facts label (81 FR 33742 at 33906-33916 and SS 101.9 (21 CFR 101.9)). This guidance document also provides conversion factors that can be used for each of these nutrients and example2 calculations for converting to the new units of measure for conventional foods and dietary supplements. Lastly, this guidance document provides information that can help manufacturers understand and comply with relevant labeling requirements.\n\nFootnote 2: In the examples provided for conventional foods, the quantity of a nutrient is expressed per serving size, which, in this guidance, refers to the serving size declaration on the Nutrition Facts label based on the reference amount customarily consumed per eating occasion (RACC) for a specific food category (§ 101.12, Tables 1-2) and applicable requirements set forth in § 101.9(b). For dietary supplements, the nutrient amount is expressed per serving size.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in our guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nII Background\n\nIn 2016, FDA amended the regulations for the nutrition labeling of conventional foods (SS 101.9) and dietary supplements (SS 101.36) to include updated Daily Values (DV), as Reference Daily Intakes (RDIs), for folate, niacin, vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin E. These RDIs are based on the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), specifically Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) published by the National Academy of Medicine (NAM, formerly known as the Institute of Medicine (IOM)). Except for niacin, which had its unit of measure established in the 1989 RDA as ""Niacin Equivalent,"" the other four nutrients have new units of measure associated with the updated RDAs established by the NAM. While the unit of measurement for the RDI for niacin is listed as Niacin Equivalents (i.e., mg NE) in SS 101.9(c)(8)(iv), only the amount ""mg"" will continue to be declared in labeling. The units of measure for these nutrients in the Nutrition Facts label, described in SS 101.9(c)(8)(iv), also pertain to the Supplement Facts label (SS 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B)). Table 1 shows the old (1993) and the current (2016) RDI\'s established for these five nutrients:\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l} \\hline\nNutrient & 1993 RDI & 2016 RDI1 \\ \\hline Folate & 400 micrograms (mcg) & 400 micrograms DFE2 (mcg DFE3) \\ Niacin & 20 milligrams (mg) & 16 milligrams NE4 (mg) \\ Vitamin A & 5,000 International Units (IU) & 900 micrograms RAE5 (mcg) \\ Vitamin D & 400 International Units (IU) & 20 micrograms (mcg) \\ Vitamin E & 30 International Units (IU) & 15 milligrams (\\alpha)-Tocopherol6 (mg) \\ \\hline \\end{tabular} 1\n\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: RDIs for the Five Nutrients\n\n3 Conversion Factors\n\n3.1 Folate\n\nThe 2016 RDI for folate is based on the RDA of 400 mcg of dietary folate equivalents (DFE) for men and women (Ref. 1). The term DFE was introduced by the NAM to take into account the differences in bioavailability between the naturally occurring folates in the reduced tetrahydrorofolate form that are inherent components of conventional foods, and folic acid, the fully oxidized monoglutamate synthetic form of the vitamin, used to fortify conventional foods and often used as an ingredient in dietary supplements.\n\nBecause folic acid is 85 percent bioavailable, but naturally occurring folate is only about 50 percent bioavailable, folic acid is 1.7 (85 (\\div) 50) times more bioavailable. Therefore, the DFE folate is calculated as:\n\n[\\textbf{mcg DFE}\\ =\\ \\textbf{mcg naturally occurring folate}+\\textbf{(1.7}\\times\\textbf{mcg folic acid)}]\n\nDFE is the unit of measure for the labeling of folate in the Nutrition Facts label (SS 101.9(c)(8)(iv)) and the Supplement Facts label (SS 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)). In addition, when folic acid is added to conventional foods, folate must be declared as the percent DV folate based on mcg DFE, in addition to the quantitative amount of folic acid in mcg in parentheses (SS 101.9(c)(8)(vii)). Declaring the quantitative amount of folate in mcg DFE is optional. When folic acid is added to dietary supplements the quantitative amount of folate must be declared by weight in mcg DFE folate and the percent DV based on mcg DFE folate, in addition to the quantitative amount by weight of folic acid in parentheses (SSSS 101.36(b)(2) and 101.9(c)(8)(vii)).\n\nFurthermore, for the Supplement Facts label, synthetic forms of folate other than folic acid (such as calcium or glucosamine salts of L-5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (L-5-MTHF)) may be added.3 We do not intend to object to a manufacturer using its own established conversion factors for such forms of folate, provided that the declaration is truthful and not misleading. Furthermore, we would not expect a conversion factor for any synthetic form of folate to exceed 1.7 (comparable to folic acid), when reporting mcg DFE on the Supplement Facts label (81 FR 33742 at 33908-09).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nExamples of Conversion from Naturally Occurring Folate, Folic Acid, and Synthetic Folate to Dietary Folate Equivalents (DFE)\n\nCONVENTIONAL FOODS\n\nExample 1: A serving (85 g) of frozen spinach contains only naturally occurring folate (120 mcg)\n\nFolate Conversion to mcg DFE\n\nFolate (mcg DFE) = Naturally occurring folate (mcg per serving) (\\times) 1.0 (conversion factor for naturally occurring folate)\n\nFolate (mcg DFE) = 120 mcg (\\times) 1 = 120 mcg DFE\n\n% DV Calculation\n\n% DV = [Folate (mcg DFE) (\\div) 2016 RDI for folate (mcg DFE)] (\\times) 100\n\n% DV = (120 mcg DFE (\\div) 400 mcg DFE) (\\times) 100 = 30%\n\nLabel Declaration\n\nDeclaring naturally occurring folate on a conventional food label is voluntary. If a manufacturer wants to report naturally occurring folate, the label declaration must be as follows, except that declaring the quantitative amount for folate in ""mcg DFE"" (e.g., 120 mcg DFE) is optional (SS 101.9(c)(8)(ii) and (c)(8)(iv)):\n\nNutrition Facts\n\nFolate 120 mcg DFE\n\nExample 2: A serving (40 g) of ready-to-eat breakfast cereal contains only folic acid (200 mcg)\n\nFolate Conversion to mcg DFE\n\nFolate (mcg DFE) = Folic acid (mcg per serving) (\\times) 1.7 (conversion factor for folic acid)\n\nFolate (mcg DFE) = 200 mcg (\\times) 1.7 = 340 mcg DFE\n\n% DV Calculation\n\n% DV = [Folate (mcg DFE) (\\div) 2016 RDI for folate (mcg DFE)] (\\times) 100\n\n% DV = (340 mcg DFE (\\div) 400 mcg DFE) (\\times) 100 = 85%4\n\nLabel Declaration\n\nDeclaring folic acid on a conventional food label is mandatory when folic acid is added or when a claim is made about the nutrient (SS 101.9(c)(8)(iv) (footnote 6)). The label declaration must be as follows, except that declaring the quantitative amount for folate in ""mcg DFE"" (e.g., 340 mcg DFE) is optional (SS 101.9(c)(8)(ii) and (c)(8)(iv)):\n\nNutrition Facts\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c c|} \\hline\nFolate & 340 mcg DFE (200 mcg folic acid) & 90\\% \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Converting Units of Measure for Folate, Niacin, and Vitamins A, D, and E on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels'

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations on nonclinical approaches to support the clinical study and approval of fixed-dose combination products (FDCs), co-packaged products, and some adjunctive therapies.2 The intent of this guidance is to delineate general guiding principles. To receive more detailed advice regarding a particular drug or biologic combination development program, sponsors should contact the appropriate review division before submitting an investigational new drug application (IND). In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is in the process of publishing more specific guidance for certain categories of drug combinations.3Drug and biologic combinations may involve: (1) two or more previously marketed drugs or biologics4 (MD/Bs); (2) one or more new molecular entities (NMEs) and one or more previously marketed drugs or biologics; or (3) more than one NME. The nonclinical studies considered important for each type of combination may differ, depending upon the information available on each drug substance. The nonclinical studies that the FDA recommends sponsors use to characterize the combination will depend on the toxicologic and pharmacokinetic profiles of the individual drugs or biologics, the treatment indication or indications, and the intended population. The number and type of studies will depend on the stage of clinical development.\n\nFootnote 4: For purposes of this guidance, the phrase previously marketed drugs or biologics includes both drug/biologic products and active pharmaceutical ingredients.\n\nIn this guidance, each of the three general types of combinations (i.e., MD/B-MD/B, MD/B-NME, and NME-NME) will be discussed separately. This guidance covers combinations of drugs and biologics regulated by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). The ICH guidance for industry S6 Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals should also be consulted for nonclinical development of biologic products.5\n\nFootnote 5: We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the CDER guidance Web page at http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nNonclinical studies for a combination of two or more previously marketed drugs or biologics (figure A)\n\nThis section addresses the situation in which a sponsor submits an application to develop a combination of two or more previously marketed drugs or biologics or a combination of drugs and biologics. Generally the FDA believes that, in such a situation, sufficient clinical and nonclinical data will exist for each drug product separately. However, the indications for which each drug is marketed should be compared to those for which the combination is being proposed. For example, drug products marketed for acute use may not have nonclinical data to support chronic use. To the extent that there are gaps in the data, the FDA may recommend that additional nonclinical studies be conducted.6\n\nSafety Considerations\n\nIf existing clinical and nonclinical safety data for each separate drug or biologic are sufficient to support the safety of the proposed new indication, then the FDA recommends that the following factors relevant to the safety of the combination be considered to determine whether further nonclinical studies are warranted.\n\nInformation available on prior human experience with the combination. The FDA recommends that the sponsor provide a summary of the available data in humans (if any) on the use of the combination. The FDA also encourages the sponsor to provide copies of any relevant published studies in humans (or animals). Such reports may not provide definitive safety data, but they may provide some measure either of assurance or reasons for concern.\n\nInformation known about the individual drugs or biologics in animals and humans and concordance of pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and toxicologic effects in animals with the analogous data for humans.\n\nPossibility of a PD interaction. Drugs/biologics may exhibit affinity for the same receptors or biologic targets or may produce similar effects on physiologic function, related or not to their mechanism of action.\n\nPossibility of a PK interaction. A PK interaction can manifest in several ways, some of which can be monitored in vivo and some of which cannot. One drug/biologic product may alter the absorption or excretion of another product, change its distribution into one or more tissues, or change its pattern or rate of metabolism. Drugs may compete for serum protein binding, resulting in an increase in circulating free levels and tissue uptake of one drug.\n\nPossibility of a toxicologic interaction (i.e., that the target organs for toxicity are similar for each drug/biologic). This situation may result in a lowering of the previously determined no-effect doses for one or both drug/biologic products and more severe toxicities in the affected organs. The FDA will consider all known toxicology on the product (e.g., general toxicity, reproductive toxicity, carcinogenicity, and safety pharmacology studies (cardiovascular, central nervous system (CNS), respiratory)).\n\nMargin of safety for each drug/biologic product. If one or more of the drugs/biologics has a narrow margin of safety (i.e., causes serious toxicity at exposures close to the predicted clinical exposure), then the possibility of drug interaction is of particular concern, especially if the toxicity is not reversible or cannot be monitored clinically.\n\nPossibility that the drugs/biologics compete for or alter the activity or endogenous levels of the same enzymes or other intracellular molecules (e.g., co-administration of two pro-oxidants could deplete endogenous levels of glutathione).\n\nPossibility of a chemical interaction. One drug may chemically modify another drug or biologic (e.g., one drug may oxidize, methylate, or ethylate the other drug or biologic). This could result in NMEs with new toxicities.\n\nPossibility that one drug/biologic may compromise the effectiveness of another drug/biologic for a lifesaving therapy.\n\nNonclinical Study Recommendations/General Procedure\n\nIf existing clinical and nonclinical safety data for each separate drug or biologic are sufficient to support the safety of the proposed new indication, including the dose, dosing schedule, duration, and new patient population, then additional nonclinical studies may not be needed.\n\nThe general approach to addressing the safety concerns posed by the testing or marketing of combinations of previously marketed drugs or biologics is illustrated in Figure A. The safety of the combination should be assessed according to the factors listed in section II.A (see Figure A, Boxes 1 to 2). If neither individual drug or biologic product has serious toxicity at exposures well above the proposed clinical exposure or if there is substantial clinical experience with the combination, the FDA may recommend that additional nonclinical studies do not need to be conducted before testing in humans, during initial studies in humans, or at all (Boxes 2 to 3). The Agency\'s recommendation to conduct nonclinical studies for further development of the combination will depend on what is learned from initial studies in humans or what is known from prior human use of the combination.7 Footnote 7: For example, as previously mentioned, the draft HIV guidance discusses the FDA’s belief that certain antiretroviral therapies previously approved for the treatment of HIV may be approved for concomitant use without additional nonclinical (or clinical) studies, because the clinical safety and efficacy of concomitant use have been evaluated and described in product labels or peer-reviewed literature.\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonclinical Safety Evaluation of Drug or Biologic Combinations'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What do you mean by ""recognized antioxidant activity""?\n--------------------\nContext: (laboratory value / label value) x 100 = %\n\nIn order to evaluate the accuracy of nutrition label information against a standard for compliance purposes, FDA regulations define two nutrient classes (Class I and Class II) (2i CFR 101.9(g)(3)) and list a third group (Third Group) of nutrients (2i CFR 101.9(g)(5)). Class I nutrients are those added in fortified or fabricated foods. These nutrients are vitamins, minerals, protein, dietary fiber, or potassium. Class I nutrients must be present at 100% or more of the value declared on the label ; in other words, the nutrient content identified by the laboratory analysis must be at least equal to the label value. For example, if vitamin C is added in a fortified product and the label states that vitamin C is present at 10% Daily Value (DV), the laboratory value must equal at least 6 mg of vitamin C/serving (i.e., 10% of the 60 mg Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for vitamin C that is specified in 2i CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv)). The ratio between a laboratory finding of 4.8 mg vitamin C/serving (i.e., 8% DV) and the label value of 10% DV would be calculated as follows:\n\n(8% / 10%) x 100 = 80% or (4.8 mg / 6 mg) x 100 = 80%\n\nand the label value would not be in compliance.\n\nClass II nutrients are vitamins, minerals, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, other carbohydrate, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat, or potassium that occur naturally in a food product. Class II nutrients must be present at 80% or more of the value declared on the label. As an example: If vitamin C is a naturally occurring nutrient in a product, and the product declares 10% DV vitamin C (i.e., 6 mg/serving) on its label, then laboratory analysis must find at least 80% of the label value (80% of 6 mg or 4.8 mg vitamin C/serving) for the product to be in compliance.\n\nThe Third Group nutrients include calories, sugars, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. However, for products (e.g., fruit drinks, juices, and confectioneries) with a sugars content of 90 percent or more of total carbohydrate, to prevent labeling anomalies due in part to rounding, FDA treats total carbohydrate as a Third Group nutrient instead of a Class II nutrient. For foods with label declarations of Third Group nutrients, the ratio between the amount obtained by laboratory analysis and the amount declared on the product label in the Nutrition Facts panel must be 120% or less, i.e., the label is considered to be out of compliance if the nutrient content of a composite of the product is greater than 20% above the value declared on the label. For example, if a laboratory analysis found 8 g of total fat/serving in a product that started that it contained 6 g of total fat/serving, the ratio between the laboratory value and the label value would be (8 / 6) x 100 = 133%, and the product label would be considered to be out of compliance.\n\nReasonable excesses of class I and II nutrients above labeled amounts and reasonable deficiencies of the Third Group nutrients are usually considered acceptable by the agency within good manufacturing practices.\n\nWhy Submit a Data Base to FDA?\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(8), compliance with the provisions set forth in 2i CFR 101.9(g)(1) through (g)(6) may be provided by use of an FDA approved data base that has been developed following FDA guideline procedures and where food samples have been handled in accordance with current good manufacturing practice to prevent nutrient loss. An approval is granted when FDA has agreed to all aspects of the data base in writing or when a clear need is presented (e.g., raw produce and seafood). Approvals are granted for a limited time and will be eligible for renewal in the absence of significant changes in agricultural or industry practices. Guidance in the use of data bases may be found in this document, the FDA Nutrition Labeling Manual--a Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases.\n\nFDA published its policy concerning the review of data bases for use in the voluntary and mandatory nutrition labeling of foods in a final rule entitled ""Guidelines for the Voluntary Nutrition Labeling of Raw Fruits, Vegetables, and Fish"" in the Federal Register of August 16, 1996 (6i FR 42742). This policy is the most recent such statement of the policy made by the agency and will be referred to throughout the manual.\n\nFDA states that upon submission of a data base, ""firms are free...to begin use of the nutrient label values and to initiate the planned studies to collect and update nutrient values. During this interim period, FDA does not anticipate that it will take action against a product bearing label values included in a data base submitted to the agency for review. If any product is identified through FDA compliance activities as including label values that are out of compliance, contingent on the company\'s willingness to come into compliance, the agency intends to work with both the manufacturer and the data base developer to understand and correct the problem label values"" (6i FR 42742).\n\n23.8.25.2.317.31\n\nChapter II: How to Develop a Nutrition Labeling Data Base\n\nFDA recommends five general steps that industry may choose to follow in the development of a nutrition labeling data base:\n\ncharacterizing the product(s);\n\ndesigning a sampling plan;\n\ncollecting the sample units;\n\nanalyzing the laboratory test samples; and\n\nstatistically analyzing the data and interpreting the results.\n\nThis chapter will address each of the five steps. Each of the steps can be performed in several different ways, and decisions made regarding the alternatives may directly impact the available resources, data quality (error in a data set), and the statistically defined risk of making a correct decision. Please note that this manual is not intended to be a statistics book or a comprehensive sampling text. Data base developers may need to consult the scientific literature, and in some cases, a statistician or research analyst to obtain additional detailed information that is relevant to the data base(s) of interest, but that is not contained in this manual.\n\nThis chapter, with the examples and definitions that are given, should serve as a general guide for individuals needing a basic reference concerning some of the administrative and statistical considerations that are associated with the development of a data base.\n\n1 Characterizing the Product(s)\n\nIn characterizing the product, one should first determine the innate nutrient makeup of the product and obtain preliminary estimates of nutrient levels, nutrient variation, and the factors that could impact nutrient levels and variation. The first step in describing a product or products is to perform a literature search to determine if there are (1) existing nutrient data; (2) estimates that describe the market (production and sales); and, if appropriate, (3) information that describes the varieties (or species, if applicable); (4) the regions where the food is grown or raised; and (5) factors already studied and known to impact or not to impact nutrient levels. If the scientific literature and other sources reveal that a nutrient is known to be absent from the food or is present in negligible amounts (e.g., sugars and dietary fiber in seafood, cholesterol and saturated fat in produce), then the agency will not require testing for that nutrient, as long as the data base developer includes supporting documentation (58 FR 2079 at 2019, January 6, 1993).\n\nIf no information is available that adequately describes the food and its nutrients, the data base developer may choose to perform a pilot study to determine if certain factors do impact nutrient levels, to determine if there are regional differences in the nutrient levels, or to test for nutrient losses over time. In addition, the developer may choose to include other relevant factors of interest in a proposal to collect nutrient data for a data base study. For fruits and vegetables, variability may arise from seasonal and geographic influences associated with such factors as variety, location (e.g., soil type, climatic conditions); growing conditions (e.g., planting time, irrigation and fertilization practices, harvest maturity); product transport (e.g, packing, shipping, storage); and processing practices. For seafoods, the variability in nutrient levels may arise from such factors as species, dietary habits, processing practices, etc. For ""mixed products"", in addition to the factors that influence the variation in the nutrient levels in the product ingredients, processing factors associated with the formulation of the product ingredients into the ""mixed product"" may also influence the variation in the nutrient levels of the finished product. In some instances, if there is a great difference in nutrient values attributable to a particular factor (e.g., different nutrient values for different food types), a data base developer may determine that the foods are different and may even consider different nutrition labels for different food types.\n\nWhen a data base developer submits a proposal to FDA, it is important to include the results of any pilot or experimental study that was completed. One data base developer, for example, completed a number of experimental studies that determined differences in nutrient levels between/among several independent variables (e.g., variety of food (2 levels), site of sampling (production vs. retail), packing medium (brine vs. water), geographical region (5 levels), and age of product (5 levels)). FDA requests that the results of any experimental study that is submitted to the agency be included in statistical tables to better describe the type(s) of statistical test used, the sample size, and the exact probability levels that were used in drawing conclusions based on these results.\n\nIn determining the sampling plan (next section), existing nutrient data are extremely helpful in determining the number of samples to test.\n\n2 Designing a Sampling Plan\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases for Nutrition Labeling']","['""Generally recognized"" means that the scientific community has a consensus concerning the substance\'s relative activity as an antioxidant. Determination of ""recognized antioxidant activity"" should take into account the following factors, among others:\n\n(1) The present body of scientific knowledge;\n\n(2) Regulatory status for antioxidant ingredients and substances;\n\n(3) Safety considerations;\n\n(4) Common chemical assays used for determination of antioxidant activity;\n\n(5) Expert opinions on availability and efficacy of test methods for assessing antioxidant activity; and\n\n(6) The substance\'s biological and physiological familiarity and characteristics.\n\nThe standard for determining ""generally recognized"" is not dependent solely on favorable but inconclusive research that supports an ingredient\'s activity; nor is the standard satisfied by clinical studies alone. Rather, the substance must be shown to have this quality based on a wide range of scientific data and information.\n\nHere\'s an example of how ""recognized antioxidant activity"" might be determined: If the pertinent scientific data and information support a conclusion that an antioxidant nutrient, such as vitamin E, tends to prevent the oxidation of LDL cholesterol in humans, and a well-recognized assay measures that protective effect, then it may be concluded that vitamin E has recognized antioxidant activity. In addition, the wider body of scientific knowledge may need to be determined when more than one assay can be used, or when different substances are combined in a dietary supplement.\n\n21 CFR 101.54(g)(4)']",0.49999999995,0.8666666666666667

Footnote 4: FDA has interpreted the statutory term “product class” for purposes of determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period (see guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act, at Q&A II.2).\n\nHowever, an application for a biological product may not be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act if there is another biological product approved under section 351(a) of the PHS Act that could be a ""reference product""5 if such application were submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 5: The term “reference product” means the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in an application submitted under section 351(k) (see section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act (a ""deemed Biologics License Application (BLA)"") on March 23, 2020.\n\nIII Interpretation of the ""deemed to be a license"" provision\n\nFDA\'s Interpretation of Section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act is directed primarily to the submission of an application for a biological product during the transition period ending on March 23, 2020.6 Though the transition scheme described in section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act culminates with the ""deemed to be a license"" provision in section 7002(e)(4), the statute is silent regarding the process foraccomplishing the transition of approved new drug applications (NDAs) to deemed BLAs, or the implications of the deeming process on pending applications.7\n\nFootnote 7: In other legislation, Congress has described the implications of transitioning applications for drug products from one statutory scheme to another, while also describing the process that would be used in effecting the transition. See, e.g., section 107(c) of the Drug Amendments of 1962 (Pub. L. 87-781) (providing that all NDAs effective on the day immediately preceding the date of enactment of the Drug Amendments of 1962 shall be deemed approved as of the enactment date, and that the provision for withdrawal of approval of an application for lack of effectiveness generally would not apply to such deemed NDAs for a period of 2 years after the enactment date); section 125 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) (Pub. L. 105-115) (repealing section 507 of the FD&C Act and providing that an application for an antibiotic drug approved under section 507 of the FD&C Act on the day before enactment of FDAMA shall, on and after the date of enactment, be considered to be an NDA submitted and filed under section 505(b) and approved under section 505(c) or an ANDA filed and approved under 505(j)).\n\n2.1.1 FDA Interprets section 7002(e)(4) to be Limited to Approved Applications\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act provides:\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under such section 351 [of the PHS Act] on the date that is 10 years after the date of enactment of [the BPCI Act].\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) is explicitly limited to an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act. Moreover, while this provision explicitly provides that an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date, the statute does not provide a means for deeming an approved NDA to be an approved BLA prior to, or after, the transition date.8 Finally, section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act does not provide a basis for the Agency to treat approved NDAs for biological products as both NDAs and BLAs after such applications are deemed to be BLAs. Therefore, FDA interprets section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act to plainly mean that, on March 23, 2020, only approved NDAs will be deemed to be BLAs. After March 23, 2020, the Agency will not approve any application submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act for a biological product subject to the transition provision that is pending or tentatively approved.9({}^{,})10 As a corollary, applications for biological products approvedunder section 505 of the FD&C Act will no longer exist as NDAs and will be replaced by approved BLAs under section 351 of the PHS Act.11\n\nFootnote 11: See FDA’s draft guidance for industry The “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the BPCI Act: Questions and Answers (Transition Q&A Draft Guidance) for additional information, including whether an approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act will be deemed a license for the biological product under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act and administrative issues associated with the transition (including BLA numbers and user fee questions). When final, that guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nAccordingly, an original 505(b)(2) application (including a resubmission) for a biological product that relies, at least in part, on FDA\'s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug that is a biological product will receive a complete response if the application is pending at the end of the day (11:59 pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) on Friday, March 20, 2020, because the NDA for the listed drug relied upon will no longer exist at midnight on Monday, March 23, 2020.\n\nFDA intends to assist applicants who may be affected by section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act, where feasible and appropriate. For example, during the review of a BLA submitted after the transition date under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act for a proposed biological product that was previously submitted, but not approved, in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act, FDA intends to consider any previously conducted scientific review by the Agency of such previous application under the FD&C Act, to the extent that such review is relevant to, and consistent with, applicable requirements of section 351 of the PHS Act.\n\nAn application generally includes all amendments and supplements to the application.13 We recognize that there may be one or more supplements submitted to an approved NDA for a biological product before March 23, 2020, that is pending on March 23, 2020. Such supplements may include a prior approval supplement (e.g., an efficacy supplement,14 a labeling supplement,\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of ""product class"" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: B.: Applications for Biological Products Submitted Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act on or Before the Transition Date\n\nQ5.: When will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the application number that will be used for its deemed BLA?\n\nFDA intends to assign the same application number used for the approved NDA to the deemed BLA on the March 23, 2020, transition date. As a hypothetical example, NDA 012345 would be deemed to be BLA 012345 on the transition date. This approach is intended to minimize burden on holders of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act who are preparing submissions to their applications around the transition date and to facilitate the administrative conversion of any pending supplements to such applications (see the Transition Policy Final Guidance for additional information regarding such supplements). The use of a predictable application numbering system for deemed BLAs is also expected to facilitate preparation and submission of a 351(k) BLA for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeableproduct that references a product licensed in a deemed 351(a) BLA as a reference product. The FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date will include the product\'s BLA number.\n\nWhen will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the license number that will apply to its deemed BLA(s)?\n\nThe FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be an approved BLA will include the U.S. license number assigned to the application holder. Each establishment that is listed in the approved NDA as currently involved in the manufacture of the biological product on the transition date will be considered a licensed establishment on that date (see section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act; see also section 7002(e)(4)(B)(iii) of the BPCI Act). FDA does not intend to conduct pre-license inspections of manufacturers of the transitioning biological products because FDA interprets section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act to mean that an approved application under the FD&C Act for the biological product will be ""deemed to be a license"" on the transition date by operation of the statute.12 Moreover, the establishments will have been inspected in connection with the previously approved NDAs under the FD&C Act (see Q16 below for information on establishment inspections related to certain supplements to a deemed 351(a) BLA).\n\nFootnote 12: See also footnote 10 in the response to Q2.\n\nFDA issues only one U.S. license number per BLA holder, regardless of the number of licensed biological products manufactured by that BLA holder under separate BLAs. Accordingly, if an NDA holder is also a BLA holder and has been assigned a U.S. license number for another biological product, the NDA holder will not be issued a different U.S. license number when its approved NDA for a biological product is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date.\n\nSection 351(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the PHS Act requires that each package of a biological product is plainly marked with, among other things, the applicable license number of the manufacturer of the biological product in order for the biological product to be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce. To minimize possible disruption in the distribution of biological products in the United States and to minimize burden on holders of deemed BLAs, FDA intends to adopt a compliance policy for the labeling of biological products that are the subject of deemed BLAs (see Q14 and section IV below for additional information on the compliance policy for labeling of biological products in deemed BLAs).\n\nWill an approved NDA for a biological product be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA or a 351(k) BLA?\n\nFDA interprets the transition provision, along with the applicable provisions of the FD&C Act and the PHS Act, to mean that an approved NDA, including an application submitted through the pathway described by section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act (505(b)(2) application), will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA on the transition date.\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act is directed primarily to the submission of an application for a biological product during the transition period ending on March 23, 2020, and does not explicitly state whether an approved NDA will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA or a 351(k) BLA. The Agency\'s interpretation that an approved NDA submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA is based on the shared requirement that both types of applications contain full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (or, for a 351(a) BLA, safety, purity, and potency). We expect that the measures FDA has taken to minimize differences in the review and approval of products in marketing applications submitted under section 351(a) of the PHS Act and section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act will facilitate implementation of the statutory provision under which an approved NDA will be deemed to be a BLA.\n\nThe Agency\'s interpretation that an approved 505(b)(2) application will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA reflects the shared requirement that both types of applications contain full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (or, for a 351(a) BLA, safety, purity, and potency).13 This approach also reflects the Agency\'s view that it is more appropriate to regulate a biological product approved through the 505(b)(2) pathway that may be intended to differ in certain respects (e.g., different strength, dosage form, or route of administration or approved conditions of use) from a previously approved product under the statutory and regulatory framework for 351(a) BLAs, as such differences are not permitted under the statutory framework for 351(k) BLAs. Moreover, FDA\'s approval of a 505(b)(2) application reflects the Agency\'s evaluation of the data against a different statutory standard than a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: A 505(b)(2) application is an NDA that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use (e.g., FDA’s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug or published literature).\n\nWill an approved NDA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing be deemed to be a BLA?*\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) states that an ""approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the [FD&C Act]"" will be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date. Accordingly, FDA interprets the statute to mean that an approved NDA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing, but for which FDA has not withdrawn approval of the application, will be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date. The holder of an NDA for a discontinued product must comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for its application before the transition date, and after its application is deemed to be a BLA. These requirements include, for example, postmarketing reporting of adverse drug experiences and, if appropriate, the submission of proposed revisions to product labeling. If the holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing seeks to reintroduce the product to the market, the BLA holder should consult with the relevant FDA review division before submitting a supplement to the deemed BLA, to discuss any data and information that may be needed.\n\nHow will the transition on March 23, 2020, affect the annual program fee for an approved NDA for a biological product?\n\nUnder section 736(a)(2) of the FD&C Act, a person named as the applicant in a human drug application (which refers to an NDA or a 351(a) BLA, subject to applicable statutory exceptions) is assessed an annual prescription drug program fee. A prescription drug program fee is assessed each fiscal year for each prescription drug product identified in a human drug application approved as of October 1 of the fiscal year, with certain exceptions described by statute. For more information about the prescription drug program fee, consult the FDA guidance for industry Assessing User Fees Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017 (May 2018).\n\nIn general, sponsors of biological products for which annual prescription drug program fees are assessed prior to the transition, and that are deemed to be licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act on the transition date, will continue to be assessed prescription drug program fees for such products after the transition, subject to applicable statutory requirements and exceptions.\n\nIf an applicant withdraws an NDA that is tentatively approved on or before the transition date, or otherwise pending with FDA, and submits an application for the same product under section 351(a) of the PHS Act, will an additional PDUFA application fee be assessed?\n\nAn applicant (or the applicant\'s licensee, assignee, or successor) will not be charged a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) application fee for the submission of an application under section 351(a) of the PHS Act if all of the following circumstances are satisfied (see section 736(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act):\n\nThe applicant previously submitted an NDA for the same product and paid the associated PDUFA application fee for the NDA.\n\nThe NDA was accepted for filing. (Note that an NDA for a biological product will not be accepted for filing after the transition date.)\n\nThe NDA was not approved14 or was withdrawn (without a waiver).

For example, a pending ""stand-alone"" efficacy supplement to a ""stand-alone"" NDA16 (e.g., a supplement intended to address a post-approval requirement or post-approval commitment) will be administratively converted to a pending efficacy supplement to the corresponding deemed 351(a) BLA on the transition date and reviewed under applicable standards for 351(a) BLAs. Similarly, a pending CBE supplement to an application submitted under the FD&C Act will be administratively converted to a pending CBE supplement to the deemed BLA on the transition date, irrespective of whether the change described in the CBE supplement has been implemented before or after the transition date. The Agency also intends to maintain the same goal date, where applicable, for completion of its review of such supplements.\n\nFootnote 15: See generally 21 CFR 314.70.\n\nFootnote 16: See section III.B.1 of this guidance for information on “stand-alone” NDAs. There may be additional considerations for a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a stand-alone NDA and a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a 505(b)(2) application.\n\nii.2.2 Removal of Biological Products from the Orange Book on March 23, 2020\n\nFDA intends to remove biological products that have been approved in NDAs from FDA\'s Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book)17 on March 23, 2020, based on the Agency\'s position that these products are no longer ""listed drugs"" and such NDAs may not be relied upon by a 505(b)(2) applicant (or ANDA applicant) for approval. After March 23, 2020, FDA will not approve any NDA (or ANDA), including those that are pending or tentatively approved, for a biological product.\n\nFootnote 17: Biological products approved in NDAs that are deemed to be BLAs will be listed in FDA’s Lists of Licensed Biological Products with Reference Product Exclusivity and Biosimilarity or Interchangeability Evaluations (the Purple Book) on or shortly after the March 23, 2020, transition date.\n\nMoreover, with the exception of orphan drug exclusivity and pediatric exclusivity, the exclusivity provisions of the FD&C Act serve to limit the submission or approval of applications under section 505 of the FD&C Act, but not under section 351 of the PHS Act. Section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act provides that no applications for biological products may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act after the transition date. Accordingly, on March 23, 2020, any unexpired period of exclusivity associated with an approved NDA for a biological product subject to section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act (e.g., 5-year exclusivity or 3-year exclusivity) would\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]\n\ndeemed to be licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. Reference product exclusivity recognizes the fact that the sponsor of an eligible reference product generated (and submitted for review) the data and information required to obtain a license under section 351(a) of the PHS Act and limits competition from biosimilar and interchangeable products for a limited period of time. The biological products that will be deemed to have BLAs on the transition date, however, have already obtained marketing approval under a different statutory authority. Allowing such products to obtain a separate 12-year period of reference product exclusivity would inappropriately impede biosimilar or interchangeable product competition in several product classes.\n\nRecognizing these principles, FDA interprets section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act together with section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act such that section 351(k)(7)(A)-(B) of the PHS Act applies only to products that have undergone review and licensing under section 351(a), and not to biological products that will be deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act on the transition date. At the same time, FDA interprets the limitations on eligibility for reference product exclusivity in section 351(k)(7)(C) of the PHS Act to apply to any ""reference product,"" without regard to whether such product was ""first licensed under subsection (a)"" or instead deemed to be a license under section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act. Nothing in the BPCI Act suggests that Congress intended holders of deemed BLAs to be able to circumvent the statutory limitations on eligibility for a 12-year period of reference product exclusivity through subsequent submissions simply because the previous reference product was deemed to be licensed under section 7002(e). Therefore, FDA interprets section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act together with section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act such that section 351(k)(7)(C) will operate to bar supplements to deemed BLAs and, where applicable, subsequent BLAs from being eligible for their own periods of reference product exclusivity.\n\nRecommendations for Sponsors of Proposed Protein Products Intended for Submission in an Application Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act\n\nSponsors of development programs for proposed protein products should evaluate whether a planned submission under section 505 of the FD&C Act would allow adequate time for approval of the application prior to March 23, 2020, considering, among other things, whether the submission may require a second cycle of review and, for certain types of applications, whether unexpired patents or exclusivity may delay final approval. FDA\'s recommendations for sponsors are based on whether a ""stand-alone"" or abbreviated development program is planned.\n\n1.1 ""Stand-Alone"" New Drug Applications\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of ""product class"" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsors may request advice from FDA regarding proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product development programs that identify a biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as the intended reference product. A sponsor will be able to submit a 351(k) BLA that references the biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as its reference product after the NDA for the biological product is deemed to be a 351(a) BLA.\n\nQ19. Can an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a ""deemed"" 351(a) BLA seek a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act to another biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act?\n\nAny person (including an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a ""deemed"" 351(a) BLA) may seek to establish the biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product to another biological product licensed or deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. FDA intends to work with applicants to address scientific or regulatory issues that may arise in the context of these 351(k) development programs, and to provide additional procedural information. Any sponsor or applicant may contact the relevant review division within the Office of New Drugs in FDA\'s CDER to request advice on a 351(k) development program.\n\nD. Transition of Biological Products from the Orange Book to the Purple Book\n\nQ20. Will any therapeutic equivalence evaluations for biological products previously listed in the Orange Book be reflected in the Purple Book?\n\nNo, the Purple Book does not include therapeutic equivalence evaluations as reflected in the Orange Book. The Purple Book identifies, among other things, whether a biological product licensed under section 351(k) of the PHS Act has been determined by FDA to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product.\n\nE. Designation of Proper Name\n\nQ21. What will be the proper name for a biological product that has be en approved in an NDA that is deemed to be a BLA?\n\nThe (proper\\,name) is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)). FDA does not intend to apply the nonproprietary naming convention (in which the proper name is composed of a core name and a four-letter distinguishing suffix) to biological products that are the subject of an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act that is deemed to be a license under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. This is consistent with what was previously communicated in FDA\'s draft guidance for industry (Nonproprietary\\,Naming) of Biological Products: Update_ (March 2019).20\n\nIV Compliance Policy for Requirements Related to Labeling\n\nTo minimize possible disruption to the distribution of biological products that are the subject of the transition provision and to minimize burden on holders of deemed BLAs, FDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA with labeling that does not conform to certain labeling requirements for BLAs until March 23, 2025, provided that all other applicable labeling requirements are met. The compliance policy set forth in this guidance would apply only as described below.\n\nFDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA and that are introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce between March 23, 2020, and March 22, 2025, where the package is not marked with:\n\nThe proper name of the biological product contained in the package (provided that the current packaging is plainly marked with the established name of the biological product);\n\nThe name and address of the manufacturer of the biological product (provided that the current packaging is plainly marked with the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor as required in 21 CFR 201.1);\n\nThe applicable license number; or\n\nOther information required by 21 CFR 610.60 through 610.64, for which there is not a corresponding requirement under 21 CFR 201.1.\n\nFDA also generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA and that are introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce between March 23, 2020, and March 22, 2025, where the content and format of labeling required by 21 CFR 201.56, 201.57, 201.80, and/or 208.20, as applicable, does not include the following information:\n\nThe proper name of the biological product, including any appropriate descriptors (provided that the current labeling uses the established name of the biological product);\n\nThe name and address of the manufacturer of the biological product (provided that the current labeling includes the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor as required by 21 CFR 201.1);\n\nThe applicable license number; or\n\nFor biological products with approved labeling in the format described by 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57 (PLR format), the year of Initial U.S. Approval of the new biological product (provided that the current labeling includes the year of Initial U.S. Approval of the new molecular entity).\n\nFDA notes that the timing of BLA-specific revisions to the prescribing information should be coordinated with the corresponding revisions to the container labels, carton labeling, and any FDA-approved patient labeling for the biological product to ensure consistency among the different types of product labeling.\n\nIf the holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product has an administratively converted supplement that includes proposed revisions to product labeling or submits a supplement that includes proposed revisions to product labeling before March 22, 2025 (i.e., the end of the compliance period), and the required BLA-specific labeling revisions to container labels, carton labeling, and prescribing information referenced in this guidance have not already been addressed, such revisions would need to be addressed before the supplement could be approved (see, e.g., 21 CFR 610.60). A changes-being-effected (CBE-0) supplement may be submitted prior to submission of a prior approval supplement that includes the BLA-specific labeling revisions. However, the prior approval supplement would need to be approved before or concurrent with approval of the CBE-0 supplement. Under this approach, holders of deemed BLAs may coordinate BLA-specific labeling updates with their plans for other proposed revisions to product labeling.\n\nAfter FDA approval of a supplement for the BLA-specific labeling revisions, FDA understands that application holders may need to wait to implement these labeling revisions until their next printing of the labels and labeling. Accordingly, to enable such application holders to exhaust existing inventory, FDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA where FDA has already approved a supplement that includes the BLA-specific labeling revisions but the labels and labeling do not include the BLA-specific labeling revisions prior to March 22, 2025.\n--------------------\nContext title: The “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'

This guidance should be used as a companion to other guidances available from FDA that describe the CMC information appropriate for evaluation of protein products.7 We encourage early interaction with FDA to discuss specific CMC issues that may arise for a sponsor\'s proposed product.\n\nFootnote 7: For CMC requirements for submission of a marketing application, sponsors should consult current regulations and see the guidance for industry Submission on Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for a Therapeutic Recombinant DNA-Derived Product or a Monoclonal Antibody Product for In-vivo Use, as well as other applicable FDA guidance documents.\n\nIn addition to comparative analytical studies, an assessment of whether a proposed product is biosimilar to a reference product generally will include animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity) and a clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics).8\n\nFootnote 8: For a discussion of the Agency’s current thinking on animal and clinical studies relevant to demonstrating biosimilarity, see the guidance for industry Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product.\n\nThis guidance applies to applications submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. However, some scientific principles described in this guidance may be informative for the development of certain biological products under section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act.9 Section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act and section 351(k) of the PHS Act are two separate statutory schemes. This guidance is not intended to describe any relationship between the standards for approval under these schemes.\n\nFootnote 9: A 505(b)(2) application is an NDA that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the sponsor and for which the sponsor has not obtained a right of reference or use (e.g., the Agency’s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug or published literature). A 505(b)(2) application that seeks to rely on a listed drug (i.e., the reference product) must contain adequate data and information to demonstrate that the proposed product is sufficiently similar to the listed drug to justify reliance, in part, on FDA’s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for the listed drug. Any aspects of the proposed product that differ from the listed drug must be supported by adequate data and information to show that the differences do not affect the safety and effectiveness of the proposed product.\n\n4 General Principles\n\nAdvances in analytical sciences (both physicochemical and biological) enable some protein products to be characterized extensively in terms of their physicochemical and biological properties. These analytical procedures have improved the ability to identify and characterize not only the desired product but also product-related substances and product- and process-related impurities.10 Advances in manufacturing science and production methods, as well as advances in analytical sciences, may enhance the likelihood that a proposed product can be demonstrated to be highly similar to a reference product by better targeting the reference product\'s physiochemical and functional properties. In addition, advances in analytical sciences may enable detection and characterization of differences between the protein products. These differences should be further assessed to understand the impact on product performance.\n\nDespite improvements in analytical techniques, current analytical methodology may not be able to detect or characterize all relevant structural and functional differences between the two protein products. A thorough understanding of each analytical method\'s limitations will be critical to a sponsor\'s successful identification of residual uncertainties and, in turn, to the design of subsequent testing. In addition, there may be incomplete understanding of the relationship between a product\'s structural attributes and its clinical performance. Sponsors should use appropriate analytical methodology that has adequate sensitivity and specificity to detect and characterize differences between the proposed product and the reference product. Accordingly, FDA encourages the use of widely available state-of-the-art technology.\n\nIn addition to a complete CMC data submission as required under section 351(a) of the PHS Act, an application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act is required to include data supporting the analytical similarity of the proposed biosimilar product to the reference product. The rationale for the analytical similarity assessment should be clearly described with consideration for the known quality attributes and performance characteristics of the specific reference product.\n\nComparative analytical data provide the foundation for a biosimilar development program and can influence decisions about the type and amount of animal and clinical data needed to support a demonstration of biosimilarity. Such analytical data should be available early in product development and will permit more detailed discussion with the Agency because known quality attributes can be used to shape biosimilar development and justify certain development decisions. Thus, in addition to the preliminary comparative analytical similarity data that should be submitted to support an initial advisory meeting, FDA encourages sponsors to submit comprehensive analytical similarity data early in the development process: at the pre-IND stage; with the original IND submission; or with the submission of data from the initial clinical studies, such as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. FDA will best be able to provide meaningful input on the extent and scope of animal and additional clinical studies for a proposed biosimilar development program once the Agency has considered the analytical similarity data.\n\nExtensive, robust comparative physicochemical and functional studies (these may include biological assays, binding assays, and enzyme kinetics) should be performed to evaluate whether the proposed product and the reference product are highly similar. A meaningful assessment as to whether the proposed product is highly similar to the reference product depends on, among other things, the capabilities of available state-of-the-art analytical assays to assess, for example, the molecular weight of the protein, complexity of the protein (higher order structure and posttranslational modifications), degree of heterogeneity, functional properties, impurity profiles, and degradation profiles denoting stability. The capability of the methods used in these analytical assessments, as well as their limitations, should be described by the sponsor. Physicochemical and functional characterization studies should be sufficient to establish relevant quality attributes including those that define a product\'s identity, quantity, safety, purity, and potency. The product-related impurities, product-related substances, and process-related impurities should be identified, characterized as appropriate, quantified, and compared with multiple lots of the proposed product to multiple lots of the reference product, to the extent feasible and relevant, as part of an assessment of the potential impact on the safety, purity, and potency of the product.\n\nPrimary structure of some protein products can be highly heterogeneous, which could affect the expected clinical performance of a protein product. Protein heterogeneity may arise in a number of ways. Replication errors in the DNA encoding the protein sequence and amino acid misincorporation may occur during translation, although the level of these errors is typically low. In addition, most protein products undergo some posttranslational modification that can alter the functions of the protein by attaching other biochemical groups such as phosphate and various lipids and carbohydrates; by proteolytic cleavage following translation; by changing the chemical nature of an amino acid (e.g., formylation); or by many other mechanisms. Such modifications can result from intracellular activities during cell culture or by deliberate modification of the protein, for example, PEGylation. Other posttranslational modifications can be a consequence of manufacturing process operations; for example, glycation may occur with exposure of the product to reducing sugars. Also, storage conditions may be permissive for certain degradation pathways such as oxidation, deamidation, or aggregation. All of these product-related variants may alter the biological properties of the expressed recombinant protein. Therefore, identification and determination of the relative levels of these protein variants should be included in the comparative analytical characterization studies.\n--------------------\nContext title: Quality Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity of a Therapeutic Protein Product to a Reference Product Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of ""product class"" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 9: In the Federal Register of February 21, 2020, FDA issued a final rule that amends its regulation that defines “biological product” to incorporate changes made by the BPCI Act and the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, and to provide its interpretation of the statutory term “protein” (85 FR 10057). This rule is effective on March 23, 2020.\n\nThe prescription or over-the-counter status of a biological product with an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act will not change when the approved application is deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act on March 23, 2020.\n\nExamples of biological products approved under the FD&C Act are listed in the Appendix to the Transition Policy Final Guidance. To enhance transparency and facilitate planning for the transition date, FDA is posting on the FDA website (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/deemed-be-license-provision-bpci-act) a preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act (as of December 31, 2019) that will be affected by the transition provision, and FDA intends to periodically update the list before the transition date (see Q3 below). Shortly after the transition date, FDA intends to post a final list of approved applications under the FD&C Act that have been deemed to be licenses under the PHS Act.\n\nDoes the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA\'s list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n\nFDA interprets the transition provision to mean that the holder of an approved application for a biological product does not need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA. Specifically, FDA interprets section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act to mean that an approved application under the FD&C Act for a biological product will be ""deemed to be a license"" for the biological product on the transition date by operation of the statute.10\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe statute is silent regarding the process for accomplishing the transition of approved NDAs to deemed BLAs. FDA intends to send a letter to such application holders on March 23, 2020, advising that the approved NDA was deemed to be a BLA at 1200 am Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on March 23, 2020, and no longer exists as an NDA. (If the NDA is approved on March 23, 2020, the approved NDA will be deemed to be a BLA immediately after approval.) In the letter, FDA also will notify the application holder that it has been issued a license that authorizes the application holder to manufacture the biological product within the meaning of section 351 of the PHS Act and to introduce the biological product or deliver the biological product for introduction into interstate commerce (see Q6 below). The letter also will remind application holders that they will need to ensure that the listing information for the biological product is updated in FDA\'s electronic Drug Registration and Listing System (eDRLS) between March 23, 2020, and June 30, 2020, to reflect a change in the prefix of the application number (from ""NDA"" to ""BLA"") (see 21 CFR 207.57(b)). FDA notes that the deeming of an approved NDA to be a BLA and the corresponding update of the eDRLS listing information for the biological product to change the prefix for the application number will not result in the need for a new National Drug Code (NDC) number with a new product code. Accordingly, in the absence of other changes made by the application holder that would require a new NDC number, biological products approved under the FD&C Act will retain their current NDC number after the NDA is deemed to be a BLA. This will provide consistency for manufacturers and for the databases and pharmacy systems that track drug and biological products.\n\nTo enhance transparency and facilitate planning for the transition date, FDA is posting on the FDA website a preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act (as of December 31, 2019) that will be affected by the transition provision, and FDA intends to periodically update the list before the transition date (see Q1 above). Biological products approved in NDAs that are deemed to be BLAs will be removed from FDA\'s Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book) on March 23, 2020, and will be listed in FDA\'s Lists of Licensed Biological Products with Reference Product Exclusivity and Biosimilarity or Interchangeability Evaluations (the Purple Book) and the CDER Therapeutic Biologics Products list on or shortly after the March 23, 2020, transition date.\n\n2.2 Who should an application holder contact if it believes that its approved NDA should or should not be included on FDA\'s preliminary list of approved applications for biological products that will be affected by the transition provision?\n\nIf an application holder or other person reviews, on FDA\'s website, the preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act that will be affected by the transition provision and believes that an approved NDA should be added to the list or should not be included on the list, the application holder or other person should submit a comment to the public docket established for this guidance and the preliminary list. For information on submission of comments to the public docket, please refer to the Federal Register (FR) Notice of Availability of this guidance.\n\nQ4.: How will FDA notify the sponsor of a proposed biological product who seeks to obtain approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act that the planned application would need to be approved under the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2020?\n\nFDA provided notice to sponsors of proposed biological products intended for submission in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act that they will be affected by the transition provision through the Biosimilars Q&A Guidance, as well as through FDA\'s draft guidance for industry Implementation of the ""Deemed to be a License"" Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (March 2016) (Transition Policy Draft Guidance) and the Biosimilars Q&A Draft Guidance. In the Biosimilars Q&A Guidance, FDA initially stated its interpretation of the statutory term ""protein"" in the amended definition of ""biological product"" (see Q1 above and Biological Product Definition Final Rule). In the Transition Policy Final Guidance, FDA provides recommendations to sponsors of proposed protein products intended for submission in an application that may not receive final approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2020, to facilitate alignment of product development plans with FDA\'s interpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.11 FDA recommends that sponsors of development programs for proposed protein products evaluate whether a planned submission under section 505 of the FD&C Act would allow adequate time for approval of the application prior to March 23, 2020, considering, among other things, whether the submission may require a second cycle of review and, for certain types of applications, whether unexpired patents or exclusivity may delay final approval. If a sponsor is unsure whether its proposed product may receive approval under the FD&C Act by March 23, 2020, the sponsor should consider submitting a BLA under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act instead. For additional information, please see the Transition Policy Final Guidance.\n\nFootnote 11: After FDA issued the Transition Policy Final Guidance, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 was enacted. Section 607 of this Act amended section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act to provide that FDA will continue to review an application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act after March 23, 2020, so long as that application was submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act, is filed not later than March 23, 2019, and is not approved as of March 23, 2020. If such an application is approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act before October 1, 2022, it will be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act upon approval (see section 7002(e)(4)(B)(iii) and (vi) of the BPCI Act).\n\nB.: Applications for Biological Products Submitted Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act on or Before the Transition Date\n\nQ5.: When will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the application number that will be used for its deemed BLA?\n\nFDA intends to assign the same application number used for the approved NDA to the deemed BLA on the March 23, 2020, transition date. As a hypothetical example, NDA 012345 would be deemed to be BLA 012345 on the transition date. This approach is intended to minimize burden on holders of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act who are preparing submissions to their applications around the transition date and to facilitate the administrative conversion of any pending supplements to such applications (see the Transition Policy Final Guidance for additional information regarding such supplements). The use of a predictable application numbering system for deemed BLAs is also expected to facilitate preparation and submission of a 351(k) BLA for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeableproduct that references a product licensed in a deemed 351(a) BLA as a reference product. The FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date will include the product\'s BLA number.\n\nWhen will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the license number that will apply to its deemed BLA(s)?\n--------------------\nContext title: The “Deemed to be a License” Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry']","['For purposes of section 7002(e)(2) of the ACA, a proposed biological product will be considered to be in the same _product class_ as a protein product previously approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2010, if both products are homologous to the same gene-coded sequence (e.g., the INS gene for insulin and insulin glargine) with allowance for additional novel flanking sequences (including sequences from other genes).

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances , What information should be included in the application about a starting material that is a commercially available chemical? (5.14)\n--------------------\nContext: [5.7] ICH Q11 states that ""a commercially available chemical is usually one that is sold as a commodity in a pre-existing, non-pharmaceutical market in addition to its proposed use as starting material"". A definition of ""custom synthesised chemical"" was not provided in ICH Q11, but a custom synthesised chemical is generally understood to be one that is made specifically to a drug substance manufacturer\'s requirement, either in-house or externally, or available for purchase but where the only use is for pharmaceutical manufacture. The reference to ""non-pharmaceutical market"" in the ICH Q11 description of commercially available chemicals is intended to preclude purchased intermediates from being claimed as commercially available chemicals.\n\n[1]ICH Q11 makes an important distinction between commercially available chemicals and custom synthesised chemicals. An applicant generally need not justify the use of a commercially available chemical as a starting material, whereas a custom synthesised chemical proposed as a starting material should be justified in accordance with the ICH Q11 general principles. The availability of a chemical from multiple suppliers should not be the sole basis for the designation of a chemical as a commercially available starting material. This includes situations where a custom synthesized chemical has become available over time from multiple suppliers. Such chemicals should still be justified according to the ICH Q11 general principles for selection of starting materials. It can be acceptable for a starting material that is demonstrated to be a commercially available chemical to enter late in the synthesis, e.g., in the last chemical transformation prior to the drug substance. A chemical manufactured on a small scale can be suitable as a commercially available starting material, provided that the scale is sufficient for the manufacture of the drug substance and that the chemical is also used in a pre-existing, non-pharmaceutical market. In some cases, a chemical that does not meet the definition of a commercially available chemical (e.g., it does not have a non-pharmaceutical use) but is simple enough in structure may be accepted as a starting material (e.g., protected natural amino acids). However, in such cases, a rationale should be provided explaining why the starting material is considered appropriate (see Q&A 5.1) and why the proposed control strategy is appropriate to control impurities in the drug substance.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11_Q&As_Q&As'

This can include information on:\n\nThe ability of analytical procedures to detect impurities in the starting material;\n\nThe fate and purge of those impurities and their derivatives in subsequent processing steps;\n\nHow the proposed specification for each starting material will contribute to the control strategy.\n\nThe applicant should provide, as part of the justification, a flow diagram outlining the current synthetic route(s) for the manufacture of the drug substance, with the proposed starting materials clearly indicated. Changes to the starting material specification and to the synthetic route from the starting material to final drug substance are subject to regional, post-approval change requirements. In addition, regional requirements concerning starting material suppliers may also be applicable.\n\nAn applicant generally need not justify the use of a commercially available chemical as a starting material. A commercially available chemical is usually one that is sold as a commodity in a pre-existing, non-pharmaceutical market in addition to its proposed use as starting material. Chemicals produced by custom syntheses are not considered to be commercially available. If a chemical from a custom synthesis is proposed as a starting material, it should be justified in accordance with the general principles for the selection of starting materials outlined above in Section 5.1.1.\n\nIn some instances, additional purification steps by the drug substance manufacturer might be called for to ensure the consistent quality of a commercially available starting material. In these instances, the additional purification steps should be included as part of the description of the drug substance manufacturing process. Specifications should normally be provided for both incoming and purified starting material.\n\n5.2.2 Justification of Starting Material Selection for Semi-Synthetic Drug Substances\n\nIf an isolated intermediate is proposed as the starting material for a semi-synthetic drug substance, the applicant should provide a justification that explains how the proposed starting material complies with the general principles for the selection of starting materials outlined above in Section 5.1.1. Otherwise, the applicant should describe the manufacturing process starting from the microorganism or botanical material, as appropriate, and these materials should be qualified.\n\n5.2.3 Qualification of Source or Starting Materials for Biotechnological/Biological Drug Substances\n\nGuidance is contained in ICH Q5A, Q5B and Q5D.\n\n6 Control Strategy\n\nGeneral Principles\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11 Guideline'

The presence of a ""significant structural fragment"" should not be the sole basis for starting material selection.

(5.14)\n--------------------\nContext: No. The ICH Q11 general principles for selection of starting materials do not include a recommendation that all steps involving mutagenic reagents or impurities should be included in the process description in section 3.2.S.2.2. Similarly, the general principles do not include a recommendation that all steps that establish regio- or stereochemical configurations (which can therefore result in regio- or stereoisomerism) should be included in section 3.2.S.2.2. However, it is expected that the other ICH Q11 general principles on impurities (see Q&As 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9) and inclusion of enough of the manufacturing process (see Q&A 5.11) be applied when deciding whether steps that involve mutagenic reagents, impurities, or establish regio- or stereochemical configurations, need to be included. As an example, a mutagenic compound could be introduced prior to the starting material, or be the starting material itself, provided the ICH Q11 general principles are addressed.\n\nQ11. ICH Q11 states that ""enough of the drug substance manufacturing process should be described in the application..."" What considerations should an applicant apply in the selection of the proposed starting materials to assure that enough of the drug substance manufacturing process will be described in the process description in section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application? (5.11)\n\nIn deciding whether enough of the drug substance manufacturing process is described in section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application, the following considerations should be applied.\n\nThe applicant should first evaluate which chemical transformation steps in the manufacturing process impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. These steps should normally be included in section 3.2.S.2.2 (see Q&As 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9).\n\nNext, the applicant should examine the steps immediately upstream of those steps that impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. These steps should normally also be included in section 3.2.S.2.2 if:\n\nThey need to be carefully controlled (e.g., within narrow parameter ranges) to prevent generation of impurities that would otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance.\n\nThey include a unit operation that has been added to the manufacturing process to control specific impurities that would otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. While starting material manufacturing processes typically contain purification operations, addition of purification steps prior to a proposed starting material in order to avoid defining an earlier, upstream compound as the starting material would not be considered appropriate.\n\nAfter these considerations, if the evaluation would result in only a small number of chemical transformation steps, then it is generally appropriate to include one or more additional chemical transformation steps in section 3.2.S.2.2. This is to ensure that enough steps are conducted under GMP to appropriately mitigate risks associated with contamination and future changes to the synthetic route or supplier of the starting material. The following paragraphs provide further clarification on this risk mitigation and should be considered together.\n\nAlthough ICH Q11 does not specify how many steps should be performed under GMP, ICH Q11 recommends the inclusion of ""multiple chemical transformation steps"" in section 3.2.S.2.2 in order to reduce the risk of contamination and support the effective implementation of the control strategy throughout the product lifecycle. When there would be a small number of steps, there is an increased risk of contamination that needs to be addressed by the applicant in their starting material justification, and will often be best mitigated by including one or more additional steps in section 3.2.S.2.\n\nPotential risks from future changes to the starting material synthesis should also be considered (see Q&A 5.16). There is an increased risk that impurities generated as a result of a change to the manufacturing process upstream of the starting material may not be detected or purged appropriately if the starting material is only a small number of steps from the drug substance. In order to determine how many additional steps to include, the applicant may also consider other approaches to risk mitigation; for example, inclusion of analytical methodologies in the specification of the proposed starting material that are designed to detect a wide range of possible impurities based on different physical and chemical separation and detection principles. Appropriate acceptance criteria for unspecified impurities should be included in the specification.\n\nThe applicant should include in their justification of the proposed starting material a comprehensive description as to what factors were considered in deciding whether enough of the drug substance manufacturing process is provided in section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application to ensure that risks are appropriately mitigated.\n\nWhat considerations are important for a starting material specification? (5.12)\n\nApplicants should provide and justify a specification (which includes a list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and appropriate acceptance criteria) for all proposed starting materials as part of the drug substance control strategy.\n\nThe specification of a starting material should include tests for identity and purity (e.g., controls on impurities) and, where applicable, could include acceptance criteria for assay, specified, unspecified and total impurities, residual solvents, reagents, elemental impurities and mutagenic impurities. The analytical procedures used should be suitably validated. The tests and acceptance criteria should be based on process knowledge and the drug substance control strategy. The justification of the specification should include an evaluation of the risks and the ability of the subsequent steps to adequately control and/or purge impurities.\n\nFor starting materials that are not commercially available chemicals, what information should be provided on the synthetic route? (5.13)\n\nInformation on how the proposed starting material is made (e.g., a flow chart of the starting material manufacturing process, showing all reagents, catalysts and solvents used) should be provided to help justify the controls applied to the starting material. Information about the actual and potential impurities in the proposed starting material should be provided.\n\nWhat information should be included in the application about a starting material that is a commercially available chemical? (5.14)\n\nAn applicant generally need not justify the use of a commercially available chemical as a starting material (see ICH Q11 section 5.2.1). However, the applicant should provide basic information on the starting material (chemical name, chemical formula, and molecular weight), information on the impurity profile of the starting material, and how the control strategy for the drug substance manufacturing process justifies the starting material specification.\n\nIf the drug substance manufacturer needs to perform additional purification steps to ensure the consistent quality of a commercially available starting material, ICH Q11 also recommends that these steps should be included in section 3.2.S.2.2 as part of the drug substance manufacturing process.\n\nThe applicant should set appropriate controls and should justify the proposed specification for the actual and potential impurities that are reasonably expected in a proposed starting material, based on the scientific knowledge and available information.\n\nICH M7 states: ""For starting materials that are introduced late in the synthesis of the drug substance (and where the synthetic route of the starting material is known) the final steps of the starting material synthesis should be evaluated for potential mutagenic impurities."" In the case where the starting material is a commercially available chemical, then this evaluation would be used to determine the appropriate control strategy.\n\nFor all starting materials, applicants should set appropriate controls and be able to justify the proposed specifications.\n\nCan the Life cycle Management section of ICH Q11 (section 9) apply to starting materials? (5.15)\n\nYes. In addition to what is submitted in the application, changes upstream of the defined starting material should be managed under the applicant\'s Pharmaceutical Quality System (PQS), which should address residual risks to the drug substance quality.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe Lifecycle Management section of ICH Q11 reinforces management\'s responsibility described in Pharmaceutical Quality Systems (ICH Q10), which is applicable to starting material lifecycle management. ICH Q10 section 2.7 (Management of Outsourced Activities and Purchased Materials) recommends that\n\nThe pharmaceutical quality system, including the management responsibilities described in this section, extends to the control and review of any outsourced activities and quality of purchased materials. The pharmaceutical company is ultimately responsible to ensure processes are in place to assure the control of outsourced activities and quality of purchased materials.\n\nICH Q7 sections 7 (Materials Management) and 13 (Change Control), ICH Q7 Q&A document sections 7 and 13, as well as ICH Q10 section 2.7 (Management of Outsourced Activities and Purchased Materials) provide guidance that can be applied to the management of starting materials and starting material suppliers.\n\nICH Q9 and its Annexes provide guidance on the use of principles for quality risk management which can be applied to changes related to the starting materials (e.g., new starting material suppliers, manufacturing processes, or specifications).\n\nQ16. Does ICH Q11 include specific guidance for post-approval changes to steps upstream of the starting material (e.g., changes in synthetic route, reagents, solvents, starting material supplier)?

This applies to all dosage forms. If the size of the pilot scale batch does not follow ICH recommendations, the applicant should provide a justification. See also section C, question 20 for additional information regarding exceptions.\n\nQ7: How is the proposed shelf life supposed to be calculated? Will 6 months of accelerated data equal 24 months at long-term?\n\nA7: ICH Q1E principles will help in the calculation of shelf life. Data from the three ANDA submission batches (i.e., 6 months), accelerated data meeting all criteria (without significant change per ICH Q1A(R2)), and 12 months long-term data without variability will not need statistical evaluation, and with appropriate post approval stability commitments, can be used to support extrapolation to a 24 months shelf life.\n\nIf there is a significant change in the accelerated data, ICH Q1E, Appendix A, provides more details regarding when intermediate condition stability data are recommended.\n\nQ8: Will the recommendation for 6 months accelerated data be met by providing 24 weeks of data as 12 weeks is typically accepted as equivalent to 3 months?\n\nA8: No. FDA, following the recommendations of ICH stability guidances refers to timeframes in terms of months and not weeks.\n\nQ9: When a patent is due to shortly expire and there are no approved ANDAs, can we file with 3 months stability data with a commitment to supply 6 months data when available?\n\nA9: No. Data recommendations in the FDA stability guidance should be followed irrespective of patent status.\n\nQ10: How long do the three pilot scale batches, submitted as a part of an ANDA, need to be stored before destruction?\n\nA10: Sample storage times are discussed in 21 CFR 320.38 and 21 CFR 320.63 in connection with bioequivalence study samples. In general, ANDA submission batch samples should be stored for 1 year after approval of the ANDA, and samples of the drug product used for bioequivalence studies must be stored following the requirements listed in 21 CFR 320.38 and 21 CFR 320.63. In addition, the guidance for industry on Handling and Retention of BA and BE Testing Samples8 may be helpful regarding the procedure for handling reserve samples from relevant bioavailability and bioequivalence studies. Additional information on sample quantities (for retention purposes) is discussed in 21 CFR 211.170 (a) and (b), Reserve Samples.\n\nFootnote 8: See footnote 2.\n\nDrug Master File\n\nQ1: Please clarify the effect of the FDA stability guidance on Drug Master File (DMF) holders.\n\nQ1(i): How many months of long-term and accelerated data are required when a ""Completeness Assessment"" is performed on the DMF? Also, what should the DMF stability section contain for a Completeness Assessment?\n\nA1(i): To pass the Completeness Assessment, DMFs should include the stability protocol, commitments, and data demonstrating that stability studies have started. The initial and one additional time point for the accelerated studies and long-term studies are sufficient. If the DMF does not meet the recommendations under A1(ii) below at the time of the Completeness Assessment the DMF holder should amend the DMF with updated stability data to prepare for full scientific review.\n\nQ1(ii): Are stability data from three current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) batches required to be filed in the DMF to support the API retest date? Also, how many months of long-term and accelerated data are required for pilot scale batches?\n\nA1(ii): Yes. Per ICH Q1A(R2) data from formal stability studies should be provided on at least three primary batches9 and the batches should be manufactured to a minimum of pilot scale10 for the drug substance to be filed in the DMF. These batches should be made under CGMPs. The FDA stability guidance recommends 6 months of accelerated data and 6 months of long-term data for the pilot scale batches to be submitted for a full scientific review of the DMF. Additional long-term data for all three batches, as the data becomes available through the proposed retest period, should be submitted as an amendment.\n\nFootnote 9: “Primary batch” is defined in ICH Q1A(R2) Glossary.\n\nQ2: Will submissions to DMFs be accepted based on stability data from production scale batches?\n\nA2: Yes. Per ICH Q1A(R2), section II, A, 8, Stability Commitment (2.1.8), the submission is appropriate if satisfactory stability data from at least three production batches made under CGMP are filed in the DMF with 6 months of accelerated data and data for samples stored under long-term conditions that cover the proposed retest period.\n\nQ3: Should executed batch records for the three batches be included in the DMF submission?\n\nA3: One representative executed batch record will be sufficient.\n\nDrug Product Manufacturing and Packaging\n\nQ1: Can the split bulk solution filled into different fill volumes be considered discrete batches?\n\nA1: To be consistent with ICH Q1A(R2), we recommend that discrete finished product batches be produced that represent different batches of bulk solution. Split filling one batch of bulk solution into different fill volume sizes would not constitute discrete batches.\n\nQ2: Can you clarify the packaging recommendations for the submission batches for blow-fill-seal containers?\n\nA2: Blow-fill-seal containers are not an exception from regular packaging and are usually packaged inside a secondary container or a carton. The secondary packaging should be included in all three batches. ICH Q1A(R2) addresses secondary packaging usefulness (see section II, B, 4, Drug Product Container Closure System (2.2.4)).\n\nQ3: Should all three batches be stored in final proposed packaging?\n\nA3: Yes. You should package all three batches in the container closure system proposed for marketing. ICH Q1A(R2) addresses this question (see section II, B, 4, Drug Product Container Closure System (2.2.4)).\n\nQ4: What is the Agency\'s position on using different lots of APIs and/or packaging materials? How many API lots should be used in the manufacture of finished product lots used to support the ANDA?\n\nA4: It is not necessary to use different lots of packaging material, except in cases where the packaging material could affect drug product performance and/or delivery. A minimum of two lots of the drug substance should be used to prepare the three primary batches of drug product.11\n\nFootnote 11: For nasal aerosols and nasal sprays, you should use three different lots of drug substance.\n\nQ5: Should the small scale batches be packaged with commercial equipment? Also, is it acceptable to package using research equipment or by hand?\n\nA5: Yes. Small scale batches should be packaged with commercial equipment, or the packaging equipment should be similar to that proposed for use prior to market distribution. No, it is not recommended to package small scale batches using research equipment or by hand. Please refer to ICH Q1A(R2) section II, B, 3, Selection of Batches (2.2.3) and the glossary definition for primary batches.\n\nQ6: What will the recommendation for secondary packaging be?\n\nA6: We recommend following ICH Q1A(R2) section II, B, 4, Drug Product Container Closure System (2.2.4).\n\nQ7: What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n\nA7: Per ICH Q1A(R2) the applicant should provide data on three batches of all dosage forms including modified release dosage forms. ICH stability guidances do not distinguish among different dosage forms.\n\nQ8: What are the recommendations for the submission of oral solutions, ophthalmic solutions, oral and ophthalmic suspensions, transdermal patches, ointments, creams, granules for reconstitution, and paremetrals?\n\nA8: The applicant should provide three discrete batches and 6 months of accelerated data and 6 months of long-term data at the time of submission for all dosage forms. Also, refer to other questions and corresponding answers that specifically discuss other dosage forms included in this document (e.g., questions Q7, Q13).\n\nQ9: Are 6 months of stability data required on all three batches, or would one batch at 6 months and two lots at 3 months be acceptable?\n\nA9: Following ICH stability guidances, 6 months accelerated stability data on all three submission batches should be provided.\n\nQ10: Should the executed batch records for the three batches be included in the ANDA submission?\n\nA10: Yes.\n\nQ11: Does all relevant CMC batch information for the three stability batches need to be included in the application?\n\nA11: Yes. When more than one lot of API or excipients is used, the corresponding section in Module 3 should contain appropriate CMC information.\n\nQ12: If you are an applicant submitting an ANDA with two API sources, are you required to perform stability on three batches of drug product for each API source?\n--------------------\nContext title: ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products, Questions and Answers'

This discussion can be supported, if appropriate, by further testing on a single batch of the API for a period shorter than three months but with more frequent testing than usual. It is considered unnecessary to continue to test an API for the whole six months when a significant change has occurred within the first three months.\n\n2.1.7.3 Active pharmaceutical ingredients intended for storage in a freezer\n\nIn the rare case of any API of nonbiological origin being intended for storage in a freezer, the retest period or shelf life should be based on the long-term data obtained at the long-term storage condition.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: At the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of three time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g. 0, 3 and 6 months), from a six-month study is recommended. Where an expectation (based on development experience) exists that results from accelerated testing are likely to approach significant change criteria, testing should be increased either by adding samples at the final time point or by including a fourth time point in the study design.\n\nWhen testing at the intermediate storage condition is called for as a result of significant change at the accelerated storage condition, a minimum of four time points, including the initial and final time points (e.g. 0, 6, 9 and 12 months), from a 12-month study is recommended.\n\nThe initial date of storage should be considered t0 and stability time points should be defined as a date with respect to t0. For example, if t0 is 1 January 2020 then the one-month time point corresponds to either 1 February or 31 January 2020. For each time point, samples should be withdrawn and tested as per the protocol. Testing should be completed as soon as possible. Deviations from the protocol should be recorded and justified.\n\nReduced designs, i.e. matrixing or bracketing, where the testing frequency is reduced or certain factor combinations are not tested at all, can be applied if justified (refer to ICH Q1D).\n\nStorage conditions\n\nStability data must demonstrate stability of the medicinal product throughout its intended shelf life under the climatic conditions prevalent in the target countries. Merely applying the same requirements appropriate to other markets could potentially lead to substandard products if stability studies are conducted at the storage conditions for countries in Climatic Zone I/II when the products are supplied in countries in Climatic Zones III and IV.\n\nIn general an FPP should be evaluated under storage conditions with specified tolerances that test its thermal stability and, if applicable, its sensitivity to moisture or potential for solvent loss. The storage conditions and the lengths of studies chosen should be sufficient to cover storage, shipment and subsequent use with due regard to the climatic conditions in which the product is intended to be marketed.\n\nThe orientation of the product during storage, i.e. upright, on the side or inverted, as well as the rationale for the orientation, may need to be included in aprotocol where contact of the product with the closure system may be expected to affect the stability of the products contained (e.g. liquids and semisolids), or where there has been a change in the container-closure system.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1F_Stability_Guideline_WHO_2018'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: The protocol for an ongoing stability programme should extend to the end of the shelf-life period and should include, but not be limited to, the following parameters:\n\nnumber of batch(es) per strength and different batch sizes, if applicable. The batch size should be recorded, if batch sizes differ;\n\nrelevant physical, chemical, microbiological and biological test parameters with acceptance criteria or reference to the attached specifications;\n\nreference to test methods;\n\ndescription of the container-closure system(s);\n\ntesting frequency (generally at 6 months and annual time points is sufficient for ongoing studies);\n\ndescription of the conditions of storage (standardized conditions for long-term testing as described in these guidelines, and consistent with the product labelling, should be used); and\n\nother applicable parameters specific to the FPP.\n\nThe protocol for the ongoing stability programme can be different from that of the initial long-term stability study as submitted in the marketing authorization dossier provided that this is justified and documented in the protocol (for example, the frequency of testing as above, or when updating to meet revised recommendations).\n\nThe number of batches and frequency of testing should provide sufficient data to allow for trend analysis. Unless otherwise justified, at least one batch per year of product manufactured in every strength and every primary packaging type, if relevant, should be included in the stability programme (unless none is produced during that year). The principle of bracketing and matrixing designs may be applied if scientifically justified in the protocol (refer to ICH Q1D).\n\nIn certain situations additional batches should be included in the ongoing stability programme. For example, an ongoing stability study should be conducted after any significant change or significant deviation to the process or container-closure system. Any reworking, reprocessing or recovery operation should also be considered for inclusion. Refer to section 2.2.12 for further details.\n\nOOS results or significant atypical trends should be investigated. Any confirmed significant change or OOS result should be reported immediately to the relevant competent authorities. The possible impact on batches on the market should be considered in consultation with the relevant competent authorities.\n\nA summary of all the data generated, including any interim conclusions on the programme, should be written and maintained. This summary should be subjected to periodic review.\n\n3. Glossary\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1F_Stability_Guideline_WHO_2018'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: The data may show so little degradation and so little variability that it is apparent from looking at them that the requested retest period or shelf life will be granted. Under these circumstances it is normally unnecessary to go through the statistical analysis.\n\nOne approach for analysing the data on a quantitative attribute that is expected to change with time is to determine the time at which the 95% one-sided confidence limit for the mean curve intersects the acceptance criterion. If analysis shows that the batch-to-batch variability is small, it is advantageous to combine the data into one overall estimate. This can be done by first applying appropriate statistical tests (e.g. (P) values for level of significance of rejection of more than 0.25) to the slopes of the regression lines and zero time intercepts for the individual batches. If it is inappropriate to combine data from several batches, the overall retest period or shelf life should be based on the minimum time a batch can be expected to remain within acceptance criteria.\n\nThe nature of any degradation relationship will determine whether the data should be transformed for linear regression analysis. Usually the relationship can be represented by a linear, quadratic or cubic function on an arithmetic or logarithmic scale. As far as possible the choice of model should be justified by a physical and/or chemical rationale and should also take into account the amount of available data (parsimony principle to ensure a robust prediction). Statistical methods should be employed to test the goodness of fit of the data on all batches and combined batches (where appropriate) to the assumed degradation line or curve.\n\nLimited extrapolation of the long-term data from the long-term storage condition beyond the observed range to extend the retest period or shelf life can be undertaken if justified. This justification should be based on what is known about the mechanism of degradation, the results of testing under accelerated conditions, the goodness of fit of any mathematical model, batch size and existence of supporting stability data. However, this extrapolation assumes that the same degradation relationship will continue to apply beyond the observed data (please refer to ICH Q1E).\n\nAny evaluation should cover not only the assay but also the levels of degradation products and other stability-indicating attributes.\n\n2.1.10 Statements and labelling\n\nA storage statement should be established for display on the label based on the stability evaluation of the API. Where applicable, specific instructions should be provided, particularly for APIs that cannot tolerate freezing or excursions in temperature. Terms such as ""ambient conditions"" or ""room temperature"" should be avoided.\n\nThe recommended labelling statements for use when supported by the stability studies are provided in Appendix 2.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1F_Stability_Guideline_WHO_2018']","['If accelerated data show a significant change or failure of any attribute in one or more batches, an applicant should submit intermediate data for all three batches.

For instance, when calcium carbonate is used to provide calcium, calcium carbonate is an ""ingredient"" and calcium is a ""dietary ingredient."" The term ""ingredient"" also refers to substances such as binders, colors, excipients, fillers, flavors, and sweeteners.\n\nPublic Law 103-417, 60 Federal Register 67194 at 67199 (December 28, 1995)\n\n2. What is unique about the ingredient labeling of dietary supplements?Top 0Ingredients that are sources of dietary ingredients may be listed within the ""Supplement Facts"" panel, e.g., ""Calcium (as calcium carbonate)."" When ingredients are listed in this way, they do not have to be listed again in the ingredient statement (also called an ingredient list).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(d)\n\nDo I need an ingredient statement when all of my ingredients are listed in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel?\n\nNo. If you place all source ingredients in the ""Supplement Facts"" panel and you have no other ingredients, such as excipients or fillers, you do not need an ingredient statement.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(a)(1)\n\nHow must I identify the ingredient list?\n\nYou must precede the ingredient list by the word ""Ingredients,"" except that you must use the words ""Other Ingredients"" when you have identified some ingredients (i.e., as sources) within the nutrition label.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(g)\n\nWhere must I place the ingredient list on the label?\n\nWhen present, you must place the ingredient list on dietary supplements immediately below the nutrition label, or if there is insufficient space below the nutrition label, immediately contiguous and to the right of the nutrition label.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(g)\n\nWhat type size must I use for the ingredient list?\n\nYou must display this information prominently and conspicuously, but in no case may the types size be less that 1/16 inch in height as measured by the lower case ""0"", or its equivalent, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.105(h)(2).\n\n21 CFR 101.2(c), 21 CFR 101.15, and 21 CFR 101.105(h)(1) and (2)\n\nMust I list the ingredients in a specified order?\n\nYes. You must list the ingredients in descending order of predominance by weight. This means that the ingredient that weighs the most is first and the ingredient that weighs the least is last.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(a)\n\nHow must I declare spices, natural flavors, or artificial flavors?\n\nYou must declare these ingredients in ingredient lists by using either specific common or usual names or by using the declarations ""spice,"" ""natural flavor"" or ""artificial flavor,"" or any combination thereof.\n\n21 CFR 101.22(h)(1) and 21 CFR 101.4(a)(1)\n\nCan I indicate that a spice is also a coloring?\n\nTop 0Yes. Paprika, turmeric, saffron and other spices that are also colorings, may be declared either by name or the term ""spice and coloring."" For example, paprika may be listed as ""paprika"" or as ""spice and coloring.""\n\n21 CFR 101.22(a)(2)\n\n10. How must I declare artificial colors?\n\nIt depends on whether or not the artificial color is certified. List a certified color by its specific or abbreviated name, e.g., ""FD&C Red No. 40"" or ""Red 40.""\n\nA color that is not certified may be listed as an ""Artificial Color,"" ""Artificial Color\n\nAdded,"" ""Color Added,""or by its specific common or usual name.\n\n21 CFR 101.22(k)(1) and (k)(2)\n\n11. May I use ""and/or"" labeling for fats and oils?\n\nYes. When a blend of fats and/or oils is not the predominant ingredient of your product and you vary the makeup of the blend you may use ""and/or"" labeling or language such as:\n\nINGREDIENTS:...vegetable oil shortening (contains one or more of the following:\n\ncottonseed oil, palm oil, soybean oil).""\n\n21 CFR 101.4(b)(14)\n\n12. Do I need to list water?\n\nYes. You must identify the added water in the list of ingredients in descending order of\n\npredominance by weight. For example:\n\n""Ingredients: Cod liver oil, gelatin, water, and glycerin""\n\n21 CFR 101.4(a) and (c) and 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iv)\n\n13. How do I list a chemical preservative?\n\nYou must list the common or usual name of the preservative followed by a description\n\nthat explains its function e.g., ""preservative,"" ""to retard spoilage,"" ""a mold inhibitor,""\n\n""to help protect flavor,"" or ""to promote color retention.""\n\n21 CFR 101.22(j)\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter V.

A mineral;\n\nAn herb or other botanical;\n\nAn amino acid;\n\nA dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or\n\nA concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or a combination of any ingredient mentioned above. Further, dietary supplements are products intended for ingestion, are not represented for use as a conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or the diet, and are labeled as dietary supplements. The complete statutory definition is found in section 201(ff) of Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321).\n\nWhat label statements are required on the containers and packages of dietary supplements? Five statements are required: 1) the statement of identity (name of the dietary supplement), 2) the net quantity of contents statement (amount of the dietary supplement), 3) the nutrition labeling, 4) the ingredient list, and 5) the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor.\n\n21 CFR 101.3(a), 21 CFR 101.105(a), 21 CFR 101.36, 21 CFR 101.4(a)(1), and 21 CFR 101.5\n\nWhere do I place the required label statements? You must place all required label statements either on the front label panel (the principal display panel) or on the information panel (usually the label panel immediately to the right of the principal display panel, as seen by the consumer when facing the product), unless otherwise specified by regulation (i.e., exemptions).\n\n21 CFR 101.2(b) and (d), 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13) and (j)(17), 21 CFR 101.36(g), (i)(2) and (i) (5)\n\nWhat label statements must I place on the principal display panel? You must place the statement of identity and the net quantity of contents statement on the principal display panel. Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, you must place this information on each alternate principal display panel.\n\n21 CFR 101.1, 21 CFR 101.3(a) and 21 CFR 101.105(a)\n\nHow do I locate the principal display panel? The principal display panel of the label is the portion of the package that is most likely to be seen by the consumer at the time of display for retail purchase. Many containers are designed with two or more different surfaces that are suitable for use as the principal display panel. These are alternate principal display panels.\n\n6 What label statements must I place on the information panel?\n\nYou must place the ""Supplement Facts"" panel, the ingredient list, and the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor on the information panel if such information does not appear on the principal display panel, except that if space is insufficient, you may use the special provisions on the ""Supplement Facts"" panel in 21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(iii) and (i)(5). See questions 46 and 56 in Chapter IV for more details.\n\n7 Where is the information panel?\n\nThe information panel is located immediately to the right of the principal display panel as the product is displayed to the consumer. If this panel is not usable, due to package design and construction (e.g. folded flaps), the panel immediately contiguous and to the right of this part may be used for the information panel. The information panel may be any adjacent panel when the top of a container is the principal display panel.\n\n8 What name and address must I list on the label of my product?\n\nYou must list the street address if it is not listed in a current city directory or telephone book, the city or town, the state, and zip code. You may list the address of the principal place of business in lieu of the actual address.\n\n9 May I place intervening material on the information panel?\n\nNo. You may not place intervening material, which is defined as label information that is not required (e.g., UPC bar code), between label information that is required on the information panel.\n\nWhat type size, prominence and conspicuousness am I required to use on the principal display panel and the information panel?\n\nYou are required to use a print or type size that is prominent, conspicuous and easy to read. The letters must be at least one-sixteenth (1/16) inch in height based on the lower case letter ""o,"" and not be more than three times as high as they are wide, unless you petition for an exemption in accordance with 21 CFR 101.2(f). The lettering must contrast sufficiently (it does not need to be black and white) with the background so as to be easy to read. See Chapter IV for the type size requirements for the nutrition label.\n\nDo I need to specify the country of origin if my product, or the ingredients in my product, is not from the United States?\n\nYes. Unless excepted by law, the Tariff Act requires that every article of foreign origin (or its container) imported into the United States conspicuously indicate the English name of the country of origin of the article.\n\nSection 304, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 304)\n* 12.Who regulates the statement ""Made in the U. S. A.""? FDA does not have regulatory authority over such statements. The U.S. Customs Service regulates country of origin marking (i.e., ""Made in the U.S.A."") as authorized by the Tariff Act of 1930. Their website is www.customs.ustreas.gov.\n* 13.How do I obtain a UPC bar code? The UPC bar code may be obtained from the Uniform Code Council. Their website is www.uc-council.org. Click on the button that says ""I Need a UPC Bar Code.""\n* 14.Must expiration dating be included on the label of dietary supplements? No. However, a firm may include this information if it is supported by valid data demonstrating that it is not false or misleading.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter I.

A measurable amount is an amount that exceeds the amount that can be declared as ""zero"" in the nutrition label of conventional foods, as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(c). If present in a measurable amount, trans fat must be listed on a separate line underneath the listing of saturated fat by January 1, 2006.\n\nCalories from saturated fat and the amount of polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, sugar alcohol, and other carbohydrate may be declared, but they must be declared when a claim is made about them.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) (see 68 FR 41434 at 41505, July 11, 3003)\n\nMust I declare vitamins and minerals (other than vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron) listed in 21 CFR 101. 9(c)(8)(iv) and (c)(9)?\n\nNo. You are only required to declare them when they are added to the product for purposes of supplementation, or if you make a claim about them.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\n8 Am I required to list any other nutrients if I make a claim about them?\n\nYes. When you make a claim about calories from saturated fat, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated fat, sugar alcohol, monounsaturated fat, other carbohydrate, and soluble fiber, you must list that nutrient.\nYes. Dietary ingredients for which no daily values have been established must be listed by their common or usual names when they are present in a dietary supplement. They must be identified as having no Daily Values by use of a symbol in the column for ""% Daily Value"" that refers to the footnote ""Daily Value Not Established.""\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(F) and (b)(3)\n\nIf I use a magnesium salt as a binder, where must I declare it?\n\nYou must list the specific magnesium salt in the ingredient statement below the ""Supplement Facts"" panel, not in the ""Nutrition Facts"" panel.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended for conventional food and dietary supplement manufacturers. It provides questions and answers on topics related to compliance with our final rules issued on May 27, 2016, entitled ""Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels"" (81 FR 33742; the ""Nutrition Facts label final rule"") and ""Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments"" (81 FR 34000; the ""serving size final rule"") (codified at title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 101 (21 CFR part 101)). This guidance also discusses labeling of added sugars, as well as formatting for lines (e.g. thickness of lines) and leading (e.g. space between lines) in the examples of graphics used by FDA on the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nIn this guidance, ""you"" (or ""I"") refers to a manufacturer of conventional food or dietary supplements.\n\nII Background\n\nOn May 27, 2016, we published the Nutrition Facts label and the serving size final rules related to the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels, which amended our labeling regulations for foods to provide updated nutrition information to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices.\n\nBelow is a summary of the combined major provisions of the Nutrition Facts label final rule and serving size final rule.\n\nThe final rules revise the Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts labels by:\n\nRemoving the declaration of ""Calories from fat"";\n\nRequiring the declaration of the gram (g) amount of ""added sugars"" in a serving of a product, establishing a Daily Reference Value (DRV) for added sugars, and requiring the percent Daily Value (DV) declaration for added sugars;\n\nChanging ""Sugars"" to ""Total Sugars"" and requiring that ""Includes \'X\' g Added Sugars"" be indented and declared directly below ""Total Sugars"";\n\nUpdating the list of vitamins and minerals of public health significance;\n\nUpdating certain reference values used in the declaration of percent DVs of nutrients on the Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts labels;\n\nRevising the format of the Nutrition Facts labels to increase the prominence of the declaration of ""Calories"";\n\nRemoving the requirement for the footnote table listing the reference values for certain nutrients for 2,000 and 2,500 calorie diets;\n\nRequiring the maintenance of records to support the declarations of certain nutrients under specified circumstances;\n\nAmending the definition of a single-serving container;\n\nRequiring dual-column labeling for certain packages;\n\nAmending several reference amounts customarily consumed that are used by manufacturers to determine their label serving size; and * Establishing an effective date of July 26, 2016, and a compliance date of January 1, 2020, for manufacturers with more than $10 million in food sales (originally scheduled to be July 26, 2018) and January 1, 2021, for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales (originally scheduled to be July 26, 2019).2 Footnote 2: On October 2, 2017, FDA issued a proposed rule that would extend the compliance dates to January 1, 2020 (i.e., for manufacturers with more than $10 million in food sales) and January 1, 2021 (i.e., for manufacturers with less than $10 million in food sales) (82 FR 45753). We finalized the changes to the compliance date in the Federal Register of May 4, 2018 (83 FR 19619).\n\nIII. Questions and Answers on Compliance Issues\n\nMust the updated Nutrition or Supplement Facts label appear on all foods sold by the applicable compliance date? After publication of the final rule, we included a frequently asked question on our website asking ""When must the label be displayed on food packages?"" In our response, we stated that the revised labels were to be displayed on food products that are initially introduced into interstate commerce on or after the compliance date, and said we would address the issue further in guidance. We received a number of questions about products at various points in the distribution chain and whether the product would need to bear the new version of the Nutrition or Supplement Facts label. After further consideration, we are providing the following guidance. Products that are labeled (i.e., when the label is placed on the product) on or after the applicable compliance date must bear a nutrition label that meets our new nutrition labeling requirements in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36. Products that are labeled before the applicable compliance date do not need to be in compliance with the new labeling requirements, and therefore, do not need to bear the new nutrition label. We consider the date the food product was labeled for purposes of determining whether the product must bear a nutrition label that meets the new requirements. We would not consider the location of the food in the distribution chain to determine whether a food product must bear a nutrition label that meets our new nutrition labeling requirements. For example, the food product, whether labeled before or after the compliance date, may be at the manufacturing facility awaiting distribution, at a warehouse awaiting further distribution, in transit to the United States to be offered for import, or on the store shelf of a U.S. retail establishment. We do not object to the use of a sticker for providing a revised nutrition label that meets our new requirements in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 before new packaging is printed. The sticker label should not cover any other mandatory information and should adhere to the package during normal handling.\n\nWhen determining whether labels need to be in compliance with the new requirements, should the determination as to whether my company has $10 million or more in annual food sales be based on domestic food sales or total food sales, including international sales, and how many years of sales should I consider? To determine whether a company has $10 million or more in annual food sales, a firm can either take the smallest sales volume from the previous three years (e.g., 2013, 2014, and 2015), or alternately the firm can take the average of the previous three years sales volume. A firm\'s total (domestic plus international) food sales best reflects the firm\'s resources and, thus, ability to comply with the final rules by the applicable compliance date.\n\nAre there certain approved companies or nutrition databases that manufacturers can use to get the nutrition values for their products? FDA does not approve nutrition databases. However, the United States Department of Agriculture provides nutrition information for a number of foods, and there are also several commercially available nutrition databases you can use to determine nutrition values for your products.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals'

Can the term ""dietary supplement"" by itself be considered the statement of identity?\n\nYes. This term describes the basic nature of a dietary supplement and therefore is an ""appropriately descriptive term"" that can be used as the product\'s statement of identity. The statement of identity for a dietary supplement may therefore consist simply of the term ""dietary supplement,"" or ""dietary supplement"" may be part of a longer statement of identity (e.g., ""cod liver oil liquid dietary supplement""). In either case, the word ""dietary"" may be deleted and replaced by another appropriately descriptive term identifying the contents of the product, such as ""calcium supplement,"" ""herbal supplement"", or ""herbal supplement with vitamins.""\n\n21 CFR 101.3(g)\n\n4. Should I make the statement of identity stand out?\n\nYes. You must make the statement of identity one of the most important features on the principal display panel.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What is unique about the ingredient labeling of dietary supplements?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:1]\n\n101.54(f) and (g) and 21 CFR 101.60(c)(1)(iii)(A) concerning dietary supplement use of certain nutrient content claims. This regulation is binding and has the full force and effect of law. FDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. Questions and Answers\n\n1. High Potency Claims\n\nWhat is the definition of ""high potency?""\n\nThe regulation states that the term ""high potency"" may be used in a claim on the label or in labeling to describe individual vitamins or minerals that are present at 100 percent or more of the Reference Daily Intakes (RDI) per reference amount customarily consumed (21 CFR 101.54(f)(1)(i)). This means a supplement may be labeled as ""high potency"" for each nutrient(s) that is present at 100% of the RDI per serving.\n2. How should the label or labeling describe the nutrients that are the subject of the high potency claim? When the term ""high potency"" is used to describe individual vitamins or minerals in a product that contains other nutrients, then the label or labeling must clearly identify which specific vitamins or minerals are being described as ""high potency."" For example, ""Botanical X with high potency vitamin E."" (21 CFR 101.54(f)(1)(ii))\n3. Can I name an entire product ""high potency"" when not all ingredients are present at 100% or greater? The term ""high potency"" may be used on the label or in labeling of a multi-ingredient product to describe the product (as opposed to describing the level of individual ingredients) if the product contains 100 percent or more of the RDI for at least two-thirds of the vitamins and minerals that are listed in 21 CFR 101.9(c) (8)(iv) and that are present in the product at 2 percent or more of the RDI. For example, ""High potency multivitamin, multimineral dietary supplement tablets."" (21 CFR 101.54(f)(2))\n4. Do any other requirements apply to the use of the term ""High potency"" in foods? Yes. If the nutrient that is the subject of a high potency claims is added to a food that is not a dietary supplement, then that fortification must be in accordance with the policy on food fortification in 21 CFR 104.20 (21 CFR 101.54(f)(3)).\n\n2. Antioxidant nutrient content claims\n\nIs an antioxidant claim a nutrient content claim?Yes. A claim that describes the level of antioxidant nutrients present in a food is a nutrient content claim and may be used on the label or in the labeling of a food when the conditions of use in the regulation are met (21 CFR 101.54(g)).\n\nCan I make an antioxidant nutrient content claim for any ingredient in a food? No. An antioxidant nutrient content claim can only be made for nutrients for which there is an RDI established in 21 CFR 101.9 (21 CFR 101.54(g)(1)).\n\nDoes the claim apply to all nutrients listed in 21 CFR 101.9? No. The nutrient that is the subject of the claim must have recognized antioxidant activity. That is, there must be scientific evidence that after it is eaten and absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, the substance participates in physiological, biochemical, or cellular processes that inactivate free radicals or prevent free radical-initiated chemical reactions (21 CFR 101.54(g)(2)).\n\nHow much of the nutrient must be present in each serving in order to use the antioxidant nutrient content claim? The antioxidant nutrient must meet the requirements for nutrient content claims in 21 CFR 101.54(b), (c), or (e) for ""High"" claims, ""Good source"" claims, and ""More"" claims, respectively. For example, to use a ""high"" claim, the food would have to contain 20% or more of the Daily Reference Value (DRV) or RDI per serving. For a ""good source"" claim, the food would have to contain between 10-19% of the DRV or RDI per serving (21 CFR 101.54(g)(3)).\n\nWhat special requirements apply to an antioxidant nutrient content claim for beta-carotene? Beta-carotene may be the subject of an antioxidant claim when the level of vitamin A present as beta-carotene in the food using the claim is sufficient to qualify for the claim. For example, if the claim is ""good source of antioxidant beta-carotene,"" then at least 10% of the RDI for vitamin A must be present as beta-carotene per serving (21 CFR 101.54(g)(3)).\n\nDoes the label claim have to include the name of the nutrient that is an antioxidant, or can the claim simply say ""antioxidants?"" The names of the nutrients that are the antioxidants must appear in the claim. For example, ""high in antioxidant vitamins C and E."" Alternatively, when used as part of a nutrient content claim, the term ""antioxidant"" or ""antioxidants"" (such as ""high in antioxidants""), may be linked by a symbol (such as an asterisk) that refers to the same symbol that appears elsewhere on the same panel of a product label followed by the name or names of the nutrients with the recognized antioxidant activity. If this is done, the list of nutrients must appear in letters of a type size height no smaller than the larger of one half of the type size of the largest nutrient content claim or 1/16 inch (21 CFR 101.54(g)(4)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:4]\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Nutrient Content Claims Definition for “High Potency” and Definition for “Antioxidant” for Use in Nutrient Content Claims for Dietary Supplements and Conventional Foods']","['Ingredients that are sources of dietary ingredients may be listed within the ""Supplement Facts"" panel, e.g., ""Calcium (as calcium carbonate).""

Shipping/Delivery Arrangements\n\n27. Is a pedigree required if a manufacturer drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer (i.e., ships the product directly to the non-ADR\'s customer)?Yes. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50, the non-ADR seller must provide a pedigree to the purchaser.\n\nIs a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n\nYes. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50, the non-ADR seller must provide a pedigree to the purchaser.\n\nWhat is the status of third party logistics providers (TPLP or 3PLs) in the context of PDMA? For example, is a TPLP considered to be a distributor or contractor for the manufacturer for whom the TPLP works?\n\nBased on comments that FDA received from a TPLP, TPLPs typically act as distributors for manufacturers. Therefore, unless the TPLP has ADR status with the manufacturer (which should be posted on the manufacturer\'s website and reflected in a written contract), the TPLP would be required to provide a pedigree prior to each wholesale distribution. Because of the unique ongoing relationship between a TPLP and a manufacturer, most, if not all, TPLPs distributing prescription drugs on behalf of a manufacturer would be able to obtain ADR status from the manufacturer with which they are doing business. Therefore, the TPLP would be listed on any subsequent pedigree because the TPLP was involved in the prior sale, purchase, or trade of the prescription drug. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\n3 Inventory\n\nIs a pedigree required for products already in the supply chain as of December 1, 2006?\n\nIt depends. A pedigree would be required for prescription drug products that are sold, purchased, or traded by a non-ADR after December 1, 2006. In order to give wholesalers sufficient time to prepare and deplete stock that would require a pedigree after December 1, FDA provided 6 months\' notice that the stay would expire on December 1, 2006. However, FDA recognizes that there may be some situations where a wholesaler has prescription drugs in stock that were purchased while the wholesaler considered itself an ADR, yet the wholesaler clearly will not be an ADR for those drugs under 21 C.F.R. SS 202.3(u) after December 1, 2006. FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion until April 1, 2007 regarding the pedigree requirement for such drugs, provided that the wholesaler can furnish documentation that the drugs were purchased prior to December 1, 2006, and that it had purchased the same type of drugs from the manufacturer on at least two prior occasions in the previous 24 months. Bills of sale or invoices could be used for this documentation. Wholesalers that cannot meet this criteria with respect to their inventories will be expected to provide a pedigree for those drugs. FDA believes that the combination of the six month notice that the stay would expire, along with additional four months of enforcement discretion, as described above,provides the wholesalers described above with sufficient time to deplete their pre-December 1, 2006 inventories.\n\n31. If there are two products on a shelf in a pharmacy, with the same lot number, but one was purchased from an ADR and the other was not, how would the pharmacy know which product came from the ADR and which product came from the non-ADR?\n\nInventory control is a business process. FDA expects firms to be able to identify and differentiate drug products that have been obtained from different sources and maintain appropriate records in compliance with PDMA.\n\n32. Is a pedigree required for inventory acquired through a pharmacy acquisition, merger, or buyout?\n\nNo. The purchase of a pharmacy by another pharmacy would not be considered a wholesale distribution, provided that the drugs purchased by the second pharmacy are dispensed or distributed by that pharmacy in the normal practice of retail pharmacy. Therefore, no pedigree would be required. However, the sale, purchase, or trade of those drugs to another pharmacy or wholesale distributor would be considered a wholesale distribution and a pedigree must be provided if that other pharmacy or distributor is not an ADR. If pedigrees are part of the record for the inventory, they must be provided with the sale, purchase, or trade of the product and retained for the appropriate length of time, as required under 21 CFR SSSS203.50(b) and 203.60(d).\n\nH. Pedigrees\n\n33. What does ""date of each previous transaction"" refer to in 21 C.F.R.\n\nSS 203.50(a)(7)?\n\n""Date of each previous transaction"" refers to the date of each prior sale, purchase, or trade of the product. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nI. Electronic Pedigrees\n\n34. Will electronic pedigrees that conform to the EPCglobal electronic drug pedigree standards be considered PDMA-compliant? At the time of printing, these standards have not been officially adopted or recognized. Therefore, it is premature for FDA to comment on whether they comply with PDMA requirements.\n\n35. Can paper or electronic pedigrees be used?\n\nSection 203.60(a)(2) states that ""combinations of paper records and electronic records, electronic records and handwritten signatures executed on paper, or paper records and electronic signatures or handwritten signatures executed to electronic records, may be used to meet any of the record and signature requirements of the PDMA."" Both paper and electronic documents and signatures may be used to meet the pedigree requirement of the Act, provided that the requirements of 21 CFR SS 203.60 are met.\n\nIs RFID the only way to achieve an electronic pedigree?\n\nNo. The PDMA and existing regulations do not require any particular technology for pedigrees. Although FDA has stated on several occasions that RFID is the most promising means to achieve an electronic pedigree, electronic pedigree can also be accomplished using bar codes or other track and trace technologies.\n\nCompliance/Enforcement\n\nWhere should a report be sent if there are concerns regarding a pedigree that has been received?\n\nCriminal activity, possible fraud, diversion, counterfeiting, or any other suspicious activity associated with a pedigree should be reported to FDA\'s Office of Criminal Investigations at rxdrugcops@oci.fda.gov.\n\nWhat are some examples of issues that might raise questions about the pedigree?\n\nDrugs that are sold below market price\n\nUnexplained gaps in the pedigree\n\nUnexplained differences in ordered product vs. shipped product\n\nUnexplained, unexpected, or unusual changes in supplier chain\n\nUnusual variety of lot numbers relative to the size of the shipment\n\nMultiple, unknown wholesalers from various states listed on the pedigree\n\nIncomplete paperwork, invoices, or other materials that do not match pedigree\n\nPattern of discrepancies in ordered vs. shipped product\n\nDiscrepancies in or missing covert/overt anti-counterfeiting measures\n\nSupplier refuses to provide a wholesale license from the state licensing authority\n\nSupplier wants payment in cash only\n\nA non ADR refuses to provide pedigree documentation\n\nSupplier refuses to divulge source of the prescription drug\n\nIf a company says that it is an ADR and not required to provide a pedigree, yet the purchaser has reason to believe that the company is not an ADR, what should the purchaser do?\n\nIf a purchaser has reason to believe that the wholesaler is not an ADR, FDA recommends that the purchaser contact the manufacturer to determine whether the entity is an ADR for that product. This is an especially important action to take in those instances where unsolicited offers are received from unfamiliar companies that meet some of the above mentioned causes for concern. In addition, report any concerns as suggested in Question 38.\n\n40 Does the PDMA Compliance Policy Guide 160.900 apply to pharmacies and chain pharmacy warehouses?\n\nYes. CPG 160.900 relates to the PDMA pedigree requirements. Retail pharmacies and chain pharmacy warehouses are included in the definition of wholesale distributors at 21 CFR SS 203.3(dd) and are required to comply with the PDMA.

HHS 12.15.06\n\nA What is affected by the preliminary injunction?\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(a). The court order enjoins FDA from implementing 21 CFR SS 203.50(a). 21 CFR SS 203.50(a)(6), states that information regarding ""each prior transaction involving the drug, starting with the manufacture"" be included in the pedigree. However, while the preliminary injunction is in effect, pedigrees shall include information regarding prior transactions going back to the manufacturer or the last ADR that sold, purchased, or traded the prescription drugs. FDA encourages wholesalers to include information regarding each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer when that information is available.\n--------------------\nContext title: Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) Requirements- Questions and Answers'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: Does a chain pharmacy warehouse have to provide a pedigree for drugs that it sends to its retail outlets?\n\nNo. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.33(cc)(1), intra-company sales are excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution. FDA considers intra-company transfers, such as those from a chain pharmacy warehouse to its own retail outlets, to fall within the scope of an intra-company sale.\n\nDo pharmacies have to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the pedigree? If so, how should they do this?\n\nNo. Pharmacies do not have this express responsibility under the PDMA, but they are encouraged to perform due diligence in verifying the accuracy of the information and integrity of the source of the drug product.\n\nC Recordkeeping Requirements\n\nWhat are the recordkeeping requirements for pedigree recipients?\n\nPursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(b), the pedigree is subject to the record retention requirements in 21 CFR SS 203.60, and must be retained by all wholesale distributors involved in the distribution of the drug product, whether ADR or non-ADR, for 3 years.\n\nIf the pharmacy receiving the pedigree will not itself engage in further distribution of the product to persons other than a consumer or patient, then the pharmacy is not required to maintain that pedigree under 21 CFR SS 203.60. However, consistent with the spirit of the PDMA, FDA encourages pharmacies and other end users to retain the pedigree for 3 years. As a result, if there is any question about the source or history of the product, it can be traced back through the drug supply chain.\n\nIf an ADR obtains drugs from a non-ADR, is the ADR required to maintain the pedigree?\n\nYes. Although an ADR is not required to provide a pedigree, pursuant to 21 CFR SSS 203.50(b), and 203.60(d), an ADR is required to retain the pedigree for 3 years.\n\nPDMA Scope\n\nDoes PDMA apply to veterinary prescription drugs?\n\nNo. PDMA applies only to prescription drugs intended for use by man. However, FDA is aware that many human prescription drugs are sold to veterinarians. Given that the human drugs are subject to section 503(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,the pedigree requirements apply to them under section 503(e). Accordingly, wholesale distributors who are not ADRs must provide a pedigree prior to wholesale distribution of human prescription drugs to veterinarians.\n\nIs a pedigree required for the distribution of drug samples?\n\nNo. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(7), the distribution of drug samples by manufacturers and authorized distributor\'s representatives is exempt from the definition of wholesale distribution, so the pedigree requirement does not apply. However, those distributing drug samples must comply with the separate requirements set forth in 21 USC SSS 353(c) and (d) and 21 CFR Part 203..\n\nIs a pedigree required for medical kits that contain prescription drugs, sometimes referred to as convenience kits?\n\nYes. ""Medical kits"" that contain devices and prescription drugs are combination products under 21 CFR SS3.2(e)(2), which are defined as ""two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of a drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products."" The ""medical kits"" referred to in the question consist of separable finished devices and drugs that are combined in a kit for ready availability and use together in a medical setting. The drug product in the kit retains its separate form and individual packaging. Although these kits may be assigned to FDA\'s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) as the lead Center for regulatory review when the primary mode of action of the kit is attributable to its device component, regulations for the drug and the device components continue to apply. Because a prescription drug component of a convenience kit is separable, and in the same form as when distributed independently, it is subject to the same pedigree requirements as when it is independently distributed. The pedigree must contain the drug\'s lot or control number(s), pursuant to 21 CFR SS203.50(a). We recognize that the convenience kit itself may have a lot or control number that is different than that on the prescription drug component. The outer container of the kit should also list the lot or control number of the prescription drug component so that the integrity of the kit\'s seal would not have to be compromised to confirm that the drug\'s lot number is the same as that listed in the pedigree. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nDoes PDMA apply to bulk drug substances?\n\nYes. The PDMA applies to drugs subject to SS 503(b) of the Act (i.e., prescription drugs). Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.1, the requirements in 21 CFR Part 203 apply to wholesale distribution of bulk drug substances.\n\nReturns\n\nIs a pedigree required for prescription drugs that are returned from a pharmacy or a physician\'s office to a wholesaler?Pursuant to the definition of wholesale distribution and other relevant provisions under SS 503(e) of the Act and 21 CFR Part 203, a pedigree is required for returns from a pharmacy or physician\'s office to a wholesaler unless that pharmacy or physician\'s office is an ADR for those prescription drugs. Prescription drugs generally are returned for two reasons: (1) the pharmacy or physician\'s office ordered too much and returns the drug to the wholesaler or manufacturer from whom they purchased the drugs, or (2) the drug is expired or close to expiring, in which case the product is returned to the wholesaler or manufacturer from which it was purchased, or to a reverse distributor for destruction. Pharmacies and physicians\' offices generally are not ADRs, and they would find it extremely difficult to provide a pedigree when they return prescription drugs because they would not have received a pedigree if the drugs were purchased from an ADR.\n\nFDA recognizes the disruption that this could cause to the more than 55,000 pharmacies and the hundreds of thousand physicians\' offices in the United States. Therefore, FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion to allow pharmacies and physicians\' offices to return drugs that are expired, damaged, recalled, or in some other non-saleable condition, without having to provide a pedigree, provided that (1) they return the drugs to the wholesaler or manufacturer from which they purchased the drugs, or to a licensed reverse distributor for destruction, and (2) they maintain for a period of three years records that document each return and the source from which the pharmacy or physician\'s office originally purchased the drugs. If the returned prescription drugs are in saleable condition and may subsequently be sold, purchased, or traded by the wholesaler or reverse distributor, then that wholesaler or reverse distributor would be required and expected to pass a pedigree if they are not an ADR for those prescription drugs. Any subsequent pedigree should reflect that the drugs were sold, purchased, or traded to the pharmacy or physician\'s office and subsequently returned. Because the wholesaler to which the drugs are returned originally sold them to the pharmacy or physician\'s office, the wholesaler would have all the necessary information to provide a pedigree, even without the pedigree from the pharmacy or physician\'s office.\n\nFDA intends to monitor the drug distribution system for abuses or exploitation of this exercise of enforcement discretion.\n\nWe note that pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(9), returns by hospitals, health care entities, and charitable institutions are excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution, provided that the returns comply with 21 CFR SS 203.23.\n\nF. Shipping/Delivery Arrangements\n\n27. Is a pedigree required if a manufacturer drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer (i.e., ships the product directly to the non-ADR\'s customer)?Yes. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50, the non-ADR seller must provide a pedigree to the purchaser.\n\nIs a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n\nYes. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50, the non-ADR seller must provide a pedigree to the purchaser.\n\nWhat is the status of third party logistics providers (TPLP or 3PLs) in the context of PDMA? For example, is a TPLP considered to be a distributor or contractor for the manufacturer for whom the TPLP works?\n\nBased on comments that FDA received from a TPLP, TPLPs typically act as distributors for manufacturers. Therefore, unless the TPLP has ADR status with the manufacturer (which should be posted on the manufacturer\'s website and reflected in a written contract), the TPLP would be required to provide a pedigree prior to each wholesale distribution. Because of the unique ongoing relationship between a TPLP and a manufacturer, most, if not all, TPLPs distributing prescription drugs on behalf of a manufacturer would be able to obtain ADR status from the manufacturer with which they are doing business.

HHS 12.15.06\n\nA What is affected by the preliminary injunction?\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(a). The court order enjoins FDA from implementing 21 CFR SS 203.50(a). 21 CFR SS 203.50(a)(6), states that information regarding ""each prior transaction involving the drug, starting with the manufacture"" be included in the pedigree. However, while the preliminary injunction is in effect, pedigrees shall include information regarding prior transactions going back to the manufacturer or the last ADR that sold, purchased, or traded the prescription drugs. FDA encourages wholesalers to include information regarding each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer when that information is available.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(a)(1)-(5). The court order also enjoins FDA from implementing the language in 21 CFR SS 203.50 that requires pedigrees to include lot and control numbers, dosage, container size, and number of containers. As described in more detail below, however, the preliminary injunction does not affect the statutory requirement that pedigrees contain the dates of all listed transactions and the names and addresses of all parties involved in those transactions. In addition, since the court did not enjoin implementation of 21 CFR SS 203.3(u), a written agreement between a manufacturer and a wholesaler may limit ADR status to a particular lot number(s), dosage, or the number or size of the containers of prescription drugs. We also note that, without the lot number on the pedigree, it would be extremely difficult to track the inventory that matches the pedigree if the inventory is further sold, purchased or traded. Therefore, FDA recommends that the lot or control number, dosage, and the number and size of the prescription drug containers be included on the pedigree even though it is not required while the preliminary injunction is in effect.\n\nPedigrees for all current and future inventory are affected by the preliminary injunction as long is it remains in effect.\n\nB What is not affected by the preliminary injunction?\n\nPedigrees still must be passed by non-authorized distributors of record (non-ADR) prior to each wholesale distribution. In addition, the court does not mention other pedigree-related regulations or other agency-issued documents relating to the pedigree requirement. Accordingly, those regulations and documents, some of which are described below, are not affected by the preliminary injunction.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.3(u). This regulation, which went into effect on December 1, 2006, defines ""ongoing relationship"" for the purposes of determining who qualifies as an authorized distributor of record (ADR.) As of December 1, 2006, only thosewholesale distributors who have an ongoing relationship (including a written agreement) with the manufacturer, as that term is defined by this regulation, are exempt from the pedigree requirement.\n\nCompliance Policy Guide (CPG) 160.900, which issued in November 2006, remains in effect until December 1, 2007. The CPG describes how FDA intends to prioritize its enforcement efforts regarding the pedigree requirements in the first year after the effective date of 21 CFR SSS 203.3(u) and 203.50. However, FDA will not enforce 203.50(a) as long as the preliminary injunction remains in effect.\n\nAll other definitions in 21 CFR Part 203 that relate to the pedigree requirement, including but not limited to, the definitions of manufacturer and wholesale distribution, have been in effect since December 2000 and remain in effect despite the injunction.\n\nThe names and addresses of all parties to the transaction and the date of the transactions are required by the statute and must be included in the pedigree.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(b). This regulation, which went into effect on December 1, 2006, requires all wholesale distributors (both ADRs and non-ADRs) involved in the distribution of a prescription drug to retain a copy of the pedigree for three years. Accordingly, all wholesale distributors that provide or receive pedigrees after December 1, 2006, must retain copies of the pedigrees for three years.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(c). This regulation, which also went into effect on December 1, 2006, provides that a manufacturer that subjects a drug to additional manufacturing processes is not required to provide a pedigree identifying previous sales of the drug or its components.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(d). This regulation also went into effect on December 1, 2006, and requires manufacturers to maintain a current written list of all ADRs, to specify whether each ADR is authorized to distribute all of the manufacturer\'s drug products or only particular products, to update its list of ADRs on a continuing basis, and to make its list of ADRs available for public inspection or copying. Accordingly, as of December 1, 2006, all manufacturers should have available for public inspection a current list of ADRs that indicates which drug products the ADR is authorized to distribute.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.60. This regulation sets forth certain requirements with respect to the use of electronic records and signatures, record retention, and the availability of records for review and reproduction by FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory and law enforcement officials. This regulation has been in effect since December 2000 and remains in effect despite the injunction.\n\nC Since the court\'s order only applies to 21 CFR SS 203.50(a), does this mean that the statutory requirement that non-ADRs provide pedigrees that include ""each prior sale, purchase, or trade"" of the drugs is still in effect?\n\nYes. The court order does not enjoin FDA from enforcing the statute. The court order affects only the regulations at 21 CFR SS 203.50(a). It has been FDA\'s longstanding position, consistent with the language of the PDMA and its legislative history, that, 21 CFR SS 203.50 notwithstanding, the statute itself requires non-ADRs to provide pedigrees that documents each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer. FDA recognizes, however, that confusion regarding the pedigree requirement could cause disruptions or delays in the nation\'s drug distribution system. Accordingly, as long as the court order remains in effect, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, as described below. To this end, FDA does not intend to enforce the statute insofar as it requires pedigrees to contain information regarding each transaction going back to the manufacturer. Rather, FDA intends to permit non-ADRs to provide pedigrees that include information regarding transactions going back to the manufacturer or the last ADR that handled the prescription drugs. FDA, however, encourages all wholesalers to provide complete pedigrees documenting each prior transaction involving the prescription drug when that information is available.\n\nAppendix D How will FDA apply the court\'s order outside of the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) and to wholesale distributors that are not plaintiffs in the lawsuit?\n\nFDA believes that limiting application of the preliminary injunction to either the named plaintiffs or the EDNY could lead to confusion and possible disruptions or delays in the nation\'s drug distribution system and could provide undue advantage to certain wholesale distributors. Accordingly, to the extent that it could be argued that the injunction should be limited in scope, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion in a manner that is consistent with the court\'s opinion. To this end, as long as the court\'s order is in effect, FDA does not intend to initiate any enforcement actions against any wholesalers solely for (1) failing to include lot numbers, dosage, container size, or number of containers on a pedigree; or (2) failing to provide a pedigree that goes back to the manufacturer so long as the pedigree otherwise identifies the last authorized distributor of record that handled the drugs.\n\nAppendix E How does the court\'s order impact what FDA said in the Guidance to Industry: PDMA Pedigree Requirements - Questions and Answers (http://www.fda.gov/cder/regulatory/PDMA/PDMA_qa.pdf)?\n\nTo the extent that Questions 2, 9, 10, 11, 14, 24, 29, and 33 refer to 21 CFR SS 203.50(a), as long as the preliminary injunction is in effect, such references are limited to the scope of the court\'s order. For example, if the question states that a pedigree include information about each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer, then the answer would be limited to including information going back to the manufacturer or the last ADR that handled the drugs.\n--------------------\nContext title: Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) Requirements- Questions and Answers'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: Is placing the list of ADRs on the manufacturer\'s web site adequate to meet the provision of making the list available on request to the public, pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(d)?\n\nYes. We highly encourage manufacturers to post their ADR list on their website in a place and manner that is readily accessible, although they are not required to do so. We note that 21 CFR SS 203.50(d) requires the list to be maintained at the manufacturer\'s corporate offices even when the list is posted on a website.\n\n8 Where can a pharmacist find the list of ADRs?\n\nPursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(d)(3), manufacturers are required to make their list of ADRs available to the public upon request. However, we recognize that it may be time consuming to get this information from manufacturers\' corporate offices. Therefore, we highly encourage manufacturers to post it on their website in a place and manner that is readily accessible. FDA will monitor the accessibility of these lists and determine whether further measures are needed to make this information more readily available to pharmacies.\n\nWhat information does a manufacturer have to provide to a wholesaler to enable that wholesaler to comply with the PDMA?\n\nManufacturers are not required under the PDMA to provide any specific information to wholesale customers. However, the information required under 21 CFR SS 203.50(a) for a pedigree statement may be included in the invoice or similar document that would typically accompany or be associated with any shipment of prescription drug products from a manufacturer to a wholesale distributor. FDA encourages manufacturers to do their part to protect public health by furnishing pedigree information to all of their supply chain partners. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nWhat information does an ADR have to provide to a non-ADR to enable that non-ADR to comply with the PDMA (e.g., to pass a pedigree that lists all prior transactions back to the manufacturer)?\n\nADRs are not required to provide a pedigree, whether they obtained the drug directly from a manufacturer, from an ADR, or from a non-ADR. However, to further advance the shared goals of protecting the public health, FDA encourages all parties in the prescription drug supply chain to cooperate fully by providing pedigrees and information to trading partners for each sale, transfer, or trade of prescription drugs. Therefore, when an ADR sells prescription drugs to another ADR or to a non-ADR, the ADR is encouraged to provide pedigree information obtained at the time of the original purchase of the prescription drugs to its wholesale customers. Each wholesale customer of that ADR, in turn, could then provide updated pedigree information with each successive wholesale distribution. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nIf a wholesaler has ADR status for a particular drug product, but it buys that drug from a non-ADR, is the wholesaler still an ADR for that specific quantity of drugs?\n\nYes. If the specific quantity of drugs purchased from the non-ADR falls within the description contained in the written agreement between that purchasing ADR and the manufacturer, then that purchasing wholesaler would have ADR status for that specific quantity of drugs. However, even though the ADR is not required to provide the pedigree when the product is further distributed, to further advance the shared goals of protecting the public health, FDA encourages all parties in the prescription drug supply chain to cooperate fully by providing pedigree documents and information to trading partners for each sale, transfer, or trade of prescription drugs. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nWhat definition is used to determine who is a manufacturer and, thus, exempt from providing a pedigree?\n\nFor purposes of the PDMA, ""manufacturer"" is defined under 21 CFR SS 203.3(s), which incorporates the definition from 21 CFR SS 201.1.\n\n13 Are contract manufacturers considered ""manufacturers"" under the PDMA?\n\nYes. A contract manufacturer falls within the definition of a ""manufacturer"" under 21 CFR SS 203.3(s), which incorporates by reference the definition of ""manufacturer"" set forth in 21 CFR SS 201.1. FDA has received several inquiries regarding the status of an NDA-holder under 21 CFR SSS 203.3(s)/201.1 when that NDA-holder\'s prescription drugs are made by a contract manufacturer. Unless the NDA-holder has performed the operations necessary to achieve ""manufacturer"" status under 21 CFR SS 201.1, that NDAholder is not technically a ""manufacturer"" of the drugs within the meaning of the 21 CFR SS 203.3(s). In such instances, the NDA-holder would therefore not be exempt from the pedigree requirements on the grounds that it was a manufacturer. Thus, for purposes of the PDMA pedigree requirements only, FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion as follows: In those instances where a third party contract manufacturer manufacturers prescription drugs for an NDA-holder, that NDA-holder may also be regarded as a manufacturer of those drugs for purposes of that NDA-holder\'s compliance with SS 503(e)(1)(A) of the Act, entering into ADR agreements for those prescription drugs, and for purposes of pedigrees created for those prescription drugs. This exercise of enforcement discretion is not intended to relieve the contract manufacturer of its obligations as a manufacturer, including its obligation to register under SS 510 of the Act, nor is it intended to require the NDA-holder to file such a registration unless the NDA-holder would otherwise be obligated to do so.\n\n14 Is a repackager or relabeler exempt from providing a pedigree?\n\nNo. Relabelers and repackagers are not considered to be manufacturers under 21 CFR SS 201.1. Therefore, unless a repackager or relabeler has ADR status with the manufacturer of that product, they are required to provide a pedigree identifying each prior sale, purchase, or trade of the drug. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\n15 Is a pedigree required if an exclusive distribution agreement exists?\n\nNo, so long as the agreement is in writing. By definition, an exclusivity agreement is a written agreement under which the distributor is authorized to distribute the manufacturer\'s products for a period or time or for a specified volume of products.\n\nAccordingly, such a written agreement would satisfy the requirements related to ADR status in 21 C.F.R. 203.3(u). Please note that, in such instances, the wholesale distributor named in the agreement would have to be included in the manufacturer\'s list of ADRs under 21 CFR SS 203.50(d).\n\n16 Do non-ADRs have to provide a pedigree if the customer is a physician\'s office?\n\nYes. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) requires non-ADRs to provide a pedigree before each wholesale distribution of a drug. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc), wholesale distribution is defined as the distribution of prescription drugs to persons other than a consumer or patient. Although a physician\'s office is not explicitly mentioned in 21 CFR SS 203.50, which discusses pedigree, it is contemplated within the scope of the language set forth in SS 503(e)(1)(A) of the Act that a pedigree would be provided because physicians offices are not specifically excluded.\n\n17 Are pharmacies required to provide a pedigree when they transfer drug product between pharmacies?For transfers other than intra-company transfers, unless the transfer of prescription drug product from one pharmacy to another is for a documented medical emergency (see 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(5)), or the sale is of minimal quantities of drugs by retail pharmacies to licensed practitioners for office use (see 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(10)), retail pharmacies that are not ADRs for the prescription drug products sold or transferred to other retail pharmacies will have to provide a pedigree.\n\nDoes a chain pharmacy warehouse have to provide a pedigree for drugs that it sends to its retail outlets?\n\nNo. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.33(cc)(1), intra-company sales are excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution. FDA considers intra-company transfers, such as those from a chain pharmacy warehouse to its own retail outlets, to fall within the scope of an intra-company sale.\n\nDo pharmacies have to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the pedigree? If so, how should they do this?\n\nNo. Pharmacies do not have this express responsibility under the PDMA, but they are encouraged to perform due diligence in verifying the accuracy of the information and integrity of the source of the drug product.\n\nC Recordkeeping Requirements\n\nWhat are the recordkeeping requirements for pedigree recipients?\n\nPursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(b), the pedigree is subject to the record retention requirements in 21 CFR SS 203.60, and must be retained by all wholesale distributors involved in the distribution of the drug product, whether ADR or non-ADR, for 3 years.\n\nIf the pharmacy receiving the pedigree will not itself engage in further distribution of the product to persons other than a consumer or patient, then the pharmacy is not required to maintain that pedigree under 21 CFR SS 203.60. However, consistent with the spirit of the PDMA, FDA encourages pharmacies and other end users to retain the pedigree for 3 years. As a result, if there is any question about the source or history of the product, it can be traced back through the drug supply chain.\n\nIf an ADR obtains drugs from a non-ADR, is the ADR required to maintain the pedigree?\n\nYes. Although an ADR is not required to provide a pedigree, pursuant to 21 CFR SSS 203.50(b), and 203.60(d), an ADR is required to retain the pedigree for 3 years.\n\nPDMA Scope\n\nDoes PDMA apply to veterinary prescription drugs?\n--------------------\nContext title: Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) Requirements- Questions and Answers'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 7: See sections 503B(a)(11) and 503B(d)(4)(A)(iii).\n\n2 Compounding, Generally\n\nCompounded drug products serve an important role for patients whose clinical needs cannot be met by an FDA-approved drug product, such as for a patient who has an allergy and needs a medication to be made without a certain dye contained in an FDA-approved drug product, or an elderly patient or a child who cannot swallow a pill and needs a medicine in a liquid form that is not available in an approved product. Drug products for identified individual patients can be compounded by licensed pharmacists in State-licensed pharmacies and Federal facilities and by licensed physicians operating under section 503A of the FD&C Act.8 Drug products can also be compounded by outsourcing facilities for identified individual patients pursuant to prescriptions or for distribution to health care practitioners without receiving prescriptions. Sections 503A and 503B restrict the compounding of drug products that are essentially copies of commercially available (section 503A) or approved drug products (section 503B).\n\nFootnote 8: Section 503A of the FD&C Act describes the conditions that must be met for a human drug product compounded by a licensed pharmacist in a State-licensed pharmacy or Federal facility, or by a licensed physician, to qualify for exemptions fromsections 501(a)(2)(B), 502(f)(1), and 505 of the FD&C Act. The conditions applicable to compounders seeking to operate under section 503A are discussed in separate guidance documents applicable to these entities.\n\n3 Compounded Drugs that are Essentially Copies of Approved Drug Products\n\nAlthough compounded drugs can serve an important need, they can also pose a higher risk to patients than FDA-approved drugs. Drug products compounded by outsourcing facilities in accordance with the conditions of section 503B are exempt from FDA drug approval requirements and the requirement to be labeled with adequate directions for use. There are greater assurances of quality when drugs are compounded by outsourcing facilities that meet the conditions of section 503B and CGMP requirements than there are for drugs compounded by entities that are not required to comply with CGMP requirements and are not routinely overseen by FDA. However, as with all compounded drugs, drugs compounded by outsourcing facilities have not undergone FDA premarket review for safety, effectiveness, and quality, and lack a premarket inspection and finding of manufacturing quality that is part of the drug approval process. Because they are subject to a lower regulatory standard, compounded drugs should only be distributed to health care facilities or dispensed to patients to fulfill the needs of patients whose medical needs cannot be met by an FDA-approved drug.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nAppendix A Definition of Essentially a Copy of an Approved Drug\n\nThe definition of essentially a copy of an approved drug has two components, specified in sections 503B(d)(2)(A) and 503B(d)(2)(B) of the Act. Section 503B(d)(2)(A) applies to a compounded drug that is ""identical or nearly identical"" to an approved drug or an unapproved non-prescription drug. All other compounded drugs are evaluated under section 503B(d)(2)(B). FDA applies these provisions as depicted in the diagrams in Appendices A and B.\n\nThe definition of essentially a copy of an approved drug in section 503B(d)(2) addresses both drug products approved under section 505 and marketed drug products that are not subject to section 503(b) and that are not subject to approval in an application submitted under section 505.\n\nFor purposes of this provision:\n\nApproved drug means a drug product that (1) is approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, (2) does not appear on the list described in subsection 503B(a)(4) of drugs that have been withdrawn or removed from the market because such drugs or components of such drugs have been found to be unsafe or not effective.\n\nMarketed drug not subject to section 503(b) and not subject to approval in an application submitted under section 505 means any non-prescription drug product marketed without an approved application.10 We refer to these products as covered OTC drug products throughout the remainder of this guidance document. Footnote 10: This includes unapproved OTC drugs whether they are marketed under FDA’s OTC Drug Monograph Review programovtside the monograph system\n\nA drug appears on the drug shortage list in effect under section 506E if the drug is in ""currently in shortage"" status (and not in ""resolved"" status), as indicated in FDA\'s drug shortage database.11 Footnote 11: See http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/dupshortaes/default.cfm.\n\nIn addition, FDA does not intend to take action against an outsourcing facility for failing to compound in accordance with section 503B(a)(5) if it fills orders for a compounded drug that is essentially a copy of an approved drug that has been discontinued and is no longer marketed.12In the discussion  that follows, in subsection 1, we explain  how we intend to apply  the definition of essentially a copy of an approved drug in section 503B(d)(2) when the compounded  drug is compared to an approved drug, and then in subsection 2, we explain  how we intend to apply this definition  when the compounded  drug is compared to a covered OTC drug product.\n\nApplication of the ""Essentially a Copy"" Definition in Section 503B(d)(2) When the Compounded Drug Is Compared to an Approved Drug (see Appendix A) a. Compounded  drugs that are identical  or nearly identical to an approved drug (section 503B(d)(2)(A)) Under section 503B(d)(2)(A), a compounded  drug is essentially  a copy of an approved drug if the compounded  drug is identical  or nearly identical  to an approved drug unless the approved drug appears on the drug shortage list  in effect under section 506E  at the time of compounding,  distribution,  and dispensing. 1. Identical  or nearly identical (Appendix A, box 1) FDA intends  to consider  a compounded  drug product to be identical  or nearly identical  to an approved drug if the compounded  drug product and the FDA-approved drug have the same: * active ingredient(s), * route of administration,13 Footnote 13: See https://www.fda.gov/Drug/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/DataStandardsManualmonographs/ucm071667.htm. Additionally, if the approved drug can be used (regardless of how it is labeled) by the same route of administration prescribed for the compounded drug, we intend to treat the compounded drug as though it has the same route of administration for purposes of this analysis. For example, if the approved drug is an injectable drug sold in a vial that is labeled for intra-muscular use, but this drug can also be drawn from the vial by a smaller needle for subcutaneous adminis ration, a compounded drug product sold in a similar vial and prescribed for sub-cutaneous use would be considered to have the same route of administration under this analysis.\n\nA compounded  drug product that has all of these characteristics in common with an FDA-approved drug product is essentially  a copy of an approved drug, unless the approved drug appears on FDA\'s drug shortage list at the time of compounding, distribution, and dispensing. If a compounded drug product is identical or nearly identical to an approved drug that is not on FDA\'s drug shortage list at the time of compounding, distribution, and dispensing, the compounded product is essentially a copy, and an outsourcing facility may not produce it under section 503B.\n\nIn establishing this policy, FDA considered the following. Under section 503B(d)(2)(A), the identical or nearly identical compounded product cannot be exempted from the copying restriction by a prescriber determination that there is a change to the compounded product that produces a clinical difference for an individual patient. Compounded products meeting the criteria outlined above are not expected to contain changes from an approved drug that would produce such a difference.\n\nA compounded drug that is identical, or nearly identical, to an approved drug is not considered essentially a copy if the approved drug is in shortage at the time of compounding, distribution, and dispensing.16 In such a case, the outsourcing facility can compound the drug provided that it complies with the other conditions of 503B. It is important to patients and prescribers that compounded drugs prepared to address a shortage closely resemble the drug in shortage, and for that reason, the statute seeks to allow compounders to compound drugs that are as close as possible to the drug in shortage.17\n\nFootnote 16: For the purposes of this guidance, distribution means that a compounded human drug product has left the facility in which the drug was compounded. Distribution includes delivery or shipment to a physician’s office, hospital, or other health care setting for administration and dispensing to an agent of a patient or to a patient for the patient’s own use.\n\nA compounded drug product with the characteristics described in our policy would be the same as the approved drug in several important respects. The active ingredient is the substance in a drug product that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease or to affect the structure or function of the body. Dosage form is the way of identifying the drug in its physical form, and route of administration describes the way a drug is administered to the body. Inactive ingredients (also known as ""excipients"") may include preservatives, dyes, and flavorings. The dosage strength of a drug product indicates the amount of the active ingredient that is present in each dosage.\n--------------------\nContext title: Compounded Drug Products That Are Essentially Copies of Approved Drug Products Under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: Unexpected ADR\n\nAn ADR whose nature, severity, specificity, or outcome is not consistent with the term or description used in the local/regional product labeling (e.g. Package Insert or Summary of Product Characteristics) should be considered unexpected. When a Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) is uncertain whether an ADR is expected or unexpected, the ADR should be treated as unexpected.\n\nAn expected ADR with a fatal outcome should be considered unexpected unless the local/regional product labeling specifically states that the ADR might be associated with a fatal outcome.\n\n""Class ADRs"" should not automatically be considered to be expected for the subject drug. ""Class ADRs"" should be considered expected only if described as specifically occurring with the product in the local/regional product labeling. This is illustrated in the following examples:\n\n""As with other drugs of this class, the following undesirable effect occurs with Drug X.""\n\n""Drugs of this class, including Drug X, can cause...""\n\nIf the ADR has not been documented with Drug X, statements such as the following are likely to appear in the local/regional product labeling:\n\n""Other drugs of this class are reported to cause...""\n\n""Drugs of this class are reported to cause..., but no reports have been received to date with Drug X.""\n\nIn these situations, the ADR should not be considered as expected for Drug X.\n\nNOTE: The term ""listedness"" is not applicable to expedited reporting but should be used to characterize the ADR according to the Company Core Safety Information (refer to ICH E2C guideline for definitions).\n\nHealthcare Professional\n\nHealthcare professional is defined as a medically-qualified person such as a physician, dentist, pharmacist, nurse, coroner, or as otherwise specified by local regulations.\n\nConsumer\n\nConsumer is defined as a person who is not a healthcare professional such as a patient, lawyer, friend, or relative of a patient.\n\n3 Sources of Individual Case Safety Reports\n\nUnsolicited Sources\n\nSpontaneous Reports\n\nA spontaneous report is an unsolicited communication by a healthcare professional or consumer to a company, regulatory authority or other organization (e.g. WHO, Regional Center, Poison Control Center) that describes one or more adverse drug reactions in a patient who was given one or more medicinal products and that does not derive from a study or any organized data collection scheme.\n\nStimulated reporting can occur in certain situations, such as notification by a ""Dear Healthcare Professional"" letter, publication in the press, or questioning of healthcare professionals by company representatives.

59,"Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section ""2.9 Photosafety Testing"" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)","['--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section ""2.9 Photosafety Testing"" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: Photosafety Tests Using In Vivo Assays and Dermal Administration (3.5)\n\nThe main recommendations provided for investigating the systemic route of administration also apply to dermal administration, including those for species selection, study duration, and irradiation conditions. For dermal drug products in general, the clinical formulation should be tested. The intended clinical conditions of administration should be used to the extent possible. Irradiation of the exposed area should take place at a specified time after application, and the interval between application and irradiation should be justified based on the specific properties of the formulation to be tested. Signs of phototoxicity should be assessed based on relevant endpoints (see section III.D(3.4)). The sensitivity of the assay should be demonstrated using appropriate reference compounds. Assessment of systemic drug levels is generally not warranted in dermal phototoxicity studies.\n\nFor dermal drug products, contact photoallergy has often been assessed in a nonclinical study along with acute phototoxicity (photoirritation). However, no formal validation of such assays has been performed. Although the acute photoirritation observed in these studies is considered relevant to humans, the predictivity of these studies for human photoallergy is unknown. For regulatory purposes, such nonclinical photoallergy testing is generally not recommended.\n\nIV Clinical Photosafety Assessment (4)\n\nThere are various options for collecting human data, if warranted, ranging from standard reporting of adverse events in clinical studies to a dedicated clinical photosafety trial. The precise strategy is determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nV Assessment Strategies (5)\n\nThe choice of the photosafety assessment strategy is up to the drug developer. ICH M3(R2) suggests that an initial assessment of the phototoxicity potential based on photochemical properties and pharmacological/chemical class be undertaken before outpatient studies. Characterization of the UV-visible absorption spectrum is recommended as the initial assessment because it can obviate any further photosafety evaluation. In addition, the distribution to skin and eye can be evaluated to inform further on the human risk and the recommendations for further testing. Then, if appropriate, an experimental evaluation of phototoxicity potential (in vitro, in vivo, or clinical) should be undertaken before exposure of large numbers of subjects (phase 3).\n\nFigure 1 provides an outline of possible phototoxicity assessment strategies. The figure is based on the strategies outlined in this section of this guidance. The strategies are flexible. Depending on the particular situation, some portions of the assessment are optional and might not be conducted.\n\nRecommendations for Pharmaceuticals Given via Systemic Routes (5.1)\n\nv.1.1 Assessment of Phototoxicity Potential (5.1.1)\n\nIf the substance does not have an MEC greater than 1000 L mol-1 cm-1 (between 290 and 700 nm), no photosafety testing is recommended and no direct phototoxicity is anticipated in humans. However, it should be noted that phototoxicity by indirect mechanisms (e.g., pseudoporphyria or porphyia), although rare, could still occur. For compounds with MEC values of 1000 L mol-1 cm-1 or higher, if the drug developer chooses to conduct a test for photoreactivity, a negative result could support a decision that no further photosafety assessment is warranted (see section III.B(3.2)). Otherwise, nonclinical and/or clinical photosafety assessment of the substance should be conducted. Available data on the phototoxicity of chemical class-related compounds should be evaluated because this could inform on the approach to be taken.\n\nv.1.2 Evaluation of Phototoxicity (5.1.2)\n\nTo reduce the use of animals in accordance with the 3R principles, a validated in vitro method should generally be considered before conducting animal testing (see, for example, Directive 2010/63/EU). If the drug developer chooses an in vitro approach, the 3T3 NRU-PT is currently the most widely used assay and in many cases could be considered as an initial test for phototoxicity. The high sensitivity of the 3T3 NRU-PT results in good negative predictivity and the negative results are generally accepted as sufficient evidence that a substance is not phototoxic. In such cases no further testing is recommended and no direct phototoxicity is anticipated in humans.\n\nIn some situations (e.g., poorly soluble compounds), an initial assessment of phototoxicity in an in vitro assay might not be appropriate. In this case, an assessment in animals or in humans could be considered. Alternatively, if drug distribution data are available, they could, on a case-by-case basis, support a decision that no further photosafety assessment is warranted (see section II.B(2.2)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSome properties of the clinical formulation that could influence the potential phototoxic response (e.g., penetration into skin, intracellular uptake) cannot be evaluated using the 3T3 NRU-PT alone. Therefore, confirmation of the overall negative result in an evaluation using the clinical formulation and/or monitoring during clinical trials can still be warranted.\n\nReconstructed human skin models can be used to assess the phototoxicity potential of clinical formulations. Under adequate test conditions (see section III.C(3.3)), a negative result in a reconstructed human skin assay indicates that the direct phototoxicity potential of the formulation can be regarded as low. In this case, generally no further phototoxicity testing is recommended (see Note 5 for exception).\n\nIf an appropriate in vitro assay is not available, the initial test could be an in vivo phototoxicity test on the clinical formulation. A negative result in an appropriately conducted in vivo animal phototoxicity study would be sufficient evidence that the formulation is not directly phototoxic and no further phototoxicity testing is recommended (see Note 5 for exception). Alternatively, the phototoxicity potential can be assessed in the clinical setting.\n\nFor dermal products where the API or any new excipient has an MEC value greater than 1000 L mol({}^{\\text{-1}}) cm({}^{\\text{-1}}) at any wavelength between 290 and 700 nm, a photoullergy assessment is generally warranted in addition to phototoxicity testing. Because the predictivity of nonclinical photoullergy tests is unknown, this would typically be a clinical assessment using the to-be-marketed formulation and conducted during phase 3.\n\nPhotosafety evaluation of the clinical formulation delivered via dermal patches can follow the above described principles for clinical dermal formulations. For transdermal patches, the principles for both dermal and systemic drugs should be applied. In addition, the intended clinical use (e.g., skin area recommended for use, duration of application) and the properties of the patch matrix (e.g., being opaque to UV and visible light) should be considered for the overall risk assessment.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n""otherwise"": data do not support a low potential for phototoxicity or have not been generated (assay/test/evaluation not conducted)\n\nA ""negative"" result in an appropriately conducted in vivo phototoxicity study supersedes a positive in vitro result. A robust clinical phototoxicity assessment indicating no concern supersedes any positive nonclinical results. A positive result in an in vitro phototoxicity test could also, on a case-by-case basis, be negated by tissue distribution data (see text). In the United States, for products applied dermally, a dedicated clinical trial for phototoxicity on the to-be-marketed formulation can be warranted in support of product approval.\n\nClinical evaluation could range from standard reporting of adverse events in clinical studies to a dedicated clinical photosafety trial.\n\nTissue distribution is not a consideration for the phototoxicity of dermal products.\n\nFigure 1: Outline of Possible Phototoxicity Assessment Strategies for Pharmaceuticals Given via Systemic and Dermal Routes\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nVI Endnotes (6)\n\nNote 1:For compounds that absorb at relevant wavelengths, have an MEC value greater than 1000 L mol({}^{\\text{1}}) cm({}^{\\text{-1}}), and are given via ocular routes (e.g., eye drops, intraocular injections), an evaluation of the phototoxicity potential should be undertaken in accordance with the general principles of phototoxicity assessment. Biodistribution of drug in the eye and optical properties of the eye should also be considered. Any available information on the compound or chemical class-related compounds should be considered in the overall assessment.\n\nCompounds that only absorb light at wavelengths below 400 nm and are to be administered as intraocular injections behind the lens (e.g., in the vitreous) are of low concern for retinal phototoxicity, because only light of wavelengths greater than 400 nm reaches the back of the adult eye. However, the lens in children of less than approximately 10 years of age is not completely protective against wavelengths below 400 nm.\n\nNote 2:Testing for photogenotoxicity is not recommended as a part of the standard photosafety testing program. In the past, some regional guidelines (e.g., CPMP/SWP/398/01) have recommended that photogenotoxicity testing be conducted preferentially using a photoclastogenicity assay (chromosomal aberration or micronucleus test) in mammalian cells in vitro. However, experience with these models since the CPMP/SWP guideline was issued has indicated that these tests are substantially oversensitive and even incidences of pseudo-photoclastogenicity have been reported (Ref. 8). Furthermore, the interpretation of photogenotoxicity data regarding its meaning for clinically relevant enhancement of UV-mediated skin cancer is unclear.\n--------------------\nContext title: S10 Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals'

(2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: 4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor either species, this design could be adapted to replace the corresponding standard chronic study and a separate juvenile animal study in some circumstances.\n\nThe appropriateness of carcinogenicity testing should be addressed before long-term exposure in pediatric clinical trials. However, unless there is a significant cause for concern (e.g., evidence of genotoxicity in multiple tests, or concern for pro-carcinogenic risk based on mechanistic considerations or findings from general toxicity studies), carcinogenicity studies are not recommended to support the conduct of pediatric clinical trials.\n\nXiii. Immunotoxicity (13)\n\nAs stated in the ICH S8 guidance (Ref. 14), all new human pharmaceuticals should be evaluated for the potential to produce immunotoxicity using standard toxicity studies and additional immunotoxicity studies conducted as appropriate based on a weight-of-evidence review, including immune-related signals from standard toxicity studies. If additional immunotoxicity studies are indicated, these should be completed before exposure of a large population of patients (e.g., phase 3).\n\nXiv. Photosafety Testing (14)\n\nThe appropriateness or timing of photosafety testing in relation to human exposure should be influenced by: (1) the photochemical properties (e.g., photoabsorption and photostability) of the molecule, (2) information on the phototoxic potential of chemically related compounds, (3) tissue distribution, and (4) clinical or nonclinical findings indicative of phototoxicity.\n\nAn initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on a drug\'s photochemical properties and pharmacological/chemical class should be performed. If assessment of all the available data and the proposed clinical plan indicates a potential for a significant human phototoxicity risk, appropriate protective measures should be taken during outpatient clinical studies. In addition, a subsequent evaluation of the nonclinical drug distribution to skin and eye should be completed to inform further on the human risk and the need for further testing. Then, if appropriate, an experimental evaluation (nonclinical, in vitro or in vivo, or clinical) of phototoxic potential should be undertaken before exposure of large numbers of subjects (phase 3).\n\nAlternatively, instead of the above stepwise approach, a direct assessment of phototoxic potential in a nonclinical or clinical study can be undertaken. If this study is negative, an early assessment of eye/skin distribution studies and clinical protective measures are not called for.\n\nIf the phototoxicity assessment indicates a potential photocarcinogenic risk, the risk can usually be adequately managed in patients by protective measures including a warning statement in the informed consent for clinical trials and in product information for marketing (Note 6).\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor drugs that produce central nervous system activity, regardless of therapeutic indication, it should be considered whether or not an evaluation of abuse liability is warranted. Nonclinical studies should support the design of clinical evaluations of abuse potential, classification/scheduling by regulatory agencies, and product information. There are regional guidance documents on the conduct of nonclinical abuse liability assessment that can be helpful in designing specific abuse liability packages.\n\nNonclinical data collected early in the drug development process can be useful in identification of early indicators of abuse potential. These early indicators would typically be available before first human dose and include the PK/PD profile to identify the duration of action, similarity of chemical structure to known drugs of abuse, receptor binding profile, and behavioural/clinical signs from in vivo nonclinical studies. When no abuse potential is apparent from these early studies, extensive testing in nonclinical abuse liability models might not be warranted. Generally, if the active substance shows signals associated with known abuse liability patterns or the active substance has a novel mechanism of action on the central nervous system, further nonclinical studies are recommended to support large clinical trials (e.g., phase 3).\n\nWhen the metabolite profile and the target for drug activity in rodent are consistent with that of human, the nonclinical abuse liability evaluations should be conducted in rodents. Nonhuman primates should be reserved only for those limited cases where there is clear evidence that they would be predictive of human abuse liability and the rodent model is inadequate. Three types of studies are often completed to evaluate the potential for abuse liability: drug discrimination, self-administration of the compound, and an assessment of withdrawal. When conducted, studies of drug discrimination and self-administration are generally stand-alone. Assessments of withdrawal can sometimes be incorporated within the design of the reversibility arm of a repeated-dose toxicity study. A maximum dose that produces a plasma concentration several-fold higher than that obtained at the therapeutic clinical dose is considered appropriate for these nonclinical abuse assessments.\n\nOther Toxicity Studies (16)\n\nAdditional nonclinical studies (e.g., to identify potential biomarkers, to provide mechanistic understanding) can be useful if previous nonclinical or clinical findings with the product or related products have indicated special safety concerns.\n\nThe approaches for qualifying impurities and degradants are outlined in ICH Q3A and Q3B (Refs. 12 and 13). If specific studies are warranted to qualify an impurity or degradant, generally these studies are not warranted before phase 3 unless there are changes that result in a significant new impurity profile (e.g., a new synthetic pathway, a new degradant formed by interactions between the components of the formulation). In these latter cases, appropriate qualification studies can be warranted to support phase 2 or later stages of development.\n\nCombination Drug Toxicity Testing (17)\n\nThis section covers combination drugs that are intended to be co-packaged or administered in a single dosage form (""fixed formulation""). The principles outlined can also apply whendeveloping products that will have product information recommendations for co-use with a specific drug, even if not in a fixed combination, and for which there is minimal clinical information regarding the combination.\n\nCombinations covered might involve: (1) two or more late stage entities (defined as compounds with significant clinical experience (i.e., from phase 3 studies and/ or post marketing))\' (2) one or more late stage entity(ies) and one or more early stage entities (defined as compounds with limited clinical experience (i.e., phase 2 studies or less)); or (3) more than one early stage entity. For most combinations which involve two late stage entities and for which there is adequate clinical experience with co-administration, combination toxicity studies would generally not be recommended to support clinical studies or marketing unless there is significant toxicological concern (e.g., similar target organ toxicity). This concern would be modified depending on the margins of safety and the ability to monitor the adverse effects in humans. If a study is being conducted to address a cause for significant toxicological concern, it should generally be completed before carrying out clinical studies with the combination.\n\nWhere there are two late stage products for which there is not adequate clinical experience with co-administration, but there are no causes for significant toxicological concern based on the available data, nonclinical combination studies generally are not recommended to support small-scale, relatively short-duration clinical studies (e.g., phase 2 studies of up to 3 months\' duration). Nonclinical combination studies, however, are recommended before large-scale or long-term combination trials, as well as for marketing.\n\nFor combinations of an early stage entity(ies) with clinical experience with a late stage entity(ies), for which there is no significant toxicological concern, combination toxicity studies are not recommended to support clinical proof-of-concept studies of up to one months\' duration. The clinical study of the combination should not be longer than the clinical experience of the individual entities. Later stage or longer duration clinical studies should be supported by a nonclinical combination toxicity study.\n\nFor combinations of two early stage entities, nonclinical combination toxicity studies are recommended to support clinical trials.\n\nProvided complete nonclinical development programs are being conducted on the individual entities and a nonclinical combination toxicity study is warranted to support combination clinical trials, the duration of the combination study should be equivalent to that of the clinical trial, up to a maximum duration of 90 days. A 90-day combination toxicity study would also support marketing. A combination toxicity study of shorter duration can also support marketing, depending on the duration of the intended clinical use.\n\nThe design of the nonclinical studies recommended to characterize the combination will depend on the pharmacological, toxicological and PK profiles of the individual entities, the treatment indication(s), the intended patient population, and the available clinical data.\n\nCombination nonclinical studies should generally be limited to a single relevant species. If unexpected toxicity is identified, additional testing can be appropriate.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen complete nonclinical development programs are not conducted on the individual entities, then a complete nonclinical toxicology program with the combination only can be appropriate, provided that the individual agents are only intended for use in combination.\n--------------------\nContext title: M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section ""2.9 Photosafety Testing"" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: Photosensitization is a general term occasionally used to describe all light-induced tissue reactions. However, in order to clearly distinguish between photoallergy and phototoxicity, the term photosensitization is not used in this guidance.\n\nFor a chemical to demonstrate phototoxicity and/or photoallergy, the following characteristics are critical:\n\nabsorbs light within the range of natural sunlight (290-700 nm)\n\ngenerates a reactive species following absorption of UV-visible light\n\ndistributes sufficiently to light-exposed tissues (e.g., skin, eye)\n\nIf one or more of these conditions are not met, a compound will usually not present a concern for direct phototoxicity. However, increased sensitivity of skin to light can also occur through indirect mechanisms. Such mechanisms are not generally addressed by the testing outlined in this guidance (see also section II.D(2.4)).\n\nII Factors to Consider in the Photosafety Evaluation (2)\n\nPhotochemical Properties (2.1)\n\nThe initial consideration for assessment of photoreactive potential is whether a compound absorbs photons at any wavelength between 290 and 700 nm. A compound that does not have a molar extinction coefficient (MEC) greater than 1000 L mol({}^{-1}) cm({}^{-1}) at any wavelength between 290 and 700 nm (Ref. [3]) is not considered to be sufficiently photoreactive to result in direct phototoxicity (see Note 3 for further details).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nexperience with melanin binding drugs suggests such binding alone does not present a photosafety concern.\n\nA single-dose tissue distribution study, with animals assessed at multiple timepoints after dosing, will generally provide an adequate assessment of relative tissue to plasma concentration ratios, tissue residence time, and the potential for retention and accumulation. Assessment timepoints should be appropriately spaced in such a study to account for the drug half-life.\n\nCompounds activated by visible light and exhibiting long elimination half-lives in internal tissues have been demonstrated to cause injury to those tissues if exposed to intense light during medical procedures. Consequently, for those compounds activated by visible light with potent in vivo phototoxicity or known to be phototoxic based on their mechanism of action, such as photodynamic therapy drugs, distribution to internal tissues should be measured and tissue-specific half-lives estimated. Drugs that only absorb ultraviolet (UV) light or have short tissue elimination half-lives are not likely to present a risk to internal tissues even if they are known to be photoreactive.\n\nMetabolite Considerations (2.3)\n\nMetabolites generally do not warrant separate photosafety assessments, because metabolism does not typically result in chromophores that are substantially different from those in the parent molecule.\n\nPharmacological Properties (2.4)\n\nIn many cases, drug-induced phototoxicity is due to the chemical structure and not the pharmacology. However, certain pharmacologic properties (e.g., immunosuppression, perturbation of heme homeostasis) can enhance susceptibility to light-induced effects, such as skin irritation or UV-induced skin tumor formation. The testing strategies outlined in this document are not designed to detect these types of indirect mechanisms. Some of these indirect mechanisms can be identified and evaluated in other nonclinical pharmacology/toxicity testing; however, phototoxicity related to other indirect mechanisms might only become apparent with human experience.\n\nIII Nonclinical Photosafety Tests (3)\n\nGeneral Considerations (3.1)\n\nCarefully selected conditions that consider both the model system and exposure to a relevant radiation spectrum are critical for nonclinical photosafety testing. Ideally, a nonclinical assay should exhibit both high sensitivity and specificity (i.e., low false negative and low false positive rates). However, to support the assessment strategies described in this document, it is most important that nonclinical photosafety assays show high sensitivity resulting in a low frequency of false negatives (i.e., a high negative predictive value). This is because negative assay results usually do not warrant further photosafety evaluation. The available nonclinical assays, both in vitro and in vivo, are focused primarily on detecting potential phototoxicity, which might or might not translate into clinically relevant phototoxicity.\n\nSelection of irradiation conditions is critical for both in vitro and in vivo assays. Natural sunlight represents the broadest range of light exposure that humans might be exposed to regularly. However, sunlight per se is not well defined and depends on many factors, such as latitude, altitude, season, time of day, and weather. In addition, sensitivity of human skin to natural sunlight depends on a number of individual factors (e.g., skin type, anatomical site and tanning status). Standardized sunlight exposure conditions have been defined by various organizations. Such standards (e.g., CIE-85-1989 (Ref. 5)) should be considered in order to assess suitability of a sunlight simulator light source, and irradiance and irradiation dose should be normalized based on the ultraviolet light A (UVA) part of the applied spectrum. UVA doses ranging from 5 to 20 J/cm({}^{2}) are successfully used in current in vitro and in vivo phototoxicity assays. These UVA doses are comparable to those obtained during prolonged outdoor activities on summer days around noon time, in temperate zones, and at sea level. In humans, sunburn reactions caused by ultraviolet light B (UVB) normally limit total sunlight exposure. In nonclinical phototoxicity assays, however, the amount of UVB should not limit the overall irradiation and might be attenuated (partially filtered) so that relevant UVA doses can be tested without reducing assay sensitivity. Penetration of UVB light into human skin is mainly limited to the epidermis, while UVA can reach capillary blood. Therefore, clinical relevance of photochemical activation by UVB is considered less important than activation by UVA for systemic drugs. However, UVB irradiation is relevant for topical formulations applied to light-exposed tissues.\n\nThe selection and monitoring of appropriate light sources (spectral distribution, irradiance, and dose) and the procedures used should be clearly described in the study methodology (e.g., OECD TG 432 (Ref. 6)).\n\nPhotoreactivity Tests Using Chemical Assays (3.2)\n\nIf a drug developer chooses to assess photoreactivity, the assay should be qualified using pharmaceutical agents under appropriate conditions to demonstrate assay sensitivity. One such assay is an ROS assay (e.g., Ref. 7). Data suggest that this assay has high sensitivity for predicting direct in vivo phototoxicants. However, this assay has a low specificity, generating a high percentage of false positive results. A negative result in this assay, conducted under the appropriate conditions, would indicate a very low probability of phototoxicity, provided a test concentration of 200 (\\mu)M can be achieved, whereas a positive result (at any concentration) would only be a flag for follow-up assessment.\n\nPhototoxicity Tests Using In Vitro Assays (3.3)\n\nA number of in vitro assays have been developed for assessing the phototoxicity potential of chemicals. Some of these assays have not been qualified for use with pharmaceuticals. Some assays involve testing compounds that are dissolved in the culture medium, and such methods are often appropriate for the active ingredient or excipients in drug products, depending on their solubility. Other assays involve direct application to the surface of a tissue preparation and can be appropriate for testing entire formulations intended to be administered topically.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe most widely used in vitro assay for phototoxicity is the 3T3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity test (3T3 NRU-PT) for which an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline (Ref. 6) is available. This is currently considered the most appropriate in vitro screen for soluble compounds.\n\nAlthough the formal European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) validation exercise conducted on this assay indicated a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 84%, experience within the pharmaceutical industry suggests a much lower specificity. The original OECD protocol was not validated for pharmaceuticals specifically. Thus, some modifications to the original OECD protocol have been proposed to address the low specificity observed with drug substances (see Note 4). These proposed changes are appropriate for the testing of pharmaceuticals. The sensitivity of the 3T3 NRU-PT is high, and if a compound is negative in this assay, it would have a very low probability of being phototoxic in humans. However, a positive result in the 3T3 NRU-PT should not be regarded as indicative of a likely clinical phototoxic risk, but rather a flag for follow-up assessment.\n\nThe BALB/c 3T3 cell line is sensitive to UVB, and the initially recommended irradiation conditions (Ref. 6) involve the use of filters to attenuate wavelengths below 320 nm. However, depending on the light source and filters used, the ratio of UVB to UVA can be adjusted such that it is possible to assess UVB-induced phototoxicity in this test. UVB-induced phototoxicity is rarely a problem for pharmaceuticals with systemic exposure because UVB minimally penetrates beyond the epidermis. However, UVB-induced phototoxicity is more relevant for topical products. For components of topically applied products that absorb predominately in the UVB range, and if in vitro assessment is desired, the use of the 3T3 NRU-PT with modified irradiation conditions (see above) can be considered. Alternatively, in vitro skin models, which better tolerate UVB, could be considered.\n--------------------\nContext title: S10 Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals'

(2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: Tissue distribution is not a consideration for the phototoxicity of dermal products.\n\nFigure 1: Outline of Possible Phototoxicity Assessment Strategies for Pharmaceuticals Given via Systemic and Dermal Routes\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nVI Endnotes (6)\n\nNote 1:For compounds that absorb at relevant wavelengths, have an MEC value greater than 1000 L mol({}^{\\text{1}}) cm({}^{\\text{-1}}), and are given via ocular routes (e.g., eye drops, intraocular injections), an evaluation of the phototoxicity potential should be undertaken in accordance with the general principles of phototoxicity assessment. Biodistribution of drug in the eye and optical properties of the eye should also be considered. Any available information on the compound or chemical class-related compounds should be considered in the overall assessment.\n\nCompounds that only absorb light at wavelengths below 400 nm and are to be administered as intraocular injections behind the lens (e.g., in the vitreous) are of low concern for retinal phototoxicity, because only light of wavelengths greater than 400 nm reaches the back of the adult eye. However, the lens in children of less than approximately 10 years of age is not completely protective against wavelengths below 400 nm.\n\nNote 2:Testing for photogenotoxicity is not recommended as a part of the standard photosafety testing program. In the past, some regional guidelines (e.g., CPMP/SWP/398/01) have recommended that photogenotoxicity testing be conducted preferentially using a photoclastogenicity assay (chromosomal aberration or micronucleus test) in mammalian cells in vitro. However, experience with these models since the CPMP/SWP guideline was issued has indicated that these tests are substantially oversensitive and even incidences of pseudo-photoclastogenicity have been reported (Ref. 8). Furthermore, the interpretation of photogenotoxicity data regarding its meaning for clinically relevant enhancement of UV-mediated skin cancer is unclear.\n\nNote 3:Standardized conditions for determination of MECs are critical. Selection of an adequate solvent is driven by both analytical requirements (e.g., dissolving power, UV-visible light transparency) and physiological relevance (e.g., pH 7.4-buffered aqueous conditions). Methanol is recommended as a preferred solvent and was used to support the MEC threshold of 1000 L mol({}^{\\text{-1}}) cm({}^{\\text{-1}}) (Ref. 3). When measuring UV-visible light spectra, potential limitations (e.g., artifacts due to high concentrations or low solubility, including slow precipitation) should be considered. If the chromophore of the molecule appears to be pH-sensitive (e.g., phenolic structure, aromatic amines, carboxylic acids), an additional spectrum obtained under aqueous, pH 7.4-buffered conditions could add valuable information regarding differences in the shape of the absorption spectrum and in the MECs. If significant differences are seen between measurements obtained in methanol versus pH-adjusted conditions, the MEC threshold of 1000 L mol({}^{\\text{-1}}) cm({}^{\\text{-1}}) cannot be used to obviate further photosafety assessment.\n\nNote 4:A survey of pharmaceutical companies indicated that the 3T3 NRU-PT, as described in OECD TG 432, generates a high percentage of positive results (approximately 50%), the majority of which do not correlate with phototoxicity responses in animals or humans (Ref. 9). Following a retrospective review of data for pharmaceuticals, a reduction of the maximum test concentration from 1000 to 100 (\\upmu)g/mL appears justified (Ref. 10). Compounds without any significant cytotoxicity (under irradiation) up to this limit can be considered as being devoid of relevant phototoxicity. In addition, the category named ""probable phototoxicity"" per OECD TG 432 (i.e.,photoiritation factor (PIF) values between 2 and 5 or mean photo effect (MPE) values between 0.10 and 0.15) is of questionable toxicological relevance for systemic drugs. Compounds in this category generally do not warrant further photosafety evaluations. For compounds with a PIF value between 2 and 5, and for which it is not possible to determine an IC({}_{50}) in the absence of irradiation, it is important to check that the compound is not classified as positive using the MPE calculation (i.e., that the MPE is less than 0.15).\n\nSystemic drugs that are positive in the 3T3 NRU-PT only at in vitro concentrations that are many times higher than drug concentrations likely to be achieved in light-exposed tissues in humans, can, on a case-by-case basis and in consultation with regulatory authorities, be considered to be low risk for phototoxicity in humans, without follow-up in vivo testing.\n\nNote 5: In the United States, for products applied dermally, a dedicated clinical trial for phototoxicity (photoiritation) on the to-be-marketed formulation (API plus all excipients) can be warranted in support of product approval.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nVII Glossary (7)\n\n3T3 NRU-PT:In vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity test.\n\nAssessment:In the context of this document, an assessment is an evaluation of all available information and does not always mean an additional test is conducted.\n\nChromophore:The substructure of a molecule that absorbs visible or ultraviolet light.\n\nDermal Drugs:Products applied topically to the skin.\n\nDirect Phototoxicity:Phototoxicity induced by absorption of light by the drug or excipient.\n\nIndirect Phototoxicity:Phototoxicity due to cellular, biochemical, or physiological alterations caused by the drug or excipient, but not related to photochemical reactivity of the drug or excipient (e.g., perturbation of heme homeostasis).\n\nIrradiance:The intensity of UV or visible light incident on a surface, measured in W/m({}^{2}) or mW/cm({}^{2}).\n\nIrradiation:The process by which an object/subject is exposed to UV or visible radiation.\n\nMec:Molar extinction coefficient (also called molar absorptivity) reflects the efficiency with which a molecule can absorb a photon at a particular wavelength (typically expressed as L mol({}^{-1}) cm({}^{-1})) and is influenced by several factors, such as solvent.\n\nMpe:The mean photo effect is calculated for results of the 3T3 NRU-PT.

However, the sensitivity of some assays can be less than that of human skin in vivo, wherein the lowest concentration eliciting a positive response can be higher than in human skin in vivo. Consequently, it is important to understand the sensitivity of any assay selected and, if appropriate and feasible, to adjust the assay conditions accordingly (e.g., testing higher strength formulations, increasing exposure time).\n\nThere are no in vitro models that specifically assess ocular phototoxicity, regardless of the route of administration. While negative results in the 3T3 NRU-PT or a reconstructed human skin assay might suggest a low risk, the predictive value of these assays for ocular phototoxicity is unknown.\n\nD. Photosafety Tests Using In Vivo Assays and Systemic Administration (3.4)\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPhototoxicity testing for systemically administered compounds has been conducted in a variety of species, including guinea pig, mouse, and rat. No standardized study design has been established, and thus the following factors might be considered as best practices.\n\nFor species selection, irradiation sensitivity (i.e., minimal erythema dose), heat tolerance, and performance of reference substances should be considered. Models with both pigmented and non-pigmented animals are available. Although non-pigmented skin tends to be more sensitive than pigmented skin for detecting phototoxicity, pigmented skin should be considered for APIs that bind significantly to melanin (see section II.B(2.2)) if appropriate exposures in target tissues cannot be ensured otherwise.\n\nIf an in vivo phototoxicity study is conducted, it is desirable to have some information about the pharmacokinetic profile of the compound before designing the study. This is to ensure that irradiation of the animals is conducted at the approximate time at which the maximum concentration of drug occurs after drug administration (T({}_{\\text{max}})), and to assist in the selection of an appropriate study duration in relation to the intended clinical exposure. Relevant pharmacokinetic data, if not already available, should be collected as part of the in vivo phototoxicity study.\n\nAlthough phototoxicity is typically an acute reaction, the duration of an in vivo assay should be carefully considered. Accumulation of compound in relevant light-exposed tissues after repeated administration might lead to an increased phototoxic response. Similarly, repeated irradiation after each dose might also lead to an increased phototoxic response due to the accumulation of damage. Generally, studies of a single day or up to a few days\' duration of dosing are appropriate, using the clinical route of administration, if feasible. Single or repeated daily irradiations after dosing (around T({}_{\\text{max}})) can be used.\n\nDose selection for in vivo nonclinical phototoxicity testing of systemic drugs should support a meaningful human risk assessment. For such studies, a maximum dose level that complies with the recommendations for general toxicity studies in ICH M3(R2), section I.E(1.5), is considered appropriate. If a negative result is obtained at the maximum dose, testing of lower doses is usually not warranted. However, if a positive result is anticipated, additional dose groups can support a NOAEL-based (no observable adverse effect level-based) risk assessment, typically considering the maximum concentration of drug after administration (C({}_{\\text{max}})) comparisons. Vehicle and non-irradiated controls can help identify compound-related phototoxicity and distinguish irradiation-induced from non-irradiation-induced adverse reactions. If the maximum systemic exposure achieved in animals is lower than clinical exposure, the reliability of a negative result in predicting human risk is questionable.\n\nThe most sensitive early signs of compound-induced phototoxicity are usually erythema followed by edema at a normally sub-erythemogenic irradiation dose. The type of response might vary with the compound. Any identified phototoxicity reaction should be evaluated regarding dose and time dependency, and if possible, the no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) should be established. The hazard identification might be further supported by additional endpoints (e.g., early inflammatory markers in skin or lymph node reactions indicative of acute irritation).\n\n2.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf a phototoxicity study is conducted in animals for a systemic drug that absorbs light above 400 nm, phototoxicity of the retina should be assessed using a detailed histopathological evaluation. For compounds that only absorb light below 400 nm, retinal assessment is usually not warranted because such wavelengths do not reach the retina of the adult human eye due to limited penetration of the cornea, lens, and vitreous body.\n\nAdequate performance of in vivo phototoxicity assays, which are not formally validated, should be demonstrated using suitable reference compounds, including pharmaceuticals. Compounds that are phototoxic in humans and that represent different chemical classes and mechanisms of phototoxicity should be included to establish adequacy of the assays. For retinal phototoxicity, a reference compound with a light absorption profile within the visible light range (i.e., above 400 nm) is recommended. The concurrent use of a positive control compound might not be warranted if an in vivo assay has been formally validated or has reached general acceptance and is established in the testing facility.\n\nTesting for photoulergy is not recommended for compounds that are administered systemically. Photoallergy reactions in humans following systemic administration are rare, and there are no established nonclinical photoallergy assays for systemically administered compounds.\n\nPhotosafety Tests Using In Vivo Assays and Dermal Administration (3.5)\n\nThe main recommendations provided for investigating the systemic route of administration also apply to dermal administration, including those for species selection, study duration, and irradiation conditions. For dermal drug products in general, the clinical formulation should be tested. The intended clinical conditions of administration should be used to the extent possible. Irradiation of the exposed area should take place at a specified time after application, and the interval between application and irradiation should be justified based on the specific properties of the formulation to be tested. Signs of phototoxicity should be assessed based on relevant endpoints (see section III.D(3.4)). The sensitivity of the assay should be demonstrated using appropriate reference compounds. Assessment of systemic drug levels is generally not warranted in dermal phototoxicity studies.\n\nFor dermal drug products, contact photoallergy has often been assessed in a nonclinical study along with acute phototoxicity (photoirritation). However, no formal validation of such assays has been performed. Although the acute photoirritation observed in these studies is considered relevant to humans, the predictivity of these studies for human photoallergy is unknown. For regulatory purposes, such nonclinical photoallergy testing is generally not recommended.\n\nIV Clinical Photosafety Assessment (4)\n\nThere are various options for collecting human data, if warranted, ranging from standard reporting of adverse events in clinical studies to a dedicated clinical photosafety trial. The precise strategy is determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nV Assessment Strategies (5)\n--------------------\nContext title: S10 Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section ""2.9 Photosafety Testing"" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: Assessment of the genotoxic potential of a compound should take into account the totality of the findings and acknowledge the intrinsic value and limitations of both in vitro and in vivo tests. The test battery approach of in vitro and in vivo tests is designed to reduce the risk of false negative results for compounds with genotoxic potential. A single positive result in any assay for genotoxicity does not necessarily mean that the test compound poses a genotoxic hazard to humans (see the ICH Guideline on Specific Aspects of Regulatory Genotoxicity Tests).\n\nIndication and Patient Population (4.4)\n\nWhen carcinogenicity studies are required they usually need to be completed before application for marketing approval. However, completed rodent carcinogenicity studiesare not needed in advance of the conduct of large scale clinical trials unless there is special concern for the patient population.\n\nFor pharmaceuticals developed to treat certain serious diseases, carcinogenicity testing need not be conducted before market approval although these studies should be conducted post-approval. This speeds the availability of pharmaceuticals for life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases, especially where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists.\n\nIn instances where the life-expectancy in the indicated population is short (i.e., less than 2 to 3 years), no long-term carcinogenicity studies may be required. For example, oncolytic agents intended for treatment of advanced systemic disease do not generally need carcinogenicity studies. In cases where the therapeutic agent for cancer is generally successful and life is significantly prolonged, there may be later concerns regarding secondary cancers. When such pharmaceuticals are intended for adjuvant therapy in tumor free patients or for prolonged use in noncancer indications, carcinogenicity studies are usually needed.\n\nRoute of Exposure (4.5)\n\nThe route of exposure in animals should be the same as the intended clinical route when feasible (see the ICH Guideline on Dose Selection for Carcinogenicity Studies of Pharmaceuticals). If similar metabolism and systemic exposure can be demonstrated by differing routes of administration, carcinogenicity studies should only be conducted by a single route, recognizing that it is important that relevant organs for the clinical route (e.g., lung for inhalational agents) be adequately exposed to the test material. Evidence of adequate exposure may be derived from pharmacokinetic data (see the ICH Guideline on Repeated Dose Tissue Distribution Studies).\n\nExtent of Systemic Exposure (4.6)\n\nPharmaceuticals applied topically (e.g., dermal and ocular routes of administration) may need carcinogenicity studies. Pharmaceuticals showing poor systemic exposure from topical routes in humans may not need studies by the oral route to assess the carcinogenic potential to internal organs. Where there is cause for concern for photocarcinogenic potential, carcinogenicity studies by dermal application (generally in mice) may be needed. Pharmaceuticals administered by the ocular route may not need carcinogenicity studies unless there is cause for concern or unless there is significant systemic exposure.\n\nFor different salts, acids, or bases of the same therapeutic moiety, where prior carcinogenicity studies are available, evidence should be provided that there are no significant changes in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, or toxicity. When changes in exposure and consequent toxicity are noted, additional bridging studies may be used to determine whether additional carcinogenicity studies are needed. For esters and complex derivatives, similar data would be valuable in assessing the need for an additional carcinogenicity study, but this should be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nG. Endogenous Peptides and Protein Substances or Their Analogs (4.7)\n\nEndogenous peptides or proteins and their analogs produced by chemical synthesis, by extraction/purification from an animal/human source, or by biotechnological methods such as recombinant DNA technology, may require special considerations.\n\nCarcinogenicity studies are not generally needed for endogenous substances given\n\nessentially as replacement therapy (i.e., physiological levels), particularly where there is\n\nprevious clinical experience with similar products (e.g., animal insulins, pituitary-derived\n\ngrowth hormone, and calcitonin).\n\nAlthough not usually necessary, long-term carcinogenicity studies in rodent species should be considered for the other biotechnology products noted above if indicated by the\n\ntreatment duration, clinical indication, or patient population (provided neutralizing\n\nantibodies are not elicited to such an extent in repeated dose studies as to invalidate the\n\nresults). Conduct of carcinogenicity studies may be important in the following\n\ncircumstances:\n\nfor products where there are significant differences in biological effects to\n\nthe natural counterpart(s);\n\nfor products where modifications lead to significant changes in structure\n\ncompared to the natural counterpart; and\n\nfor products resulting in humans in a significant increase over the existing\n\nlocal or systemic concentration (i.e., pharmacological levels).\n\nV Need for additional testing [5]\n\nThe relevance of the results obtained from animal carcinogenicity studies for assessment of\n\nhuman safety are often cause for debate. Further research may be needed, investigating the mode of action, which may result in confirming the presence or the lack of carcinogenic potential for\n\nhumans. Mechanistic studies are useful to evaluate the relevance of tumor findings in animals for\n\nhuman safety.\n--------------------\nContext title: S1A The Need for Long-term Rodent Carcinogenicity Studies of Pharmaceuticals']",['ICH S9 should be consulted for the timing of phototoxicity studies.

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?\n--------------------\nContext: You not reprocess a rejected dietary supplement, or treat or provide an in-process adjustment to a component, packaging, or label to make it suitable for use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement unless quality control personnel conduct a material review and make a disposition decision to approve the reprocessing, treatment, or in-process adjustment (21 CFR 111.90(a)); ** You not reprocess any dietary supplement, or treat or provide an in-process adjustment to a component to make it suitable for use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, unless quality control personnel conduct a material review and make a disposition decision based on a scientifically valid reason and approves the reprocessing, treatment, or in-process adjustment (21 CFR 111.90(b)); and\n\nAny batch of dietary supplement that is reprocessed (or that contains components that you have treated, or to which you have made in-process adjustments to make them suitable for use in the manufacture of the dietary supplement) must meet requirements in 21 CFR 111.123(b) and be approved by quality control personnel before releasing for distribution (21 CFR 111.90(c)).\n\nD. Specific Requirements Regarding Specifications for Dietary Ingredients and Other Components 1. What does the DS CGMP rule require me to do to verify the identity of each dietary ingredient that I use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement? The DS CGMP rule requires you to conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any dietary ingredient, unless you petition us to exempt you from this requirement and we approve your petition (21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)). It is up to you to determine the appropriate test(s) or examination(s) necessary to verify the identity of a dietary ingredient. In some cases, a single test or examination may be all that is needed to verify the identity of a dietary ingredient; in other cases, it may be necessary to conduct more than one test or examination (72 FR 34752 at 34847).\n\n2. Is there an alternative to the requirement of 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1) for me to verify the identity of each dietary ingredient that I use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement? Yes. You may petition us for an alternative to the required 100 percent identity testing of components that are dietary ingredients (see 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(ii) of the identity testing interim final rule). You would submit the petition as a citizen petition in accordance with the provisions of 21 CFR 10.30 (21 CFR 111.75(a)(1) (ii)). Your petition must set forth the scientific rationale, and be accompanied by the supporting data and information, for proposed alternative testing that will demonstrate that there is no material diminution of assurance, compared to the assurance provided by 100 percent identity testing, of the identity of the dietary ingredient before use when the dietary ingredient is obtained from one or more suppliers identified in the petition (21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(ii)).\n\n(\\blacktriangle)If FDA grants the petition, you would conduct the tests and examinations for the dietary ingredient, otherwise required under 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(i), under the terms specified by FDA when the petition is granted (21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(ii)).\n3. What does the DS CGMP rule require me to do to ensure that specifications are met for components that I use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement? The DS CGMP rule requires you to confirm the identity of components, and determine whether other specifications for components (including dietary ingredients), are met, either by conducting appropriate tests or examinations or by relying on a certificate of analysis from the supplier of the component. (21 CFR 111.75(a)(2))\n4. What does the CGMP rule require me to do if I rely on a Certificate of Analysis from a supplier to confirm the identity of a component other than a dietary ingredient, or to determine whether any other component specifications are met? The DS CGMP rule requires that: * You first qualify the supplier by establishing the reliability of the supplier's certificate of analysis through confirmation of the results of the supplier's tests or examinations (21 CFR 111.75(a)(2)(ii)(A)). * The certificate of analysis include a description of the test or examination method(s) used, limits of the test or examinations, and actual results of the tests or examinations (21 CFR 111.75(a)(2)(ii)(B)). * You maintain documentation of how you qualified the supplier (21 CFR 111.75(a)(2)(ii)(C)). * You periodically re-confirm the supplier's certificate of analysis (21 CFR 111.75(a)(2)(ii)(D)). * Your quality control personnel review and approve the documentation setting forth the basis for qualification (and re-qualification) of any supplier (21 CFR 111.75(a)(2)(ii)(E)).\n5. Requirements for Representative and Reserve Samples 1. What representative samples does the DS CGMP rule require me to collect? The DS CGMP rule requires you to collect representative samples of the following materials: * Each unique lot of components, packaging, and labels that you use (21 CFR 111.80(a)); * In-process materials for each manufactured batch at points, steps, or stages, in the manufacturing process as specified in the master manufacturing 700\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:29]\n\nWhat container-closure system does the DS CGMP rule require me to use to hold reserve samples of packaged and labeled dietary supplements?\n\nThe DS CGMP rule requires you to use the following container-closure systems to hold reserve samples of dietary supplements:\n\nIf you are distributing a packaged and labeled dietary supplement, the DS CGMP rule requires you to keep the reserve samples in a container-closure system that is the same as the container-closure system in which the dietary supplement is distributed.\n\nIf you are distributing a dietary supplement for packaging and labeling, the DS CGMP rule requires you to keep the reserve samples in a container-closure system that provides essentially the same characteristics to protect against contamination or deterioration as the one in which you distributed the dietary supplement for packaging and labeling elsewhere. For example, if you distribute product in bulk using a polyethylene bottle that can hold 50 kilograms of the product, and there is an air space above the product, you would hold the reserve samples in a polyethylene bottle with an air space. However, you would use a bottle sized to fit the smaller amount you are holding in reserve.\n\nHow long does the DS CGMP rule require me to hold reserve samples of packaged and labeled dietary supplements?\n\nThe DS CGMP rule requires you to hold reserve samples of packaged and labeled dietary supplements for:\n\nOne year past the shelf life date (if shelf life dating is used); or\n\nTwo years from the date of distribution of the last batch of dietary supplements associated with the reserve sample.\n\n9 X. Subpart F - Production and Process Control: Requirements For Quality Control\n\n1. What does the DS CGMP rule require quality control personnel to do?\n\nThe DS CGMP rule requires quality control personnel to ensure that your manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record.\n\n2 What operations does the DS CGMP rule require quality control personnel to perform?\n\nThe DS CGMP rule requires quality control personnel to perform operations that include:\n\nApproving or rejecting all processes, specifications, written procedures, controls, tests, and examinations, and deviations from or modifications to them, that may affect the identity, purity, strength, or composition of a dietary supplement (21 CFR 111.105(a));\n\nReviewing and approving the documentation setting forth the basis for qualification of any supplier (21 CFR 111.105(b));\n\nReviewing and approving the documentation setting forth the basis for why meeting in-process specifications, in combination with meeting component specifications, will help ensure that the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplement are met (21 CFR 111.105(c));\n\nReviewing and approving the documentation setting forth the basis for why the results of appropriate tests or examinations for each product specification selected under 21 CFR 111.75(c)(1) will ensure that the finished batch of the dietary supplement meets product specifications (21 CFR 111.105(d));\n\nReviewing and approving the basis and the documentation for why any product specification is exempted from the verification requirements in 21 CFR 111.75(c) (1), and for why any component and in-process testing, examination, or monitoring, or other methods will ensure that such exempted product specification is met without verification through periodic testing of the finished batch (21 CFR 111.105(e));\n\nEnsuring that all representative samples are collected (21 CFR 111.105(f));\n\nEnsuring that all reserve samples are collected and held (21 CFR 111.105(g));\n\nDetermining whether all specifications established under 21 CFR 111.70(a) are met (21 CFR 111.105(h));\n\nLaboratory operations (21 CFR 111.110);\n\nOperations regarding material review and disposition decisions (21 CFR 111.113);\n\nOperations regarding equipment, instruments, and controls (21 CFR 111.117);\n\nOperations regarding components, packaging, and labels before use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement (21 CFR 111.120);\n\nOperations regarding the master manufacturing record, the batch production record, and manufacturing operations (21 CFR 111.123);\n\nPackaging and labeling operations (21 CFR 111.127);\n\nOperations regarding returned dietary supplements (21 CFR 111.130); and\n\nOperations regarding product complaints (21 CFR 111.135).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAny proposals for GMP relevant changes should be drafted, reviewed, and approved by the appropriate organizational units and reviewed and approved by the quality unit(s). (13.12)\n\nThe potential impact of the proposed change on the quality of the intermediate or API should be evaluated. A classification procedure may help in determining the level of testing, validation, and documentation needed to justify changes to a validated process. Changes can be classified (e.g., as minor or major) depending on the nature and extent of the changes, and the effects these changes may impart on the process. Scientific judgment should determine what additional testing and validation studies are appropriate to justify a change in a validated process. (13.13)\n\nWhen implementing approved changes, measures should be taken to ensure that all documents affected by the changes are revised. (13.14)\n\nAfter the change has been implemented, there should be an evaluation of the first batches produced or tested under the change. (13.15)\n\nThe potential for critical changes to affect established retest or expiry dates should be evaluated. If necessary, samples of the intermediate or API produced by the modified process can be placed on an accelerated stability program and/or can be added to the stability monitoring program. (13.16)\n\nCurrent dosage form manufacturers should be notified of changes from established production and process control procedures that can affect the quality of the API. (13.17)\n\nXiv Rejection and Re-Use of Materials (14)\n\nRejection (14.1)\n\nIntermediates and APIs failing to meet established specifications should be identified as such and quarantined. These intermediates or APIs can be reprocessed or reworked as described below.\n\nThe final disposition of rejected materials should be recorded. (14.10)\n\nReprocessing (14.2)\n\nIntroducing an intermediate or API, including one that does not conform to standards or specifications, back into the process and reprocessing by repeating a crystallization step or other appropriate chemical or physical manipulation steps (e.g., distillation, filtration, chromatography, milling) that are part of the established manufacturing process is generally considered acceptable. However, if such reprocessing is used for a majority of batches, such reprocessing should be included as part of the standard manufacturing process. (14.20)Continuation of a process step after an in-process control test has shown that the step is incomplete is considered to be part of the normal process. This is not considered to be reprocessing. (14.21)\n\nIntroducing unreacted material back into a process and repeating a chemical reaction is considered to be reprocessing unless it is part of the established process. Such reprocessing should be preceded by careful evaluation to ensure that the quality of the intermediate or API is not adversely affected due to the potential formation of by-products and over-reacted materials. (14.22)\n\nReworking (14.3)\n\nBefore a decision is taken to rework batches that do not conform to established standards or specifications, an investigation into the reason for nonconformance should be performed. (14.30)\n\nBatches that have been reworked should be subjected to appropriate evaluation, testing, stability testing if warranted, and documentation to show that the reworked product is of equivalent quality to that produced by the original process. Concurrent validation is often the appropriate validation approach for rework procedures. This allows a protocol to define the rework procedure, how it will be carried out, and the expected results. If there is only one batch to be reworked, a report can be written and the batch released once it is found to be acceptable. (14.31)\n\nProcedures should provide for comparing the impurity profile of each reworked batch against batches manufactured by the established process. Where routine analytical methods are inadequate to characterize the reworked batch, additional methods should be used. (14.32)\n\nRecovery of Materials and Solvents (14.4)\n\nRecovery (e.g., from mother liquor or filtrates) of reactants, intermediates, or the API is considered acceptable, provided that approved procedures exist for the recovery and the recovered materials meet specifications suitable for their intended use. (14.40)\n\nSolvents can be recovered and reused in the same processes or in different processes, provided that the recovery procedures are controlled and monitored to ensure that solvents meet appropriate standards before reuse or commingling with other approved materials. (14.41)\n\nFresh and recovered solvents and reagents can be combined if adequate testing has shown their suitability for all manufacturing processes in which they may be used. (14.42)\n\nThe use of recovered solvents, mother liquors, and other recovered materials should be adequately documented. (14.43)\n\nReturns (14.5)\n\nReturned intermediates or APIs should be identified as such and quarantined. (14.50)\n\n11.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the conditions under which returned intermediates or APIs have been stored or shipped before or during their return or the condition of their containers casts doubt on their quality, the returned intermediates or APIs should be reprocessed, reworked, or destroyed, as appropriate. (14.51)\n\nRecords of returned intermediates or APIs should be maintained. For each return, documentation should include the following: (14.52)\n\nName and address of the consignee\n\nIntermediate or API, batch number, and quantity returned\n\nReason for return\n\nUse or disposal of the returned intermediate or API\n\nXv. Complaints and Recalls (15)\n\nAll quality-related complaints, whether received orally or in writing, should be recorded and investigated according to a written procedure. (15.10)\n\nComplaint records should include the following: (15.11)\n\nName and address of complainant\n\nName (and, where appropriate, title) and phone number of person submitting the complaint\n\nComplaint nature (including name and batch number of the API)\n\nDate complaint is received\n\nAction initially taken (including dates and identity of person taking the action);\n\nAny follow-up action taken\n\nResponse provided to the originator of complaint (including date response sent)\n\nFinal decision on intermediate or API batch or lot\n\nRecords of complaints should be retained to evaluate trends, product-related frequencies, and severity with a view to taking additional, and if appropriate, immediate corrective action. (15.12)\n\nThere should be a written procedure that defines the circumstances under which a recall of an intermediate or API should be considered. (15.13)\n\nThe recall procedure should designate who should be involved in evaluating the information, how a recall should be initiated, who should be informed about the recall, and how the recalled material should be treated. (15.14)\n\nIn the event of a serious or potentially life-threatening situation, local, national, and/or international authorities should be informed and their advice sought. (15.15)\n\nXvi Contract Manufacturers (Including Laboratories) (16)\n\nAll contract manufacturers (including laboratories) should comply with the GMP defined in this guidance. Special consideration should be given to the prevention of cross-contamination and to maintaining traceability. (16.10)\n\nCompanies should evaluate any contractors (including laboratories) to ensure GMP compliance of the specific operations occurring at the contractor sites. (16.11)\n\nThere should be a written and approved contract or formal agreement between a company and its contractors that defines in detail the GMP responsibilities, including the quality measures, of each party. (16.12)\n\nA contract should permit a company to audit its contractor's facilities for compliance with GMP. (16.13)\n\nWhere subcontracting is allowed, a contractor should not pass to a third party any of the work entrusted to it under the contract without the company's prior evaluation and approval of the arrangements. (16.14)\n\nManufacturing and laboratory records should be kept at the site where the activity occurs and be readily available. (16.15)\n\nChanges in the process, equipment, test methods, specifications, or other contractual requirements should not be made unless the contract given is informed and approves the changes. (16.16)\n\nXvii Agents, Brokers, Traders, Distributors, Repackers, and Relabellers (17)\n\nApplicability (17.1)\n\nThis section applies to any party other than the original manufacturer who may trade and/or take possession, repack, relabel, manipulate, distribute, or store an API or intermediate. (17.10)\n\nAll agents, brokers, traders, distributors, repackers, and relabelers should comply with GMP as defined in this guidance. (17.11)\n\nTraceability of Distributed APIs and Intermediates (17.2)\n\nAgents, brokers, traders, distributors, repackers, or relabelers should maintain complete traceability of APIs and intermediates that they distribute. Documents that should be retained and available include the following: (17.20)* Identity of original manufacturer\n* Address of original manufacturer\n* Purchase orders\n* Bills of lading (transportation documentation)\n* Receipt documents\n* Name or designation of API or intermediate\n* Manufacturer's batch number\n* Transportation and distribution records\n* All authentic Certificates of Analysis, including those of the original manufacturer\n* Retest or expiry date\n\nQuality Management (17.3)\n\nAgents, brokers, traders, distributors, repackers, or relabelers should establish, document and implement an effective system of managing quality, as specified in Section 2.

61,"Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?","['--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: No, heroic measures need not be taken. Storage conditions should be consistent with the knowledge of the stability of the mixture under conditions of use and reasonable so as not to permit accelerated decomposition.\n\nWhat are the details of the Agency\'s reserve sample retention policy?\n\nWith regard to reserve sample retention, the GLPs provide as follows:\n\nReserve samples are to be retained from each batch of test and control article prepared in accord with section 58.105(a) for all nonclinical laboratory studies lasting more than 4 weeks. For the purposes of these sections, the 4-week period includes initial dosing to the final in vivo observations. Only sufficient sample need be retained to permit meaningful reanalysis. The samples need be retained either for the terms specified in section 58.105 or for the useful life of the sample (dependent on the stability or the quality of the sample) whichever is shorter. Storage conditions should be those commonly accepted as minimizing the deterioration of sample quality and need not require exhaustive study to determine those which maximize stability. All batches of test and control article mixtures are to be retained even if they are prepared daily.\n\nFor medical devices, how can stability be demonstrated any more effectively than by the continued functioning of a device within specifications during an in vivo nonclinical study?\n\nThe stated procedure is acceptable.\n\nThe cost of chemical assay development and assay of dosage forms prior to conducting acute studies far exceeds the cost of doing the experiment. Will data confirming the weighing, mixing and administration of the test article be considered sufficient?\n\nNo. The test article must be sufficiently characterized to ensure that the same article is used in any further studies.\n\nDoes FDA expect a firm to conduct long-term stability tests on test article-carrier mixtures, which are used within a day of preparation?\n\nThe firm must determine the stability of the mixtures over the period of their use. The GLPs require retention of samples of all batches of test article-carrier mixtures for studies that last longer than 4 weeks. The regulations do not require stability studies on such samples. Samples placed in storage may be analyzed periodically to determine their useful storage life.\n\nAm I correct in assuming that the chemical testing done by the sponsor to characterize the test article is not covered by the GLPs when the test article is subsequently submitted to a contract laboratory as a blind sample for safety testing?\n\nThe GLPs do not cover the basic exploratory chemical tests done to derive the specifications of the test article. They do cover those chemical tests done on discrete batches of test article to determine identity, strength, purity and composition.\n\nDoes the phrase ""mixtures of articles and carriers"" also refer to solutions and suspensions, e.g., a solution of a test article in distilled water?\n\nYes.\n\nFor acute studies, is it necessary for the laboratory to analyze each batch of test article-carrier mixture prior to dosing the test system?\n\nNo. Uniformity of the mixture must be known and periodic batch analyses need to be done.\n\nWill dialogues such as this and recent inspectional experience bring about substantive changes in the final regulations through FDA initiated proposed amendments? Whatchanges are anticipated in the reserve sample retention requirements?\n\nThe Agency does not believe the initiative to change the GLPs rests with FDA. Petitions for change may be submitted to the Agency in accord with the 21 CFR 10.30. As was mentioned at the meeting, the Agency recognizes that the reserve sample retention requirements are extensive and expensive and a petition for change would be considered.\n10. What guidelines can be used by a laboratory or sponsor in deciding how frequently concentration analyses should be made?\n\nThe Agency has not established guidelines with regard to the frequency of periodic reanalysis of test article-carrier mixtures. Enough batches should be analyzed to assure that the test systems are being exposed to the quantities of test article in the specified protocol.\n11. How long must one retain samples of feed used in nonclinical laboratory studies and should they be frozen?\n\nThe sample retention period differs for the various regulated products and the periods are listed in section 58.195. Feed samples need not be frozen for storage.\n12. What is the definition of carrier?\n\nCarrier is the material with which the test article is mixed for administration to the test system. It can be feed, water, solvents and excipients depending on dosage form and route of administration.\n13. Once stability of a given concentration of a test article-carrier mixture is substantiated, is it necessary to establish a stability profile for each batch at that concentration?\n\nNo. Stability need be determined only on a single batch of test article-carrier mixture; however, periodic reanalysis to determine concentration must be done.\n14. In the course of a 14-C tissue residue study in the target animal, is it necessary to retain:\n\nAll samples listed in a - d and f above should be retained for the term listed in section 58.195.\n\na. sample of the 14-C labeled drug,\n\nb. samples of the diet fed control and experimental animals,\n\nc. samples of urine and feces after completion of the analyses,d. samples of collected tissues after completion of the analyses, e. if they must be retained, for how long? f. is similar sample retention necessary when doing ""cold"" tissue residue studies in target animals?\n15. If a battery of different tests on a substance is being conducted by different contractors, is it necessary to run replicate stability analyses from each and every contractor especially when long-term stability has been documented for the substance?\n\nNo. Once stability has been determined in accord with good science, it is not necessary to continually replicate the stability determination.\n\n58.120 Protocol\n\n58.130 Conduct of a Nonclinical Laboratory Study\n\nIn as much as only wet tissues, blocks and slides are necessary to reconstruct the histopathologic aspects of a study by a third party, are written notes, tapes, etc. of the histopathological\'s thought process in arriving at a final report legitimately considered ""raw data"" in the presence of a signed and dated final report? Does the Agency have the right to inspect the written notes from the pathologist?\n\nRaw data in this case, refers only to the signed and dated final report of the pathologist. Agency investigators may wish to examine the interim notes and reports in an attempt to reconstruct the study but not to second-guess the scientific process used to arrive at the final report. The GLPs do not require that these interim reports and notes be retained.\n2. What is considered to be raw data in computer systems when the data is generated from dictated results?\n\nTranscribed dictation, which has been proofread and corrected for typographical -and transcription errors, is raw data.\n3. Do the GLPs require that the protocol be amended to reflect the actual starting date of the study?\n\nYes, this is a critical piece of information, which should be supplied by way of a formal protocol amendment.\n\nIt is said that raw data may be any verified exact copy of the original data. In a computerized data system where data is put directly on disc thence to tape, what documentation of the program performing this transfer is required to assure that the tape copy is exact? The standard operating procedures, which cover computer operations, should describe the computer program and the procedure used to assure the production of an exact tape copy.\n\nIf reformatting of data is done as part of the transfer described in question 4 above, is the new file not raw data even if all data is transferred intact although in a different organization? The Agency can not precisely answer this question without further details of the new data format.\n\nAre initials and dates on data printouts (e.g., scintillation counters, gas chromatographs), when these printouts include standards, sufficient documentation for standardization? Yes.\n\nIs there a time limit for submission of the final report of a nonclinical laboratory study after its conclusion? Generally no. On occasion, for marketed products, the Agency may establish time frames for study conduct. Of course alarming findings on marketed products should be reported as soon as possible.\n\nIs it permissible to list changes in a final report on a page, which is appended, to the original final report? Yes.\n\nDoes ""studies in progress on June 20, 1979"" refer to the phase of dosing of the test system or the phase post-dosing but not yet reported? The quotation pertains to all studies for which the final report has not yet been completed. Included are all post-dosing phases.\n\nThe final report requires a list of participants. Should this include technicians as well as people who perform support functions?The final report should include the name of the study director, the names of other scientists or professionals, and the names of all supervisory personnel involved in the study.\n\nWhen an analysis protocol is developed for the first time by using standard scientific technique, who shall validate the protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry'

Do the GLPs permit the designation of different study directors for each study under the contract?\n\nYes.\n\nDo the GLPs require that a sponsor approve the study director for a contracted study?\n\nNo. Testing facility management designates the study director.\n\nA firm functions as a primary contractor for nonclinical laboratory studies. The actual studies are then subcontracted to nonclinical laboratories. Is the firm considered to be a ""sponsor?""\n\nThe GLPs define ""sponsor"" as a person who initiates and supports a nonclinical laboratory study. Sponsorship in the cited example would be determined by the specific provisions of the contract.\n\nWho is responsible for test article characterization - the sponsor or the contractor?\n\nThe GLPs do not assign the responsibility in this area. The matter is a subject of the specific contractual arrangement between the sponsor and the contractor.\n\nDo contract laboratories have to show the sponsor\'s name on the Master Schedule Sheet or can this information be coded?\n\nThe information can be coded but the code must be revealed to the FDA investigator on request.\n\nA sponsor desires to contract for a nonclinical laboratory study to be conducted in a foreign laboratory. Must the sponsor notify the foreign laboratory that compliance with the U.S. GLPs is required?\n\nYes.\n\nMust a contractor include in the final report information on test article characterization and stability when such information has been collected by the sponsor?\n\nNo. The contractor should identify in its final report which information will be subsequently supplied by the sponsor.\n\nMust a sponsor reveal toxicology data already collected on a test article to a contract laboratory?\n\nNo. If use of the test article involves a potential danger to laboratory personnel, the contract laboratory should be advised so that appropriate precautions can be taken.\n\nSection 58.15 Inspection of a testing facility.\n\nWhat is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n\nThe FD-483 is the written notice of objectionable\n\npractices or deviations from the regulations that is prepared by the FDA investigator at the end of the inspection. The items listed on the form serve as the basis for the exit discussion with laboratory management at which time management can either agree or disagree with the items and can offer possible corrective actions to be taken.\n\nManagement may also respond to the district office in writing after it has had sufficient time to properly study the FD-483.\n\nWill a laboratory subsequently be notified of GLP deviations not listed on the FD-483?\n\nThis does happen. The FDA investigator prepares an establishment\n\ninspection report (EIR) which summarizes the observations made at the\n\nlaboratory and which contains exhibits concerning the studies audited\n\n(Protocols, SOPs, CV\'s, etc.). The EIR is then reviewed by District\n\npersonnel as well as headquarters personnel. This review may reveal\n\nadditional GLP deviations that should be and are communicated to\n\nlaboratory management.\n\nWhat kinds of domestic toxicology laboratory inspections does FDA\n\nperform and how frequently are they done?\n\nFDA performs four kinds of inspections related to the GLPs and\n\nnonclinical laboratory studies. These include: A GLP inspection -\n\nan inspection undertaken as a periodic, routine determination of a\n\nlaboratory\'s compliance with the GLPs, it includes examination of an\n\nongoing study as well as a completed study; A data audit - an\n\ninspection made to verify that the information contained in a final\n\nreport submitted to FDA is accurate and reflected by the raw data; A\n\ndirected inspection - any of a series of inspections conducted for\n\nvarious compelling reasons (questionable data in a final report, tips\n\nfrom informers, etc.); A followup inspection - an inspection made\n\nsometime after a GLP inspection which revealed objectionable\n\npractices and conditions. The purpose of the followup inspection is\n\nto assure that proper corrective actions have been taken. GLP\n\ninspections are scheduled once every two years whereas the other\n\nkinds of inspections are scheduled as needed.\n\nShould GLP investigators comment on the scientific merits of a protocol or the scientific interpretation given in the final report? No. Their function is strictly a noting of observations and verification. Scientific judgments are made by the respective headquarters review units that deal with the test article.\n\nCan a GLP EIR be reviewed by laboratory, management prior to issuance? No. The GLP EIR is an internal agency document which reflects the observations and findings of the FDA investigator. It can not be released to anyone outside the agency until agency action has been completed and the released copy is purged of all trade secret information. Laboratories that disagree with portions of the EIR should write a letter which contains the areas of disagreement to the local FDA District Office. The laboratories can ask that their letters accompany the EIR whenever it is requested under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nCan FDA investigators take photographs of objectionable practices and conditions? It is the agency position that photographs can be taken as a part of the inspection and this position has been sustained by a District Court decision.\n\nThe GLP Compliance Program requires the FDA investigator to select an ongoing study in order to inspect current laboratory operations. What criteria are used to select the study? The studies are selected in accord with agency priorities, i.e. the longest term study on the most significant product.\n\nDoes FDA inspect international nonclinical laboratories once every two years? No. Overseas laboratories are scheduled for inspection on the basis of having submitted to FDA the results of significant studies on important products.\n\nWhat background materials are used by agency investigators to prepare for a GLP inspection? Prior to an inspection, the following materials are usually reviewed:(a) The GLP regulations; (b) The Management Briefings Post-Conference Report; (c) Assorted memoranda and policy issuances; (d) The GLP Compliance Program; (e) The protocol of an ongoing study, if available; (f) The final report of a completed study, if available; (g) The inspection report of the most recent inspection.\n\nHow long does FDA allow a laboratory to effect corrective actions after an inspection has been made? If the results of an inspection reveal that significant deviations from the GLPs exist, the laboratory will be sent a regulatory letter that lists the major deviations and that requests a response within 10 days. The response should describe those actions that the laboratory has taken or plans to take to effect correction. The response should also encompass items that were listed on the FD-483 and those that were discussed during the exit discussion with laboratory management. A specific time table should be given for accomplishing the planned actions. The reasonableness of the time table will be determined by FDA compliance staff, based on the needs of the particular situation. For less significant deviations, the laboratory will be sent a Notice of Adverse Findings letter that also lists the deviations but that requests a response within 30 days. Again, the reasonableness of the response will be determined by FDA staff.\n\nDoes a laboratory\'s responsibility for corrective action listed on a FD-483 begin at the conclusion of an inspection or upon receipt of correspondence from the originating bureau in which corrective action is requested? The FD-483 lists observations of violative conditions that have the capability to adversely affect nonclinical laboratory studies. Corrective actions should be instituted as soon as possible.\n\nDoes FDA preannounce all GLP inspections? Laboratory management is informed of all routine GLP inspections prior to the inspection, but special compliance or investigative inspections need not be preannounced.\n\nSUSPART B ORGANIZATION AND PERSONNEL\n\nSection 58.29 Personnel.\n\nFor what sequence in the supervisory chain should position descriptions be available?\n\nPosition descriptions should be available for each individual engaged in or supervising the conduct of the study.\n\nShould current summaries of training and experience list attendance at scientific and technical meetings?\n\nYes. The agency considers such attendance as a valuable adjunct to the other kinds of training received by laboratory personnel.\n\nIf certain specialists (pathologists, statisticians, ophthalmologists, etc.) are contracted to conduct certain aspects of a study, need they be identified in the final report?\n\nYes.\n\nDoes the QAU have to be composed of technical personnel?\n\nNo. Management is, however, responsible for assuring that ""personnel clearly understand the functions they are to perform"" (Section 58.31(f)) and that each individual engaged in the study has the appropriate combination of education, training and experience (Section 58.29(a)).\n\nSection 58.31 Testing Facility Management.\n\nCan the study director be the chief executive of a nonclinical laboratory?\n\nNo. The GLPs require that there be a separation of function between the study director and the QAU director. In the example, the QAU director would be reporting to the study director.\n\nSection 58.33 Study director.\n\nThe GLPs permit the designation of an ""acting"" or ""deputy"" study director to be responsible for a study when the study director is on leave. Should study records identify the designated ""deputy"" or ""acting"" study director?\n\nYes.\n\nIs the study director responsible for adherence to the GLPs? Yes.\n\nSection 58.35 Quality Assurance Unit.\n\nAs a QAU person, I have no expertise in the field of pathology.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: SUSPART B ORGANIZATION AND PERSONNEL\n\nSection 58.29 Personnel.\n\nFor what sequence in the supervisory chain should position descriptions be available?\n\nPosition descriptions should be available for each individual engaged in or supervising the conduct of the study.\n\nShould current summaries of training and experience list attendance at scientific and technical meetings?\n\nYes. The agency considers such attendance as a valuable adjunct to the other kinds of training received by laboratory personnel.\n\nIf certain specialists (pathologists, statisticians, ophthalmologists, etc.) are contracted to conduct certain aspects of a study, need they be identified in the final report?\n\nYes.\n\nDoes the QAU have to be composed of technical personnel?\n\nNo. Management is, however, responsible for assuring that ""personnel clearly understand the functions they are to perform"" (Section 58.31(f)) and that each individual engaged in the study has the appropriate combination of education, training and experience (Section 58.29(a)).\n\nSection 58.31 Testing Facility Management.\n\nCan the study director be the chief executive of a nonclinical laboratory?\n\nNo. The GLPs require that there be a separation of function between the study director and the QAU director. In the example, the QAU director would be reporting to the study director.\n\nSection 58.33 Study director.\n\nThe GLPs permit the designation of an ""acting"" or ""deputy"" study director to be responsible for a study when the study director is on leave. Should study records identify the designated ""deputy"" or ""acting"" study director?\n\nYes.\n\nIs the study director responsible for adherence to the GLPs? Yes.\n\nSection 58.35 Quality Assurance Unit.\n\nAs a QAU person, I have no expertise in the field of pathology. How do I audit pathology findings?\n\nThe QAU is not expected to perform a scientific evaluation of a study nor to ""second-guess"" the scientific procedures that are used. QAU inspections are made to ensure that the GLPs, SOPs and protocols are being followed and that the data summarized in the final report accurately reflect the results of the study. A variety of procedures can be used to do this but certainly the procedures should include an examination and correlation of the raw data records.\n\nMust the QAU keep copies of all protocols and amendments and SOPs and amendments?\n\nThe QAU must keep copies of all protocols as currently amended. The only SOPs that the QAU are required to keep are those concerned with the operations and procedures of the QAU.\n\nDoes the QAU have to monitor compliance with regulations promulgated by other government agencies?\n\nThe GLPs do not require this.\n\nCan an individual who is involved in a nonclinical laboratory study perform QAU functions for portions of the study that the individual is not involved with?\n\nNo. However, the individual can perform QAU functions for a study that he/she is not involved with.\n\nDoes the QAU review amendments to the final report? Yes.\n\nWhat studies are required to be listed on the master schedule sheet?\n\nThe master schedule sheet should list all nonclinical laboratory studies conducted on FDA regulated products and intended to support an application for a research or marketing permit.\n\nMay the QAU in its periodic reports to management and the study director recommend actions to solve existing problems? Yes.\n\nIf raw data are transcribed and sent to the sponsor for (a) preparing the data in computer format or (b) performing a statistical analysis, what are the responsibilities of the QAU?\n\nFor (a) the QAU should assure that the computer formatted data accurately reflect the raw data. For (b) the statistical analyses would comprise a report from a participating scientist, therefore it should be checked by QAU and appended to the final report.\n9. Can the QAU also be responsible for maintaining the laboratory archives?\n\nYes.\n10. Can a QAU be constituted as\'a single person?\n\nYes, provided that the workload is not excessive and other duties do not prevent the person from doing an adequate job. It would be prudent to designate an alternate in case of disability/vacations/ etc.\n11. Who is responsible for defining study phases and designating critical study phases and can these be covered in the SOP?\n\nThe GLPs do not isolate this responsibility. Logically, the task should be done by the study director and the participating scientists working in concert with the QAU and laboratory management. It can be covered by an SOP.\n\nSUBPART C FACILITIES\n\nSection 58.41 General.\n\nNo questions were asked on the subject.\n\nSection 58.43 Animal Care Facilities.\n\nDo the GLPs require clean/dirty separation for the animal care areas?\n\nNo. They do require adequate separation of species and studies.\n\nDo the GLPs require that separate animal rooms be used to house test systems and conduct different studies? No. The GLPs require separate areas adequate to assure proper separation of test systems, isolation of individual projects, animal quarantine and routine or specialized housing of animals, as necessary to achieve the study objectives.\n\nDo the GLPs require that access to animal rooms be limited only to authorized individuals? No. However, undue stresses and potentially adverse influences on the test system should be minimized. Section 58.45 Animal Supply Facilities. No questions were asked on the subject. Section 58.47 Facilities for Handling Test and Control Articles.\n\nDo test and control articles have to be maintained in locked storage units? No, but accurate records of test and control article accountability must be maintained. Section 58.49 Laboratory operation areas. No questions were asked on the subject. Section 58.51 Specim and data storage facilities. 1. What do the GLPs require with regard to facilities for the archives? Space should be provided for archives limited to access by authorized personnel. Storage conditions should minimize deterioration of documents and specimens. Section 58.53 Administrative and personnel facilities. No questions were asked on the subject.\n\nSUBPART D\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nSection 58.61 Equipment design.\n\nNo questions were asked on the subject.\n\nSection 58.63 Maintenance and calibration of equipment.\n\nHas FDA established guidelines for the frequency of calibration of equipment (balances) used in nonclinical laboratory studies?\n\nThe agency has not established guidelines for the frequency of calibration of balances used in nonclinical laboratory studies. This would be a large undertaking in part due to the wide variety of equipment that is available and to the differing workloads that would be imposed on the equipment. It is suggested that you work with the equipment manufacturers and your study directors to arrive at a suitable calibration schedule. The key point is that the calibration should be frequent enough to assure data validity. The maintenance and calibration schedules should be part of the SOPs for each instrument.\n\nWhen an equipment manufacturer performs the routine equipment maintenance, do the equipment manufacturer\'s maintenance procedures have to be described in the facilities\' SOPs?\n\nNo. The facilities\' SOPs would have to state that maintenance was being performed by the equipment manufacturer according to their own procedures.\n\nSUBPART E\n\nTESTING FACILITIES OPERATION\n\nSection 58.81 Standard Operating Procedures.\n\nWhat amount of detail should be included in the standard operating procedures (SOPs)?\n\nThe GLPs do not specify the amount of detail to be included in the SOPs. The SOPs are intended to minimize the introduction of systematic error into a study by ensuring that all personnel will be familiar with and use the same procedures. The adequacy of the SOPs is a key responsibility of management. A guideline of adequacy that could be used is to determine whether the SOPs are understood and can be followed by trained laboratory personnel.\n\nCan the study director authorize changes in the SOPs? No. Approval of the SOPs and changes thereto is a function of laboratory management.\n\nHow many copies of the complete laboratory SOPs are needed? Each work station should have access to the SOPs applicable to the work performed at the station. A complete set of the SOPs, including authorized amendments, should be maintained in the archives.\n\nWho approves the SOPs of the Quality Assurance Unit? Laboratory Management.\n\nTo what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs? The GLPs do not specify the contents of individual SOPs, but the SOP that deals with computerized data acquisition should include the purpose of the program, the specifications, the procedures, the end products, the language, the interactions with other programs, procedures for assuring authorized data entry and access, procedures for making and authorizing changes to the program, the source listing of the program and perhaps even a flow chart. The laboratory\'s computer specialists should determine what other characteristics need to be described in the SOP.\n\nSection 58.83 Reagents and solutions.\n1. What are the GLP requirements for labeling of reagents purchased directly from manufacturers? All reagents used in a nonclinical laboratory have to be labeled to indicate identity, titer or concentration, storage requirements, and expiration date. Purchased reagents usually carry all these items except for the expiration date, so the laboratory should label the reagent containers with an expiration date. The expiration date selected should be in line with laboratory experience and need not require specific stability testing.\n2. How extensive should the procedures be for confirming the quality of incoming reagents used in nonclinical laboratory studies? Laboratory management should make this decision but the SOPs should document the actual procedures used.\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Questions and Answers'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: We feel that storage of test article - diet mixtures in animal rooms in well-labeled, vermin proof containers will lead to fewer errors than storage in a central common area. Is this permissible in light of section 58.47(b)?\n\nYes. Section 58.47(b) requires separate areas for test article diet mixtures, which need not be a separate common area or a separate room. In the cited example, each animal room could have a separate area devoted to feed storage.\n\nIs it necessary to provide space for the isolation of diseased animals if they are immediately removed from the study and sacrificed?\n\nNo. The intent of the regulations is to ensure that diseased animals are handled in a manner that will not adversely impact on the nonclinical laboratory study.\n\nIs it acceptable for a nonclinical laboratory to quarantine all newly arrived animals for the required period and then begin the study in the same area?\n\nYes.\n\n58.61 Equipment Design\n\nMaintenance and Calibration of Equipment\n\nRegarding GLP required standard operating procedures for preventive maintenance, is it expected that detailed instructions be prepared for each piece of laboratory equipment? Can the standard operating procedures refer to an equipment manual for detailed instructions as appropriate?\n\nSpecific standard operating procedures are required for each piece of equipment. These procedures can incorporate verbatim the instructions contained in the equipment manuals.\n\nIn order to calibrate a scale used to weigh large farm animals is it necessary to use a set of standard weights similar to those used for laboratory animal scales only much, much heavier?\n\nIn this case, calibration and maintenance of a periodic nature can be performed by a manufacturer\'s representative and the records should reflect these operations.\n\nAdditionally, calibration can be accomplished through use of secondary standards.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:19]\n\nTextbooks and manufacturer\'s literature are not necessarily complete and it is highly unlikely that such materials could be used without modifications to more precisely fit a laboratory\'s needs. These materials may be used, however, as supplements to and references for standard operating procedures.\n8. In the absence of the ""Guide for the Care of Laboratory Animals,"" what reference will FDA use in inspection of facilities for determining appropriate cage sizes, animal environment, animal facilities, veterinary care, and animal care practices?\n\nReferences to the guide and regulations promulgated by other agencies have been deleted from the final order on the GLPs. Nonetheless, these materials do provide guidance on the current state-of-the-art for animal care and they are helpful both to the laboratory and to the Agency in determining the adequacy of animal care practices.\n9. Are expiration dates required on purchased chemicals and reagents present in the laboratory?\n\nYes, expiration dates are required on such chemicals and reagents when they are used in a nonclinical laboratory study.\n10. Are expiration dates required on prepared solutions made from purchased chemicals and reagents?\n\nYes.\n11. Are stability data required to substantiate the expiration dates of reagents and solutions?\n\nNot necessarily. It is sufficient to use scientific judgement coupled with literature documentation, manufacturer\'s literature or laboratory experience.\n12. With respect to evaluating the effectiveness of reagents and solutions throughout their shelf life, what requirements are there on the certification of efficacy of the test reagents used to evaluate the effectiveness of the GLP reagents and solutions?\n\nStandard operating procedures for the analyses should provide such efficacy tests for reagents and solutions as the scientific literature, the manufacturer\'s literature, and the laboratory experience indicate are necessary.\n\nWhat does the Agency expect in the area of analysis of feed and drinking water for known interfering contaminants?The GLPs require analysis for and control of contaminants known to be capable of interfering with the nonclinical laboratory study and which are reasonably expected to be present in the feed and water. Certain contaminants may affect study outcome by masking the effects of the test article, as was the case in recent toxicological studies of pentachlorophenol and diethylstilbestrol. In these studies the feeds used as carriers of the test article were found to contain varying quantities of pentachlorophenol and estrogenic activity. These contaminants invalidated the studies by producing erratic results. The use of positive and negative controls in these studies was insufficient to compensate for the variability in the concentration of the contaminants.\n\nTo implement this provision of the GLPs, the study director and associated scientists should consider each study in the light of its length, the expected toxicological endpoints and pharmacological activity of the test article, the test system, the route of administration, and other relevant factors to determine what contaminants could reasonably be expected to interfere. These considerations coupled with scientific literature, experience and anticipated levels of contamination should be used to determine which contaminants should be controlled and analyzed.\n\nIt is unlikely that a blanket analysis conducted either by feed manufacturers or water authorities would be sufficient. These analyses would either provide data on contaminants which would not be expected to interfere or neglect to provide data for certain interfering contaminants.\n\nFor acute studies in which the test article dosage is sufficiently high, in most instances, to overcome any effects from feed or water contaminants, the analytical requirement would be minimized.\n14. Study directors are frequently unfamiliar with certain aspects of their studies (e.g. chemical analyses, histopathology, etc.). Is it appropriate for the study director to authorize all deviations from standard operating procedures?\n\nYes. As the focal point for study direction and conduct, the study director must be made aware of and react positively to any deviation from a standard operating procedure.\n\nWhere necessary, a study director should consult with other scientists to determine the impact of a deviation on the study.\n\nIs it required that the quality assurance unit test the reagents used in a nonclinical laboratory study?\n\nWhatever testing is required by section 58.83 of the GLPs for reagents and solutions may be accomplished by those organizational units that normally conduct such testing.\n\nIt need not be done by the quality assurance unit.\n\nMay reagent grade chemicals be used in a study on the basis of label analysis declaration?Yes, provided that the reagent is labeled with an expiration date.\n\nIf animals do not have some form of unique identification actually attached to the animal, is identification using only cage cards appropriate? If the test system is housed in individual cages, which are uniquely identified, must each and every animal be identified?\n\nSection 58.90(d) requires that animals which are to be removed from their home cages or which are to be observed over a long period of time have appropriate identification. Therefore, identification using only cage cards is not sufficient in most cases and each animal should be identified.\n\n58.10 Test and Control Article Characterization\n\n58.10 Test and Control Article Handling\n\n58.113 Mixtures of Articles with Carriers\n\nAre laboratories required to go beyond shelf storage of reserve samples of test article-carrier mixtures to whatever methods (e.g., cryogenic temperatures), regardless of cost that will maximize stability? Does the Agency expect stability studies to determine optimum storage conditions for each sample?\n\nNo, heroic measures need not be taken. Storage conditions should be consistent with the knowledge of the stability of the mixture under conditions of use and reasonable so as not to permit accelerated decomposition.\n\nWhat are the details of the Agency\'s reserve sample retention policy?\n\nWith regard to reserve sample retention, the GLPs provide as follows:\n\nReserve samples are to be retained from each batch of test and control article prepared in accord with section 58.105(a) for all nonclinical laboratory studies lasting more than 4 weeks. For the purposes of these sections, the 4-week period includes initial dosing to the final in vivo observations. Only sufficient sample need be retained to permit meaningful reanalysis. The samples need be retained either for the terms specified in section 58.105 or for the useful life of the sample (dependent on the stability or the quality of the sample) whichever is shorter. Storage conditions should be those commonly accepted as minimizing the deterioration of sample quality and need not require exhaustive study to determine those which maximize stability. All batches of test and control article mixtures are to be retained even if they are prepared daily.\n\nFor medical devices, how can stability be demonstrated any more effectively than by the continued functioning of a device within specifications during an in vivo nonclinical study?\n\nThe stated procedure is acceptable.\n\nThe cost of chemical assay development and assay of dosage forms prior to conducting acute studies far exceeds the cost of doing the experiment. Will data confirming the weighing, mixing and administration of the test article be considered sufficient?\n\nNo. The test article must be sufficiently characterized to ensure that the same article is used in any further studies.\n\nDoes FDA expect a firm to conduct long-term stability tests on test article-carrier mixtures, which are used within a day of preparation?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: 58.185 Reporting of Nonclinical Laboratory Study Results\n\n58.190 Storage and Retrieval of Records and Data\n\n58.195 Retention of Records\n\nWhat types of storage conditions are required for the storage of retained specimens?\n\nThe Agency has not developed guidelines for storage conditions. The Agency does not expect heroic measures to be used, but conditions should be reasonable in light of the nature of the specimen. Storage conditions, which foster accelerated deterioration, should be avoided.\n\nIn section 58.185, it is stated that test and control article identification and characterization must appear in the final report signed by the study director. However, if the study director is affiliated with a contract laboratory, he/she has no need to know such details of a proprietary test article. Do you agree that such information can be appended to the final report by the sponsor rather than be provided by the study director?\n\nYes.\n\nIs the storage of archival material (tissues, slides, raw data) the responsibility of the testing laboratory or can this responsibility be assigned to the sponsor of the study?\n\nThe GLPs permit these materials to be stored in the archives of either the testing laboratory or the sponsor. If they are stored in the sponsor\'s archives, the archives of the testing laboratory must identify the storage location.\n\nIf a sponsor agrees to characterize and store test articles submitted for study to a contractor, must the contractor also verify the characterization and provide storage for the test articles? No, but the contractor must identify the storage location.\n\nWhat is the ""completion date"" of a nonclinical laboratory study? The completion date is the date that the study director signs the final report. Some discretion must be used however, since the protocol calls for a proposed ""completion date."" In this case, it would be adequate for the protocol to list a completion date for the in vivo phase and qualify it as such.\n\nWith respect to archival material, what is required to be listed as the date of the study? The study date would be the same as the completion date of the study.\n\nDo all studies on a test article need to be submitted in support of an application for a research or marketing permit? All studies need be submitted, however, not all studies need be conducted in accord with the GLPs. The conforming amendments provide that a statement be included in the submission which identifies which studies have not been conducted in compliance with the GLPs and the extent of the non-compliance.\n\nWhat should be included in the signed and dated reports of the individual scientists participating in the study? The final report prepared by the study director should have appended to it all reports written by other participating scientists. These reports should contain sufficient detail to enable the study director to write a final report, which reflects the results of the study.\n\nSubpart K Disqualification of Testing Facilities\n\n58.200 Purposes\n\n58.202 Grounds for Disqualification\n\n58.204 Notice of And Opportunity for Hearing on Proposed Disqualification\n\n58.210 actions UPON DISQUALIFICATION\n\n58.213 PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION REGARDING\n\nDISQUALIFICATION\n\n58.215 alternative OR ADDtional actions TO DISQUALIFICATION\n\n58.217 suspension OR TERMINATION OF A TESTING FACILITY BY A SPONSOR\n\n58.219 reinstatement OF A DISQUALIFI TESTING FACILITY\n\nENFORCEMENT STRategy\n\nWhat can FDA do to force a laboratory to take corrective actions to achieve compliance with the GLPs? Are warnings given to the laboratory?\n\nFDA has a number of regulatory sanctions, which can be brought to bear on a violative firm in order to, bring about compliance with the law. These include rejection of studies, withdrawal of approval of marketed products if such products are supported by defective studies, prosecution and, after June 20, 1979, disqualification of the laboratory. FDA\'s present GLP enforcement policy is to provide adequate warning and to afford a reasonable opportunity to take corrective action.\n\nDisqualifying a laboratory on the basis of failing to comply with one or more provisions of the GLPs raises the question of whether all violations are considered-equally, are weighted, or are evaluated scientifically to consider the impact on the outcome of the study.\n\nA laboratory will not be considered for disqualification unless all of the following criteria are met:\n\nThe violations of the various provisions of the GLPs are evaluated to assess their impact on the validity of the studies. It is impossible to assign weights to the various provisions of the GLPs. Noncompliance with the various provisions must be evaluated in the context of the entire laboratory operation and the kinds of studies being performed. Thus, a violation of a specific provision may be critical for one laboratory doing long-term studies and not for another laboratory engaged in short term studies.\n\na. failure to comply with one or more provisions of the GLPs;\n\nb. the noncompliance adversely affected the validity of the studies;\n\nc. other lesser regulatory actions (warnings, rejection of individual studies) have not or will not be adequate to achieve compliance with the GLPs.\n\nIf a laboratory is disqualified, how long does the disqualification last? Under what conditions does reinstatement occur?The disqualification will last until the laboratory submits in writing to the Commissioner, reasons for reinstatement including a detailed description of the corrective actions it has taken to assure that the violations which led to disqualification will not recur. Reinstatement will depend upon one or more inspections which show that the laboratory is in compliance with GLPs.\n\nParagraph 231 of the preamble to the GLPs states: ""The order of disqualification creates a rebuttable presumption that all studies previously conducted by the facility are unacceptable. Paragraph 226 states: ""Studies conducted at facilities that are in substantial compliance will be presumed to be valid."" Can we presume that studies conducted during a period when a lab is found to be substantially in compliance will be accepted by FDA as valid even if the laboratory is disqualified at a later date?\n\nYes, unless FDA develops information to the contrary.\n4. If a contract laboratory is disqualified because of a study performed for one sponsor, what effect does this have on other studies performed for other sponsors? What about studies underway at the time of disqualification?\n\nFDA will not disqualify a laboratory on the basis of one invalid study. Disqualification is viewed as a most serious regulatory sanction by FDA and will only be imposed when the facts demonstrate that the laboratory is incapable of producing valid scientific data and will not take adequate corrective measures. In the event a laboratory is disqualified, all studies performed by the laboratory, including those in progress are presumed to be unacceptable unless the sponsors of those studies can establish, to the satisfaction of FDA, that the studies were not affected by the circumstances that led to the disqualification.\n5.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: If reformatting of data is done as part of the transfer described in question 4 above, is the new file not raw data even if all data is transferred intact although in a different organization? The Agency can not precisely answer this question without further details of the new data format.\n\nAre initials and dates on data printouts (e.g., scintillation counters, gas chromatographs), when these printouts include standards, sufficient documentation for standardization? Yes.\n\nIs there a time limit for submission of the final report of a nonclinical laboratory study after its conclusion? Generally no. On occasion, for marketed products, the Agency may establish time frames for study conduct. Of course alarming findings on marketed products should be reported as soon as possible.\n\nIs it permissible to list changes in a final report on a page, which is appended, to the original final report? Yes.\n\nDoes ""studies in progress on June 20, 1979"" refer to the phase of dosing of the test system or the phase post-dosing but not yet reported? The quotation pertains to all studies for which the final report has not yet been completed. Included are all post-dosing phases.\n\nThe final report requires a list of participants. Should this include technicians as well as people who perform support functions?The final report should include the name of the study director, the names of other scientists or professionals, and the names of all supervisory personnel involved in the study.\n\nWhen an analysis protocol is developed for the first time by using standard scientific technique, who shall validate the protocol?\n\nThe Agency does not per se validate protocols. Persons developing new protocols may submit them to the responsible bureau for review and comment prior to initiating a nonclinical laboratory study.\n* One of the testing deficiencies found in the early Agency investigations of nonclinical studies was protocol changes that were made without informing the sponsor. The changes prejudiced the validity of the studies. Accordingly, the GLPs require that each study have a specific protocol, which is attested to by the sponsor.\n* The identity of the individual collecting data entered into a computer can be recorded via the use of a code known only to the individual but directly identifying the individual; similarly the identity of the individuals witnessing or reviewing the data can be recorded. Is this acceptable?\n\nYes, this procedure is acceptable. The key to the code must be made available to Agency investigators. Do note, however, the final GLPs do not require that data entries need be witnessed by a second person.\n* Does the following proposal on data entry to computer files satisfy the GLP intent?\n\nData is entered through keyboard commands and stored in a ""temporary"" computer file with accompanying date, time, and analyst codes. The analyst may be technician level personnel. At the conclusion of a set of observations, no more than one day\'s worth, the data in the ""temporary file"" is reviewed by a scientist (this person may or may not be the same person who entered the original data) and ""corrected"" for any typing or entry errors. When it is determined that the data are correct, the data are transferred to a ""permanent"" computer file. Only authorized personnel may make changes to the ""permanent"" file.\n\nNo audit trail is kept for changes to ""temporary"" file. All changes to permanent file are recorded in a change file with appropriate data, personnel code, and comments regarding reason for change and original entry.\n\nNo. This method would permit unauthorized tampering with the temporary file before the raw data are transferred to the permanent file.\n* When should a protocol amendment issue? Should it be as soon as possible or could a list of all deviations from a protocol be prepared at the end of the study?If the deviation from the protocol is intended to be permanent, the protocol should be amended as soon as possible. If the deviation is an error, it should be promptly corrected and noted in the raw data.\n* 16. Section 58.120 describes a sixteen-part protocol and section 58.185 describes a fourteen part final report. Must all of these be included in protocols and reports for LD 50\'s and other short-term tests?\n\nYes.\n* 17. Is a protocol required for routine research and experimentation?\n\nProtocols are required for all studies covered by the GLPs.\n* 18. If all raw data are not required in a final report, does this mean, for example, that weekly body weight or food intake averages can be in a report without the individual animal data?\n\nThe data appearing in a final report depends on the type of study and the kind of regulated product. Specific advice can be obtained by contacting the Agency bureau, which has responsibility for the regulated product.\n* 19. If a compound or formula is proprietary, must the final report describe its detailed composition or chemical structure?\n\nIf the proprietary material is a commercially available article to be used as a control, the final report need only describe the trade or chemical name, the source and the manufacturer\'s batch number.\n* 20. How does the requirement for ""approval"" of protocols apply to ""in house"" studies which are\' conducted in the laboratories of the actual ""sponsor?"" Who approves? What is an ""approved"" protocol?\n\nThe word ""approved"" was retained in the final order to emphasize that a sponsor should have a mechanism for evaluation and approval of initial protocols and all amendments. The specifics of the mechanism can vary but a formal mechanism should be in place.\n* 21. Must the protocol contain both the name and the code number of the test article?\n\nNo, either designation is acceptable.\n* 22. Section 58.120 states that the protocol shall contain the records to be maintained. Is this intended as a detailed list of each data form to be generated?No, in this case generalized statements would be satisfactory.\n23. How much raw data must be entered into notebooks when performing well-documented routine tests? Basically, the GLPs define raw data as the immediate results of original observations. All such immediate results must be entered.\n24. What is meant by the statement in section 58.120(a)(12), which pertains to the method by which the degree of absorption of the test and control articles by the test system will be determined? The GLPs do not mandate that absorption studies need be done, or which kind of study is satisfactory. The GLPs do require, however, that the protocol describe the method used if one is necessary to achieve the study objectives.\n25. Please clarify the issue of having to provide reasons for all corrections to data entries. It seems unreasonable to require reasons for ""obvious"" error corrections such as misspellings, transposed numbers, and wrong year early in a calendar year. It must be remembered that ""raw data"" is basically the results of original observations. Thus, the wrong year is not raw data and can be easily corrected. Misspellings may or may not be raw data whereas in all probability numbers are raw data. The Agency believes that it is sometimes difficult for a second party, such as the personnel in your quality assurance unit, to distinguish ""obvious"" errors. Consequently, the Agency insists that all corrections to raw data entries be justified.\n26. How and to what extent is the selection of the test system to be justified in the protocol? Usually, the test system is selected after consideration of the state-of-the-art of toxicology testing in the area of interest. The protocol need not contain extensive justification.\n27. Are we expected to label all specimens (e.g. serum, blood, urine, tissue slides) with their exact nature?\n\nYes. Such information is useful in preventing mix-ups.\n28. Why does ""test system, study, nature and date of collection"" have to be located on a specimen container? Can such information be coded?Specimen refers to any material derived from a test system for examination or analysis. Consequently, blood, tissues, urine, feces, etc. are considered to be specimens whose containers must carry the required label information. Such information will help preclude mix-ups in the subsequent handling of the specimens. Accession numbers or code numbers can be used for samples of specimens, which are subjected to further analysis. For example, in histopathology the excised fixed tissue is a specimen, which must carry all the label information. However, the blocks and slides prepared from that tissue could be identified by accession numbers. Similarly, in tissue residue analysis, the excised tissue is a specimen; whereas, tissue samples, which are homogenized and otherwise prepared for further analysis, are not specimens and need not carry full labeling.\n\n58.185 Reporting of Nonclinical Laboratory Study Results\n\n58.190 Storage and Retrieval of Records and Data\n\n58.195 Retention of Records\n\nWhat types of storage conditions are required for the storage of retained specimens?\n\nThe Agency has not developed guidelines for storage conditions. The Agency does not expect heroic measures to be used, but conditions should be reasonable in light of the nature of the specimen. Storage conditions, which foster accelerated deterioration, should be avoided.\n\nIn section 58.185, it is stated that test and control article identification and characterization must appear in the final report signed by the study director. However, if the study director is affiliated with a contract laboratory, he/she has no need to know such details of a proprietary test article. Do you agree that such information can be appended to the final report by the sponsor rather than be provided by the study director?\n\nYes.\n\nIs the storage of archival material (tissues, slides, raw data) the responsibility of the testing laboratory or can this responsibility be assigned to the sponsor of the study?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry']","['No. The GLPs require that, if absorption studies are needed to achieve the scientific objectives of the study plan, the protocol should describe the methods to be used to determine absorption.

While not within the scope of this guideline, the principles outlined can be applicable to the nonclinical testing of vaccines for other indications as well (e.g., cancer).\n\nThe types of reproductive and/or developmental toxicity studies used for preventative and therapeutic vaccines depend on the target population for the vaccine and the relevant reproductive risk. Generally, DART studies are not warranted for vaccines being developed for neonates, pre-pubertal children, or geriatric populations.\n\nFor reproductive toxicity studies of vaccines, it is typically sufficient to assess a single dose level capable of eliciting an immune response in the animal model (Section 5.1.2), using the clinical route of administration. This single dose level should be the maximum human dose without correcting for body weight (i.e., 1 human dose = 1 animal dose). If it is not feasible to administer the maximum human dose to the animal because of a limitation in total volume that can be administered, or because of dose-limiting toxicity, whether local or systemic, a dose that exceeds the human dose on a mg/kg basis can be used. To use a reduced dose, justification as to why a full human dose cannot be used in an animal model should be provided.\n\nThe vaccination regimen should maximize maternal antibody titers and/or immune response throughout the embryonic, fetal, and early postnatal periods. Timing and number of doses will depend on the onset and duration of the immune response of the particular vaccine. When developing vaccines to be given during pregnancy, a justification should be provided for the specific study design, based upon its intended use (e.g., protecting the mother during pregnancy or protecting the child early postnatally).\n\nDaily dosing regimens can lead to overexposure to the vaccine constituents. Episodic dosing of pregnant animals rather than daily dosing is recommended. Also, episodic dosing better approximates the proposed clinical immunization schedule for most preventive and therapeutic vaccines. Considering the short gestational period of routine animal species, it is generally recommended to administer a priming dose(s) to the animals several days or weeks prior to mating in order to elicit peak immune response during the critical phases of pregnancy (i.e., the period of organogenesis). The dosing regimen can be modified according to the intended vaccination schedule in humans.\n\nAt least one dose should be administered during early organogenesis to evaluate potential direct embryotoxic effects of the components of the vaccine formulation and to maintain a high antibody response throughout the remainder of gestation. If embryo-fetal toxicity is observed, this can be further assessed using subgroups of animals that are dosed at certain time points.\n--------------------\nContext title: S5-R3_Step4_Guideline_2020_0218_1'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Genetically modified models can be used to provide information about on-target effects of a pharmaceutical on DART parameters through permanent or conditional alterations in target activity. Such models can inform on whether the biology of the target is closely linked to adverse effects on reproduction and development in routine test species.\n\nWhen the pharmaceutical does not have adequate activity against the target in the routine test species, surrogate molecules can be used to assess potential adverse effects on reproduction and development.\n\n6 Dose level selection, route of administration and schedule\n\nThe choice of dose levels, schedule and route of administration are important study design considerations and should be based on all available information (e.g., pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and dose range finding studies). Guidance on the principles of dose selection for small molecules and biopharmaceuticals is given in ICH M3 and ICH S6, respectively. When sufficient information on tolerability in the test system is not available, dose range finding studies are advisable.\n\nDose Selection\n\nThere are a number of dose selection endpoints that can be used for DART studies. All endpoints discussed in this section are considered equally appropriate in terms of study design. The high dose in the definitive studies should be one that is predicted to comply with one or more of the concepts set forth in sections 6.1.1 to 6.1.5 below. The selected doses should take into account observations made in previous studies (e.g., repeated-dose, TK, DRF, etc.). There can be instances where fewer than three dose levels are sufficient to provide the necessary information for risk assessment.\n\nJustification for high dose selection using endpoints other than those discussed below can be made on a case-by-case basis.\n\n6.1.1 Toxicity-based Endpoint\n\nThis endpoint is based on inducing a minimal level of toxicity in the parental animals at the high dose. Factors limiting the high dose determined from previously conducted studies could include, but are not limited to:\n\nAlterations in body weight (gain or absolute; either reductions or increases). Minor, transient changes in body weight gain or body weight are not appropriate for dose selection. When assessing weight change effects, the entire dosing duration of the study should be considered.\n\nExaggerated pharmacological responses (e.g., excessive sedation or hypoglycemia)\n\nToxicological responses (e.g., convulsions, excessive embryo-fetal lethality, clinical pathology perturbations).

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Dose Range-Finding Studies\n\nA DRF study with small group sizes of juvenile animals is recommended to assess tolerability in relation to exposure and age. This is particularly valuable to design a definitive JAS when dosing starts prior to weaning to avoid unexpected mortality or excessive toxicity, often due to irrelevant exposures. Dosing should include the youngest planned starting age of the animals in the definitive JAS to evaluate the most critical period for tolerability and exposure differences. DRF studies typically are of short duration, have limited endpoints and are not expected to include all core endpoints (e.g., pathology). DRF studies can also be used to explore particular endpoints and thus refine the study design of the definitive JAS. DRF studies are not necessarily conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices.\n\nA DRF study can reveal important information for paediatric development. Differences in exposure between age ranges can be identified in a DRF. This might necessitate an adjustment to the dosing regimen in the definitive JAS (See Sections 3.4 and 3.7).\n\nAlternatively, lack of tolerability in a DRF at anticipated paediatric clinical exposure might indicate a significant concern for the corresponding clinical age range (i.e., the juvenile animals are unexpectedly sensitive, potentially related to their immaturity, which can have clinical paediatric relevance). When the reason for greater sensitivity or significant differences in toxicity is not understood, additional investigations guided by review of available ADME, safety and developmental biology knowledge can be useful for the interpretation of these differences. This situation might warrant a customized investigative JAS to further define the sensitive age window and/or understand the possible mechanism of toxicity. Results could have safety implications for a specific paediatric age which might alter the intended paediatric clinical age range, and thus the WoE should be revisited (See Section 2.2).\n\nAnimal Test System Selection\n\nWhen a JAS is warranted, in most cases a single species is considered sufficient. In principle, the same species as used in adult repeated-dose studies should initially be considered as the species for a JAS, preferably a rodent. In all cases, the selected species should be justified, as nonclinical studies in a pharmacologically non-relevant species can give rise to misinterpretation and are not recommended.\n\nThe following factors should be considered when selecting a relevant species:\n\nAn understanding of the ontogeny of the pharmacological or toxicological target (e.g., the receptor) in animals in comparison to that in the intended paediatric population\n\nPreference for a species and strain for which adult repeated-dose toxicity data are available to facilitate a comparison of the toxicity and systemic exposure profiles between juvenile and adult animals\n--------------------\nContext title: S11_Step4_FinalGuideline_2020_0310'

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Background\n\nIn the era of globalisation of drug development, it may be challenging to conduct a drug development programme globally, in part due to distinct and sometimes conflicting requirements from regulatory authorities. At the same time, regulatory authorities face increasing challenges in evaluating data from MRCTs for drug approval. Data from MRCTs are often submitted to multiple regulatory authorities without a previously harmonised regulatory view on the development programme. There are currently no ICH guidelines that deal specifically with the planning and design of MRCTs, although the ICH E5 guideline covers issues relating to the bridging of results from one region to another.\n\nMRCTs conducted according to the present guideline will allow investigation of treatment effects including safety evaluations in the overall population as well as investigations of the potential impact of intrinsic and extrinsic factors (described as ethnic factors in the ICH E5 guideline) on the treatment effect. MRCTs, which are properly designed and executed according to this guideline, may facilitate more efficient drug development and increase the possibility of submitting marketing authorisation applications to multiple regulatory authorities in different regions simultaneously, thus providing earlier access to new drugs worldwide. In addition, MRCTs conducted according to the present guideline may enhance scientific knowledge about how treatment effects vary across regions and populations under the umbrella of a single study protocol, and how this variation may be explained by intrinsic and extrinsic factors.\n\n1.3.Scope of the Guideline\n\nMRCT is defined in the present guideline as a clinical trial conducted in more than one region under a single protocol. In this context, a region may refer to a geographical region, country or regulatory region (see Section 3. Glossary). The primary focus of this guideline is on MRCTs designed to provide data that will be submitted to multiple regulatory authorities for drug approval (including approval of additional indications, new formulations and new dosing regimens) and for studies conducted to satisfy post-marketing requirements. Certain aspects of this guideline may also be relevant to studies conducted early in clinical development or in later phases. The present guideline mainly covers drugs including biological products, although some sections may not be applicable to all development programmes (e.g., pharmacokinetics (PK) not used for preventive vaccine dose-finding).\n\n1.4.Basic Principles\n\nBasic principles for designing MRCTs are described below. Subsequent sections expand on these principles in more detail.\n--------------------\nContext title: E17EWG_Step4_2017_1116'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Group Size and Sex of Animals\n\nAn appropriate number of animals per sex (as applicable) should be evaluated at each predetermined sampling time point to generate sufficient data that support comprehensive BD assessment (see Note 2). In keeping with the principles of the 3Rs, the total number of animals can be an aggregate from several studies. Justification should be provided for the number of animals evaluated at each time point, as well as the use of combined data from multiple studies, as applicable. Justification should also be provided when only one sex is evaluated.\n\nRoute of Administration and Dose Level Selection\n\nThe ROA of the GT product can affect the BD profile, including the cell types that are transduced and the immune response, and therefore, the GT product should be administered using the intended clinical ROA, as feasible (see Note 3). The selected dose levels of the administered GT product should provide adequate characterisation of the BD profile to aid in interpretation of the pharmacology and toxicology assessments. The highest dose level evaluated should be the expected maximum dose level in the toxicology studies (usually limited by animal size, ROA/anatomic target, or GT product concentration). It is important that the dose level for BD evaluation equate to or exceed the anticipated maximum clinical dose level. However, it should not exceed the highest dose level administered in the toxicology study.\n\nSample Collection\n\nThe sample collection procedure for target and non-target tissues and biofluids should be designed to minimise the potential for contamination. It is important to follow a pre-specified process that includes appropriate retention of the samples obtained from each animal (those that received vehicle control and those administered the GT product), as well as documenting the order of sample collection. Sample collection time points during the nonclinical BD study should be selected to sufficiently characterise the time-related changes in GT product levels over appropriate time points. Additional time points can be included, as applicable, to comprehensively capture the length of the steady-state period or to estimate persistence. Inclusion of time points to permit evaluation of GT product levels after repeat administration should be considered, when applicable.\n\nFor replication competent vectors, sample collection time points should also cover the detection of the second peak level due to vector replication and the subsequent clearance phase in relevant sample(s).\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_S12_Step4_Guideline_2023_0314_WithCorrection_0']",['Provide a rationale for locations of dosimeters for dose mapping studies.'],0.0,0.0
63,"Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?","[""--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 22: See, for example, FDA’s guidance E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials (September 1998); FDA’s guidance Design Considerations for Pivotal Clinical Investigations for Medical Devices (November 2013); and FDA’s guidance Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests (March 2007).\n\nIf the firm wishes to present this information in a CFL promotional communication, it must do so in a truthful and non-misleading way.23 For example, the firm could present the results from these analyses of the individual components of the composite endpoint descriptively without p-values and without claiming that the results on the individual components are demonstrated additional effects of the drug. The firm should also include contextual information to describe the material limitations of the data (see Q.8/A.8) - e.g., for this particular presentation, the firm could explain that because these analyses were not prespecified and appropriate multiplicity adjustments were not applied, the results on the individual components need cautious interpretation and could represent chance findings.\n\nFootnote 23: See sections 502(a), 502(n), 502(q), and 502(r) of the FD&C Act; 21 CFR 1.21 (a) and 202.1(e)(5).\n\nThus, in addition to being scientifically appropriate and statistically sound, the evidence should be accurately characterized in the CFL promotional communication, including limitations of the strength of the evidence and the conclusions that can be drawn from it (as discussed in Q.8/A.8). However, firms should note that if a CFL promotional communication relies on a study that is inadequate to support the representations or suggestions it presents, disclosure of the material limitations of that study does not correct the misleading message conveyed by the communication. For example, in the scenario described in the previous paragraphs, if the firm's communication represented or suggested that the results on the individual components are demonstrated additional effects of the drug, disclosing the limitations of the underlying evidence would not correct the misleading message conveyed by the communication. Rather, as previously mentioned, the information should be presented in a way that does not overstate the conclusions that can be drawn from the supporting evidence. And if a firm's communication is based on speculation or belief without scientific support or is based on a poorly designed or conducted study or analysis, that communication would not be consistent with the recommendations in this guidance, regardless of whether the communication discloses the lack of appropriate support for the information being presented.\n\nWhat other considerations apply to CFL promotional communications that are consistent with the FDA-required labeling?\n\nIn addition to the considerations addressed in Q.6/A.6, firms should ensure their FDA-regulated promotional materials otherwise satisfy the applicable requirements of the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations.\n\nNothing in this guidance is intended to change a firm's existing obligations under the FD&C Act, the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), or FDA's implementing regulations to update its FDA-required labeling to ensure that the labeling is not false or misleading or for other reasons.24\n\nFootnote 24: See, for example, 21 CFR 201.56(a)(2) (“[approved] labeling must be updated when new information becomes available that causes the labeling to become inaccurate, false, or misleading”); 21 CFR 314.70 and 601.12 (concerning supplements and other changes to an approved application, including labeling); 21 CFR 514.8(c) (concerning supplements and other changes to an approved application for a new animal drug, including labeling); 21 CFR 814.39 (concerning supplements to an approved premarket approval application (PMA), including labeling); and 21 CFR 814.108 (concerning supplements to an approved HDE application, including labeling).\n\nWhat does FDA recommend that firms consider when developing CFL promotional communications that are consistent with the FDA-required labeling to help ensure that the presentation of this information does not render the communication false or misleading?\n\nThe way a firm presents information that is consistent with the FDA-required labeling (including the express and implied claims made and the overall impression created by the communication as a whole) affects how the information is understood. The following are some high-level recommendations for firms to consider when developing their presentations of information in CFL promotional communications to help ensure the presentations do not mislead the applicable audience(s):\n\nAny study results or other data and information that are relied upon to support a firm's CFL promotional communication should be accurately represented in the communications. Moreover, aspects of study design and methodology that are material for audiences to accurately interpret the information presented (e.g. type of study, study objectives, product dosage/use regimens, controls used, patient population studied) from any studies relied on should be clearly and prominently25 disclosed in firms' CFL promotional communications, and material limitations related to the study design, methodology, and results should also be disclosed in a clear and prominent manner.\n\nThe CFL promotional communication should accurately characterize and contextualize the relevant information about the product, including by disclosing unfavorable or inconsistent findings. For example, if a firm presents efficacy results from a postmarketing study of its product that evaluated the effect of the product on two different endpoints, such as overall survival and progression-free survival, and the product failed to demonstrate an effect on one of these two endpoints, the firm should clearly and prominently disclose this in the CFL promotional communication, rather than selectively presenting only the positive efficacy results.\n\nIf the FDA-required labeling contains data or information related to what is being represented/suggested in the CFL promotional communication, the communication should also include the data or information from the FDA-required labeling to provide the audience with appropriate context, and this information should be presented in a clear and prominent way. For example, if a communication provides postmarketing information about the types and rates of occurrence of adverse events that have been observed in practice, the communication should also include information from the FDA-required labeling about the types and rates of occurrence of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials to provide context.\n\nThese considerations are not intended to be a comprehensive description of everything a firm should factor into its analysis of whether its presentations are truthful and non-misleading. FDA recommends that, before disseminating a CFL promotional communication, firms should have qualified medical/scientific, legal, and regulatory personnel carefully review the communication to ensure it is not false or misleading.\n\nWhat are some examples of promotional communications that are consistent with the FDA-required labeling and with the recommendations in this guidance?\n\nThe following are two examples of promotional communications FDA would consider to be consistent with the FDA-required labeling and the recommendations in Q.6/A.6 and Q.8/A.8.\n\nExample 1: Product B is an Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), 10% liquid indicated for the treatment of primary humoral immunodeficiency (PI) and chronic immune thrombocytopenia pur purura (IPT). Product B's firm develops promotional materials which communicate that clearance of Product B is comparable in males and females taking it to treat PI and IPT. These materials cite to the pharmacokinetic information obtained from the pivotal study of the product.\n\nIs this consistent with the FDA-required labeling? Yes. This claim about the product is within the scope of the uses approved by FDA, because the FDA-required labelingreflects that the product is indicated for use in both males and females to treat PI and IPT, and does not contain any limitations or directions or other special considerations related to the gender of patients using the product. The representation about similar clearance of the product in males and females is not expected to increase the potential for harm to patients, and the directions in the FDA-required labeling enable the product to be safely and effectively used to treat PI and IPT regardless of gender. This would be an example of a promotional communication that FDA would consider to be consistent with the FDA-required labeling.\n\nIs this truthful and non-misleading? Yes, assuming the clearance information from the pivotal study is accurately reported in the firm's CFL promotional communication and the material aspects of the underlying study design and methodology are disclosed, including any material limitations of the information. As indicated in Q.7/A.7, the firm should also ensure the rest of the information in the CFL promotional communication is truthful and non-misleading and satisfies any other applicable requirements.\n\nExample 2: An implantable device is approved for use as an adjunctive therapy for reducing symptoms of a chronic disease when symptoms are not adequately controlled by medication. The device is clinician/patient-controlled based on the disease state and symptoms. The directions for use do not prescribe a specific use schedule. In the clinical study that supported the device's premarket approval application (PMA), approximately half of the patients using the device reported severe headaches, but many patients tolerate this risk because of the benefits of amelioration of symptoms associated with their chronic illness.\n--------------------\nContext title: Medical Product Communications That Are Consistent With the FDA-Required Labeling — Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: In addition, statements that claim investigational drugs and devices are safe or effective for the purposes for which they are being investigated are prohibited (21 CFR 312.7(a) and 21 CFR 812.7(d)). Likewise, statements that overstate the possibility of benefit may unduly influence prospective subjects by leading them to incorrectly assume that it is known that the investigational product will be of benefit to them, influencing them to agree to participate when they might not have otherwise chosen to do so. For example, wording that refers to the clinical investigation as a ""therapeutic trial"" could contribute to a prospective subject\'s misunderstanding that the trial will offer a direct benefit for their disease or condition.\n\nFurthermore, we generally recommend against including statements such as ""FDA has given permission for the clinical investigation to proceed"" or ""FDA has approved the clinical investigation"" in the informed consent process, because such statements may suggest to subjects that the investigation has FDA\'s endorsement. In addition, these statements may not be accurate for the particular clinical investigation at issue (see, e.g., 21 CFR 312.40(b) and 21 CFR 812.2(b)).\n\nFDA does not consider reimbursement for reasonable travel expenses to and from the clinical trial site (e.g., airfare, gas, tolls), and associated costs, such as parking and lodging, to raise issues related to coercion or undue influence. Reimbursement for other expenses may be considered by an IRB on a case-by-case basis, and IRBs should consider whether the proposed remuneration could be an undue influence. Payment for participation in research should be just and fair. This topic is also discussed under sectionIII.2.3, ""Benefits.""\n\nFinally, as discussed in FDA\'s Information Sheet, ""Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Payment and Reimbursement to Research Subjects,"" paying research subjects in exchange for their participation is a common and, in general, acceptable practice.22 FDA recognizes that payment to subjects for participation in clinical investigations, which is not specifically addressed by FDA regulations, may in some cases, raise difficult questions that should be addressed by IRBs. For example, an IRB should address how much money research subjects should receive, and for what subjects should receive payment (e.g., their time, inconvenience, discomfort, or some other consideration). However, FDA does not consider payment to research subjects for participating in research a benefit that can be used to justify risk when IRBs evaluate whether risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefit as required by 21 CFR 56.111(a)(2). IRBs should review both the amount of payment and the proposed method and timing of disbursement to assure that they are not coercive and do not present undue influence (21 CFR 50.20). As a general rule, FDA does not believe genuine offers of payment raise questions about coercion; however, an overt threat of harm presented in the guise of an offer of payment (e.g., a threat to withhold payment that had already been promised) would still be coercive.\n\nFootnote 22: See the FDA Information Sheet, “Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Payment and Reimbursement to Research Subjects,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/payment-and-reimbursement-research-subjects.\nThe information given to the prospective subject, which includes both information provided orally during the consent discussion and written information in the consent form, must be in language understandable to the prospective subject or LAR (21 CFR 50.20). ""Understandable"" means the information presented to prospective subject is in a language and at a level the subjects can comprehend (including an explanation of scientific and medical terms).\n\nii.1.4 Exculpatory Language\n\nThe consent process must not include exculpatory language through which a subject, or the LAR, is made to waive or appear to waive any of their legal rights, or release or appear to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence (21 CFR 50.20). FDA considers exculpatory language to be language that has the general effect of freeing or appearing to free an individual or an entity from malpractice, negligence, blame, fault, or guilt.23\n\nFootnote 23: For additional discussion of exculpatory language, see the joint draft guidance from the HHS Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) and FDA, “Guidance on Exculpatory Language in Informed Consent,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/exculpatory-language-informed-consent. When finalized the guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this issue. When finalized, the examples in the draft may be revised.\n\nThe following are examples of exculpatory language that would violate 21 CFR 50.20, and therefore cannot appear in consent forms:\n\nI waive any possibility of compensation, including any right to sue for injuries that I may receive as a result of being in this study.\n\nIf you suffer an injury as a result of being in this study, neither the institution nor the investigator can assume financial responsibility or liability for the expenses of treatment for such injury.\n\nExamples of language that would not be considered exculpatory are included below (see also sectionIII.B.6, ""Compensation and Medical Treatment in Event of Injury""):\n\nYou do not give up any of your legal rights by being in this study, and you may choose to pursue legal action if you are injured by being in the study.\n\nIf you are injured as a result of being in this study, paying for the cost of your medical care will be your responsibility or that of your health insurance company. However, signing this form does not stop you from pursuing legal action for the injury.\n\nBasic Elements of Informed Consent\n\nAs discussed in this section, FDA regulations identify eight basic elements of informed consent to be provided to the subject (21 CFR 50.25(a)). The text of each of the eight elements is italicized below, followed by a discussion of the element. As discussed in section III.5.4.b ""Short Form"", when a short form written consent document is used, the document must state that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject\'s LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)).\n\nBasic elements of informed consent. In seeking informed consent, the following information shall be provided to each subject:\n\nDescription of Clinical Investigation\n\nA statement that the study involves research, an explanation of the purposes of the research and the expected duration of the subject\'s participation, a description of the procedures to be followed, and identification of any procedures which are experimental. (21 CFR 50.25(a)(1))\n\nA clear statement that the clinical investigation involves research is important to make prospective subjects aware that, although preliminary data (bench, animal, pilot studies, literature) may exist, the purpose of the subject\'s participation is primarily to contribute to research (for example, to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the test article or to evaluate a different dose or route of administration of an approved drug), rather than to their own medical treatment.\n\nFDA recommends that when discussing the required elements of informed consent with prospective subjects, there should first be a discussion of the care a patient would likely receive if not part of the research, if relevant, and then the potential subject should be provided with information about the research. This sequence allows prospective subjects to understand how the research differs from the care they might otherwise receive. The description of the clinical investigation should identify tests or procedures required by the protocol that would not be part of their care outside of the research; for example, drawing blood samples for a pharmacokinetic study. Note that all experimental procedures must be identified as such (21 CFR 50.25(a)(1)). Procedures related solely to research must be explained (for example, protocol-driven versus individualized dosing, randomized assignment to treatment, blinding of subject and investigator, and receipt of placebo if the study is placebo-controlled) (21 CFR 50.25(a)(1)). In some cases, tests or procedures that would be considered part of usual clinical care will not be performed on study participants; when applicable, this should be discussed as part of the informed consent process.\n\n2.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsors generally include prohibitions related to the use of concomitant medications in the protocol or restrict (via exclusion criteria) inclusion of subjects who have participated in another clinical investigation within a specified period of time (for example, the washout period before a subject can enroll in a new clinical investigation). Implied in the prohibitions on concomitant medications is the idea that subjects should generally not participate in more than one clinical investigation at a time. Investigators should inquire about multiple enrollments and, when appropriate, discourage this practice in the consent document and during informed consent discussions. Further, when appropriate, the risks of participating simultaneously in more than one clinical investigation should be discussed with subjects during the consent process but do not necessarily need to be included in the informed consent form.\n\n12 How should data be handled when an enrolled subject decides to withdraw from a trial?\n\nUnder FDA regulations, data collected on subjects up to the time of withdrawal from clinical investigations of drugs and devices conducted under an IND or IDE must remain in the study database (see, e.g., 21 CFR 312.62(b) and 812.140(a)(3)).84 If a subject withdraws from a study, removal of data that were already collected would undermine the scientific validity, and therefore the ethical integrity, of the research. Such removal of data could also put enrolled subjects, future subjects, and eventual users of marketed products at an unreasonable risk and could compromise FDA\'s ability to perform its mission to protect public health and safety by assuring the safety and effectiveness of regulated medical products.\n\nFDA recommends that subjects be advised in the consent document that the data collected on them up until the point of their withdrawal will remain part of the study database and may not be removed. An investigator should ask a subject who is withdrawing whether they wish to withdraw from the investigational interventions only and are willing to continue in the clinical investigation for follow-up of associated clinical outcome information. If a subject withdraws from the interventional portion of the clinical investigation but agrees to continued follow-up not addressed in the original consent document, the investigator must obtain the subject\'s informed consent for this limited participation using an IRB-approved consent document (21 CFR 50.20 and 50.27(a)). If a subject withdraws from the interventional portion of a clinical investigation and does not consent to continued follow-up of associated clinical outcome information, the investigator must not access the subject\'s medical record or other confidential records that would require additional consent from the subject (21 CFR 50.20). However, such recordsmay be accessed consistent with the original consent process, without additional consent under FDA\'s regulations, to obtain information collected prior to the subject\'s withdrawal from the study.\n\nAn investigator may consult publicly available sources of information to determine a subject\'s vital status (and if deceased, cause of death) after a subject withdraws from a clinical investigation. This activity does not require subject consent because the information is publicly available.\n\nWhat steps should be taken to inform subjects when a study is suspended or terminated? 85\n\nFootnote 85: For further discussion, see “Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors: IRB Continuing Review after Clinical Investigation Approval,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/irb-continuing-review-after-clinical-investigation-approval. See section III.H.2, “Suspension or Termination of IRB Approval.”\n\nA clinical trial may be suspended and possibly terminated for a variety of reasons. When a study is suspended, IRBs, sponsors, and investigators should consider whether subjects should be notified, and if so, when, especially given that during a study suspension, complete information may not be available. Although the IRB has the authority to require that information be provided to subjects when in the IRB\'s judgment the information would meaningfully add to the protection of the rights and welfare of subjects (21 CFR 50.109(b)), all parties should consider what information should be shared with subjects in order to ensure that their rights and welfare are protected, that they are not put at risk, and that they receive appropriate care, if indicated. The parties involved, including the subjects\' treating physicians (if different from the investigator), as appropriate, may need to help determine whether it is in the best interests of currently enrolled subjects to (a) continue receiving the interventions that were being administered to subjects under the study at the present site, (b) be transferred to another study site (if the study is only suspended at certain sites) so that participation of the subjects in the study may continue, or (c) be transitioned to medical management outside of the research context. Continuation of subjects on the test article may be appropriate, for example, when the test article holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the study subjects or when withholding the test article poses increased risk to study subjects. In general, information about these considerations should be shared with subjects so that they may understand the changes affecting their participation in the study and to allow them to make informed decisions about their continued participation.\n\nIf a study is terminated, study subjects should be provided with as much information as possible regarding the reason for the termination. Such a discussion not only recognizes their valuable participation in the study but also helps explain the scientific value of the information obtained due to their willingness to participate in clinical research. Such a discussion provides an opportunity to address questions subjects may have about an investigational product that was administered to them (e.g., immediate safety concerns, ability to participate in another clinical trial, and appropriate waiting period to do so) and what long-term follow-up may be available or necessary. If the reason for the study termination involves a safety concern that may impact the future medical care of the study subjects, it would be important to discuss appropriate follow-up procedures with the subjects and possibly the subjects\' primary care provider(s).\n\n14.1 Should subjects be informed of aggregate study results at the completion of a trial?\n\nFDA recognizes that subjects are frequently interested in the aggregate results of the clinical investigation in which they were enrolled. FDA supports the return of aggregate research results and recommends that they be returned to subjects in a clear and comprehensible manner. Title VIII of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA), including its implementing regulations in 42 CFR part 11, requires the ""responsible party"" (usually the sponsor or principal investigator) of certain clinical trials of drug products (including biological products) and device products (referred to in FDAAA as ""applicable clinical trials"") to register the trials and submit summary results information to the government-operated clinical trials data bank, www.ClinicalTrials.gov, within a certain time period.86 Summary results information submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov is made publicly available in the databank.87 As discussed in section III.D, ""Elements of Informed Consent for Applicable Clinical Trials"" above, FDA issued a final rule88 that amends the informed consent regulations (21 CFR 50.25) to require that the informed consent documents for applicable clinical trials include the specific statement that is provided in the regulation to inform subjects that clinical trial information for such clinical trials will be available at www.ClinicalTrials.gov but it will not include information that can identify subjects individually.\n\nFootnote 86: See section 801(a) of FDAAA, Pub. L. 110-85, adding 42 U.S.C. §282(j); https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:42%20section:282%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title42-section282)&f=treesort&edition=prelim8num=0&jumpTo=true. See also 81 FR 64982 (September 21, 2016), available at https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/FR-2016-09-21/2016-22129.\n\nFor clinical trials that are not ""applicable clinical trials,"" the sponsor or principal investigator may voluntarily register the clinical trial and submit summary results information to the databank.89 If a sponsor or principal investigator plans to submit summary results information from the trial voluntarily, nothing would prevent an investigator, sponsor, or IRB from informing prospective subjects of the plan to submit such information in an appropriate manner. Informed consent forms can direct subjects to www.ClinicalTrials.gov, where subjects can obtain certain overall aggregated summary study results information. Investigators and sponsors can describe other plans in the consent form for informing subjects of the outcomes of the clinical investigation.\n\nFDA regulations do not directly address the issue of IRB review of return of aggregated results to subjects; however, when return of aggregated results is planned at the time of initial IRB review of the study, or the decision to share results is made after initial IRB approval but while the study is still open with the IRB, then the plan for communicating this information to subjects should be reviewed by the IRB. However, if the plan to share aggregated study results is developed after the study is closed with the IRB, the IRB does not need to review the sponsor\'s plan to share the aggregate results.90\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'

The description of the clinical investigation should identify tests or procedures required by the protocol that would not be part of their care outside of the research; for example, drawing blood samples for a pharmacokinetic study. Note that all experimental procedures must be identified as such (21 CFR 50.25(a)(1)). Procedures related solely to research must be explained (for example, protocol-driven versus individualized dosing, randomized assignment to treatment, blinding of subject and investigator, and receipt of placebo if the study is placebo-controlled) (21 CFR 50.25(a)(1)). In some cases, tests or procedures that would be considered part of usual clinical care will not be performed on study participants; when applicable, this should be discussed as part of the informed consent process.\n\n2.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe description of the clinical investigation must describe the test article (e.g., the investigational product under study) and, if used in the study, the control (21 CFR 50.25(a)(1)). The description should include relevant information on what is known about both the test article and the control. For example, the description should indicate whether the test article is approved or cleared24 for marketing and describe the use(s) for which it has been approved or cleared. The description should also provide relevant information about any control used in the study: for example, whether the control is FDA approved or cleared for marketing, considered a medically recognized standard of care25, or is a placebo (including an explanation of what a placebo is). The information provided about the test article and control should include appropriate and reliable information about the potential benefits and risks of each, to the extent such information is available. For clinical investigations involving the comparison of an investigational product to one or more standards of care, it may be acceptable to describe the most common risks and benefits of the standard(s) of care in the consent form and provide additional information that may be relevant to a particular subject as part of the consent discussion, if appropriate.\n\nFootnote 24: For purposes of this guidance, when “approved or cleared” is used in discussing devices, the terms refer to FDA permitting the marketing of a device via the premarket approval, premarket notification (510(k)), De Novo classification, or Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) pathways.\n\nFootnote 25: For the purposes of this guidance only, FDA generally would consider a medically recognized standard of care to be one evidenced by publication in a peer reviewed journal as a generally recognized standard of care or recognition by a professional medical society (e.g., in a clinical guideline).\n\nThe consent process should outline what the subject\'s participation will involve in order to comply with the protocol, for example, the number of clinic visits, maintenance of diaries, and medical or dietary restrictions (including the need to avoid specific medications or activities, such as participation in other clinical investigations26). If describing every procedure would make the consent form too lengthy or detailed, FDA recommends providing the general procedures in the consent form with an addendum describing the details of the study procedures to be performed at each visit. It may be helpful to provide a chart outlining what happens at each study visit to simplify the consent form and assist the prospective subject in understanding what participation in the clinical investigation will involve. FDA believes that removing procedural details from the consent form will reduce its length, enhance its readability, and allow the consent document to focus on content related to the risks and anticipated benefits, if any.\n\nFootnote 26: For additional information see Frequently Asked Question #11, “Can a subject participate in more than one clinical investigation simultaneously?”\n\nThe informed consent process must clearly describe the expected duration of the subject\'s participation in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.25(a)(1)), which includes their active participation as well aslong-term follow-up, if appropriate. Prospective subjects must be informed of the procedures that will occur during such follow-up (21 CFR 50.25(a)(1)), which may be provided in a chart as described above.\n\niv.1.2 Risks and Discomforts\n\nA description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomorts to the subject. (21 CFR 50.25(a)(2))\n\nThe informed consent process must describe the reasonably foreseeable risks or discomorts to the subject. This includes risks or discomorts of tests, interventions and procedures required by the protocol (including protocol-specified standard medical procedures, exams, and tests), with a particular focus on those that carry significant risk of morbidity or mortality. Possible risks or discomorts due to changes to a subject\'s medical care (e.g., by changing the subject\'s stable medication regimen or by stopping the subject\'s current treatment and randomizing them to either the investigational drug or placebo) should also be addressed. Where relevant, participants should also be made aware of the possibility of unintended disclosures of private information and be provided with an explanation of measures to protect a subject\'s privacy and data, and limitations to those measures.27 The explanation of potential risks of the test article and control, if any, and an assessment of the likelihood of these risks occurring should be based on reliable and accurate information presented in the protocol, investigator\'s brochure, labeling, and/or previous research reports. Reasonably foreseeable discomorts to the subject must also be described (21 CFR 50.25(a)(2)). For example, the consent form should disclose that the subject may be uncomfortable having to stay in one position or experience claustrophobia-like symptoms during an MRI. For clinical investigations involving the comparison of an investigational product to one or more standards of care, it may be acceptable to describe the more common and significant risks and discomorts of the standard of care in the informed consent form and provide additional risk information, as appropriate, as part of the consent discussion.\n\nFootnote 27: Note, 21 CFR 56.111(a)(7) requires IRBs to determine, where appropriate, that there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.\n\nAny reasonably foreseeable risks or discomorts to the subject need to be described in the informed consent form; however, it is not necessary to describe all possible risks, especially if doing so could make the form overwhelming for subjects to read. Information on risks that are more likely to occur and those that are serious should be described so that prospective subjects can understand the nature of the risk. The discussion may include information on whether a risk is reversible, and the probability of the risk based on existing data. Information on what may be done to mitigate serious risks, and risks and discomorts more likely to occur, should also be considered for inclusion.\n\nThe description should not understate the probability and magnitude of the reasonably foreseeable risks and discomforts. If applicable, the consent document should include a description of the reasonably foreseeable risks to the subject, but also the potential for risk to ""others"" (for example, radiation therapy where close proximity to subjects post-procedure may create some risk to others). In situations where there may be a risk to others, efforts to mitigate the potential risk (e.g., using separate bathrooms) may be included in the consent document or provided in a separate document and given to the subject during the consent discussion.\n\nWhen appropriate, a statement must be included that a particular treatment or procedure may involve currently unforeseeable risks to the subject (or to the subject\'s embryo or fetus, if the subject is or may become pregnant) (21 CFR 50.25(b)(1); see section III.C.1, ""Unforeseeable Risks""). If unanticipated risks are reported during the investigation, the informed consent discussion and documents may need to be updated with the additional risks (21 CFR 50.25(a)(2); see Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nii.3.3 Benefits\n\nA description of any benefits to the subject or to others which may reasonably be expected from the research.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: Within a CSR of a study, using an ICH E3 format as an example, FDA recommends that a sponsor or applicant identify on the Title Page that the study is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120. The Title Page should contain a reference and/or alink to a section or an appendix which specifically addresses the sponsor\'s compliance with 21 CFR 312.120. (In ICH E3 format, such an Appendix would be in addition to the kind of Appendices already listed in the ICH E3 Guidance, e.g. 16.5). FDA further recommends identifying specific foreign non-IND clinical sites using Appendix 16.1.4 (""List and Description of Investigators"") in ICH E3 format or a similarly designated section.\n\nThe section or appendix specifically intended to address compliance with 21 CFR 312.120 should include a brief statement describing actions the sponsor has taken and should provide supporting information in accordance with all the required elements as listed in the regulations (see below). FDA anticipates that for each such element the sponsor would provide the necessary information or provide reference and/or links to other sections of the study report which contain the information. FDA strongly advises against duplicating information provided elsewhere in the application.\n\nThe regulation allows for flexibility in how the requirements are to be met. For example, a full CSR prepared in accordance with ICH E3 ""Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports""23 may meet many of the requirements under 21 CFR 312.120, but adherence to ICH E3 is not required. The same holds for ICH E6: a sponsor or applicant may choose but is not required to meet many of the requirements of this rule through adherence to ICH E6. Note, however, that even if studies are submitted according to ICH E3 or E6, in some cases it may be necessary to provide additional information to FDA to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120, as well as other applicable requirements in 21 CFR parts 312, 314, or 601.24\n\nBelow, we discuss in more detail each of the required elements of 21 CFR 312.120(b) (""Supporting Information""). Although we make reference throughout these answers to relevant portions of ICH E3 and E6, we remind sponsors and applicants that they may choose to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120 through other means. FDA encourages sponsors and applicants to discuss any questions or concerns they may have about the format and content of the required information during pre-submission meetings with FDA (e.g., pre-IND and pre-NDA/BLA meetings).\n\nFootnote 23: This guidance and other ICH guidance documents are available at http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpeciaTopicx/RunningClinicalTrials/GuidancesInformationSheetsandNotices/ucm219488.htm.\n\nFootnote 24: 73 Fed. Reg. at 22808.\n\n1. Investigator Qualifications (Section 312.120(b)(1))\n\nWhat documentation should the sponsor or applicant provide regarding investigator qualifications?\n\nAnswer: FDA requires documentation to show that the investigator is qualified to serve as a study investigator based on their training and experience specifically related to the proposed clinical investigation.25Such documentation generally includes a curriculum vitae or summary of training. If this information is already included as part of the CSR, referencing the appropriate section within the CSR is acceptable. For research involving novel technologies and/or the potential for increased risk of morbidity and/or mortality, the sponsor or applicant may wish to include additional documentation identifying the clinical investigator\'s specific experience in this field (e.g., as demonstrated by recent presentations or publications) and with the test article.\n\n2 Description of the Research Facilities (Section 312.120(b)(2))\n\nIs the name and address of the research facility a sufficient description to address this requirement?\n\nAnswer: No, the name and address of the research facility is generally not a sufficient description to meet the requirement in 21 CFR 312.120(b)(2). Because FDA is generally less likely to be familiar with the research facilities in which foreign non-IND studies are conducted, greater detail is usually needed. For example, it would generally be adequate to identify and briefly describe the academic medical center, hospital, physician\'s office, clinical research unit or other type of facility at which the research is being conducted. The description should include enough information to enable FDA to determine the adequacy of the facilities to execute the protocol requirements (e.g., whether the site is appropriately staffed and equipped to conduct the proposed research and is able to provide the appropriate emergent or specialized care, if required).\n\nDetailed Summary of the Protocol and Study Results and, If Requested, Case Records or Additional Background Data (Section 312.120(b)(3))\n\nWould a study report ""Synopsis"" (as shown in ICH E3, Annex I)26 provide a sufficiently detailed summary of the protocol and study results?\n\nFootnote 26: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM073113.pdf\n\nAnswer: No, as stated in the preamble to the final rule, submitting only the Synopsis from Annex I of ICH E3 would not be adequate to meet the requirement in 21 CFR 312.120(b)(3), because the Synopsis would not provide sufficient detail about the study protocol or results.27 By contrast, submitting an integrated, full CSR in accordance with ICH E3 would meet this requirement, although alternative approaches are also acceptable.\n\nFootnote 27: 73 Fed. Reg. at 22808.\n\nIntegrated, full CSRs are commonly submitted for clinical and human pharmacology investigations that contribute to the evaluation of effectiveness for the proposed indication or that otherwise support information included in proposed labeling for the product.28 Sponsors and applicants are reminded that, even if they submit such integrated, full CSRs, they must also submit any additional information that is required by 21 CFR parts 312, 314, or 601. Footnote 28: For more information, see FDA’s Guidance, Submission of Abbreviated Reports and Synopses in Support of Marketing Applications, available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM072053.pdf.\n2. Will FDA need access to case records maintained by the investigator or additional background data such as hospital or other institutional records?\n\nAnswer: Yes, FDA may need to review source documents such as hospital records to verify data, whether during an on-site inspection or upon request.29 For example, a review division within FDA may request submission of investigator, hospital, or institutional records outside of an inspectional context. If so, these records must be made available to the Agency for FDA to rely on the data.30 In addition, FDA believes that informed consent documents should notify subjects that international regulatory authorities may need to have direct access to the subjects\' original medical records for verification of clinical study procedures and data.31 This position is consistent with ICH E6, section 4.8.10(n).32\n\nFootnote 29: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(ii) and (b)(3).\n\nFootnote 30: Ibid.\n\nIf the necessary records are not available, FDA may not accept the study data in support of an IND or application for marketing approval. If the records exist but a sponsor or applicant cannot disclose them to FDA because such disclosure is prohibited by applicable foreign law, the sponsor or applicant may seek a waiver of this requirement, as described below in Section III.3. For FDA to rely on such data that cannot be disclosed, the sponsor and FDA would need to agree on an alternative validation procedure.33\n\nFootnote 31: Note that the submission of case report forms (CRF) as specified by 21 CFR 314.50 are required for submission of an application for marketing approval.\n32\nFootnote 32: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM073122.pdf\n4. Description of the Drug Substance and Drug Product, Including the Components, Formulation, Specifications, and, If Available, the Bioavailability of the Drug Product (Section 312.120(b)(4))\n\nWhat information should the sponsor or applicant provide to meet the requirement in 21 CFR 312.120(b)(4)?\n\nAnswer: In general, the description of the drug required under 21 CFR 312.120(b)(4) would already be included in other sections of the IND or application for marketing approval.34 This requirement can therefore generally be met through cross-references to other sections of the submission.\n\nFootnote 34: 21 CFR 312.23, 21 CFR 314.50, 21 CFR 314.94, and 21 CFR 601.2.\n\n5. Information Showing that the Effectiveness Study is Adequate and Well Controlled Under 21 CFR 314.126 (Section 312.120(b)(5))\n\nWhat information should the sponsor or applicant submit to FDA to show that the study is adequate and well controlled under 21 CFR 314.126?\n\nAnswer: As an example, integrated, full CSRs in accordance with ICH E3 generally provide appropriate detail to show that the study is adequate and well-controlled as described in 21 CFR 314.126. Note: the sponsor or applicant should also explain how the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice.35\n\nFootnote 35: See 21 CFR 314.106.\n\n6.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: When appropriate, the consent process must describe the consequences of a subject\'s decision to withdraw from the clinical investigation and the procedures for orderly termination of participation by the subject (21 CFR 50.25(b)(4)). For example, when withdrawal from a clinical investigation may adversely affect the subject, the informed consent process must explain the withdrawal procedures that are recommended in order to ensure the subject\'s safety and should specifically state why the withdrawal procedures are important to the subject\'s welfare. For some clinical investigations, an intervention should be withdrawn gradually, or the investigator may recommend follow-up to ensure the subject\'s safety when an investigational intervention is prematurely terminated due to a subject\'s withdrawal. In these cases, the consent process must explicitly inform the subject of the potential adverse effects of premature termination of the investigational intervention. Prospective subjects should be made aware of the number of visits and approximate time required for participation in the study to help them determine if they are able to make the commitment to complete the study. When appropriate, it may be reasonable to counsel prospective subjects that they should not participate in the trial if they do not foresee staying in the study. If applicable, the consent process must explain whether a subject who withdraws early will receive future study payments.40 The subject should also be informed as to how the data that have already been collected will be handled (see also sectionIII.2.8, ""Voluntary Participation"").\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nProviding Significant New Findings to Subjects\n\nA statement that significant new findings developed during the course of the research which may relate to the subject\'s willingness to continue participation will be provided to the subject. (21 CFR 50.25(b)(5))\n\nThe consent process must, when appropriate, include a statement that significant new findings that may relate to the subject\'s willingness to continue participation, such as new risk information, will be provided to the subject (21 CFR 50.25(b)(5)). Significant new findings may include an unexpected adverse event, an adverse event occurring at greater frequency or severity than previously stated in the consent process, results from interim analyses (in some cases), additional alternative procedures or courses of treatment that become available during the course of the clinical investigation, and information from other clinical trials about the effectiveness of the investigational product, the comparator, or other products for the same indication. FDA encourages the inclusion of this statement in the consent form for clinical investigations where knowledge of risk is limited, for example, clinical investigations involving the first use of an investigational product in humans, novel therapies, and new molecular entities, or complex clinical investigations that involve significant risk. Where there are significant new findings, the IRB should consider whether enrolled subjects should be contacted to determine if this information impacts their decision to continue participation in the clinical investigation (see Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nii.4.6 Number of Subjects\n\nThe approximate number of subjects involved in the study. (21 CFR 50.25(b)(6))\n\nWhen appropriate, the informed consent process must state the approximate number of subjects involved in the clinical investigation (21 CFR 50.25(b)(6)). For example, a subject\'s decision whether or not to participate in the study may be influenced by knowledge that the clinical investigation is a small initial trial of the product (such as a phase 1 or 2 drug clinical investigation or a device feasibility clinical investigation where only a small number of subjects participate).\n\nElement of Informed Consent for ""Applicable Clinical Trials""41\n\nFootnote 41: For further information, see FDA’s “Guidance for Sponsors, investigators, and Institutional Review Boards, Questions and Answers on Informed Consent Elements, 21 CFR §50.25(c)” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/questions-and-answers-informed-consent-elements-21-cfr-ss-5025c?source=govdelivery.\n\n_When seeking informed consent for applicable clinical trials, as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A), the following statement shall be provided to each clinical trial subject in informed consent documents and processes. This will notify the clinical trial subject that clinical trial information has been or will be submitted for inclusion in the clinical trial registry databank under paragraph (j) of section 402 of the Public Health Service Act. The statement is: ""A description of this clinical trial will be available on https://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. Law. This Web site will not include information that can identify you. At most, the Web site will include a summary of the results. You can search this Web site at any time."" (21 CFR 50.25(c))\n\nAll informed consent forms for ""applicable clinical trials""42 initiated on or after March 7, 2012, must contain the above quoted statement, which cannot be modified (21 CFR 50.25(c)).43 However, additional explanation may be provided, if appropriate. For example, with respect to clinical trials involving investigational devices, an additional statement could be added that information about device trials might not be made publicly available until after a product is cleared or approved by FDA.\n\nFootnote 42: For the definition of “applicable clinical trial,” see 42 USC 282(j)(1)(A) and 42 CFR 11.10(a). It is the responsibility of sponsors and investigators to determine if their clinical trial meets the definition of an “applicable clinical trial” and to ensure compliance with the most current applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Information on “applicable clinical trials” is available at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/manage-recs/fdaaa.\n\nFootnote 43: Note that this statement is not required for child assent.\n\nFootnote 44: 21 CFR 56.109(c) states, “An IRB shall require documentation of informed consent in accordance with section 50.27 of this chapter, except as follows: “(1) The IRB may, for some or all subjects, waive the requirement that the subject, or the subject’s legally authorized representative, sign a written consent form if it finds that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside the research context; or “(2) The IRB may, for some or all subjects, find that the requirements in 50.24 of this chapter for an exception from informed consent for emergency research are met.”\n\nDocumentation of Informed Consent\n\nRequirement for Written Documentation of Informed Consent\n\n[label=()]\n\nExcept as provided in SS 56.109(c), informed consent shall be documented by the use of a written consent form approved by the IRB and signed and dated by the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative at the time of consent. A copy shall be given to the person signing the form. (21 CFR 50.27(a))\n\nInformed consent must be documented by a signed and dated written consent form except under two specific circumstances as described in FDA\'s regulations at 21 CFR 56.109(c)44 (21 CFR 50.27). Whenwritten informed consent is required, the use of electronic, including digital, signatures are permitted under FDA\'s regulations, provided it is in compliance with applicable regulations.45\n\nFootnote 45: See 21 CFR part 11, “Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures” and FDA guidance entitled, “Guidance for Industry Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures – Scope and Application,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/part-11-electronic-records-electronic-signatures-scope-and-application.\n\nIn the event that an IRB waives the requirement for documentation of informed consent (under 21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)), FDA recommends that the elements of informed consent be reviewed verbally with the subject or the subject\'s LAR. Additionally, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects with a written statement regarding the clinical investigation (21 CFR 56.109(d)). See section III. E.2, ""Alternative Methods of Obtaining Informed Consent"" below for additional information regarding documentation of consent. FDA recommends that when an IRB waives the documentation requirement for informed consent in circumstances where there is minimal risk of harm under 21 CFR 56.109(c)(1), the consent process and discussion be described and noted in subject case histories required to be maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3).46\n\nFootnote 46: Documentation requirements related to emergency research, as mentioned in 21 CFR 56.109(c)(2), can be found in 21 CFR 50.24. Discussion of these studies is in a separate guidance, “Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors; Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/exception-informed-consent-requirements-emergency-research.\n\nFootnote 47: For additional information on alternative methods of obtaining informed consent, please see “Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Investigators, and Sponsors, Use of Electronic Informed Consent in Clinical Investigations,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-electronic-informed-consent-clinical-investigations-questions-and-answers, and FDA’s MyStudies Application (App) at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/science-and-research-drugs/covid-mystudies-application-app.\n\n2.2.2 Alternative Methods of Obtaining Informed Consent\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors']",['The following examples further illustrate how factors 2 and 3 are applied:'],0.0,0.0

A subject may be in normal health or may have a medical condition or disease (21 CFR 812.3(p)).\n\nSurplus samples - see excess samples.\n\nTransitional device - a product defined as a device as of May 28, 1976, but previously considered by FDA to be a new drug or an antibiotic drug (21 CFR 812.3(r)).\n\nTreatment IDE - use of an unapproved investigational device for the treatment or diagnosis of patients during the clinical trial or prior to final FDA action on the marketing application, if during the course of the clinical trial the data suggest that the device is effective. A treatment IDE may cover a large number of patients that exceeds the number of clinical sites and patients stipulated in the original IDE. The device must be for treatment or diagnosis of a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition; there must be no comparable or satisfactory alternative device or therapy available; the device must be under investigation in a controlled clinical study for the same use under an approved IDE, or such clinical studies have been completed; and the sponsor must be actively pursuing marketing approval or clearance of the device. Requirements for an application for a treatment IDE are found in the Investigational Device Exemptions regulation at 21 CFR 812.36.\n\nTruth Standard (""Gold"" Standard) - any medical procedure or laboratory method or combination of procedures and methods that the clinical community relies upon for diagnosis, that is accepted by FDA, and that is regarded as having negligible risk of either a false positive or a false negative result. The truth standard result should be definitive (positive/negative, present/absent, or diseased/non-diseased), and should not give an indeterminate result. As science and technology improve, newer, more reliable standards may replace previous standards, particularly in the case of new disease markers.\n\nVIII.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What is a study?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA welcomes the opportunity to provide informal advice and feedback during the development of the pivotal study design through the pre-submission process. It is also advisable that investigator input be sought during the study design phase. Clinical data managers play a critical role in providing input into study design and case report form design based on past experiences running similar clinical studies.\n\n11 Glossary\n\nIn this glossary, terms are defined according to their specific interpretation as used in this particular guidance.\n\nActive Control Investigation (Active Treatment Control Investigation)\n\nA study that uses an intervention whose effectiveness has been previously established. In a device investigation, the active control could be a device (drug or biological product) approved or cleared for that indication or a surgical procedure.\n\nAesthetic Device\n\nDevice intended to provide a desired change in visual appearance in the subject through physical modification of the structure of the body.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA diagnostic clinical performance study in which the diagnostic device result is compared with a result that is not from a clinical reference standard.\n\nBenefit-Risk Assessment\n\nThe probable benefit to health from the use of a device weighed against any probable injury or illness from such use.\n\nBias\n\nThe introduction of systematic errors from the truth. In a clinical investigation, bias can lead to incorrect conclusions about what the study shows.\n\nBlind (Mask)\n\nA condition placed on an individual or group of individuals to keep them from knowing the intervention (or test) assignment of the subjects or subject specimens. For ophthalmic device studies, the term ""blind"" to describe this condition is inappropriate.\n\nClinical Investigation\n\nSee Clinical Study.\n\nClinical Outcome Study\n\nA study in which subjects are assigned to an intervention and then studied at planned intervals using validated assessment tools to assess clinical outcome parameters or their validated surrogates to determine the safety and effectiveness of the intervention.\n\nClinical Reference Standard (CRS)\n\nBest available method for establishing the true status of a subject\'s target condition; it can be a single method or combination of methods and techniques including clinical follow-up, but it should not consider the investigational device output.\n\nClinical Study\n\nSystematic study conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a therapeutic, aesthetic or diagnostic device using human subjects or specimens (see also Clinical Investigation).\n\nComparator\n\nA procedure or another medical product that serves to assess the level of performance of the investigational device. Often the comparator is another medical device.\n\nComposite Endpoint\n\nA prespecified combination of several endpoints.\n\nCondition of Interest\n\nSee Target Condition.\n\n11.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA control based on data collected over the same time period as the investigational device.\n\n11.3.3 Control\n\nA device, drug, biological product, medical procedure, or ""no intervention"" that is used to compare with the investigational device.\n\n11.3.4 Control Group\n\nIn a clinical outcome study, the group of subjects or specimens who receive the control.\n\n11.3.5 Controlled Clinical Study\n\nA clinical study that evaluates the performance of the investigational device by comparison with results from a control group, a comparator device or a clinical reference standard.\n\n11.3.6 Cross-over Design (Cross-over Study)\n\nA study in which subjects receive a sequence of different interventions (or diagnostic tests). In the simplest case of a cross-over design study, each participant receives either the investigational device or the control in the first period, and the other in the succeeding period. When necessary, the two periods are separated by a suitably long ""washout"" period to mitigate the effect of the earlier intervention(s). The order in which investigational device or control is given to each subject is usually randomized.\n\n11.3.7 Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)\n\nA group of individuals with pertinent expertise that reviews on a regular basis accumulating data from one or more ongoing clinical studies. A DMC may recommend that a study be stopped if there are safety concerns or if the study objectives have been achieved. Also sometimes called a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB).\n\n11.3.8 Diagnostic Clinical Performance Study\n\nA study in which the performance of a diagnostic device is characterized by measure(s) that quantify how well the device result of a subject is associated with the clinical condition of the subject as determined by a clinical reference standard.\n\n11.3.9 Diagnostic Device\n\nA device that provides results that are intended to be used alone or in the context of other information to help assess a subject\'s target condition.\n\n11.3.1 Exploratory Stage\n\nA medical device clinical development stage that includes initial development, evaluation, first-in-human and other feasibility studies.\n\n11.3.1 Feasibility Study\n\nA preliminary clinical study to see, for example, if a pivotal study is practical or to refine the study protocol for the pivotal study. A feasibility study is sometimes also called a pilot study.\n\nGood Clinical Practice (GCP)\n\nA standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analyses, and reporting of clinical studies that provides assurance that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, well-being, integrity, and confidentiality of study subjects are protected.\n\nGood Clinical Data Management Practices or GCDMP\n\nCurrent industry standards for clinical data management that consist of best business practices and acceptable regulatory standards.\n\nHistorical Control Group\n\nA control group of subjects who were observed prior to the pivotal study. Data collected from this control group is used to compare the performance of the investigational device.\n\nIntervention Assignment Mechanism\n\nMethod that assigns the study subjects to investigational or control groups.\n\nInvestigational Device\n\n1) An unapproved new device or a currently marketed device being studied for an unapproved use in a clinical investigation or research involving one or more subjects to determine the safety or effectiveness of the device. 2) A device, including a transitional device, that is the object of an investigation, where a Transitional device means a device subject to Section 520(l) of the FD&C Act, that is, a device that FDA considered to be a new drug or an antibiotic drug before May 28, 1976 (See 21 CFR 812.3(g) and (h)).\n\nIn Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device\n\nA diagnostic device that is intended for use in the collection, preparation and examination of specimens taken from the human body.\n\nLearning curve\n\nA graphical representation of the change in the rate of learning in the use of a medical device or, for a surgical implant, in the implantation procedure of the device. It can be measured in terms of the time taken to achieve desired outcomes or in the number of procedures until successful outcomes are assured.\n\nLevel of Evidence\n\nThe collective level of confidence about the validity of estimates of benefits and harms for any given intervention or diagnostic test.\n\nMedical Device\n\nAn instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or accessory, which is (1) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopeia, or any supplement to them,(2) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, or (3) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What is a study?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 9: In some cases for in vitro diagnostic devices that are used as companion diagnostic devices for therapeutic products, a non-final version of the device is used in the clinical trial of the therapeutic product. When this occurs, careful advance planning and execution of “bridging” studies are needed to establish clinical validity of the commercial in vitro diagnostic device.\n\nFor diagnostic devices, analytical validation of the device to establish performance characteristics such as analytical specificity, precision (repeatability/reproducibility), and limit of detection are often part of the exploratory stage. In addition, for such devices, the exploratory stage may be used to develop an algorithm, determine the threshold(s) for clinical decisions, or develop the version of the device to be used in the pivotal clinical study. For both in vivo and in vitro diagnostic devices, results from early clinical studies may prompt device modifications and thus necessitate additional small studies in humans or with specimens from humans. FDA should be consulted prior to initiating these studies.\n\nExploratory studies may continue even as the pivotal stage of clinical device development gets underway. For example, FDA may require continued animal testing of implanted devices at 6 months, 2 years and 3 years after implant. While the pivotal study might be allowed to begin after the six-month data are available, additional data may also need to be collected. As another example, additional animal testing might be required if pediatric use is intended. For in vitro diagnostic devices, it is not uncommon for stability testing of the device (e.g., for shelf life) to continue while (or even after) conducting the pivotal study.\n\nWhile the pivotal stage is generally the definitive stage during which valid scientific evidence is gathered to support the primary safety and effectiveness evaluation of the medical device for its intended use, the exploratory stage should be used to finalize the device design and the appropriate endpoints for the pivotal stage. This is to ensure that the investigational device is standardized as described in 21 CFR 860.7(f)(2), which states:\n\nTo insure the reliability of the results of an investigation, a well-controlled investigation shall involve the use of a test device that is standardized in its composition or design and performance.\n\n6 Some Principles for the Choice of Clinical Study Design\n\nFDA reviews medical device pivotal clinical studies submitted as part of marketing applications to determine whether they provide reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness. FDA recognizes that there may be several types of studies that can fulfill this expectation. FDA therefore encourages applicants to meet with the appropriate FDA review division to discuss study design choices for demonstrating reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness prior to study commencement.\n\nIn this document two broad types of clinical studies will be distinguished: clinical outcome studies and diagnostic clinical performance studies. The following discussion is predicated on the choice of appropriate questions to be answered by the study using clinically meaningful and statistically appropriate study endpoints.\n\nThis section addresses some of the considerations applicable to all pivotal clinical studies of medical devices. Various factors are important when designing any medical device clinical study, including general considerations of bias, variability, and validity, as well as specific considerations related to study objectives, subject selection, stratification, site selection, and comparative study designs. Each of these is defined and discussed below.\n\nTypes of Studies\n\nClinical Outcome Studies\n\nIn a clinical outcome study, subjects are assigned to an intervention and then studied at planned intervals using validated assessment tools to assess clinical outcome parameters (or their validated surrogates) to determine the safety and effectiveness of the intervention. These studies are described in greater detail in Section 7. It may be the case that device clinical performance (i.e., whether the device has the intended effect in the clinical setting) is also studied but the primary focus of the investigation is one or more clinical outcomes. For purposes of this document, the term ""intervention"" refers to either the use of an investigational device or a control. The investigational device could be therapeutic or aesthetic. For diagnostic devices, the term ""intervention"" relates to a strategy for subject management based on the result produced by the diagnostic device. A clinical outcome study is used to evaluate a diagnostic device when the goal is to evaluate the impact of how the device result changes a subject\'s subsequent course of treatment or management by the health care provider.\n\nDiagnostic Clinical Performance Studies\n\nFor the majority of diagnostic devices, the pivotal clinical evaluation is not a clinical outcome study but a diagnostic clinical performance study. It could be that a performance study also may have clinical outcomes but these outcomes are not the primary focus of the study. These studies are described in greater detail in Section 8. In a diagnostic clinical performance study, diagnostic test results are obtained from subjects, but are not used for subject management. Instead, the diagnostic clinical performance of a test is characterized by performance measures that quantify for each subject how well the diagnostic device output agrees with a clinical reference standard that is used to assess subjects for the target condition, as described in greater detail in Section 8.\n\nGeneral Considerations\n\nDevices with both diagnostic and therapeutic functions, e.g., to detect a condition and then administer the treatment, may be assessed using a diagnostic clinical performance study and/or a clinical outcome study with diagnostic performance elements.\n\nClinical outcome studies and diagnostic clinical performance studies are discussed separately in this document. For more information on clinical outcome studies, please refer to Section 7, and for more information on clinical performance studies for diagnostic devices, please refer to Section 8. For products with both diagnostic and either therapeutic or aesthetic components, please read both Sections 7 and 8. Section 9, which provides information on plans and techniques that sustain the level of evidence of clinical studies, applies to both clinical outcome studies and diagnostic clinical performance studies.\n\nGeneral Considerations: Bias and Variability in Device Performance\n\nDesigning studies to collect the right data is more important than designing studies simply to collect more data. The study design should consider both bias and variability. When evaluating a study design to determine whether the design will support approval of a PMA, an important consideration is the statistical concept of bias. Bias is the introduction of systematic errors from the truth. Bias can be introduced in subject selection, study design, study conduct, and data analysis procedures. In a clinical study, bias may lead to an incorrect determination of safety and effectiveness. Study designs that introduce little or no bias are preferable to designs that do not control for bias, which can be introduced into clinical studies due to a number of reasons. Some of these are reviewed below with strategies that can help to eliminate or minimize bias in the design phase (see also Sections 7 through 9).\n\nBias can distort the interpretation of study outcomes. When the performance of the device is good, the presence of moderate bias may not distort the study\'s ability to support conclusions about overall effectiveness; when the performance is known (or thought) to be marginal, the performance may be overwhelmed by the bias in some study designs. Particularly when there has been insufficient study in the exploratory stage and the device effect may not be well understood, it may be difficult to choose an appropriate study design under which the device effect would not be overwhelmed by bias. Consideration of the potential for study bias is a critical factor in designing a study to reduce the risk that bias may invalidate the final study results.\n\nA second general consideration when evaluating a study design for level of evidence is the sampling variability, which is controlled by the sample size of the study. On the one hand, a larger sample size provides more data so that estimates of performance have less sampling variability and hence become more precise. On the other hand, larger sample size can also result in an analysis for a clinically insignificant outcome that demonstrates it is statistically significant. Studies should be designed to show both clinical and statistical significance. It is also important to note that increased sample size will not necessarily address issues of bias, inappropriate outcomes assessment, a marginal improvement in outcomes that fails to show clinical relevance, or other study design problems.\n\nStudy Objectives\n\nThe study objectives provide the scientific rationale for why the study is being performed. The objectives should provide support for the intended use of the device, including any desired labeling claims.\n\n6.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nClaims can be supported statistically by formal hypothesis testing or by point estimates with corresponding confidence intervals. For pivotal studies designed to test a scientific hypothesis, the study objectives should include a statement of the null and alternative hypotheses that correspond to any desired claim. For studies with estimation goals (e.g., some diagnostic performance studies), rather than hypothesis testing, claims can be supported with point estimates and confidence intervals describing device performance.\n\nSubject Selection\n--------------------\nContext title: Design Considerations for Pivotal Clinical Investigations for Medical Devices Guidance for Industry, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards and FDA Staff'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What is a study?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 7: Diagnostic products that do not meet the “device” definition, for example because they achieve their primary intended purposes through chemical action on or in the body, are not covered by this guidance.\n\nDevices with More than One Intended Use\n\nWhile many devices can simply be categorized as therapeutic, aesthetic or diagnostic, there are devices that may fall into more than one of these categories, e.g., a device that both diagnoses a condition and then provides therapy for that condition when determined by the device to be present. There are also devices that may fall into one of these categories, but have more than one intended use in that category, e.g., a therapeutic device used to treat two very different conditions in two very different patient populations, or a diagnostic device that makes an initial diagnosis and also monitors progression of the same condition. Either case may result in a need to have more than one clinical study and possibly more supporting studies, e.g., bench studies or analytical ones.\n\nSpecial Considerations for Clinical Studies of Devices\n\nCertain considerations unique to medical devices should be taken into account in designing a clinical study of a device. These considerations apply to all devices, be they therapeutic, aesthetic, or diagnostic devices, although the device type may influence study design decisions. The following characteristics and features unique to medical devices can influence how the device is evaluated by FDA and should be addressed in the clinical study design:\n\nHow the device works: In all devices, an understanding of the scientific principles underlying device function and mechanism of action may be relevant in assessing performance and the adequacy of the proposed study design. This information is especially important as part of a Pre-Submission in which a sponsor requests FDA's advice in developing their clinical studies.\n\nUser skill level and training: Some devices require considerable training and skill to use in a safe and effective manner. This clearly would apply to implantable devices requiring the user to be a highly trained surgical specialist, particularly when the procedure involved is complex. Sometimes multiple personnel and skill sets are needed for appropriate use of the device. For example, for an IVD, one person with a certain skill set may collect the specimen, another person with a different skill set may process the specimen, and still another person with a third skill set may interpret the test results. When designing a device study, one should consider the skills necessary for the safe and effective use of the device. The skill sets of study investigators and personnel should reflect the range of skills of personnel likely to use the device in the intended use setting after marketing approval. The training provided to study investigators and personnel in the appropriate use of the device should guide the training that will be provided to users when the device is marketed. If no training will be provided for a marketed device, study personnel should not be specifically trained in the use of the device in order to ensure that the study reflects intended use conditions.\n\nLearning curve: Some devices are so novel that there is a learning curve associated with use of the device. With novel technologies, it may take time to master the steps prior to using the device in the clinical study. For an implant this would usually include any surgical techniques specific to the implantation procedure. For some devices, determination of a learning curve can be addressed during the exploratory stage, including pilot studies. If hands-on training of device operators is provided by a sponsor in the pre-market pivotal study, then one would expect such training to be provided in the post-market setting. Devices with steep learning curves may not be suitable for some settings (e.g., home use) because they may not be safe and effective in that setting. When a learning curve is evident during the pivotal study, it is important to consider how information gathered during this learning curve period are considered in the protocol (e.g., by clearly defining which subjects in the study are part of the learning curve period) and how results will be reported in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). If the learning curve is steep, this may have ramifications in labeling and in training requirements for users.\n\nHuman factors considerations: Human factors can play a crucial role in the development of a medical device.8 At any point in the device developmental process, the study of human factors associated with the use of the device may necessitate changes to the design of the device or instructions for use to make it safer or more effective or easier to use for subjects or medical professionals. Devices that incorporate software or provide a user interface should be designed to minimize user error. Devices that require more manual intervention or subjective judgment on the part of the user may require more user skill. Clear documentation of the device-user interface under real-world scenarios should be part of a human factors assessment.\n\nFootnote 8: See Medical Device Use-Safety: Incorporating Human Factors Engineering into Risk Management (July 18, 2000), http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm094460.htm.\n\n5 The Importance of Exploratory Studies in Pivotal Study Design\n\nMedical devices often undergo design improvement during development, with refinement during lifecycles beginning with early research, extending through investigational use and initial marketing of the approved or cleared product, and continuing on to subsequently approved or cleared commercial device versions.\n\nFor new medical devices, as well as for significant changes to marketed devices, clinical development in many cases is marked by the following three stages: the exploratory stage (first-in-human, feasibility), the pivotal stage (determines the safety and effectiveness of the device), and the post-market stage (design improvement, better understanding of device safety and effectiveness and development of new intended uses). While these stages can be distinguished, it is important to point out that device development can be an ongoing, iterative process, requiring additional exploratory and pivotal studies as new information is gained and new intended uses or indications are developed. Insights obtained late in development (e.g., from a pivotal study) can raise the need for additional studies, including clinical or non-clinical.\n\nThis section focuses on the importance of the exploratory work (in non-clinical and clinical studies) to development of a pivotal study design plan. Non-clinical testing (e.g., bench, cadaver, modeling, or animal) can often lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of action and can provide basic safety information for those devices that may pose a risk to subjects. The exploratory stage of clinical device development, consisting of first-in-human and feasibility studies, is intended to allow for any iterative improvement of the design of the device, to advance the understanding of how the device works and its safety, and to set the stage for the pivotal study.\n\nThorough and complete evaluation of the device during the exploratory stage results in a better understanding of the device and how it is expected to perform. This understanding can help to confirm that the intended use of the device will be aligned with sponsor expectations. It also can help with the selection of an appropriate pivotal study design. A robust exploratory stage should also bring the device as close as possible to the form that will be used both in the pivotal trial and in the commercial market.9 This reduces the likelihood that the pivotal study will need to be altered due to unexpected results. This is an important consideration, since altering an ongoing pivotal study can increase cost, time, and patient resources. This might also invalidate the study or lead to its abandonment. In general, in order to make scientifically valid confirmatory inferences, feasibility study data should not be combined with pivotal study data without advanced planning at the exploratory stage.\n\nFootnote 9: In some cases for in vitro diagnostic devices that are used as companion diagnostic devices for therapeutic products, a non-final version of the device is used in the clinical trial of the therapeutic product. When this occurs, careful advance planning and execution of “bridging” studies are needed to establish clinical validity of the commercial in vitro diagnostic device.\n\nFor diagnostic devices, analytical validation of the device to establish performance characteristics such as analytical specificity, precision (repeatability/reproducibility), and limit of detection are often part of the exploratory stage. In addition, for such devices, the exploratory stage may be used to develop an algorithm, determine the threshold(s) for clinical decisions, or develop the version of the device to be used in the pivotal clinical study. For both in vivo and in vitro diagnostic devices, results from early clinical studies may prompt device modifications and thus necessitate additional small studies in humans or with specimens from humans. FDA should be consulted prior to initiating these studies.\n--------------------\nContext title: Design Considerations for Pivotal Clinical Investigations for Medical Devices Guidance for Industry, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards and FDA Staff""

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What is a study?\n--------------------\nContext: Types of Studies Not Addressed in this Guidance\n\nAlthough this guidance does not address the following kinds of studies, some principles discussed herein are applicable to many of them:\n\nNon-clinical studies (e.g., bench, animal or measurement studies and, for in vitro diagnostic devices, analytical validation studies);\n\nHumanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Regulation: Questions and Answers, at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucml110194.htm, for detailed information.\n\nPre-market feasibility clinical studies, or other pre-market clinical studies that are not part of the pivotal stage;\n\nStudies to establish the clinical validity of companion diagnostic devices (i.e., in vitro diagnostic tests that provide essential information for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product). Clinical development programs for companion diagnostic devices are typically part of the clinical development programs of the corresponding therapeutic products;\n\nPost-market clinical studies. Though the need for post-market clinical studies might arise from interpretation of pre-market clinical results, post-market studies do not drive the initial determination of safety and effectiveness, and their design is not addressed in this guidance. However, the principles discussed in this guidance may be useful in designing such studies;\n\nStudies of products regulated by CBER that require an Investigational New Drug application and Biologics License Application, such as donor screening tests, are not included in the scope of the guidance.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAlthough this guidance is developed primarily for clinical studies used to support PMAs, the recommendations of this guidance may also be used in designing clinical studies used to support some 510(k) and de novo submissions with clinical data when applicable.\n\n3 Regulatory Framework for Level of Evidence and Study Design\n\nClinical studies of medical devices must conform to certain legal requirements. This section describes the:\n\nRegulatory framework applicable to the design of clinical studies that support pre-market submissions for medical devices;\n\nStatutory standard for approval of a PMA;\n\nRegulatory requirements that apply to clinical and other data used to meet the statutory standard for approval of a PMA;\n\nHow FDA evaluates the data to assess the risks and benefits of a device;\n\nBasic information about Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) applications; and\n\nFDA\'s current thinking on good regulatory practice as identified in the least burdensome concept.\n\nThis guidance reflects the Agency\'s consideration of standards for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve the participation of human subjects. Related international documents include the ""Declaration of Helsinki"" and are further explained in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 14155:2011, Clinical investigation of medical devices for human subjects - Good clinical practice and through the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance. FDA regulations under 21 CFR Parts 50, 54, 56, and 812 articulate good clinical practice (GCP) requirements applicable to clinical investigations of medical devices. In addition, FDA guidance documents describe FDA\'s current thinking on GCP and the conduct of clinical studies.3 Compliance with GCP, as applicable to medical devices, protects the rights, safety, and well-being of human subjects, ensures appropriate scientific conduct of the clinical investigation and the credibility of the results, defines the responsibilities of the sponsor and the clinical investigator, and assists sponsors, investigators, institutional review boards (IRBs), other ethics committees, regulatory authorities, and other bodies involved in the development and review of medical devices.\n\nFootnote 3: A list of FDA’s GCP guidance documents is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm122046.htm.\n\nIf a clinical investigation of a device is conducted in the United States it must comply with the applicable regulations found in 21 CFR Part 56 (IRBs), Part 50 (informed consent), and Part 812 (investigation device exemption (IDE)). If the clinical investigation of the device is conductedoutside of the United States, submitted in support of a PMA, and conducted under an IDE, the study shall comply with 21 CFR Part 812. 21 CFR 814.15(a). If a clinical investigation of a device is conducted completely outside the United States and not conducted under an IDE, FDA will accept studies submitted in support of a PMA, if the data are valid and the investigator has conducted the studies in conformance with the ""Declaration of Helsinki"" or the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever accords greater protection to the human subjects, in accordance with 21 CFR 814.15. A PMA based solely on foreign clinical data may be approved if the foreign data are applicable to the United States population and medical practice; the studies have been performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence; if an inspection is needed, FDA can validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means; and the application otherwise meets the criteria for approval. 21 CFR 814.15(d). The sponsor must be able to show that the foreign clinical data are adequate to support approval of the device in the United States, under applicable standards. Section 569B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act or the Act). We encourage you to meet with FDA in a Pre-Submission meeting if you intend to seek approval based on foreign data, or based on a combination of foreign and U.S. data.\n\nThe Statutory Standard for Approval of a PMA: Reasonable Assurance of Safety and Effectiveness\n\nAs indicated by Sections 513(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act, a PMA must provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device. FD&C Act Section 513(a)(2) states:\n\n[T]he safety and effectiveness of a device are to be determined:--\n\n(A) with respect to the persons for whose use the device is represented or intended,\n\n(B) with respect to the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the\n\nlabeling of the device, and\n\n(C) weighing any probable benefit to health from the use of the device against any\n\nprobable risk of injury or illness from such use.\n\nIn addition, FDA has, through regulation, interpreted the statutory standard for approval of a PMA as follows:\n\n21 CFR 860.7(d)(1). There is reasonable assurance that a device is safe when it can be determined, based upon valid scientific evidence, that the probable benefits to health from use of the device for its intended uses and conditions of use, when accompanied by adequate directions and warnings against unsafe use, outweigh any probable risks. The valid scientific evidence used to determine the safety of a device shall adequately\n\ndemonstrate the absence of unreasonable risk of illness or injury associated with the use of the device for its intended uses and conditions of use.\n\n_21 CFR 860.7(e)(1). There is reasonable assurance that a device is effective when it can be determined, based upon valid scientific evidence, that in a significant portion of the target population, the use of the device for its intended uses and conditions of use, when accompanied by adequate directions for use and warnings against unsafe use, will provide clinically significant results._These statutory and regulatory provisions specify that a finding of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness must be supported by data relevant to the target population, and evaluated in light of the device labeling. Further, a determination of whether the standard of approval for a PMA has been met is based on balancing probable benefit to health with probable risk.\n\nValid Scientific Evidence\n\nThe regulations state that the safety and effectiveness of a device will be determined on the basis of valid scientific evidence. 21 CFR 860.7(c)(1). Valid scientific evidence is defined through regulation as follows:\n\n21 CFR 860.7(c)(2) Valid scientific evidence is evidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience with a marketed device, from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device under its conditions of use. The evidence required may vary according to the characteristics of the device, its conditions of use, the existence and adequacy of warnings and other restrictions, and the extent of experience with its use. Isolated case reports, random experience, reports lacking sufficient details to permit scientific evaluation, and unsubstantiated opinions are not regarded as valid scientific evidence to show safety or effectiveness. Such information may be considered, however, in identifying a device the safety and effectiveness of which is questionable.\n\nFDA regulations also consider which types of evidence support reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness:\n\n21 CFR 860.7(d)(2) Among the types of evidence that may be required, when appropriate, to determine that there is reasonable assurance that a device is safe are investigations using laboratory animals, investigations involving human subjects, and nonclinical investigations including in vitro studies.\n--------------------\nContext title: Design Considerations for Pivotal Clinical Investigations for Medical Devices Guidance for Industry, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards and FDA Staff']","['Study - as used in this document, covers the systematic evaluations conducted in the development of an IVD product, including the feasibility, analytical assessments, method comparison, and evaluations to determine clinical utility of a product.']",0.9999999999833332,0.0

As with an inspection, FDA encourages facilities to respond during the discussion and/or provide responses in writing to the observations within 15 U.S. business days.\n\nFootnote 13: If the remote interactive evaluation, including the review of any records before or during the evaluation, is intended to supplement a scheduled inspection, then FDA usually will combine any observations from the remote interactive evaluation(s) into a single written list of observations issued at the close of the inspection, which would be issued on a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations.\n\nDepending on the purpose and outcome of the remote interactive evaluation, the information and documentation collected may be used to, among other regulatory purposes:\n\nSupport FDA's assessment of pending applications, including whether to approve an application\n\nPreclude the need for an inspection in follow-up to a reported concern or defect\n\nSupport a regulatory meeting, warning letter, import alert, recall activities, or enforcement action\n\nRank or prioritize a facility for an inspection, particularly a surveillance CGMP inspection\n\nJustify a follow-up or compliance inspection or any other surveillance activity\n\nAfter the remote interactive evaluation concludes, FDA will provide a copy of the final remote interactive evaluation report to the facility. A remote interactive evaluation report and any written list of observations may be subject to a disclosure request under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nIf FDA determines that an inspection will be necessary based on the outcome of the remote interactive evaluation, we will use the information obtained from the remote interactive evaluation to prepare for and conduct the inspection.\n\nVI Impacts of Remote Interactive Evaluations on Established Commitments and Timeframes\n\nIn general, the use of remote interactive evaluations should help FDA operate within normal timeframes (i.e., in a similar manner as an inspection) as outlined below, especially for higher priority activities in spite of challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFDA intends to use information from a remote interactive evaluation to meet user fee commitments and to update FDA's relevant internal databases. FDA expects that a remote interactive evaluation will generally enable us to meet a user fee goal date. However, FDA will notify applicants if we expect to miss a user fee goal date.\n\nAppendix A Commitments for Pre-Approval and Pre-License Inspections\n\nFDA will adhere to existing response timeframes applicable to inspections.\n\nAny responses or corrective actions submitted to the FDA in response to the observations identified during the remote interactive evaluation will be considered in the application assessment if provided within 15 U.S. business days of FDA's communication. FDA may defer consideration of responses or corrective actions in the current review cycle if received after 15 days.\n\nResponses received after 15 U.S. business days will be considered in the next application user fee cycle, should the application receive a complete response action and the facility requires re-evaluation.\n\nAppendix B Timeframes for All Inspection Types\n\nFDA generally intends to use existing timelines established for reporting on and evaluating the outcome of an inspection for the remote interactive evaluation.\n\nAny responses or corrective actions submitted to the FDA in response to the issues identified during the remote interactive evaluation will be considered with respect to further regulatory action if provided within 15 U.S. business days of FDA's communication of the observations.\n--------------------\nContext title: Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: From what I\'ve read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 7: For existing FDA mutual recognition agreements with the European Union and the United Kingdom, this includes the use of official inspection reports issued by a recognized authority for manufacturing facilities located inside and outside the territory of the issuing authority. For more information visit: https://www.fda.gov/international-programs/international-arrangements/mutual-recognition-agreement-mra.\n\nFootnote 8: See FDA guidance for industry Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (April 2021).\n\n2.2.2 What types of inspections would be deemed ""mission-critical""?\n\nA2: FDA\'s assessment of whether an inspection is mission-critical considers many factors related to the public health benefit of U.S. patients having access to the product subject to inspection. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether the product has received breakthrough therapy designation, orphan-drug designation, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation; is included in the Drug Shortage or CBER-Regulated Products Shortage list; is used for critical care or as a medical countermeasure; is used to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a serious disease or medical condition, including COVID-19, for which there is no other appropriate and available treatment. Therefore, for-cause (including follow-up and where a specific drug quality problem or facility issues come to FDA\'s attention), preapproval, and pre-license inspections can be deemed mission-critical. When determining whether to conduct a mission-critical inspection, FDA also takes into account concerns about the safety of its investigators, employees at a site or facility, and where applicable, clinical trial participants and other patients at investigator sites.\n\n2.3 Does FDA determine what is ""mission-critical"" using the same factors for both domestic and foreign inspections?\n\nA3: Yes, the determination is made considering the same factors regardless of whether the site is domestic or foreign.\n\n2.2.4 How will FDA ensure the quality of imported products while inspections are limited?\n\nA4: During this interim period, FDA is expanding the use of other tools and approaches for assessing manufacturing facilities, when appropriate, to help ensure the quality of the drug products imported into the United States. These may include physical examinations of products arriving at U.S. borders or product sampling and testing before release into commerce, reviewing the compliance histories of facilities, using information shared by trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements, requestingrecords directly from facilities ""in advance of or in lieu of"" certain drug inspections,9 and conducting remote interactive evaluations where appropriate. If a product appears not to meet applicable standards for safety, effectiveness, or quality based on these approaches, FDA has the authority to refuse admission of the product into the United States.10\n\nFDA continues to work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to target products intended for importation into the United States that violate applicable legal requirements for FDA-regulated products. FDA has the ability to use a risk-based analytics tool (Predictive Risk-based Evaluation for Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT)) to electronically screen regulated shipments imported or offered for import into the United States.11 PREDICT uses automated data mining, pattern discovery, and automated queries of FDA databases to determine the potential risk of a shipment. It takes into consideration the inherent risk of a product and also information about the previous history of importers, manufacturers, and shippers.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 10: See section 801(a) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: For more details visit FDA’s Entry Screening Systems and Tools page at https://www.fda.gov/industr/import-systems/entry-screening-systems-and-tools.\n\nQ5: How will travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency affect my application?\n\nA5: During the COVID-19 public health emergency, FDA is using all available tools and sources of information to support regulatory decisions on applications12 that include sites impacted by travel restrictions due to COVID-19. For example, FDA will continue the assessment of all applications per normal assessment operations for all disciplines, where all manufacturing facilities will be evaluated using a risk-based approach consistent with existing guidelines. Similarly, the need for and selection of sites for BIMO inspections will continue to be risk-based, considering application and site-specific factors. During this interim period, FDA is using alternative tools, where available, to determine or mitigate the need for an inspection and to support the application assessment. This includes reviewing a firm\'s previous compliance history, using information sharing from trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements, requesting records ""in advance of or in lieu of"" facility inspections13 or voluntarily from facilities and sites, and conducting remote interactive evaluations where appropriate.\n\nFootnote 12: See 21 CFR 314.50(d), 314.94(a), and 601.20(d).\n\nCDER and CBER are continuing to evaluate applications, strategically applying a holistic approach in the decision-making process to determine if an inspection is warranted or if an inspection is no longer needed due to information gained through the use of the alternative tools mentioned above. FDA will continue to work directly with the applicants of those impacted applications.\n\nFDA is also working directly with facilities to communicate any issues identified through a review of records or other information requested. For example, for both CDER- and CBER-regulated products, interim processes have been implemented to communicate with manufacturing facilities regarding issues identified following a review of records or other information requested ""in advance of or in lieu of"" a preapproval or pre-license inspection. Responses from the facility regarding these issues will, as feasible, be considered before taking an action on a pending application.\n\nThe Agency encourages applicants to be in communication with all their facilities and sites to ensure timely responses to any inquiries to support application assessment.\n\nQ6: If my application includes sites that cannot be inspected because of travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency will my application automatically receive a complete response letter?\n\nA6: No, FDA will not automatically issue a complete response (CR) letter if FDA cannot conduct an inspection because of travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency.14 Decisions regarding applications will be based on the totality of the information available to FDA, including information obtained from use of the alternative tools as described in Q5/A5.\n\nFootnote 14: For mission-critical and prioritized domestic inspections needed to support application approval, FDA aims to conduct those inspections during the review of the application. However, in cases where travel restrictions due to the public health emergency prevent FDA from performing those inspections during the review clock, recommendations in Q6/A6 are applicable.\n\nBased on an assessment of the product information provided in the application and based on available information about the facility or site, FDA will take one of the following actions:\n\nFDA plans to *approve\n\nthe application if\n\nAvailable information, including information obtained from the use of alternate tools, supports the adequacy of the facilities and sites named in a pending application, no other deficiencies have been identified, and the application otherwise satisfies the requirements for approval.15 Footnote 15: See 21 CFR 314.50, 314.94, and 601.2.\n\nIn this case, the need for an inspection could be sufficiently mitigated by the FDA\'s use of alternate tools, including a firm\'s responses to outstanding issues identified from the use of alternate tools (see Q5/A5).\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter with facility- or site-related deficiencies\n\nAvailable information from a prior FDA or mutual recognition agreement inspection or the use of alternate tools identifies concerns about the adequacy of a facility or site, and an inspection needed to address those concerns cannot be completed during the review cycle, or\n\nResponses to outstanding issues identified from requested records and other alternate sources (see Q5/A5) are not sufficient to address the issues identified for a facility or site.\n\nIn this case, FDA intends to inform the applicant of the facility or site issues as soon as possible during the review cycle. Specifically, FDA intends to inform the applicant that an inspection will be needed before the application can be approved\nand that the inspection may not be conducted before the action date due to restrictions on travel. * FDA generally intends to issue a CR letter, including a deficiency related to the facility or site, if the inspection has not been conducted by the action date.\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter without facility or site deficiencies\n\nAn inspection is necessary because there is insufficient information currently available to make a determination on the acceptability of a facility or site16,17 and other deficiencies have been identified.\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: From what I\'ve read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: No. The training of industry and academic personnel to enable them to properly perform their duties is the responsibility of their employers. However, FDA is prepared to participate in any training courses, which may be offered by industry associations or the academic community to the extent that resources will allow.\n4. If the GLPs are Phase I of Bioresearch Monitoring, what other phases are anticipated by FDA?\n\nOther phases include new regulations on obligations of sponsors and monitors of clinical investigations, obligations of clinical investigators, and obligations of institutional review boards. Note that these regulations are directed towards efficacy data and the protection of human subjects whereas the GLPs are directed towards safety data.\n5. Who makes the decision on whether or not a headquarters scientist participates in a GLP inspection? Why can\'t we have a headquarters scientist on each inspection?\n\nThe scheduling bureau makes the decision. During the past two years, headquarters scientists have participated in about half of all GLP inspections and, with rare exception, the Bureau of Biologics assigns a headquarters scientist to each GLP inspection. Resources do not permit more extensive participation.\n\nHow are laboratories selected for inspection?\n\nLaboratories are selected for inspection by bureaus within FDA. The criteria for selection are actual or potential involvement in studies associated with products regulated by FDA. Inspections will involve a specific study submitted to a bureau or a study selected from the firm\'s master list which is of interest to FDA.\n\nHow often can a laboratory expect to be inspected?\n\nRoutine surveillance inspections will occur at least once every two years or more frequently depending upon findings of previous inspections. However, more frequent inspections may occur when an audit of a specific study submitted to FDA or EPA in support of a marketing application is required.\n\nEither type of inspection can result in more frequent visits if serious adverse findings are reported. These latter visits are considered compliance or follow-up inspections and are carried out to determine if correction of previous violative conditions have been made.\n8. Will laboratories be notified in advance of an inspection? Because of the comments received during the conferences and the experiences to date with this program, laboratories will generally be notified prior to inspection. However, compliance or special investigation inspections may not follow this procedure.\n9. Can a laboratory postpone an inspection? A facility may at the time of initial FDA contact request a postponement. Such a postponement may occur when personnel responsible for the conduct of the study to be audited will be unavailable at the anticipated inspection date. FDA expects to be reasonable in arranging for an inspection date. Unreasonable delays in scheduling the inspection will however be viewed by FDA as a refusal to permit an inspection.\n10. Can a laboratory request an inspection? How? A facility may request an inspection from either the local FDA district office or from FDA headquarters. However, an inspection will be initiated only with headquarters concurrence. Consideration will be given to the work schedules under which district management is operating.\n11. If a laboratory is not performing a study on an FDA regulated product at the time the investigator arrives, will the inspection still be carried out? Routinely, GLP inspections are not scheduled unless the Agency has received a final report on a regulated product or has received submitted protocols, interim study reports, or knows that a study on a regulated product is underway. In the case of a laboratory that is not currently performing a study on a regulated product the laboratory will be asked to consent to an inspection. The FDA investigator will utilize an ongoing study, even though it is not associated with an FDA regulated product, to document the laboratory\'s compliance with GLPs. In such cases, the study will not be audited in terms of validating the raw data, and specifics of the study will not be included in the inspection report.\n12. Will inspections cover other areas such as chemistry, physical testing, metallurgy, etc.?To the extent that the protocol of a nonclinical laboratory study requires tests in the field of metallurgy, clinical chemistry, etc., we will examine and evaluate adherence to test specifications or protocol requirements.\n* Are firms notified of specific studies to be audited? Will sufficient time be allowed to seek authorization from the sponsor of the study to disclose the data to the FDA investigator? What happens if the sponsor of the study refuses to authorize the laboratory to disclose the records?\n\nAs stated with respect to prior notification of inspection, where FDA has an interest in auditing a study, ample time generally will be provided for the facility to seek authorization from the sponsor to disclose the data. In some cases, FDA investigators may begin inspecting the physical layout of the facilities while authorization to release the study records is being obtained. If the sponsor refuses to authorize disclosure of the records to the investigator, FDA will pursue the matter directly with the sponsor.\n* Can FDA investigators ask for records to which they are not legally entitled; can they engage in ""fishing expeditions?""\n\nIt is not FDA policy to request documents during an inspection to which the Agency is not legally entitled. On occasion, the Agency may request such documents when pursuing an audit trail of a possible violation. Under these circumstances, it is the laboratory\'s prerogative to cooperate or refuse without fear of reprisal. The requests should be specific and pertinent to the inspection. The Agency discourages investigators from making vague requests to see documents with no specific purpose in mind.\n* Should the Form-FD-483, Notice of Observations issued by the FDA investigator reflect current practices only; and should it include practices that were corrected during the course of the inspection?\n\nThe FD-483 can include historical practices, which may have affected the scientific validity of the nonclinical study in question even though subsequent correction may have occurred. Any corrective action taken by the facility will be noted by the investigator in the establishment inspection report.\n* At time of the observation, the management should discuss any differing opinions and attempt to clarify the investigator\'s perceptions or observations. The management may also, at the conclusion of the inspection, offer to explain what the management considers to be erroneous 483 observations. Should the matter in question remain unresolved, a written objection should be sent to the local FDA district director or a meeting with district personnel should be requested to attempt to resolve the issue.\n* What is the procedure for correcting errors in the FDA investigator\'s inspection report? Such errors can be damaging to the laboratories since the reports are ultimately available through FOI.\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: Updated processes specify that during pre-announcement, investigators should communicate with the firm regarding the planned timeframe and duration of the inspection, to include appropriate working hours during which the inspection is likely to take place. To the extent possible, FDA should also provide advance notice of some records that may be requested during the inspection (e.g., certain procedures and any associated records).\n\nUnder 704(h)(1) of the FD&C Act, FDA retains authority to conduct unannounced, for-cause inspections.\n\nStandard Inspection Timeframe\n\nFDA standards for reasonable estimated timeframes of inspections generally range from 3 to 6 continuous business days. These standards are based on the type of surveillance inspection (abbreviated or comprehensive) and the extent of coverage needed for a pre-approval inspection. The estimated duration for each inspection should be shared with the firm at the time of pre-announcement. Inspection duration is impacted by factors such as the complexities of the firm's operations, availability of knowledgeable staff, and the nature of observed deficiencies.\n\nAdditionally, it may be necessary to extend the duration of an inspection for a number of reasons, including for FDA to follow-up on post-market safety information such as recalls, Medical Device Reports, and complaints received by the Agency. Updated processes provide that, unless an investigator or the firm identifies a reason that additional time is needed and communicates this verbally to the other party, inspections of both domestic and foreign device establishments should take place within a standard timeframe and occur over consecutive business days. FDA recognizes that circumstances may arise, for either FDA or the firm, where exceptions to these timeframes may be appropriate. Exceptions to the timeframe should be communicated verbally during the course of the inspection.\n\nCommunication During Inspections\n\nFDA's updated processes also address regular verbal communications during the inspection between the investigator and the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the device establishment about the status of the inspection. When time and circumstances permit, investigators should make every reasonable effort to discuss all observations with the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the device establishment as they are observed, or on a daily basis, to minimize errors and misunderstandings. These discussions may address observations not documented on the FDA Form 483 that require clarification. Communications may be recorded by either FDA or the firm, if there is advance notice and mutual consent by the other party.4\n\nFootnote 4: FDA recordings will be treated in accordance with applicable disclosure laws including sections 301(j) and 520(c) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(j), 360j(c)) and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).\n--------------------\nContext title: Review and Update of Device Establishment Inspection Processes and Standards Guidance for Industry""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAfter issuance of a warning letter, holding a regulatory meeting, or following an enforcement action (e.g., seizure or injunction), FDA usually will conduct an inspection to confirm that corrective actions have been implemented.\n\nTo evaluate defect reports (e.g., Field Alert Reports or Biological Product Deviation Reports), FDA may request a remote interactive evaluation and/or make a request under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\n3.1.5 Specific Considerations for Bioresearch Monitoring Inspections\n\nSelection of facilities for BIMO inspections is risk based. While some facility selection factors such as inspection history and time since last inspection may be common across BIMO programs, other factors are unique to each BIMO program.\n\nFDA will consider BIMO facilities for remote interactive evaluation according to existing risk-based facility selection methodologies when there are no data integrity or other concerns that FDA determines require an inspection, and information to be evaluated can be accessed remotely. Generally, the information obtained from a remote interactive evaluation will be used to assess the facility's conduct, including data reliability and human subject protections to determine the acceptability of BIMO studies for FDA's application decision-making.\n\nAppendix B Preparing for a Remote Interactive Evaluation\n\nOnce the facility confirms its willingness and ability to participate in a remote interactive evaluation, FDA will schedule a brief virtual meeting to discuss logistics, responsibilities, and expectations. Discussion topics may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nObjectives and scope of the remote interactive evaluation.\n\nIntroduction of the FDA remote interactive evaluation team and the remote interactive evaluation lead.\n\nIdentification of the facility point of contact and all other participants (e.g., sponsor or contract research organization, monitor, remote ancillary operations).\n\nSchedule of virtual interactions and the anticipated duration of the remote interactive evaluation.\n\nFDA's expectations during the livestreaming walkthroughs of the facility.\n\nTime zone differences and translation services (i.e., spoken and written translation), if applicable. Virtual interactions, including remote observation of manufacturing operations or livestream assessment of data, usually will occur during the facility's normal business hours.\n\nMethods for sharing requested information, including sharing documents and the use of video-streaming technology.\n\nTechnological limitations that could impair or prevent FDA's remote interactive evaluation of the facility.\n\n3.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCheck of the internet connection throughout the facility to verify that the signal strength is adequate to support livestreaming video and audio during the actual remote interactive evaluation.\n\nIV Conducting a Remote Interactive Evaluation\n\nWhen facilities agree to participate in a remote interactive evaluation, FDA expects them to cooperate with the same level of transparency as they would during an FDA inspection. We expect appropriate staff to be available at scheduled times for interviews and other virtual interactions, and we expect the facility to be operational to the extent possible for FDA to evaluate areas and operations of interest (e.g., manufacturing, laboratory, packaging). If a facility is unable to support video or other virtual interactions, or if FDA determines that the video or any other virtual interaction during the remote interactive evaluation does not permit a sufficient examination of the facility or of a corrective action, FDA may terminate the remote interactive evaluation and instead perform an inspection or use other available tools.\n\nAs part of a remote interactive evaluation, FDA may:\n\nRequest and review documents, records, and other information (electronic systems).9 Footnote 9: Some remote interactive evaluations will be preceded by a request for records and other information for those facilities covered by FDA’s authority under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, when appropriate. FDA requests, including requests for records, during a remote interactive evaluation are considered voluntary unless a section 704(a)(4) request is sent to the facility.\n\nUse livestream and/or pre-recorded video to examine facilities, operations, and data and other information.10 Footnote 10: For a remote interactive evaluation supporting a pending biologics license application, FDA usually will expect a facility to provide for livestream video of the manufacturing operations described in the application.\n\nThrough the facility's point of contact, schedule interviews and meetings to address any questions or concerns.\n\nEvaluate a facility's corrective actions (e.g., in response to a previous inspection or evaluation, or to the current remote interactive evaluation). An inspection instead of a remote interactive evaluation may be necessary to verify the adequacy of some corrective actions, or if evaluating the corrective actions remotely would unreasonably extend the duration of the remote interactive evaluation.\n\nProvide verbal updates to the facility on observations and outstanding issues, whenever feasible.\n\nFDA will not issue a Form FDA 482, Notice of Inspection, to announce or open a remote interactive evaluation.\n\nTechnological Requirements\n\nThe quality of the remote connection (e.g., connectivity, image quality, cameras used) should be adequate for FDA to remotely review, observe, examine, and evaluate the information requested. To the extent practicable, technologies employed also should allow access for remotely viewingand evaluating operations at the facility, as necessary (e.g., aseptic practices, equipment cleaning and set up, material weighing and dispensing, instrument set up, sampling, testing). FDA understands that there may be temporary connection issues during the virtual interaction, and we expect either party to resolve the issue in a timely manner.\n\nFor security reasons, FDA will use its own IT platforms and equipment11 to host virtual interactions during remote interactive evaluations (e.g., videoconferences, livestreaming video of the facility and operations in the facility). FDA currently uses the following conferencing platforms:\n\nFootnote 11: FDA is not able to supply equipment to a facility to enable FDA’s remote interactive evaluation. Additionally, FDA is not able to accept equipment or devices from a facility for our use in conducting a remote interactive evaluation.\n\nFDA Microsoft Teams\n\nFDA Zoom for Government\n\nFDA Adobe Connect\n\nRemote Interactive Evaluation of Documents and Records\n\nFDA will usually request and review documents and other information in advance of a remote interactive evaluation12 to ensure the livestream interactions are as efficient as possible. However, we may request additional documents and other information, including video recordings, at any time during the remote interactive evaluation to address questions and to explain observations. Documents and other information requested during a remote interactive evaluation are expected to be provided within a reasonable timeframe, similar to requests for documents or other information made during an inspection.\n\nFDA expects all documents requested during the remote interactive evaluation to be provided in electronic format or accessible by screen sharing during a live interaction so that the documents can be assessed efficiently. FDA will provide a secure means to send requested information during a remote interactive evaluation. For electronic documents and other information, facilities should identify any limitations and ensure that encrypted and password-protected files can be accessed by FDA. Documents submitted during a remote interactive evaluation should be in English. However, if translation is needed during a livestream interaction, the facility may need to provide a translator.\n\nFDA recognizes that some facilities maintain documents in paper format and not all electronic systems will be accessible for direct viewing. Thus, when such a facility agrees to participate in a remote interactive evaluation, they should consider taking steps to enable FDA's remote viewing and verification of the facility's documents, procedures, and electronic systems. Requested documents maintained in paper format should be scanned as searchable Portable Document Format (PDF) files when possible.\n\nConcluding a Remote Interactive Evaluation\n\nUpon completion of a remote interactive evaluation, FDA will have a closeout meeting with the facility's management. During this meeting, FDA will usually present a written list of observations, if any, and describe and discuss any observations in sufficient detail to enable understanding and foster an appropriate response.13 This written list of observations will not be a final Agency action or decision. FDA will not issue a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations. As with an inspection, FDA encourages facilities to respond during the discussion and/or provide responses in writing to the observations within 15 U.S. business days.\n\nFootnote 13: If the remote interactive evaluation, including the review of any records before or during the evaluation, is intended to supplement a scheduled inspection, then FDA usually will combine any observations from the remote interactive evaluation(s) into a single written list of observations issued at the close of the inspection, which would be issued on a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations.\n\nDepending on the purpose and outcome of the remote interactive evaluation, the information and documentation collected may be used to, among other regulatory purposes:\n\nSupport FDA's assessment of pending applications, including whether to approve an application\n\nPreclude the need for an inspection in follow-up to a reported concern or defect\n--------------------\nContext title: Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: In assessing the adequacy of supervision by an investigator, FDA focuses on four major areas: (1) whether individuals who were delegated tasks were qualified to perform such tasks, (2) whether study staff received adequate training on how to conduct the delegated tasks and were provided with an adequate understanding of the study, (3) whether there was adequate supervision and involvement in the ongoing conduct of the study, and (4) whether there was adequate supervision or oversight of any third parties involved in the conduct of a study to the extent such supervision or oversight was reasonably possible.\n\nWhat Is Appropriate Delegation of Study-Related Tasks? The investigator should ensure that any individual to whom a task is delegated is qualified by education, training, and experience (and state licensure where relevant) to perform the delegated task. Appropriate delegation is primarily an issue for tasks considered to be clinical or medical in nature, such as evaluating study subjects to assess clinical response to an investigational therapy (e.g., global assessment scales, vital signs) or providing medical care to subjects during the course of the study. Most clinical/medical tasks require formal medical training and may also have licensing or certification requirements. Licensing requirements may vary by jurisdiction (e.g., states, countries). Investigators should take such qualifications/licensing requirements into account when considering delegation of specific tasks. In all cases, a qualified physician (or dentist) should be responsible for all trial-related medical (or dental) decisions and care.4 During inspections of investigation sites, FDA has identified instances in which study tasks have been delegated to individuals lacking appropriate qualifications. Examples of tasks that have been inappropriately delegated include:\n\nFootnote 4: Guidance for industry, E6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance, section 4.3.1.\n\nScreening evaluations, including obtaining medical histories and assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria\n\nPhysical examinations\n\nEvaluation of adverse events\n\nAssessments of primary study endpoints\n\nObtaining informed consent\n\nThe investigator is responsible for conducting studies in accordance with the protocol (see 21 CFR 312.60, Form FDA-1572, 21 CFR 812.43 and 812.100). In some cases a protocol may specify the qualifications of the individuals who are to perform certain protocol-required tasks (e.g., physician, registered nurse), in which case the protocol must be followed even if state law permits individuals with different qualifications to perform the task (see 21 CFR 312.23(a)(6) and 312.40(a)(1)). For example, if the state in which the study site is located permits a nurse practitioner or physician's assistant to perform physical examinations under the supervision of a physician, but the protocol specifies that physical examinations must be done by a physician, a physician must perform such exams.\n\nThe investigator should maintain a list of the appropriately qualified persons to whom significant trial-related duties have been delegated.5 This list should also describe the delegated tasks, identify the training that individuals have received that qualifies them to perform delegated tasks(e.g., can refer to an individual's CV on file), and identify the dates of involvement in the study. An investigator should maintain separate lists for each study conducted by the investigator.\n\n2.2.2 What Is Adequate Training?\n\nThe investigator should ensure that there is adequate training for all staff participating in the conduct of the study, including any new staff hired after the study has begun to meet unanticipated workload or to replace staff who have left. The investigator should ensure that staff:\n\nAre familiar with the purpose of the study and the protocol\n\nHave an adequate understanding of the specific details of the protocol and attributes of the investigational product needed to perform their assigned tasks\n\nAre aware of regulatory requirements and acceptable standards for the conduct of clinical trials and the protection of human subjects\n\nAre competent to perform or have been trained to perform the tasks they are delegated\n\nAre informed of any pertinent changes during the conduct of the trial and receive additional training as appropriate\n\nIf the sponsor provides training for investigators in the conduct of the study, the investigator should ensure that staff receive the sponsor's training, or any information (e.g., training materials) from that training that is pertinent to the staff's role in the study.\n\n2.2.3 What Is Adequate Supervision of the Conduct of an Ongoing Clinical Trial?\n\nFor each study site, there should be a distinct individual identified as an investigator who has supervisory responsibility for the site. Where there is a subinvestigator at a site, that individual should report directly to the investigator for the site (i.e., the investigator should have clear responsibility for evaluating the subinvestigator's performance and the authority to terminate the subinvestigator's involvement with the study) and the subinvestigator should not be delegated the primary supervisory responsibility for the site.\n\nThe investigator should have sufficient time to properly conduct and supervise the clinical trial. The level of supervision should be appropriate to the staff, the nature of the trial, and the subject population. In FDA's experience, the following factors may affect the ability of an investigator to provide adequate supervision of the conduct of an ongoing clinical trial at the investigator's site:\n\nInexperienced study staff\n\nDemanding workload for study staff\n\nComplex clinical trials (e.g., many observations, large amounts of data collected)\n\nLarge number of subjects enrolled at a site\n\nA subject population that is seriously ill\n\nConducting multiple studies concurrently\n\nConducting a study from a remote (e.g., off-site) location\n\nConducting a study at multiple sites under the oversight of a single investigator, particularly where those sites are not in close proximity\n\nThe investigator should develop a plan for the supervision and oversight of the clinical trial at the site. Supervision and oversight should be provided even for individuals who are highly qualified and experienced. A plan might include the following elements, to the extent they apply to a particular trial:\n\nRoutine meetings with staff to review trial progress, adverse events, and update staff on any changes to the protocol or other procedures\n\nRoutine meetings with the sponsor's monitors\n\nA procedure for the timely correction and documentation of problems identified by study personnel, outside monitors or auditors, or other parties involved in the conduct of a study\n\nA procedure for documenting or reviewing the performance of delegated tasks in a satisfactory and timely manner (e.g., observation of the performance of selected assessments or independent verification by repeating selected assessments)\n\nA procedure for ensuring that the consent process is being conducted in accordance with 21 CFR Part 50 and that study subjects understand the nature of their participation and the risks\n\nA procedure for ensuring that source data are accurate, contemporaneous, and original\n\nA procedure for ensuring that information in source documents is accurately captured on the case report forms (CRFs)\n\nA procedure for dealing with data queries and discrepancies identified by the study monitor\n\nProcedures for ensuring study staff comply with the protocol and adverse event assessment and reporting requirements\n\nA procedure for addressing medical and ethical issues that arise during the course of the study in a timely manner\n\nWhat Are an Investigator's Responsibilities for Oversight of Other Parties Involved in the Conduct of a Clinical Trial?\n\nStudy Staff Not in the Direct Employ of the Investigator\n\nStaff involved directly in the conduct of a clinical investigation may include individuals who are not in the direct employ of the investigator. For example, a site management organization (SMO) may hire an investigator to conduct a study and provide the investigator with a study coordinator or nursing staff employed by the SMO. In this situation, the investigator should take steps to ensure that the staff not under his/her direct employ are qualified to perform delegated tasks (see section III.A.1) and have received adequate training on carrying out the delegated tasks and on the nature of the study (see section III.A.2), or the investigator should provide such training. The investigator should be particularly cautious where documentation needed to comply with the investigator's regulatory responsibilities is developed and maintained by SMO staff (e.g., source documents, CRFs, drug storage and accountability records, institutional review board correspondence). A sponsor who retains an SMO shares responsibility for the quality of the work performed by the SMO.\n\nThe investigator is responsible for supervising the study tasks performed by this staff, even though they are not in his/her direct employ during the conduct of the study (see section III.A.3). This responsibility exists regardless of the qualifications and experience of staff members. In the event that the staff's performance of study-related tasks is not adequate and cannot be made satisfactory by the investigator, the investigator should document the observed deficiencies in writing to the staff member's supervisor(s) and inform the sponsor. Depending on the severity of the deficiencies, the clinical trial may need to be voluntarily suspended until personnel can be replaced.\n\nParties Other than Study Staff\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigator Responsibilities — Protecting the Rights, Safety, and Welfare of Study Subjects Guidance for Industry""]","['Where alternate tools are not available, insufficient, or otherwise will not satisfy the need for an inspection, FDA will use a risk-based approach to prioritize inspections, which includes consideration for (a) how product availability could impact public health; (b) investigator safety; and (c) travel restrictions and/or advisories associated with the location of the facility or site (e.g., country or region/state/province within the country, U.S. state, county, or territory).

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , Does the scope of section 13 of the PBRER only include controlled clinical trials?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER) described in this Guideline is intended to be a common standard for periodic benefit-risk evaluation reporting on marketed products (including approved drugs that are under further study) among the ICH regions.\n\nThis Guideline defines the recommended format and content of a PBRER and provides an outline of points to be considered in its preparation and submission.\n\nDefinitions of many technical terms used in the Guideline are included in a glossary (Appendix A); the first mention of a term in the Guideline is identified with an asterisk (*).\n\nBackground\n\nWhen a new medicinal product is approved for marketing, demonstration of safety and efficacy are generally based on data from a limited number of patients, many studied under the controlled conditions of randomised trials. Often, higher risk subgroups and patients with concomitant illnesses that require use of other drugs are excluded from clinical trials, and long-term treatment data are limited. Moreover, patients in trials are closely monitored for evidence of adverse events. In clinical practice, monitoring is less intensive, a broader range of patients are treated (age, co-morbidities, drugs, genetic abnormalities), and events too rare to occur in clinical trials may be observed (e.g., severe liver injury). These factors underlie the need for continuing analysis of relevant safety, efficacy,1 and effectiveness1 information throughout the lifecycle of a medicinal product - promptly, as important findings occur - and periodically - to allow an overall assessment of the accumulating data. Although the majority of new information will be safety-related, new information about effectiveness, limitations of use, alternative treatments, and many other aspects of the drug's place in therapy may be pertinent to its benefit-risk assessment.\n\nFootnote 1: The terms efficacy and effectiveness are not standardised, and have different meanings across some regions. See Section 2.6\n\nThe ICH Guideline E2C, Clinical Safety Data Management: Periodic Safety Update Reports for Marketed Drugs, achieved Step 4 in 1996, and was intended to harmonise the periodic reporting requirements to regulatory authorities and to provide, in a common format, the worldwide interval safety experience of a medicinal product at defined times post-approval. At that time, the focus of the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) was on relevant new safety information in the context of patient exposure, to determine if changes were needed to the Reference Safety Information* (RSI) in order to optimise the continued safe use of the product. The Guideline was revised in 2003, to provide needed clarification, guidance and flexibility.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline""

This should include relevant information from drug utilisation studies when applicable to multiple regions.\n\nA listing of any MAH-sponsored post-marketing non-interventional study(ies) with the primary aim of identifying, characterising, or quantifying a safety hazard, confirming the safety profile of the medicinal product, or measuring the effectiveness of risk management measures that were completedor ongoing during the reporting interval should be included in an appendix (see Section 3.7 of this Guideline for the information that should be included in the listing).\n\nFinal study reports completed during the reporting interval for the studies mentioned in the paragraph above should also be included in the regional appendix of the report where stipulated by regional requirements.\n\nInformation from Other Clinical Trials and Sources\n\n3.9.1 Other Clinical Trials\n\nThis subsection should summarise information accessible to the MAH with reasonable and appropriate effort from any other clinical trial/study sources, including results from pooled analyses or meta-analyses of randomised clinical trials, and safety information provided by co-development partners or from investigator-initiated trials.\n\n3.9.2 Medication Errors\n\nThis subsection should summarise relevant information on patterns of medication errors and potential medication errors, even when not associated with adverse outcomes. A potential medication error is the recognition of circumstances that could lead to a medication error, and may or may not involve a patient. Such information may be relevant to the interpretation of safety data or the overall benefit-risk evaluation of the medicinal product. A medication error may arise at any stage in the medication use process, and may involve patients, consumers, or healthcare professionals.\n\nThis information may be received by the MAH via spontaneous reporting systems, medical information queries, customer complaints, screening of digital media, patient support programmes, or other available information sources.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline'

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , Does the scope of section 13 of the PBRER only include controlled clinical trials?\n--------------------\nContext: Clinical trials using an investigational drug (i.e., human pharmacology, therapeutic exploratory and therapeutic confirmatory trials (Phase 1-3));8 Footnote 8: For classification of clinical trials, see ICH E8 General Considerations for Clinical Trials, at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm073132.pdf.\n\nClinical trials conducted using marketed drugs in approved indications (i.e., therapeutic use trials (Phase 4));\n\nTherapeutic use of an investigational drug (e.g., expanded access programs, compassionate use programs, particular patient use, single patient INDs, and treatment INDs); and\n\nClinical trials conducted to support changes in the manufacturing process of medicinal products.\n\nThe DSUR should also include significant other findings pertinent to the safety of the investigational drug, including findings from:\n\nObservational or epidemiological studies;\n\nNonclinical studies (toxicological and in vitro studies);\n\nRelated DSURs, if applicable to the investigational drug;\n\nManufacturing or microbiological changes;\n\nStudies recently published in the literature;\n\nClinical trials with results indicating lack of efficacy that could have a direct impact on subject safety (e.g., worsening of the underlying condition if the indication is serious or life-threatening);\n\nAny other source of relevant safety findings for products in the same therapeutic class;\n\nClinical trials conducted by a co-development partner, if permitted by the contractual agreement.\n\nRelation of the DSUR to the Periodic Safety Update Report (1.4)\n\nAt present, some ICH countries and regions accept submission of a periodic safety update report (PSUR) to fulfill national and regional requirements for periodic reporting on the safety of approved drugs. Although the focus of the DSUR is on investigational drugs, there can be Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\noverlap between the content of the DSUR and PSUR, and some repetition is expected. For example, information from marketing experience (reported in the PSUR) might be relevant to clinical development, and therefore reported in the DSUR. Safety findings from clinical trials conducted using marketed drugs would be included in the DSUR, but would also be pertinent to postmarketing safety and would be reported in the PSUR. Both the DSUR and PSUR should be comprehensive and stand alone as they focus on different subject matter and have differing periodicities and recipients.\n\n5 Recipients of the DSUR (1.5)\n\nThe DSUR is intended to serve as an annual report to regulatory authorities. Where national or regional laws or regulations require submission of an annual safety report on an investigational drug to ethics committees/institutional review boards, the DSUR Executive Summary might be appropriate, supplemented with line listings of serious adverse reactions9 (SARs) as warranted.\n\nFootnote 9: Serious adverse reaction, serious adverse event, and adverse drug reaction are defined in ICH E2A Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm073087.pdf.\n\n6 General Principles (2)\n\nSingle DSUR for an Active Substance (2.1)\n\nIn order to promote a comprehensive analysis and presentation of the safety profile of the investigational drug, a sponsor should prepare a single DSUR with data pertinent to all dosage forms and strengths, all indications, and all patient populations under study with the investigational drug, wherever feasible. If this is not possible (e.g., when the data are not available to the sponsor), an explanation should be provided in the introduction section of the DSUR.\n\nIf more than one sponsor is involved in drug development, particularly in a co-development or other contractual agreement, a single DSUR can be submitted (see section 2.2.2).\n\nPeriodicity and DSUR Data Lock Point* (2.2)\n\nThe Development International Birth Date* (DIBD) is used to determine the start of the annual period for the DSUR. This date is the sponsor's first authorization to conduct a clinical trial in any country worldwide. The start of the annual period for the DSUR is the month and date of the DIBD.\n\nWhen the sponsor's first clinical trial is conducted in a country without a formal authorization process, the sponsor should designate an appropriate date linked to the commencement of the first clinical trial. Where clinical trials are ongoing in one country and are later initiated in another country, the original DIBD should be maintained and used for all countries in preparing the DSUR.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe data lock point of the DSUR should be the last day of the one-year reporting period. For administrative convenience, if desired by the sponsor, the data lock point of the DSUR can be designated as the last day of the month prior to the month of the DIBD.\n\nWhen clinical development of a drug continues following a marketing approval in any country worldwide, both a PSUR and a DSUR should be submitted as specified by national or regional laws or regulations. If desired by the sponsor, a DSUR can be prepared based on the PSUR International Birth Date (IBD) so that the DSUR and the PSUR can be synchronized. In synchronizing the data lock points for the DSUR and PSUR, the period covered by the next DSUR should be no longer than one year.\n\nThe DSUR should be submitted to all concerned regulatory authorities no later than 60 calendar days after the DSUR data lock point.\n\nDuration of DSUR Submissions (2.3)\n\nDSURs should continue to be submitted for as long as indicated by national or regional laws or regulations.10 When submission of an annual report is no longer required in an individual country or region, the sponsor should indicate that the final DSUR serves as the last annual report for the investigational drug in that country or region. The sponsor should also indicate whether or not clinical trials are continuing elsewhere.\n\nFootnote 10: For example, in the United States, sponsors might keep an IND open even if no clinical trials are ongoing or planned. Annual reports are submitted for as long as the IND remains open.\n\nResponsibilities for Preparing and Submitting a DSUR (2.4)\n\n1.1.1 Sponsor's Responsibilities (2.4.1)\n\nThe sponsor* of a clinical trial is considered responsible for the preparation, content and submission of a DSUR. The sponsor can delegate the preparation of the DSUR to a third party (e.g., a contract research organization).\n\nIn situations where the sponsor does not have access to the information to be included in specific sections (e.g., sponsor-investigators* might not have information on manufacturing issues, nonclinical data, and marketing status), this should be stated in the DSUR.\n\n2.2.2 Responsibilities of Multiple Parties (2.4.2)\n\nWhen there is more than one sponsor of a clinical trial or drug development program, the parties should arrange to prepare a single DSUR, if possible. This includes situations where a sponsor is in a formal co-development or licensing relationship with one or more partners, or where individual clinical trials or a drug development program involve collaboration with public or private institutions, business partners, or other parties. Written agreements should be in place specifying how data will be exchanged and detailing the responsibilities for preparation and submission of the DSUR.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen a single DSUR cannot be arranged, multiple sponsors can agree to prepare separate\n\nDSURs for the same investigational drug. This can occur where different indications, routes of administration, or formulations are being investigated by different parties. In this situation, the rationale for separate DSURs should be provided in each report.\n\nAppendix E DSURs for Combination Therapies (2.5)\n\nGiven the potential complexities of clinical development involving combination therapies, it is not possible to provide guidance that addresses all such situations. The sponsor should select the most appropriate option based on judgment, taking into account patient population, indication, formulation, etc., as well as the circumstances in which the clinical trials are being conducted and national or regional laws or regulations. The rationale for this decision should be provided in the report.\n\nIn general, a single DSUR should be prepared for clinical trials involving a fixed combination\n\nproduct (i.e., a product consisting of at least two active ingredients in a fixed dose that is\n\nadministered in a single dosage form). If the sponsor is also conducting clinical trials with\n\nindividual component(s) of the fixed combination product, separate DSUR(s) should be\n\nsubmitted for each component. Relevant findings from each DSUR should be summarized in\n\nsection 8.5 of the other DSUR(s).\n\nFor trials involving multi-drug therapy, i.e., combinations of drugs that are not fixed, the sponsor can prepare either:\n\n(1) a DSUR for the multi-drug therapy, or\n\n(2) DSUR(s) for one or more of the individual components; in this case information on the\n\nmultidrug therapy trials can be included in the DSURs of one or all of the components.\n\nThe following table provides examples of strategies for preparation of DSURs for multi-drug\n\ntherapies.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nF. Reference Safety Information (2.6)\n--------------------\nContext title: E2F Development Safety Update Report""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , Does the scope of section 13 of the PBRER only include controlled clinical trials?\n--------------------\nContext: Yes, with two exceptions. The first is that the FDA requirements for IRBs under 21 CFR Part 56 are slightly different with respect to membership and function. To address this issue, as described in #12 above, FDA can provide a specific waiver from the Part 56 IRB requirements, allowing an IEC that complies with good clinical practice to substitute for the IRB.4 The second exception is that the requirements for informed consent under 21 CFR Part 50 for particular clinical trials (e.g., emergency research under 21 CFR 50.24, clinical investigations involving pediatric subjects under Subpart D) are more extensive with respect to IRB responsibilities. Because these types of trials are uncommon, our experience has not revealed that this has caused a conflict; but in the event of one, we would be willing to discuss a resolution with the sponsor on a case-by-case basis. If the investigator or sponsor believes that there are other conflicting requirements, the sponsor may request a waiver from FDA from the specific requirement under 21 CFR 312.10.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n14.  Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n\nNo. A multinational study may include domestic sites under the IND and foreign sites not under the IND.  Investigation drug and biologics studies conducted in the U.S. must be conducted in compliance with the IND requirements contained in 21 CFR 312, which includes the requirement that investigators sign the 1572.  If a study also involves foreign clinical sites, the sponsor may choose, but is not required, to include the foreign clinical sites under the IND.  The investigators from the U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND would be required to sign the 1572.  The investigators from the foreign sites that are not included under the IND are not required to sign the 1572.\n\nIf the sponsor chooses to conduct a multinational study with U.S. and some foreign sites under the IND, and other foreign sites not under the IND, the sponsor can submit a single protocol to the IND and all sites would follow this protocol.  Alternatively, the sponsor can conduct a multinational study with one protocol for sites under the IND (U.S. sites and some foreign sites) and a different protocol(s) for foreign sites not under the IND.  If the intent is to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites, the protocols would ordinarily be very similar or identical.  The U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND must follow the protocol that was submitted to the IND.  For foreign sites that are not included under the IND, the protocol(s) does not need to be submitted to the IND.  In general, if the sponsor intends to submit the data in an application for marketing approval, we recommend that the sponsor identify the foreign sites that will not be conducted under the IND and discuss plans to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites with the appropriate FDA review division.\n\nNote, however, that 21 CFR 312.32(b) requires sponsors to promptly review information about the safety of the investigational drug obtained or otherwise received by the sponsor from any source, foreign or domestic.  Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), sponsors must also notify FDA and all participating investigators in an IND safety report of any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected.  This means that FDA and all participating investigators under the IND would be informed of such an adverse experience, even if it occurred in a foreign study not conducted under the IND.\n\n15.  How does a sponsor submit information to FDA about a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND?\n\nUnder 21 CFR 312.120, the sponsor can submit information to FDA from a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND to support clinical investigations in the United States and/or marketing approval.  When submitting information about a foreign clinical study, it is helpful to clearly identify in the cover letter that the material is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120.  The submission requirements for supporting documentation can be found at 21 CFR 312.120(b).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n16. Should a new form be prepared and signed when the OMB expiration date is reached?\n\nNo. There is no need to prepare and sign a new 1572 when the OMB expiration date has been reached.\n\n17. Does FDA expect a double-sided 1572, or is a two-page document printed from the FDA website acceptable?\n\nEither is acceptable; however, FDA recommends that a two-page document be stapled so that there is no question about what form the investigator signed.\n\n18. How should the 1572 be completed?\n\nThe 1572 on FDA's website may be completed by typing the information directly into the fillable form and printing the completed form. Alternatively, it is acceptable to print the blank form from FDA's website and hand-write or type the information onto the form. Typed forms are preferable because they are usually more legible. The completed form must be signed and dated by the investigator (either by hand or using an acceptable electronic method).\n\nII. SECTION #1: NAME AND ADDRESS OF INVESTIGATOR\n\n19. How should an investigator's name appear on the 1572?\n\nSection #1 should contain the investigator's full legal name (e.g., name on the investigator's birth certificate or marriage certificate). Titles, degrees, and/or professional qualifications may follow the investigator's legal name, if desired.\n\n20. What address should be entered into Section #1?\n\nThe address where the investigator can be reached by mail or in person should be entered in Section #1 of the 1572. Usually, this corresponds to the investigator's work or business address.\n\n21. Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n\nThe term co-investigator is not defined in FDA regulations. As commonly used, the term is meant to indicate that each co-investigator is fully responsible for fulfilling all of the obligations of an investigator as identified in 21 CFR 312.60. Thus under 21 CFR 312.3(b), each co-investigator is an investigator, and as such must sign a separate 1572.\n\nIn some situations, it is preferable to have more than one investigator responsible for a clinical investigation. For example, when a study is conducted at multiple research facilities that are not in close proximity, FDA expects an investigator who has signed a 1572 to be available at each location to either personally conduct or supervise the study. This responsibility cannot be delegated to a subinvestigator.\n\nAlthough not necessary, it is acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site. For example, the conduct and supervision of a large investigation with many subjects or complicated procedures might be shared among several investigators, each of whom has signed a 1572 when the investigation is conducted under an IND. This is distinct from a subinvestigator (see #31) whose role in the clinical investigation is more limited.\n\nIII. SECTION #2: EDUCATION, TRAINING, AND EXPERIENCE THAT QUALIFY THE INVESTIGATOR AS AN EXERT IN THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION\n\n22. What is the purpose of Section #2?\n\nSection #2 requires the investigator to attach a curriculum vitae (CV) or other statement of qualifications, showing the education, training and experience that qualifies the investigator as an expert in the clinical investigation of the drug/biologic for the use under investigation. Information identified in this section and attached to the 1572 enables the sponsor to assess an investigator's qualifications.\n\n23. Does the CV or other statement of qualifications need to be updated during a clinical study?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV or other statement of qualifications to be updated during a clinical study.\n\n24. Are CVs required to be signed and dated?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV to be signed and dated. The investigator's dated signature on the 1572 is sufficient to attest to the accuracy of the CV or other statement of qualifications submitted with the 1572.\n\nIV. SECTION #3: NAME AND ADDRESS OF ANY MEDICAL SCHOOL. HOSPITAL, OR OTHER RESEARCH FACILITY WHERE THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION(S) WILL BE CONDUCTED\n\n25. What address(es) should be entered in Section #3?\n\nThe address(es) of the location(s) where the investigation will be conducted and to where the test articles will be shipped, if different from the investigator's address of record, should be entered in Section #3.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n26. What qualifies as a research facility for Section #3?\n\nSection #3 is intended to identify facilities where study activities will be conducted and clinical data will be generated or collected. This includes facilities where subjects will be seen and study procedures performed. For example, this might include locations such as health care facilities where the test article will be administered, or where physical exams will be performed. Facilities where other important clinical investigation functions are performed may also be identified in Section #3. For example, a research laboratory where the test article is prepared, a special storage facility where the test article will be kept, or a location where tissue specimens are collected should be listed in this section.\n\n27. If an investigator sees study subjects at more than one site, should the investigator list all sites on the 1572?\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions – Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572) Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs""]","['No. Although Section 13 of the E2C(R2) guidance is titled ""Lack of Efficacy in Controlled Clinical Trials,"" the intent of this section is that it should include lack of efficacy data arising from all types of clinical trials conducted or completed during the reporting interval.']",0.249999999975,0.0

Strategies for product development vary from company to company and from product to product. The approach to, and extent of, development can also vary and should be outlined in the submission. An applicant might choose either an empirical approach or a more systematic approach to product development, or a combination of both. An illustration of the potential contrasts of these approaches is shown in Appendix 1. A more systematic approach to development (also defined as quality by design) can include, for example, incorporation of prior knowledge, results of studies using design of experiments, use of quality risk management, and use of knowledge management (see ICH Q10) throughout the lifecycle of the product. Such a systematic approach can enhance achieving the desired quality of the product and help the regulators to better understand a company's strategy. Product and process understanding can be updated with the knowledge gained over the product lifecycle.\n\nA greater understanding of the product and its manufacturing process can create a basis for more flexible regulatory approaches. The degree of regulatory flexibility is predicated on the level of relevant scientific knowledge provided in the registration application. It is the knowledge gained and submitted to the authorities, and not the volume of data collected, that forms the basis for science- and risk-based submissions and regulatory evaluations. Nevertheless, appropriate data demonstrating that this knowledge is based on sound scientific principles should be presented with each application.\n\nPharmaceutical development should include, at a minimum, the following elements:\n\nDefining the quality target product profile (QTPP) as it relates to quality, safety and efficacy, considering e.g., the route of administration, dosage form, bioavailability, strength, and stability* Identifying potential critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the drug product, so that those product characteristics having an impact on product quality can be studied and controlled\n\nDetermining the critical quality attributes of the drug substance, excipients, etc., and selecting the type and amount of excipients to deliver drug product of the desired quality\n\nSelecting an appropriate manufacturing process\n\nDefining a control strategy\n\nAn enhanced, quality by design approach to product development would additionally include the following elements:\n\nA systematic evaluation, understanding and refining of the formulation and manufacturing process, including\n\nIdentifying (through, e.g., prior knowledge, experimentation, and risk assessment) the material attributes and process parameters that can have an effect on product CQAs\n\nDetermining the functional relationships that link material attributes and process parameters to product CQAs\n\nUsing the enhanced product and process understanding in combination with quality risk management to establish an appropriate control strategy, which can, for example, include a proposal for a design space(s) and/or real-time release testing\n\nAs a result, this more systematic approach could facilitate continual improvement and innovation throughout the product lifecycle (see ICH Q10).\n\n2 Elements of Pharmaceutical Development (2)\n\nThe section that follows elaborates on possible approaches to gaining a more systematic, enhanced understanding of the product and process under development. The examples given are purely illustrative and are not intended to create new regulatory requirements.\n\nQuality Target Product Profile (2.1)\n\nThe quality target product profile forms the basis of design for the development of the product. Considerations for the quality target product profile could include:\n\nIntended use in clinical setting, route of administration, dosage form, delivery systems\n\nDosage strength(s)\n\nContainer closure system * Therapeutic moiety release or delivery and attributes affecting pharmacokinetic characteristics (e.g., dissolution, aerodynamic performance) appropriate to the drug product dosage form being developed\n\nDrug product quality criteria (e.g., sterility, purity, stability, and drug release) appropriate for the intended marketed product\n\nCritical Quality Attributes (2.2)\n\nA CQA is a physical, chemical, biological, or microbiological property or characteristic that should be within an appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the desired product quality. CQAs are generally associated with the drug substance, excipients, intermediates (in-process materials), and drug product.\n\nCQAs of solid oral dosage forms are typically those aspects affecting product purity, strength, drug release, and stability. CQAs for other delivery systems can additionally include more product specific aspects, such as aerodynamic properties for inhaled products, sterility for parenterals, and adhesion properties for transdermal patches. For drug substances, raw materials, and intermediates, the CQAs can additionally include those properties (e.g., particle size distribution, bulk density) that affect drug product CQAs.\n\nPotential drug product CQAs derived from the quality target product profile and/or prior knowledge are used to guide the product and process development. The list of potential CQAs can be modified when the formulation and manufacturing process are selected and as product knowledge and process understanding increase. Quality risk management can be used to prioritize the list of potential CQAs for subsequent evaluation. Relevant CQAs can be identified by an iterative process of quality risk management and experimentation that assesses the extent to which their variation can have an impact on the quality of the drug product.\n\nRisk Assessment: Linking Material Attributes and Process Parameters to Drug Product CQAs (2.3)\n\nRisk assessment is a valuable science-based process used in quality risk management (see ICH Q9) that can aid in identifying which material attributes and process parameters potentially have an effect on product CQAs. Risk assessment is typically performed early in the pharmaceutical development process and is repeated as more information becomes available and greater knowledge is obtained.\n\nRisk assessment tools can be used to identify and rank parameters (e.g., process, equipment, input materials) with potential to have an impact on product quality, based on prior knowledge and initial experimental data. For an illustrative example, see Appendix 2. The initial list of potential parameters can be quite extensive, but can be modified and prioritized by further studies (e.g., through a combination of design of experiments, mechanistic models). The list can be refined further through experimentation to determine the significance of individual variables and potential interactions. Once the significant parameters are identified, they can be further studied (e.g., through a combination of design of experiments, mathematical models, or studies that lead to mechanistic understanding) to achieve a higher level of process understanding.\n\nDesign Space (2.4)\n\nThe relationship between the process inputs (material attributes and process parameters) and the critical quality attributes can be described in the design space (see examples in Appendix 2).\n\nSelection of Variables (2.4.1)\n\nThe risk assessment and process development experiments described in Section 2.3 can lead to an understanding of the linkage and effect of process parameters and material attributes on product CQAs and also help identify the variables and their ranges within which consistent quality can be achieved. These process parameters and material attributes can thus be selected for inclusion in the design space.\n\nA description should be provided in the application of the process parameters and material attributes considered for the design space, those that were included, and their effect on product quality. The rationale for inclusion in the design space should be presented. In some cases, it is helpful to provide also the rationale as to why some parameters were excluded. Knowledge gained from studies should be described in the submission. Process parameters and material attributes that were not varied through development should be highlighted.\n\nDescription a Design Space in a Submission (2.4.2)\n\nA design space can be described in terms of ranges of material attributes and process parameters, or through more complex mathematical relationships. It is possible to describe a design space as a time dependent function (e.g., temperature and pressure cycle of a lyophilization cycle), or as a combination of variables such as components of a multivariate model. Scaling factors can also be included if the design space is intended to span multiple operational scales. Analysis of historical data can contribute to the establishment of a design space. Regardless of how a design space is developed, it is expected that operation within the design space will result in a product meeting the defined quality.\n\nExamples of different potential approaches to presentation of a design space are presented in Appendix 2.\n\nUnit Operation Design Space(s) (2.4.3)\n--------------------\nContext title: Q8(R2) Pharmaceutical Development""

 ""--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , For release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n--------------------\nContext: The design space is applicable only within specified conditions, including\n\nAppropriately defined quality criteria for input materials;\n\nAppropriately selected CQAs and process parameters.\n\nExample 4: Selecting an Appropriate Starting Material\n\nThis example illustrates the importance of considering all general principles described in Section 5.1.1 when selecting an appropriate starting material, rather than applying each general principle in isolation. The example is fictional, based on a linear synthesis for a relatively simple molecule, and is not intended to convey any particular meaning in relation to the number of steps.\n\nThe desired stereochemical configuration in the drug substance results from the synthesis of compound B in Step 1 from a commercially available achiral precursor A and a stereo-selective reagent. A small amount of the opposite enantiomer of compound B is also formed in Step 1. Once formed, both stereochemical configurations persist through the synthetic steps that follow, so the drug substance also contains a small amount of its undesired enantiomer as a specified impurity. In accordance with the principle that manufacturing steps that impact the drug substance impurity profile should normally be included in the manufacturing process described in Section 3.2.S.2.2of the application, it could be concluded that Step 1 should be described in 3.2.S.2.2, and that A should be considered the starting material.\n\nHowever, for this manufacturing process, it is also known that all of the significant impurities in the drug substance (other than opposite enantiomer) arise from Steps 4, 5, and 6. Steps 2 and 3 have no impact on the drug substance impurity profile, and the only impact from Step 1 is with regard to the enantiomeric impurity. Furthermore, it is also known that the stereocentre first formed in Step 1 is stable to the manufacturing conditions in all of the steps that follow (i.e., no racemisation occurs or is ever likely to occur), and that a suitable analytical procedure exists for measuring the amount of the opposite enantiomer in compound D. Therefore, provided compound D is in accordance with most of the other general principles described in Section 5.1.1, it would be reasonable to propose D as the starting material instead of A in accordance with the principle that early steps in the manufacturing process tend to have a lower potential to impact drug substance quality than later steps. In this example, the only impact of Step 1 is on the amount of the enantiomeric impurity in the drug substance, and this could alternatively be controlled through an appropriate limit on the amount of the opposite enantiomer in compound D. Information on Steps 1-3 would be made available to regulatory authorities in order to justify such a proposal as per regional expectations.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11 Guideline""

FDA recommends that you include information on the basis and rationale for the change(s), where applicable.\n\nSupporting Information and Analysis\n\nSupporting information submitted with the CP should demonstrate your understanding of those aspects of the product, manufacturing process, risk, and control strategy that are relevant to the proposed change(s).\n\nThe supporting information should include the following, as applicable:\n\nPrior knowledge32 used to justify the proposed CMC change(s)\n\nA summary of the risk assessment of the proposed change(s) The risk assessment should identify the potential effects of the change(s) on product quality.33 The extent of the risk assessment should be commensurate with the level of risk associated with the proposed change(s). If multiple changes are proposed for simultaneous implementation or if a specified type of change will be made repeatedly over the life cycle of the product, the risk assessment should also address the potential for cumulative effects of these changes on product quality. Footnote 32: See footnote 33: A number of different approaches can be taken to perform risk assessments of the potential effects of the change(s) on product quality (see ICH Q8(R2), ICH Q9, and ICH Q11 for more information on possible approaches).\n\nInformation from development of the drug substance and its manufacturing process and/or pharmaceutical development that contributes to the scientific and technological understanding of a proposed change(s) and its predicted effDevelopment batches used to support the CP should be described according to batch size or scale, site, date of manufacture, route and/or process used, and intended purpose.\n\nAny studies conducted to gain an increased understanding of the proposed change(s) and the predicted effects on product quality. For example, studies at less than commercial scale (e.g., mechanistic evaluations, design of experiments, modeling, simulations) to identify the relationship between material attributes and process parameters to product quality attributes can be used to gain such an understanding. Also, process analytical technology (PAT)34 can be used to enhance understanding and control of the manufacturing process. Footnote 34: See FDA guidance for industry PAT–A Framework for Innovative Pharmaceutical Development, Manufacturing, and Quality Assurance (September 2004).\n\nA discussion regarding the suitability of the control strategy, and if applicable, any changes needed to the control strategy to accommodate the planned CMC change(s).\n\nThe amount of supporting information that should be provided depends on, and is commensurate with, the complexity of the product, manufacturing process, and the planned change. For any information that is already submitted in the same NDA, ANDA, or BLA, you should simply indicate where this information can be found (e.g., provide the section number and sequence number, or volume and page number).\n\nAppendix D Comparability Protocol for the Proposed CMC Change(s)\n\nThe CP for the proposed CMC change(s) should describe the specific tests and studies to be performed, including analytical procedures to be used, and acceptance criteria to be achieved to demonstrate the lack of adverse effect on product quality. The overall design of the CP should take into account your understanding of the product, manufacturing process, risks, and control strategy that are relevant to the proposed change(s). The intended use of the product should also be taken into account. The level of detail that should be provided in the CP depends on the complexity of the product, manufacturing process, and the proposed change(s), as well as the specific risks to product quality associated with the proposed change(s).\n\nFor a proposed product and/or manufacturing process change(s), the CP should typically include a comparative assessment of relevant product quality attributes before and after the change(s). A side-by-side comparison should be performed, if possible. A CP developed without such a side-by-side comparison should include appropriate justification.35 A CP should identify the material(s) that may be affected by the proposed CMC change(s) (e.g., in-process material, drug substance, intermediate, reagent, product component, drug product, container closure system, raw material or a combination of these, as appropriate)36 and the material(s) that will be assessed in the tests and studies based on your risk assessment for the proposed change(s). The comparative assessment should be performed at commercial manufacturing scale, except where less than commercial scale is justified.37 The projected number of batches, batch size or scale, site of manufacture, and manufacturing process to be used should be provided.\n\nFootnote 36: See footnote 19 and ICH Q7 and ICH Q11.\n\nFootnote 37: Analysis of commercial scale batches should be included for implementation to assess the effect of the change on the product, except where not feasible (e.g., viral clearance studies). Other studies at less than commercial scale can be submitted as supporting information (see section IV.C.).\n\nThe selection of the relevant tests and studies to be performed should be scientifically justified and based on the risk assessment for the proposed change(s). You should confirm that the routine quality controls (e.g., conformance to specifications, meeting process controls, annual stability batch testing) will be appropriate to ensure continued product quality after implementation of the CMC change(s). However, routine quality controls alone are generally not considered adequate to assess the impact of CMC changes since they are chosen to confirm the routine quality of the product rather than to fully characterize it. In addition to the routine quality controls, relevant characterization and other tests and studies (e.g., structural characterization, impurities characterization, comparative multipoint dissolution profiles, extractables/leachables studies, biological characterization, stability studies, as appropriate) to assess the potential effects of the proposed change(s) and to ensure continued product quality should be specified in the CP. A plan for comparison of impurity profiles before and after a change should be included, as appropriate. Stability studies (e.g., long-term, accelerated, forced degradation), when needed, should provide a comparison of products manufactured before and after the change(s) to ensure that the product will maintain quality throughout its shelf life after implementation of the proposed change(s). Any other studies based on your risk assessment also should be included, where appropriate.\n\nAnalytical procedures should be described in the CP or incorporated by reference if previously submitted in your application. The analytical procedures should be capable of providing the information needed to assess the effects of the proposed change(s) and ensure product quality. Information to support that the analytical procedures are appropriate for their intended purpose also should be provided or incorporated by reference. You should use analytical procedures, sampling methodologies, and statistical methods, where appropriate, that provide a scientifically valid assessment of product quality.38 Such procedures can include online determinations and statistical analysis. Data analysis methods and their selection and development should be described, including statistical methods to be used.\n\nFootnote 38: You must comply, as applicable, with 21 CFR 211.160.\n\nAcceptance criteria to be achieved that ensure the quality of the product after implementation of the CMC change(s) should be specified in the CP. You should confirm that the acceptance criteria established for routine quality controls are appropriate for the CP. In addition to acceptance criteria for routine quality controls, relevant acceptance criteria to be achieved demonstrating that the change(s) was successful should be specified for each characterization test and study. You should include acceptance criteria related to the success of the change(s) for impurity profiles, stability studies, and any other studies, where applicable. Acceptance criteria may also include statistical analysis, such as analysis of data for trends and/or analysis of variability to ensure the continued quality of the product. If the acceptance criteria for the change(s) allow for differences in product quality attributes, you should provide justification based on your assessment of the effect(s) of the change(s) on safety and effectiveness. If you anticipate such differences, they should be prospectively described.\n\nFor a CP that includes a proposed specification change, the CP should provide for a comparison of the approved and proposed specifications to demonstrate that the proposed specification will provide the same or greater assurance of product quality as the current specification.39\n\nFootnote 39: See ICH guidance for industry Q2(R1) Validation of Analytical Procedures: Text and Methodology (November 2005) (ICH Q2(R1)), FDA guidance for industry Analytical Procedures and Methods Validation for Drugs and Biologics (July 2015), and the Appendix for further details.\n--------------------\nContext title: Comparability Protocols for Postapproval Changes to the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information in an NDA, ANDA, or BLA""]","['For example, does it use an enteric coating or slow release matrix.']",0.99999999995,0.0909090909090909

Office of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nThe interrelationship and interaction between the research sponsor (e.g., drug, biologic and device manufacturers), the clinical investigator and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) may be very complex. The regulations do not prohibit direct sponsor-IRB contacts, although, the sponsor-IRB interaction customarily occurs through the investigator who conducts the clinical study. The clinical investigator generally provides the communication link between the IRB and the sponsor. Such linkage is agreed to by the sponsors and investigators when they sign forms FDA-1571 and FDA-1572, respectively, for drug and biologic studies or an investigator agreement for device studies. There are occasions when direct communication between the IRB and the sponsor may facilitate resolution of concerns about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The clinical investigator should be kept apprised of the discussion.\n\nSponsor Assurance that IRBs Operate in Compliance with 21 CFR Part 56\n\nFDA regulations [21 CFR 312.23(a)(1)(iv)] require that a sponsor assure the FDA that a study will be conducted in compliance with the informed consent and IRB regulations [21 CFR parts 50 and 56]. This requirement has been misinterpreted to mean that it is a sponsor\'s obligation to determine IRB compliance with the regulations. This is not the case. Sponsors should rely on the clinical investigator, who assures the sponsor on form FDA-1572 for drugs and biologics or the investigator agreement for devices that the study will be reviewed by an IRB. Because clinical investigators work directly with IRBs, it is appropriate that they assure the sponsor that the IRB is functioning in compliance with the regulations.\n\nAn IRB must notify an investigator in writing of its decision to approve, disapprove or request modifications in a proposed research activity [21 CFR 56.109(e)]. This correspondence should be made available to the sponsor by the clinical investigator. In the Agency\'s view, this required documentation provides the sponsor with reasonable assurance that an IRB complies with 21 CFR part 56 and that it will be responsible for initial and continuing review of the study. Also, the sponsor and, in fact, anyone who is interested, mayobtain an Establishment Inspection Report from an FDA inspection of an IRB. These reports summarize the conditions observed during the IRB inspection. FDA, however, does not certify IRBs.\n\nSponsor Access to Medical Records\n\nThe IRB is responsible for ensuring that informed consent documents include the extent to which the confidentiality of medical records will be maintained [21 CFR 50.25(a)(5)]. FDA requires sponsors (or research monitors hired by them) to monitor the accuracy of the data submitted to FDA in accordance with regulatory requirements. These data are generally in the possession of the clinical investigator. Each subject must be advised during the informed consent process of the extent to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained and of the possibility that the FDA may inspect the records. While FDA access to medical records is a regulatory requirement, subject names are not usually requested by FDA unless the records of particular individuals require a more detailed study of the cases, or unless there is reason to believe that the records do not represent actual cases studied or actual results obtained. The consent document should list all other entities (e.g., the sponsor) who will have access to records identifying the subject. The extent to which confidentiality will be maintained may affect a subject\'s decision to participate in a clinical investigation.\n\nConfidentiality of Sponsor Information\n\nThe IRB\'s primary responsibility with respect to protecting confidentiality is to the research subject. IRBs should, however, respect the sponsor\'s need to maintain confidentiality of certain information about products under development. IRB members and staff should be aware that information submitted for review may be confidential, trade secret, and of commercial interest and should recognize the need for maintaining the confidentiality of the review materials and IRB records. It is advisable for IRBs to have policies that address this issue.\n\nNonsignificant Risk Device Studies\n\n""A sponsor\'s preliminary determination that a medical device study presents an NSR is subject to IRB approval."" The effect of the IRB\'s NSR decision is important to research sponsors and investigators because significant risk (SR) studies require sponsors to file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with FDA before they may begin. NSR studies, however, may begin as soon as the IRB approves the study. The sponsor, usually through the clinical investigator, provides the IRB with information necessary to make a judgment on the risk of a device study. While the investigational plan and supporting materials usually contain sufficient information to make a determination, the IRB can request additional information if needed [21 CFR 812.150(b)(10)]. If the IRB believes that additional information is needed, it may contact the sponsor directly, but it should keep the clinical investigator apprised of the request. While making the SR/NSR determination, any of the three parties may ask FDA to provide a risk assessment. See FDA Information Sheet: ""Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies"" for further information.\n\nDisagreements\n\nThe sponsor may choose not to conduct, to terminate, or to discontinue studies that do not conform with the sponsor\'s wishes. For example, the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB may reach an impasse about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The FDA will not mediate such disagreements. The Agency\'s policy of decentralized ethical review of clinical investigations allows such decisions to be made by local IRBs, and any disagreements between a sponsor, IRB, and clinical investigator should be resolved through appropriate communication among those parties.\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) - Specific Electronic Submissions Intended For FDA\'s Dockets Management Staff (i.e., Citizen Pettitions, Draft Proposed Guidance Documents, Variances, and other administrative record submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management Food and Drug Administration 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061 Rockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\n[] Search for FDA Guidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 64: See section IV.A.4 for guidance regarding identification of the most up-to-date version of the informed consent form.\n\niv.2.4 Identification of Revised Consent Forms\n\nThe IRB should ensure that there is a way to identify a revised consent form so that continued use of a previously approved version does not occur. While not required by FDA regulations, the use of date stamps is one possible mechanism for ensuring use of the most recently approved version of the consent form.\n\nThe Clinical Investigator\n\nThe clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects during a clinical investigation, and for ensuring that, unless an exception applies, legally effective informed consent is obtained from each subject or the subject\'s LAR before that subject takes part in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.20(a), 312.60, and 812.100). Legally effective informed consent includes meeting all applicable Federal, State, and local laws that require additional information in the informed consent form beyond what FDA regulations require. Sponsors and investigators may wish to seek legal guidance regarding specific local consent requirements applicable to their research.\n\nThe clinical investigator should notify the IRB regarding the consent process, including who (e.g., the investigator or another study team member) will conduct the consent discussion. Any information that will be given to subjects to review and discuss as part of informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)). An investigator may not begin the informed consent process with prospective subjects until the IRB reviews and approves the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process (21 CFR 50.20, 50.27, and 56.109).\n\nThe clinical investigator\'s institution may have standard language or a standard format for consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation). FDA recognizes that investigators may also need to identify and meet institutional requirements and incorporate them into the consent form for the IRB\'s initial review of the clinical investigation.\n\nDuring the clinical investigation, the investigator may need to revise the consent form to address new information that might arise during the conduct of the trial, such as a change to the protocol or new safety information. The investigator will need to obtain IRB review and approval of the revised consent form (21 CFR 50.27 and 56.109). In addition, because the consent form is being modified to reflect new information that might affect the willingness of already enrolled and actively participating subjects to continue in the clinical investigation, the IRB should determine the need to inform the previously enrolled subjects of the new information and determine their willingness to continue in the research (see\n\nFrequently Asked Questions #16).\n\nAny new information that is part of the consent process must be reviewed and approved by the IRB as a change in approved research before it is initiated, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject (see 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)). In the rare event that urgent safety information is provided to the subject prior to IRB approval, the IRB should promptly be notified of both the safety issue and the notification of subjects.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the clinical investigator:\n\niv.2.1 Delegation of Consent Discussion\n\nFDA regulations require that the investigator obtain the legally effective informed consent of subjects (21 CFR 50.20, 312.60 and 812.100). If the investigator delegates this responsibility, FDA expects that the individual to whom the responsibility is delegated be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform this activity. The individual obtaining informed consent should be knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and have the appropriate training and credentials to be able to address any questions or concerns the subject may have about the study and/or alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject. The investigator should have a detailed plan for the supervision and training of staff, and oversight of the clinical investigation, including the informed consent process.65 Even when a task is delegated to another individual, the investigator remains responsible for ensuring that legally effective informed consent is obtained for all subjects in accordance with 21 CFR part 50.\n\niv.2.2 Financial Relationships and Interests\n\nThe clinical investigator should consider whether information related to financial relationships or interests should be provided to subjects.66 Clinical investigators should consider the potential effects that a financial relationship might have on the clinical investigation or on interactions with subjects. When there are financial relationships or interests, clinical investigators should consider the following actions:\n\nFootnote 66: See the HHS guidance document, “Financial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidance for Human Subject Protection,” available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/financial-conflict-of-interest/index.html#.\n\nIncluding information in the informed consent form, such as:\n\nThe source of funding and funding arrangements for the conduct and review of the clinical investigation, or\n\nInformation about a financial arrangement or interest (e.g., stock in the study sponsor, patent on the investigational product) of an institution or an investigator and how it is being managed.\n\nUsing special measures to modify the informed consent process when a potential or actual financial conflict exists, such as:\n\nHaving another individual who does not have a potential or actual conflict of interest involved in the consent process, especially when a potential or actual conflict of interest could influence the tone, presentation, or type of information presented during the consent process.\n\nUsing independent monitoring of the consent process.\n\nAlthough the clinical investigator should consider these issues regarding financial relationships and interests, IRBs have the final responsibility of determining whether subjects should be provided with information regarding the source of funding, funding arrangements, or financial interests of parties involved in the clinical investigation as part of the informed consent process (see 21 CFR 56.109 and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).\n\nThe Sponsor\n\nSponsors often provide clinical investigators with a model consent form that may be adapted by the clinical investigator to meet local needs. When the consent form for studies that require an IND or IDE application is submitted to FDA for review, FDA\'s comments are generally directed to the sponsor (see sectionIV.4.1, ""Investigational New Drugs and Biologics,"" and sectionIV.4.2, ""Investigational Medical Devices""). The sponsor should promptly provide the clinical investigator with any necessary modifications required to satisfy the regulations at 21 CFR 50.25 so that changes can be made to the consent forms. A modified model consent form reflecting the changes may be used to convey the necessary edits. Because the clinical investigator must receive IRB approval before starting the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 312.66 and 21 CFR 812.110(a)), the sponsor should work closely with the clinical investigator to make certain the modified consent form is reviewed and approved by the IRB. The clinical investigator should provide the sponsor with a copy of the consent form approved by the IRB.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the sponsor:\n\niv.3.1 Considerations for Multicenter Clinical Investigations\n\nFor multicenter clinical investigations, changes may need to be made to the consent form to address local and institutional requirements. For multicenter clinical investigations reviewed by more than one IRB, when local IRB review results in substantive modifications to the consent form, i.e., changes that affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects, FDA expects the sponsor to share the revisions with all investigators and their IRBs. In this situation it may be more efficient to share the changes with the sites using a modified model consent form, when appropriate. If the multicenter clinical investigation has a central IRB cooperating with local IRBs or human research protection offices, the revisions should be forwarded to the central IRB.67 Alternatively, local issues may be addressed by the central IRB depending on the review agreement between the local IRB(s) and central IRB. Note that for medicaldevice studies that require submission of an IDE application, such changes must be submitted to FDA.68\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 812.35(a).\n\nFootnote 69: The 2018 Common Rule requires that any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States, unless the research is not subject to the provision (45 CFR 46.114(b)). The compliance date for research subject to this provision was January 20, 2020. On September 28, 2022, FDA issued a proposed rule to harmonize with this requirement to the extent practicable and consistent with statutory provisions (see https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/28/2022-21089/institutional-review-boards-cooperative-research). The January 19, 2017, final rule revising the Common Rule is available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/finalized-revisions-common-rule/index.html.\n\n.4.2 Sponsor Personnel\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: In the event that an IRB waives the requirement for documentation of informed consent (under 21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)), FDA recommends that the elements of informed consent be reviewed verbally with the subject or the subject\'s LAR. Additionally, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects with a written statement regarding the clinical investigation (21 CFR 56.109(d)). See section III. E.2, ""Alternative Methods of Obtaining Informed Consent"" below for additional information regarding documentation of consent. FDA recommends that when an IRB waives the documentation requirement for informed consent in circumstances where there is minimal risk of harm under 21 CFR 56.109(c)(1), the consent process and discussion be described and noted in subject case histories required to be maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3).46\n\nFootnote 46: Documentation requirements related to emergency research, as mentioned in 21 CFR 56.109(c)(2), can be found in 21 CFR 50.24. Discussion of these studies is in a separate guidance, “Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors; Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/exception-informed-consent-requirements-emergency-research.\n\nFootnote 47: For additional information on alternative methods of obtaining informed consent, please see “Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Investigators, and Sponsors, Use of Electronic Informed Consent in Clinical Investigations,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-electronic-informed-consent-clinical-investigations-questions-and-answers, and FDA’s MyStudies Application (App) at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/science-and-research-drugs/covid-mystudies-application-app.\n\n2.2.2 Alternative Methods of Obtaining Informed Consent\n\nTraditionally, informed consent has been obtained and documented in a face-to-face interview using paper consent forms. Technologies are available that may serve as an alternative to the paper consent form in the informed consent process.47 Parties interested in pursuing alternative methods of obtaining informed consent should discuss their plan with their IRB and are welcome to contact FDA as needed for advice.48\n\nFootnote 48: Questions related to alternative methods of obtaining informed consent can be directed to the Office of Clinical Policy at gcpaquestions@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nEven in the context of paper consent forms, there may be certain circumstances when an alternative to a face-to-face consent discussion may be appropriate. For example, such an alternative may be appropriate\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:31]\n\nbe described and noted in subject case histories required to maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3).\n\niv.1.3 Requirement for Dating Consent Form\n\nIn addition to signing the consent form, the subject or the subject\'s LAR must enter the date of signature on the form (21 CFR 50.27(a)) to allow confirmation that the subject or the subject\'s LAR provided consent prior to participation in the clinical investigation, as required by 21 CFR 50.20. In those cases where the subject provides consent on the same day51 that they begin participation in the clinical investigation, the subject\'s case history must document that the subject provided consent prior to participation in the research for studies conducted under an IND or IDE, (312.62(b) and 812.140(a)(3)), and the subject\'s case history should contain the signed and dated consent form. Although FDA regulations do not require the subject\'s copy to be a signed copy, FDA recommends that a copy of the signed consent form be provided.\n\nFootnote 51: Prospective subjects should have sufficient opportunity and time to consider enrollment in the research, such that coercion and undue influence are minimized. See sectionIII.A.2, “Coercion and Undue Influence”.\n\niv.1.4 Forms for Documentation of Informed Consent\n\nUnder 21 CFR 50.27:\n\n(b) Except as provided in SS 56.109(c), the consent form may be either of the following:\n\nA written consent document that embodies the elements of informed consent required by SS 50.25_. This form may be read to the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative, but, in any event, the investigator shall give either the subject or the representative adequate opportunity to read it before it is signed._\n\nA short form written consent document stating that the elements of informed consent required by SS 50.25 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Also, the IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the representative. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining the consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.\n\nThe regulations provide for obtaining written informed consent by two different methods: a long form that embodies all the elements of informed consent (see 21 CFR 50.25), or a short form that states that the elements of informed consent have been presented orally to the subject\'s LAR.\n\nLong Form\n\nAs stated above, the long form must incorporate all the elements of informed consent as required under 21 CFR 50.25. When the long form is used, a copy must be provided to the person signing the form, that is, the subject or the subject\'s LAR (21 CFR 50.27(a)).\n\nShort Form\n\nAn IRB may approve a short form to be used in appropriate situations where the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 are presented orally to the subject or the subject\'s LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For example, IRBs may consider approving the use of a short form in situations where the subject or the subject\'s LAR is unable to read due to low literacy or visual impairment.52\n\nFootnote 52: For additional information see Frequently Asked Question #6, “What should be considered when enrolling subjects with low literacy and numeracy?” and Frequently Asked Question #7, “What should be considered when enrolling subjects with physical or sensory disabilities?” In addition, for information on enrolling individuals with limited English proficiency see Frequently Asked Question #3, “What are some considerations for enrolling non-English speaking subjects?”, Frequently Asked Question #4, “What process should be followed when it is expected that subjects who do not understand English will be enrolled?”, and Frequently Asked Question #5, “What process should be followed when the enrollment of subjects who do not understand English, or who are limited English proficient, is not expected?”\n\nWhen the short form is used, the IRB is required to approve a written summary of the information to be presented orally (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The information presented orally should be as thorough as the information contained in the long form.53 A copy of the short form and the written summary must be given to the person signing the form (that is, the subject or the subject\'s LAR) (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)).\n\nFootnote 53: See the response to Comment 52 in the preamble to the 1981 final rule issuing regulations for the protection of human subjects (46 FR 8942, January 27, 1981); https://www.fda.gov/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/protection-human-subjects-informed-consent: “The fact that a short form is used to document informed consent does not mean that the subject will get less information than if handed a long, detailed written document...All the ‘form’ provides [whether long or short] is evidence that the information required by 50.25 has been provided to a prospective subject.”\n\nUse of the short form requires that there be a witness to the oral presentation of information to the subject or the subject\'s LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). FDA recommends that an impartial third party not otherwise connected with the clinical investigation (for example, clinical staff not involved in the research, a patient advocate or an independent interpreter) serve as the witness. The witness must be present physically or by some other means, for example, by phone or video conference, during the oral presentation, not just the signing of the consent form (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The purpose of the witness is generally to attest to the voluntariness of the subject\'s consent and the adequacy of the consent process by ensuring that the information was accurately conveyed and that the subject\'s questions were answered.\n\nThe subject or the subject\'s LAR signs and dates only the short form (21 CFR 50.27(a) and (b)(2)). The witness must sign both the short form and the summary, and the person obtaining consent must sign the summary (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). Due to the additional requirements of having a witness and providing a written summary of the consent discussion, use of the short form may not ease or expedite the consent process.\n\nIV Responsibilities for informed consent\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 19: For more information, see the draft guidance for IRBs, clinical investigators, and sponsors Informed Consent Information Sheet. When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nUnder section 704(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 374(a)(1)), FDA may inspect and copy records relating to the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 312.58(a), 312.68, and 812.145(b)). FDA generally will not copy records that include the subject's name unless there is reason to believe the records do not represent the actual cases studied or results obtained. When FDA requires subject names, FDA will treat such information as confidential. On rare occasions, FDA may be required to disclose this information to third parties, such as to a court of law (see 21 CFR 20.63(a) and 20.83(a) and (b)). Therefore, the consent process should not promise or imply absolute confidentiality by FDA.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor systems that are interoperable or fully integrated, sponsors and clinical investigators should have a detailed understanding of data flow and data visibility to allow for a clear description in the informed consent of the parties granted access to the patient's data.\n\nVI Inspection, recordkeeping, and record retention requirements\n\nFDA must have access to records and may inspect and copy all records pertaining to a clinical investigation in accordance with 21 CFR 312.62, 312.68, 812.140, and 812.145. All relevant information in the EHR pertaining to the clinical investigation must be made available to FDA for review upon request (21 CFR 312.62(b), 312.68, 812.140(a), and 812.145).20 This information should be made available and viewable to FDA as original records in the EHR or as certified copies. During an inspection, FDA may also request other paper or electronic records to support data in the eCRF (e.g., case histories, other data pertaining to the clinical investigation) (see 21 CFR 312.62(b), 312.68, 812.140(a)(3), and 812.145). In addition, FDA may request to review the EHR audit trail information during inspection.\n\nFootnote 20: If the necessary records are not available for a foreign clinical study that is not conducted under an IND, FDA may not accept the study data in support of an IND or an application for marketing approval. If the records exist but a sponsor or an applicant cannot disclose them to FDA because such disclosure is prohibited by applicable foreign law, the sponsor or applicant may seek a waiver of this requirement (21 CFR 312.120(c)). For FDA to rely on such data that cannot be disclosed, the sponsor and FDA would need to agree on an alternative validation procedure. For more information, see the guidance for industry and FDA staff FDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND — Frequently Asked Questions.\n\nClinical investigators must retain all paper and electronic source documents (e.g., originals or certified copies) and records as required to be maintained in compliance with 21 CFR 312.62(c) and 812.140(d).\n\nFor human drugs and biological products, clinical investigators must retain all records (e.g., including case histories and other EHR data pertaining to a clinical investigation), as required by 21 CFR part 312, for 2 years following the date a marketing application is approved for the drug for the indication for which it is being investigated or, if no application is to be filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and FDA is notified.\n\nFor medical devices, an investigator or sponsor must maintain all records, including EHRs relating to the investigation, as required by 21 CFR 812.140(d), during the investigation and for 2 years after the latter of the following two dates:\n\nThe date on which the investigation is terminated or completed\n\nThe date that the records are no longer required for the purposes of supporting a premarket approval application or a notice of completion of a product development protocol\n\n6 Glossary\n\nAudit Trail -- Documentation that allows reconstruction of the course of events.\n\nCertified Copy -- A copy (irrespective of the type of media used) of the original record that has been verified (i.e., by a dated signature or by generation through a validated process) to have the same information, including data that describe the context, content, and structure, as the original.\n\nData Element -- A single observation associated with a subject in a clinical study. Examples include birth date, white blood cell count, pain severity measure, and other clinical observations made and documented during a study.\n\nData Originator -- An origination type associated with each data element that identifies the source of the data element's capture in the eCRF. This could be a person, a computer system, a device, or an instrument that is authorized to enter, change, or transmit data elements into the eCRF (also, sometimes known as an author).\n\nElectronic Case Report Form (eCRF) -- An auditable electronic record of information that generally is reported to the sponsor on each trial subject, according to a clinical investigation protocol. The eCRF enables clinical investigation data to be systematically captured, reviewed, managed, stored, analyzed, and reported.\n\nElectronic Data Capture (EDC) systems -- Electronic systems designed to collect and manage clinical trial data in an electronic format.\n\nElectronic Health Record (EHR) -- An individual patient record contained within the EHR system. A typical individual EHR may include a patient's medical history, diagnoses, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, pharmacy records, and laboratory and test results. This guidance uses a broad definition to be inclusive of many different types of EHRs and may not be consistent with the definition for EHRs published in other guidance documents.\n\nElectronic Health Record (EHR) systems -- Electronic platforms that contain individual health records for patients. EHR systems are generally maintained by health care providers, health care organizations, and health care institutions and are used to deliver care. EHR systems can be used to integrate real-time electronic health care information from medical devices and multiple health care providers involved in the care of patients.\n\nElectronic Source Data -- Data initially recorded in an electronic format.\n\nInteroperability -- The ability of two or more products, technologies, or systems to exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged without special effort on the part of the user.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nRegistries -- Organized systems that use observational study methods to collect uniform data (clinical and other) to evaluate specified outcomes for a population defined by a particular disease, condition, or exposure, and that serve one or more predetermined scientific, clinical or policy purposes.21\n\nFootnote 21: For more information, see Registries for Evaluating Patient Outcomes: A User’s Guide, available at https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/topics/registries-guide-3rd-edition/research/.\n\nSource Data -- All information in original records and certified copies of original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsor\n\nFor studies conducted under an IND, 21 CFR part 312 provides that a sponsor is responsible for obtaining a commitment from each investigator that he or she will ensure that requirements in part 56 relating to IRB review and approval are met with respect to the research conducted by the investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d)). Sponsors can also initiate plans for use of a centralized IRB review process and facilitate agreements and other necessary communications among the parties involved.\n\n3.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.1.2 Investigator\n\nUnder 21 CFR part 312, an investigator is responsible for ensuring that there will be initial and continuing review by a qualified IRB of research conducted by that investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d); 312.66). If the investigator is conducting clinical research as part of a multicenter study at an institution with its own IRB and is subject to the policies of that institution, those policies would dictate how the investigator will ensure IRB review. Those policies may provide that the investigator\'s responsibility can be met by ensuring review through a centralized IRB review, through the institution\'s IRB, or through apportionment of IRB review responsibilities between a centralized IRB and the institution\'s IRB.\n\nCentral IRB\n\nFor multicenter studies, the central IRB is the IRB that conducts reviews on behalf of all study sites that agree to participate in the centralized review process. For sites at institutions that have an IRB that would ordinarily review research conducted at the site, the central IRB should reach agreement with the individual institutions participating in centralized review and those institutions\' IRBs about how to apportion the review responsibilities between local IRBs and the central IRB (21 CFR 56.114).\n\nIV Addressing Local Aspects of IRB Review\n\nThe implementation of a centralized IRB review process involves addressing a number of issues related to the communities where the research will take place. The requirements for IRB membership in 21 CFR 56.107(a) specify that the membership of an IRB must have sufficient experience, expertise, and diversity to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. This requirement was intended to implement a recommendation of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research that IRB members be ""men and women of diverse backgrounds and sufficient maturity, experience, and competence to assure that the Board will be able to discharge its responsibilities and that its determinations will be accorded respect by investigators and the community served by the institution or in which it is located.""1 In addition, IRB members must ""be able to ascertain the acceptability of the proposed research in terms of institutional commitments and regulations, applicable law, and standards or professional conduct and practice"" (21 CFR 56.107(a)). Thus, IRB review, through its membership, is intended to provide meaningful consideration of various local factors in assessing research activities, including the cultural backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, educational level, religious affiliations) of the population from which research subjects will be drawn, community attitudes10 about the nature\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nof the proposed research, and the capacity of the institution to conduct or support the proposed research. Inter-community differences could influence, among other things, assessments of whether mechanisms of subject selection will be equitable, whether adequate provision is made to minimize risks to vulnerable populations, and the adequacy of the informed consent process.\n\nThe preamble to the final rule indicates that where a centralized IRB review process is used (21 CFR 56.114), the review should consider the ethical standards of the local community.11 Therefore, a centralized IRB review process should include mechanisms to ensure meaningful consideration of these relevant local factors. Possible mechanisms include:\n\nFootnote 11: Federal Register, Vol. 46, p. 8966, January 27, 1981\n\nProvision of relevant local information to the central IRB in writing by individuals or organizations familiar with the local community, institution, and/or clinical research\n\nParticipation of consultants with relevant expertise, or IRB members from the institution\'s own IRB, in the deliberations of the central IRB\n\nLimited review of a central IRB-reviewed study by the institution\'s own IRB, with that limited review focusing on issues that are of concern to the local community\n\nOther mechanisms may also be appropriate.12 IRB meeting minutes or other records should document how relevant community issues were considered in the review (21 CFR 56.115(a)) (see section 5).\n\nFootnote 12: Guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) (IRB Knowledge of Local Research Context) discusses mechanisms for ensuring adequate consideration of local factors by IRBs in review of clinical research that is supported by DHHS funding. Although the guidance applies only to DHHS funded research, it may be also helpful to off-site IRBs seeking to provide meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for non-DHHS funded clinical research.\n\n5 IRB Records -- Documenting Agreements and Procedures\n\nIRBs and institutions are required to prepare and maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities (21 CFR 56.115(a)). IRBs are also required to follow written procedures for the conduct of initial and continuing review of clinical research and for reporting their findings and actions to the investigator and the institution (21 CFR section 56.108(a), 56.115(a)(6)). The following recommendations should help IRBs fulfill these requirements.\n\nDocumenting Agreements\n\nIf an institution, its IRB, and a central IRB agree (under 21 CFR 56.114) to participate in a centralized IRB review process, they should document that action in an agreement signed by the parties. IRBs should report this action to the investigator and the institution, for example, by providing copies of the agreement to the investigator, and the institution.13 If the agreement\n\n3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApportions IRB review responsibilities between a central IRB and the institution\'s IRB, the agreement should delineate the specific responsibilities of the central IRB and the institution\'s IRB for the initial and continuing review of the study.\n\nWritten Procedures\n\nWhen an institution and an institution\'s IRB rely on review by a central IRB, both IRBs must have written procedures in place to implement the centralized IRB review process (21 CFR 56.108, 56.114). For example, procedures should address the following:\n\nHow the institution\'s IRB determines that the central IRB is qualified to review research conducted at the institution\n\nHow the central IRB intends to communicate with relevant institutions, the institutions\' IRBs, and investigators regarding its review\n\nHow the central IRB ensures that it provides meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for communities from which research subjects will be drawn (see Section 4)\n\nHow the central IRB assesses the ability of a geographically remote site to participate in a study (e.g., whether the site has medical services appropriate to the complexity of the study)\n\nWhen an institution, an institution\'s IRB, and a central IRB agree to apportion IRB review responsibilities between the two IRBs, each IRB must have written procedures describing how it implements its responsibilities under the agreement (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)).\n\nVI Using a Central IRB at Unaffiliated Sites\n\nAt clinical sites that are not already affiliated with an IRB, investigators and sponsors typically rely on the review and oversight of a central IRB. In this situation, the central IRB should document in meeting minutes or other records how it considered relevant local factors for the various communities from which research subjects are to be drawn (see Section 4). The central IRB must also document its action in agreeing to conduct IRB review for the site (21 CFR 56.115) and must have written procedures in place that describe how it will perform its initial and continuing review responsibilities at remote sites (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)) (see Section 5).\n\nVII Examples of Cooperative IRB Review Models\n\nThere are a variety of mechanisms that have been used to distribute IRB review responsibilities between an institution\'s IRB and a central IRB. This guidance is not intended to endorse any particular mechanism. These examples are provided only to illustrate possible mechanisms.\n\nTrial in Which Multiple Sites Rely on a Central IRB\n\nThe primary model contemplated by this guidance is a centralized IRB review process used for a single multicenter trial performed by a commercial or publicly funded sponsor. Under 21 CFR 56.114, IRBs affiliated with the study sites could enter into agreements with a central IRB to rely on all or some of the review findings of the central IRB, or could decline to participate in a centralized IRB review (i.e., do their own complete review). Study sites not already affiliated with an IRB would rely on a central IRB for all IRB review responsibilities.\n\nCentral IRB Formed to Review Multicenter Trials in a Therapeutic Category\n--------------------\nContext title: Using a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: materials documenting that the criteria for the exception from informed consent requirements for emergency research listed in 21 CFR 50.24(a)(1) through (4) are met;\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:26]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe IRB determines whether the proposed clinical investigation can be approved and allowed to proceed and notifies the investigators and the institution(s) in writing of its decision.\n\nIf the IRB decides that it cannot approve the investigation because it does not meet all of the criteria under 21 CFR 50.24 and 56.111 (and Part 50, Subpart D for pediatric research), or because of other relevant ethical concerns, the IRB promptly notifies the investigator and the sponsor in writing, including a statement of the reasons for the IRB\'s determination (21 CFR 50.24(e) and 56.109(e)).\n\nPrior to the initiation of an investigation, the IRB reviews the information that will be publicly disclosed to assure that the information will reach the broader communities involved and will adequately inform the affected communities of the plans to conduct the investigation and its risks and expected benefits.\n\nThe IRB must find and document that the public disclosure will have or has taken place prior to initiation of the investigation (21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(ii)).\n\nThe IRB promptly provides to the sponsor in writing a copy of the information that has been publicly disclosed about the initiation of the study under 21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(ii): see 21 CFR 56.109(g).\n\nAfter the study is completed, the IRB reviews the plans for disclosure of sufficient information to apprise the community and researchers of the study, including the demographic characteristics of the research population and its results.\n\nThe IRB promptly provides to the sponsor in writing a copy of the information that has been publicly disclosed following completion of the study (21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(iii); 21 CFR 56.109(g), 312.54(a) and 812.47(a)).\n\nThe IRB retains records related to these studies for at least 3 years after completion of the clinical investigation and makes them accessible for inspection and copying by FDA (21 CFR 50.24(c)).\n\n47. Is the IRB responsible only for finding and documenting that the plans for community consultation and public disclosure exist, or does the IRB have additional responsibilities for ensuring that these activities are implemented?\n\nThe IRB must review the plans for community consultation and public disclosure before the plans are implemented (21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(i), (ii), (iii)). FDA also expects the IRB to consider the concerns and objections raised during community consultation activities when the IRB deliberates on whether to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval) or disapprove the research activity. An IRB may decide, at its discretion, that it is appropriate for the IRB itself to carry out community consultation activities, for example, if it determines that the plans were not adequately implemented. In addition, the IRB must find and document that the public disclosure will have or has taken place prior to initiation of the investigation (21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(ii)).\n\n48. If an IRB determines that it needs additional input from the community about the study, what should the IRB do?\n\nThe IRB could:Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nInvite members of the community from which the subjects will be drawn to an IRB meeting to discuss the study;\n\nConsistent with IRB membership requirements (see 21 CFR 56.107), enhance the membership of the IRB by adding members who are not affiliated with the institution and are representative of the community;\n\nUse community members as consultants to the IRB under 21 CFR 56.107(f). Use of consultants would not by itself adequately substitute for the community consultation called for in 21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(i);\n\nRequest that the sponsor and investigator conduct additional or other community consultation activities; and\n\nDecide, where appropriate, to conduct community consultation activities itself (21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(i)). The IRB could use one or more of the activities listed in Question 76 (e.g., hold a public community meeting to discuss the protocol).\n\nMust an emergency research study be reviewed only by IRBs that are affiliated with institutions?\n\nNo. All of the options available for IRB review of non-emergency research studies are also available for review of emergency research studies. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nEmergency research may be reviewed by an IRB that is responsible for reviewing all studies at a particular institution.\n\nEmergency research may be reviewed by an independent (commercial) IRB.\n\nEmergency research may be reviewed using a centralized IRB process.33, 34, 35) When a centralized IRB process is used:\n\nThe central IRB may be responsible for reviewing all aspects of the study, including local issues.\n\nReview may be shared by a local IRB and central IRB who cooperate in the review of emergency research studies. ( 21 CFR 56.114) For example, the central IRB may agree to be responsible for the scientific review of the study and the informed consent document; the local IRB may agree to be responsible for evaluating plans for community consultation and public disclosure.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAny IRB that reviews an emergency research study must be able to ascertain the acceptability of the proposed research in terms of institutional commitments and regulations, applicable law, and standards of professional conduct and practice; therefore the IRB needs to include persons knowledgeable in these areas (21 CFR 56.107).\n\nThe IRB that is responsible for finding and documenting that community consultation and public disclosure will take place (as required by 21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)) should be knowledgeable about local conditions in order to evaluate the community consultation and public disclosure plans. A central IRB may want to obtain input from an IRB at the institution where the research is to be conducted, to ensure that local concerns are addressed. The institution\'s IRB may have additional insights or knowledge about local or State laws or regulations pertaining to emergency research studies, the demographics of the area in which the study will take place, the need to translate the informed consent document, community consultation or public disclosure materials into other languages, practices of emergency medical services in the area, etc.\n\nResponsibility for these studies should not be delegated to another IRB unless the institution agrees to the transfer. Any such agreements to allow review using a centralized IRB process or an IRB other than the institution\'s IRB should be in writing.36 Copies of any agreements should be provided to all parties involved in conducting the research (e.g., the institution, the institution\'s IRB, the central IRB, clinical investigator(s)).\n\nFootnote 36: In the preamble to the proposed rule, FDA said that the agency anticipates that research involving an exception from informed consent will usually be performed at an institution with an IRB. However, any duly constituted IRB can ensure that the rights and welfare of research subjects are protected by fulfilling the requirements of part 56 (21 CFR part 56) and $ 50.24, including § 50.24(a)(7) requiring public disclosure to and consultation with the communities from which the subjects will be drawn. FDA recognizes that independent IRBs can also review such studies, or institutions can enter into agreements to use a centralized IRB review process. Any agreement delegating review responsibilities to an independent IRB or using a centralized IRB Review process should be documented in writing. See 61 Fed. Reg. 51504 (Comment #18).\n\n4.2.3 How should an IRB document its review of an emergency research study?\n\nIRB meeting minutes must be in sufficient detail to show attendance at the meetings, actions taken by the IRB, the vote on these actions, the basis for requiring changes in or disapproving research, and a written summary of the discussion of controverted issues and their resolution (21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)). FDA anticipates that a study in which informed consent is not obtained for all subjects is by its very nature controversial. Therefore IRBs must summarize their discussions and decisions regarding the required elements for these studies (21 CFR 50.24(a)) in the IRB\'s written meeting minutes. For example, the IRB would document its discussion of issues raised during community consultation activities, particularly discussions of community opposition to, or concern about, the emergency research study. If the IRB approves the study despite the objection of some part(s) of the community, the IRB should also document this, and provide its reason(s) for doing so.\n\n4.2.4 What is meant by ""licensed physician concurrence""?\n\nThe IRB must have the concurrence of a licensed physician, both initially and at the time of continuing review, that the criteria of 21 CFR 50.24 are met (21 CFR 50.24(a)). The licensed physician must be ""a member of or consultant to the IRB and...not otherwise participating in the clinical investigation"" (21 CFR 50.24(a)). Where the licensed physician member(s) cannot participate in the deliberation andvoting for any reason, participation in the convened meeting by a licensed physician consultant would be necessary. Because the concurrence of the licensed physician member or licensed physician consultant is required for the IRB to allow these studies to proceed, IRBs should ensure that meeting minutes record the licensed physician member\'s affirmative vote or the licensed physician consultant\'s concurrence (21 CFR 50.24(a) and 56.115(a)(2)).\n\nVI Sponsor\'s responsibilities\n\nWhat are the sponsor\'s responsibilities under 21 CFR 50.24?\n--------------------\nContext title: Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors']","['For investigational devices, the informed consent is a required part of the IDE submission.

For those metabolites that have been determined to exceed 10 percent of drug-related material in humans only after repeated dosing, steady state levels (clinical and nonclinical) should be used to assess the adequacy of the exposure margins.\n\nQ6:: The M3(R2) guidance says: ""Nonclinical characterization of a human metabolite(s) is only warranted when that metabolite(s) is observed at exposures greater than 10 percent of total drug-related exposure and at significantly greater levels in humans than the maximum exposure seen in the toxicity studies.""\n\nWhen a human metabolite exposure is compared to the maximum exposure of that metabolite in toxicity studies, should it always be to the highest exposure achieved in the animal studies or is it more appropriate in some cases to use the exposure at the NOAEL, NOEL (no observed effect level), or MTD?\n\nA6: Because the parent drug and metabolites contribute to the target organ toxicity profile observed in animals at the MTD, the exposure comparisons across species should be conducted at the MTD in the animal compared to the maximum exposure in humans at the therapeutic dose, assuming the toxicity of concern can be adequately monitored in humans and does not pose an unacceptable risk. If the toxicity at the MTD is not monitorable in humans or poses an unacceptable risk, then the exposure comparison should be conducted at the NOAEL for the toxicity of concern.\n\nQ7:: When in development, should data on nonclinical metabolites be available?\n\nA7: As described in ICH M3(R2), section III Toxicokinetic and Pharmacokine Studies (3), paragraph 1, in vitro metabolism data for animals and humans should be evaluated before initiating human clinical trials. Data on in vivo metabolism in test species and humans should be available before exposing large numbers of human subjects or treating for long duration (generally before phase 3).\n\nQ8:: Clarification is sought on metabolites that may not be of toxicological concern. In ICH M3(R2), what is meant by ""most"" in the phrase ""most glutathione conjugates""? Would acyl glucuronides that can undergo chemical rearrangement be an example of a concern? What should we do about chemically reactive metabolites?\n\nA8: Although there are relatively rare exceptions, most glutathione conjugates are formed by conjugation with reactive metabolites to form excretory metabolites that are not of toxicological concern. Most glucuronides are not of concern, except those that undergo chemical rearrangement (e.g., reactive acyl glucuronides). Highly chemically reactive metabolites, although of toxicological concern, do not generally accumulate in plasma due to their short half-life. Generally, it is not feasible to test highly reactive metabolites independently because of their instability, but they are assumed to contribute to the overall nonclinical toxicity of the drug.\n\nQ9: Should safety pharmacology studies be conducted for metabolites that warrant nonclinical characterization?\n\nA9: Clinical studies assessing safety pharmacology endpoints are generally conducted during phase 1. These endpoints will have already been assessed in humans before a full characterization of the metabolites is conducted. Therefore, nonclinical safety pharmacology studies are generally not warranted for the characterization of metabolites. However, if a safety pharmacology signal is seen in humans that was not predicted by nonclinical studies with the parent, then additional safety pharmacology studies of these human metabolites can be considered to better understand the mechanism (see ICH S7A and ICH S7B).\n\nQ10: What does ""in vitro biochemical information"" mean in section III (3), paragraph 1, of ICH M3(R2)?\n\nA10: In vitro biochemical information includes standard in vitro metabolic evaluation (e.g., cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition, pregnane X receptor (PXR) activation assays). It can include studies with hepatic microsomes/hepatocytes or studies on potential interactions via drug transporters.\n\nQ11: What should be the design of nonclinical studies for metabolites (e.g., species, duration, study type)?\n\nA11: This level of detail is generally out of scope for ICH M3(R2); study design should be considered on a case-by-case basis using scientific judgment in consultation with regulatory agencies. Also see answers to other questions in this section (e.g., Q3 and Q9).\n\nQ12: Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n\nA12: The guidance does not specifically address prodrugs. If the animal species converts the prodrug to the active metabolite similarly to humans, then a standard testing approach as recommended in ICH M3(R2) can be used. If the active metabolite is not adequately produced in the animal species, then the target molecule for toxicological evaluation is the active metabolite and therefore additional testing beyond that recommended for metabolites can be appropriate. Timing of the nonclinical testing of the active metabolite in this case should follow the general timelines as outlined in ICH M3(R2) rather than the timing indicated for metabolite testing in section III (3) of M3(R2).\nQ1:: When is assessment of reversibility considered to be appropriate and is it important to demonstrate full reversibility or is it sufficient to demonstrate the potential for full reversibility?\n\nICH M3(R2) states the following in section I.D General Principles (1.4): ""The goals of the nonclinical safety evaluation generally include a characterization of toxic effects with respect to target organs, dose dependence, relationship to exposure, and, when appropriate, potential reversibility."" Evaluation of the potential for reversibility of toxicity (i.e., return to the original or normal condition) should be provided when there is severe toxicity in a nonclinical study with potential adverse clinical impact. The evaluation can be based on a study of reversibility or on a scientific assessment. The scientific assessment of reversibility can include the extent and severity of the pathologic lesion, the regenerative capacity of the organ system showing the effect and knowledge of other drugs causing the effect. Thus, recovery arms or studies are not always critical to conclude whether an adverse effect is reversible. The demonstration of full reversibility is not considered essential. A trend towards reversibility (decrease in incidence or severity), and scientific assessment that this trend would eventually progress to full reversibility, are generally sufficient. If full reversibility is not anticipated, this should be considered in the clinical risk assessment. A toxicity study that includes a terminal non-dosing period is generally warranted if a scientific assessment cannot predict whether the toxicity will be reversible and if:\n\nthere is severe toxicity at clinically relevant exposures (e.g., (\\leq 10)-fold the clinical exposure); or\n\nthe toxicity is only detectable at an advanced stage of the pathophysiology in humans and where significant reduction in organ function is expected. (The assessment of reversibility in this case should be considered even at (>10)-fold exposure multiples.) A toxicity study that includes a terminal non-dosing period is generally not warranted when the toxicity:\n\ncan be readily monitored in humans at an early stage before the toxicity becomes severe; or\n\nis known to be irrelevant to humans (e.g., rodent Harderian gland toxicity); or\n\nis only observed at high exposures not considered clinically relevant (see 2 above for exception); or\n\nis similar to that induced by related agents, and the toxicity based on prior clinical experience with these related agents is considered a manageable risk.\nIf a study of reversibility is called for, it should be available to support clinical studies of a duration similar to those at which the adverse effects were seen nonclinically. However, a reversibility study is generally not warranted to support clinical trials of a duration equivalent to that at which the adverse effect was not observed nonclinically. If a particular lesion is demonstrated to be reversible in a short duration (e.g., 2-week or 1-month) study, and does not progress in severity in longer term studies, repeating the reversibility assessment in longer term toxicity studies is generally not warranted. If a reversibility study is warranted, it is efficient to conduct it as part of a chronic study so that all toxicities of concern can be assessed in a single study, provided that it is not critical to conduct it earlier to support a specific clinical trial.\n\nCombination Drug Toxicity Testing (4)\n\nIf two (or more) late stage entities are combined but for one of them the human dosage/exposure will be higher than that already approved, is it important to conduct a combination toxicity study or are the existing nonclinical data and clinical experience with the lower dose considered adequate to address the nonclinical assessment?\n--------------------\nContext title: M3(R2)Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals- Questions and Answers'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: Q4: The M3(R2) guidance provides advice on establishing the maximum dose (exposure) permitted in exploratory clinical trials but provides minimal guidance for establishing the maximum dose in standard phase 1 or clinical development trials. Can the maximum dose in standard phase 1 trials be based on the principles described for exploratory clinical trials (Table 3 of M3(R2))?\n\nA4: When the package of nonclinical studies meets the general recommendations of section V.A (5.1) of ICH M3(R2), then the maximum clinical dose for a clinical development phase 1 study can be based on standard risk assessments (e.g., whether the findings are reversible and/or monitorable, the severity of the indication, adverse effects in clinical studies; also see section VI (6) of ICH M3(R2) and regional guidances). This would normally support a higher clinical dose than that recommended for exploratory clinical trials. However, a sponsor has the option to set a lower maximum clinical dose for a phase 1 study (e.g., based on the principles described for exploratory approaches).\n\nQ5: What are reasonable strategies for exploratory clinical trials with biotechnology-derived products?\n\nA5: Exploratory clinical trial approaches can be applicable to biotechnology-derived products. Biotechnology-derived products include a wide variety of molecular structures and targets (e.g., peptides, polypeptides, therapeutic proteins, and monoclonal antibodies). The designs of the exploratory clinical trial and supporting toxicity studies for biotechnology-derived products should reflect their special features as described in ICH S6(R1). This includes the duration of exposure, the potential for immunogenicity in animals or humans, and the possibility that dose-limiting toxicity might be due to on-target, pharmacodynamic-related mechanisms. ICH S6(R1) recommends that exploratory clinical trial approaches be discussed with the appropriate regulatory authorities.\n\nQ9: What chemistry, manufacturing, and control (CMC) information should be available for an exploratory clinical trial?\n\nA9: CMC information for exploratory clinical trials was not addressed in ICH M3(R2). Consult appropriate regulatory authorities and regional guidances.\n\nQ10: Does evaluation of potential mutagenic impurities (e.g., structure-activity relationship (SAR) or testing) apply to exploratory clinical trial support?\n\nA10: The drug substance should be considered appropriate from a CMC perspective. For approaches 1 and 2 (microdose studies), SAR or genotoxicity testing is not recommended for the parent drug or for the impurities. For other exploratory clinical trial approaches where higher doses and longer treatments are used, available guidance on mutagenic impurities should be followed.\n\nReproductive Toxicity (7)\n\nQ1a: Endnote 4: In the preliminary embryo-fetal developmental study, what is the definition of ""adequate dose levels""? Does this mean maternal toxicity at least one dose level? If only one or two dose levels have surviving fetuses, would that be adequate?\n\nA1a: The same dose selection criteria used for a definitive embryo-fetal development study should be used for the preliminary study (see ICH S5).\n\nQ1b: Endnote 4: The text specifies a minimum of six dams per group. Does this mean a minimum of six litters per group should be evaluated?\n\nA1b: No. Sometimes pregnant females have total loss of litters. Dosing should be initiated with a minimum of six presumed pregnant females per group, with all surviving litters evaluated.\n\nQ1a: Are embryo-fetal development studies or the demonstration that the drug and/or metabolites do not partition into semen important for male-only products?\n\nA1a: The ICH M3(R2) guidance does not address recommendations for embryo-fetal development studies in products intended for use only in males. Embryo-fetal development studies for a male-only drug should be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nQ2b:: Should contraception be used in male-only studies until reproductive risks have been evaluated?\n\nA2b: It is general practice to use contraception in males until the potential for reproductive and developmental risk has been addressed.\nH.: Juvenile Animal Studies (8)\n\nWhat is the appropriate duration of treatment for a toxicity study using juvenile animals to address a specific issue of concern?\n\nA1: Specific aspects of the design of juvenile toxicity studies are outside the scope of ICH M3(R2). However, in general, the duration of such a study will depend on the toxicity to be addressed, the organ system involved, and the information available from previous studies. The design and duration of the study should address the concerns for the product\'s potential to affect the developing organ systems of the intended clinical population.\n\nTo reduce animal use, the specific issue of concern can sometimes be evaluated by incorporating developmental endpoints into a general repeated-dose toxicity study or into a pre/postnatal toxicity study in which the pups were adequately exposed to the drug.\n\nClarify when a second species might be important.\n\nThe guidance states that when a juvenile animal toxicity study is warranted, one relevant species (preferably rodents) is generally considered adequate. It may be difficult to prospectively describe the majority of instances in which a second study in another species is scientifically justified, but can parameters be described that are not reasonable justifications?\n\nA2: There are few circumstances for which juvenile animal studies in two species would be recommended besides (1) an absence of adult human data (i.e., a pediatric-only indication), or (2) there are multiple specific issues of developmental concern and no one species is able to address them adequately. Some situations for which a juvenile study in a second species is not warranted include the following: solely because a therapeutic is first-in-class, when verifying adverse findings in a juvenile study in one species, or when further examining behavioral effects of agents for which such effects are known or can be expected.\n\nPlease clarify what is important for pediatric-only indications. Should a juvenile animal study be conducted to support a pharmacokinetic (PK) study inpediatric populations if you don\'t have any adult data? Should a second species be studied?\n\nGenerally, data from adult human volunteers and the supporting nonclinical data (in two species) should be available before pediatric clinical trials are initiated, even when the product is not intended for development in adults. Section XII (12) of ICH M3(R2), Clinical Trials in Pediatric Populations, generally provides recommendations for the situation in which adult clinical trials should precede pediatric trials and indicates that juvenile animal toxicity studies are not considered important to support short-term PK trials in pediatric populations. However, if data from adult humans are not available and the drug will be developed only for pediatric subjects, then this is a case where juvenile animal studies in two species would be appropriate to support pediatric PK trials.\n--------------------\nContext title: M3(R2)Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals- Questions and Answers'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: This guidance does not apply to pharmaceuticals intended for cancer prevention, treatment of symptoms or side effects of chemotherapeutics, studies in healthy volunteers, vaccines, or cellular or gene therapy. If healthy volunteers are included in clinical trials, the ICH M3 guidance should be followed. Radiopharmaceuticals are not covered in this guidance, but some of the principles could be adapted.\n\nGeneral Principles (4)\n\nThe development of each new pharmaceutical calls for studies designed to characterize its pharmacological and toxicological properties according to its intended use in humans.\n\nModification of ""standard"" nonclinical testing protocols generally is warranted to address novel characteristics associated with the pharmaceutical or with the manner in which it is to be used in humans.\n\nThe manufacturing process can change during the course of development. However, the active pharmaceutical substance used in nonclinical studies should be well characterized and should adequately represent the active substance to be used in the clinical trials.\n\nIn general, nonclinical safety studies that are used to support the development of a pharmaceutical should be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices.\n\nII Studies to Support Nonclinical Evaluation (2)\n\nPharmacology (1)\n\nPrior to Phase 1 studies, preliminary characterization of the mechanism(s) of action and schedule dependencies, as well as anti-tumor activity of the pharmaceutical, should have been made. Appropriate models should be selected based on the target and mechanism of action, but the pharmaceutical need not be studied using the same tumor types intended for clinical evaluation.\n\nThese studies can:\n\nprovide nonclinical proof of principle;\n\nguide schedules and dose-escalation schemes;\n\nprovide information for selection of test species;\n\naid in start dose selection and selection of investigational biomarkers, where appropriate; and,\n\nif relevant, justify pharmaceutical combinations.\n\nUnderstanding the secondary pharmacodynamic properties of a pharmaceutical could contribute to the assessment of safety for humans, and those properties might be investigated as appropriate.\n\nSafety Pharmacology (2)\n\nAn assessment of the pharmaceutical\'s effect on vital organ functions (including cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems) should be available before the initiation of clinical studies; such parameters could be included in general toxicology studies. Detailed clinical observations following dosing and appropriate electrocardiographic measurements in nonrodents are generally considered sufficient. Conducting stand-alone safety pharmacology studies to support studies in patients with advanced cancer is not called for. In cases where specific concerns have been identified that could put patients at significant additional risks in clinical trials, appropriate safety pharmacology studies described in ICH S7A and/or S7B should be considered. In the absence of a specific risk, such studies will not be called for to support clinical trials or for marketing.\n\nPharmacokinetics (2.3)\n\nThe evaluation of limited pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., peak plasma/serum levels, area under the curve (AUC), and half-life) in the animal species used for nonclinical studies can facilitate dose selection, schedule, and escalation during Phase 1 studies. Further information on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the pharmaceutical in animals should normally be generated in parallel with clinical development.\n\nGeneral Toxicology (2.4)\n\nThe primary objective of Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer is to assess the safety of the pharmaceutical. Phase 1 assessments can include dosing to a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Toxicology studies to determine a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) or no effect level (NOEL) are not considered essential to support clinical use of an anticancer pharmaceutical. As the toxicity of the pharmaceutical can be greatly influenced by its schedule of administration, an approximation of its clinical schedule should be evaluated in toxicology studies. This is further discussed in sections III.C and III.D (3.3 and 3.4).\n\nAssessment of the potential to recover from toxicity should be provided to understand whether serious adverse effects are reversible or irreversible. A study that includes a terminal nondosing period is called for if there is severe toxicity at approximate clinical exposure and recovery cannot be predicted by scientific assessment. This scientific assessment can include the extent and severity of the pathologic lesion and the regenerative capacity of the organ system showing the effect. If a study of recovery is called for, it should be available to support clinical development. The demonstration of complete recovery is not considered essential.\n\nFor small molecules, the general toxicology testing usually includes rodents and nonrodents. In certain circumstances, determined case-by-case, alternative approaches can be appropriate (e.g., for genotoxic drugs targeting rapidly dividing cells, a repeat-dose toxicity study in one rodent species might be considered sufficient, provided the rodent is a relevant species). For biopharmaceuticals, see ICH S6 for the number of species to be studied.\n\nToxicokinetic evaluation should be conducted as appropriate.\n\nReproduction Toxicology (2.5)\n\nAn embryofetal toxicology assessment is conducted to communicate potential risk for the developing embryo or fetus to patients who are or might become pregnant. Embryofetal toxicity studies of anticancer pharmaceuticals should be available when the marketing application is submitted, but these studies are not considered essential to support clinical trials intended for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. These studies are also not considered essential for the purpose of marketing applications for pharmaceuticals that are genotoxic and target rapidly dividing cells (e.g., crypt cells, bone marrow) in general toxicity studies or belong to a class that has been well characterized as causing developmental toxicity.\n\nFor small molecules, embryofetal toxicology studies are typically conducted in two species as described by ICH S5(R2). In cases where an embryofetal developmental toxicity study is positive for embryofetal lethality or teratogenicity, a confirmatory study in a second species is usually not warranted.\n\nFor biopharmaceuticales, an assessment in one pharmacologically relevant species should usually be sufficient. This assessment might be done by evaluating the toxicity during the period of organogenesis or study designs as described by ICH S6. Alternative approaches might be considered appropriate if scientifically justified. The alternative approaches might include a literature assessment, assessment of placental transfer, the direct or indirect effects of the biopharmaceutical, or other factors.\n\nA study of fertility and early embryonic development is not warranted to support clinical trials or for marketing of pharmaceuticals intended for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. Information available from general toxicology studies on the pharmaceutical\'s effect on reproductive organs should be used as the basis of the assessment of impairment of fertility.\n\nA pre- and postnatal toxicology study is generally not warranted to support clinical trials or for marketing of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer.\n\nF. Genotoxicity (2.6)\n\nGenotoxicity studies are not considered essential to support clinical trials for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer. Genotoxicity studies should be performed to support marketing (see ICH S2). The principles outlined in ICH S6 should be followed for biopharmaceuticales. If the in vitro assays are positive, an in vivo assay might not be warranted.\n\nG. Carcinogenicity (2.7)\n\nThe appropriateness of a carcinogenicity assessment for anticancer pharmaceuticals is described in ICH S1A. Carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer.\n\nH. Immunotoxicity (2.8)\n\nFor most anticancer pharmaceuticals, the design components of the general toxicology studies are considered sufficient to evaluate immunotoxic potential and support marketing. For immunomodulatory pharmacokinetics, additional endpoints (such as immunophenotyping by flow cytometry) might be included in the study design.\n\nI. Photosafety testing (2.9)\n\nAn initial assessment of phototoxic potential should be conducted prior to Phase 1, based on photochemical properties of the drug and information on other members in the class. If assessment of these data indicates a potential risk, appropriate protective measures should be taken during outpatient trials. If the photosafety risk cannot be adequately evaluated based on nonclinical data or clinical experience, a photosafety assessment consistent with the principles described in ICH M3 should be provided prior to marketing.\n\n3 Nonclinical data to support clinical trial design and Marketing (3)\n\nStart Dose for First Administration in Humans (3.1)\n\nThe goal of selecting the start dose is to identify a dose that is expected to have pharmacologic effects and is reasonably safe to use. The start dose should be scientifically justified using all available nonclinical data (e.g., pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicity), and its selection based on various approaches (see Note 2). For most systemically administered small molecules, interspecies scaling of the animal doses to an equivalent human dose is usually based on normalization to body surface area. For both small molecules and biopharmaceuticals, interspecies scaling based on body weight, AUC, or other exposure parameters might be appropriate.\n--------------------\nContext title: S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals'

The approaches outlined below are provided as examples that sponsors may consider using. These approaches are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive; in some cases combining elements from different approaches may be appropriate. Sponsors are encouraged to discuss their specific proposed development programs with the FDA before commencing clinical trials. The following are examples of trial design considerations.\n\nNoninferiority clinical trials\n\nThe efficacy of an investigational drug intended to treat serious bacterial diseases in patients with an unmet medical need can be established on the basis of a noninferiority trial in a population of patients who have treatment options for their serious bacterial disease. The trial population should include patients with severity of illness and/or comorbid conditions that are similar to those of patients who have an unmet medical need to have a finding of safety and efficacy that can be relevant to the patient population with unmet medical need (i.e., patients with infections caused by bacteria resistant to other available antibacterial drugs).15({}^{,})16({}^{,})17\n\nFootnote 15: Patients with unmet need may have greater comorbidities, altered pharmacokinetics, or disease severity that affect treatment effect and patient outcomes. Enrolling patients with these characteristics in the noninferiority trial should increase the generalizability to similar populations of patients who have unmet need.\n\nGiven that the antibacterial drug would be indicated for use only for patients who have limited or no treatment options, the characterization of efficacy in a noninferiority trial could be based on a larger noninferiority margin than is typically recommended in infectious disease-specific guidances but still establishes effectiveness.18 The labeled indication would specifically state that the drug should be reserved for patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options (see the response to Question 17).\n\nFootnote 16: A hierarchical nested noninferiority/superiority analysis can be considered if a sufficient number of patients with infection caused by bacteria resistant to the control drug are expected to be enrolled in the trial. See the response in Question 4.c., Nested noninferiority/superiority clinical trials.\n\nBecause there usually will be few patients, if any, who have an unmet medical need in the noninferiority trial, sponsors may want to consider an additional clinical trial in patients with an unmet medical need.19 The additional clinical trial can be conducted in patients with the specific type of infection studied in the noninferiority trial as well as other types of infections of comparable or greater disease severity. Ideally, a randomized active-controlled trial is the best option, if active control therapy is feasible and ethical, because then comparative safety and efficacy evaluations can be performed. Experience has shown that having a randomized comparator group can be particularly important for interpreting safety data from the trial (in small trials that enroll acutely ill patients, having a comparator group can help in evaluating adverse events that may represent background adverse events in this ill population). This trial does not have to be powered for inference testing. If demonstrating statistical superiority is planned, refer to the response in Question 4.b., Superiority clinical trials.\n\nThe additional clinical trial should collect information on patient comorbidities, disease severity, and pharmacokinetics, with comparisons to the patient population in the noninferiority trial (see the response to Question 7 regarding PK/PD considerations).\n\n4 Superiority clinical trials\n\nAn investigational drug can be compared to best-available active control therapy in a single randomized controlled superiority trial. Sponsors should discuss with the FDA the type of trial design (e.g., a trial enrolling patients who have a particular type of infection (e.g., ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia) or who have different types of infection (e.g., ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia and complicated intra-abdominal infection)) and inferential statistical evaluations for a finding of superiority.\n\nThere may not be sufficient historical experience to clearly establish a reliable and reproducible treatment effect of the best available active control antibacterial drug therapy against placebo or no treatment. However, it is likely that it has a treatment effect greater than placebo or no treatment. Given this likelihood, it may be difficult to show unequivocal superiority for the investigational drug and it may be appropriate to use a less stringent statistical finding for superiority. In this case, an efficacy finding less robust than usual would be accepted as evidence of efficacy to enable the drug to be marketed because of the identified unmet medical need.\n\nA superiority trial design can be used to evaluate an antibacterial drug with activity against a single species (or a few species) of bacteria. A sufficient number of patients for enrollment into a trial of a particular type of infection (e.g., ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia) may not be available. Patients with infections at more than one body site caused by the bacterial species of interest can be enrolled in the trial, with inferential statistical testing for superiority.\n\nA superiority clinical trial design that relies on an external control population may be appropriate to evaluate efficacy when the untreated morbidity and/or mortality is high and does not vary widely in the patient population with unmet medical need, and the effect of the investigational drug in an unmet medical need population is expected to be large.20 For an externally controlled trial, the control patients should be as similar as possible to the population expected to receive the investigational drug. Patients should have been treated in a similar setting and in a similar time frame, except with respect to the investigational drug therapy. For sponsors considering an externally controlled trial, we recommend randomizing at least a small number of patients to the active control (e.g., through disproportionate randomization of 4:1), if feasible and ethical based on an active control considered to be best-available therapy. This will allow for an assessment of the comparability of the external control to the trial population. Frequentist and Bayesian statistical methods can then be used to combine external control data with data from the patients randomized to the active control in assessing differences between treatment groups for the primary comparison.\n\nNested noninferiority/superiority clinical trials\n\nPatients with and without unmet medical need can be included in a nested, active-controlled noninferiority/superiority trial design. Patients should be randomized to the investigational drug or the control drug before the availability of the results of antibacterial drug susceptibility testing of the bacteria causing the patient's infection because of the time required for results from susceptibility testing to become available using current technologies. The trial should include provisions for adjusting the control regimen to provide standard-of-care treatment for patients who are found to have resistant bacterial isolates at baseline. It is essential that adequate procedures be in place to protect patients enrolled in this trial from avoidable exposure to less effective therapy.\n--------------------\nContext title: Antibacterial Therapies for Patients With an Unmet Medical Need for the Treatment of Serious Bacterial Diseases""

More extensive characterization may be required for complex or biological products. Formulations should be well characterized in the drug development plan, including information on bioavailability, wherever feasible, and should be appropriate for the stage of drug development and the targeted patient population. Age-appropriate formulation development may be a consideration when clinical studies are planned in pediatric populations (ICH guidances for industry E11 Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population (December 2000) and E11(R1) Addendum: Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population (April 2018)).\n\nEvaluation of the quality of a drug may extend to devices required for its administration or a companion diagnostic to identify the targeted population.\n\nChanges in a product during development should be supported by comparability data to ensure the ability to interpret study results across the development program. This includes establishing links between formulations through bioequivalence studies or other means.\n\nNonclinical Studies (4.2)\n\nGuidance on nonclinical safety studies is provided in the ICH guidance for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals (January 2010), in ICH Safety (S) Guidances and related question-and-answer documents, as well as in regional guidance. The nonclinical assessment usually includes toxicology, carcinogenicity, immunogenicity, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and other evaluations to support clinical studies (and may encompass evidence generated in in vivo and in vitro models, and by modelling and simulation). The scope of nonclinical studies, and their timing with respect to clinical studies, depend on a variety of factors that inform further development, such as the drug's chemical or molecular properties; pharmacological basis of principal effects (mechanism of action); route(s) of administration; absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; physiological effects on organ systems; dose/concentration-response relationships; metabolites; and duration of action and use. Use of the drug in special populations (e.g., pregnant or breast-feeding people, children) may require additional nonclinical assessments. Guidance for nonclinical safety studies to support human clinical studies in special populations should be reviewed (see, e.g., the ICH guidances for industry S5(R3) Detection of Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity for Human Pharmaceuticals (May 2021), S11 Nonclinical Safety Testing in Support of Development of Pediatric Pharmaceuticals (May 2021), and M3(R2).\n\nAssessment of the preclinical characteristics, including physiological and toxicological effects of the drug, serves to inform clinical study design and planned use in humans. Before proceeding to studies in humans, there should be sufficient nonclinical information to support initial human doses and duration of exposure.\n\nClinical Studies (4.3)\n\nClinical drug development, defined as studying the drug in humans, is conducted in a sequence that builds on knowledge accumulated from nonclinical and previous clinical studies. The structure of the drug development program is shaped by many considerations and comprised of studies with different objectives, designs, and dependencies. The Annex provides an illustrative list of example studies and their objectives. Although clinical drug development is often described as consisting of four temporal phases (phases 1 through 4), it is important to appreciate that the phase concept is a description and not a requirement, and that the phases of drug development may overlap or be combined.\n\nTo develop new drugs efficiently, it is essential to identify their characteristics in the early stages of development and to plan an appropriate development program based on this profile. Initial clinical studies may be more limited in size and duration to provide an early evaluation of short-term safety and tolerability, as well as proof of concept of efficacy. These studies may provide pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and other information needed to choose a suitable dosage range and/or administration schedule to inform further clinical studies. As more information is known about the drug, clinical studies may expand in size and duration, may include more diverse study populations, and may include more secondary endpoints in addition to the primary measures of efficacy. Throughout development, new data may suggest the need for additional studies.\n\nThe use of biomarkers has the potential to facilitate the availability of safer and more effective drugs, to guide dose selection, and to enhance a drug's benefit-risk profile (see the ICH guidance for industry E16 Biomarkers Related to Drug or Biotechnology Product Development: Context, Structure, and Format of Qualification Submissions (August 2011)) and can be considered throughout drug development. Clinical studies may evaluate the use of biomarkers to better target patients more likely to benefit and less likely to experience adverse reactions, or as intermediate endpoints that could predict clinical response.\n\nThe following subsections describe the types of studies that typically span clinical development from the first studies in humans through late development and post-approval.\n\n1.1.1 Human Pharmacology (4.3.1)\n\nThe protection of study participants should always be the first priority when designing early clinical studies, especially for the initial administration of an investigational product to humans (usually referred to as phase 1). These studies may be conducted in healthy volunteer participants or in a selected population of patients who have the condition or the disease, depending on drug properties and the objectives of the development program.\n\nThese studies typically address one or a combination of the following aspects:\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nEstimation of Initial Safety and Tolerability (4.3.1.1)\n\nThe initial and subsequent administration of a drug to humans is usually intended to determine the tolerability of the dose range expected to be evaluated in later clinical studies and to determine the nature of adverse reactions that can be expected. These studies typically include both single- and multiple-dose administration.\n\nPharmacokinetics (4.3.1.2)\n\nCharacterization of a drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion continues throughout the development program, but the preliminary characterization is an essential early goal. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies are particularly important to assess the clearance of the drug and to anticipate possible accumulation of parent drug or metabolites, interactions with metabolic enzymes and transporters, and potential drug-drug interactions. Some PK studies are commonly conducted in later phases to answer more specialized questions. For orally administered drugs, the study of food effects on bioavailability is important to inform the dosing instructions in relation to food. Obtaining PK information in subpopulations with potentially different metabolism or excretion, such as patients with renal or hepatic impairment, geriatric patients, children, and ethnic subgroups, should be considered (ICH guidances for industry E4 Dose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration (November 1994), E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations: Geriatrics (August 1994), E11 and E11(R1) Addendum, and E5, respectively).\n\nPharmacodynamics and Early Measurement of Drug Activity (4.3.1.3)\n\nDepending on the drug and the endpoint of interest, pharmacodynamic (PD) studies and studies relating drug levels to response (PK/PD studies) may be conducted in healthy volunteer participants or in patients with the condition or disease. If there is an appropriate measure, PD data can provide early estimates of activity and efficacy and may guide the dosage and dose regimen in later studies.\n\nExploratory and Confirmatory Safety and Efficacy Studies (4.3.2)\n\nAfter initial clinical studies provide sufficient information on safety, clinical pharmacology, and dose, exploratory and confirmatory studies (usually referred to as phases 2 and 3, respectively) are conducted to further evaluate both the safety and efficacy of the drug. Depending on the nature of the drug and the patient population, this objective may be combined in a single or small number of studies. Exploratory and confirmatory studies may use a variety of study designs depending on the objective of the study.\n--------------------\nContext title: E8(R1) General Considerations for Clinical Studies""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: To optimize and expedite drug development for serious or life-threatening diseases other than cancer (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, human immunodeficiency virus), the number and type of nonclinical studies for the drug metabolites can be modified on a case-by-case basis for those drugs with major beneficial therapeutic advances and for drugs for illnesses that lack an approved effective therapy. Sponsors should contact the appropriate review division to discuss such situations.\n\nGlossary\n\nDisproportionate drug metabolite -- A metabolite present only in humans or present at higher plasma concentrations in humans than in the animals used in nonclinical studies. In general, these metabolites are of interest if they account for plasma levels greater than 10 percent of total drug-related exposure, measured as area under the curve at steady state.\n\nMetabolite -- A compound derived from the parent drug through phase 1 and/or phase 2 metabolic pathways.\n\nPharmacologically active metabolite -- A metabolite that has pharmacological activity at the target receptor. The activity may be greater than, equal to, or less than that of the parent drug.\n\nAppendix A Decision Tree Flow Diagram\n\nAppendix B Case examples of drug metabolites\n\nCase 1.\n\nFrom an initial mass balance study, a metabolite represented 1 to 2 percent of total radioactive dose in rat plasma, 5 percent in dogs, and 20 percent in humans (radioactivity of this metabolite in urine and/or feces was minimal). Based on the up-to-20-fold greater exposure in humans than in animals, nonclinical safety testing was recommended.\n\nHowever, the data generated in the general toxicology studies with the parent drug in the rat and dog suggested that the maximum doses tested produced metabolite exposures that represented at least the therapeutic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose. Also, the plasma concentrations of this metabolite measured in the in vivo genetic toxicity study, embryo-fetal development toxicity study, and carcinogenicity studies conducted with the parent drug provided adequate exposure and characterization of the metabolite. Therefore, no additional testing with the metabolite was needed.\n\nCase 2.\n\nTwo primary hydroxylated metabolites, M1 and M2, were shown to undergo further oxidation to form secondary metabolites M3 and M4 using hepatic microsomes and hepatocytes from human, monkey, rat, dog, rabbit, and mouse. This metabolic profile was later confirmed by in vivo data. The results showed the following:\n\nM1 and M4 were the predominant metabolites in human, monkey, and dog microsomes, whereas rat, mouse, and rabbit formed M2 and M3\n\nM4 was formed in humans at 4-fold higher levels than the parent drug and 75 percent of the total drug-related exposure, but M4 was formed at very low levels in rodents and only represented 20 percent of the total drug-related exposure in monkey (see Table 1)\n\nSevere drug-related and novel target organ toxicities were observed with the parent drug in monkeys but not in rats\n\nM4 was pharmacological inactive at the drug target receptors\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \\hline  & Human (MRHD)* & Monkey & Rat \\ \\hline Total drug- & 10,220 & 24,240 & 15,135 \\ related exposure & & & \\ \\hline Parent Exposure & 1,800 & 15,000 & 12,500 \\ \\hline \\hline M4 Exposure & 7,700 & 5,000 & 135 \\ \\hline \\multicolumn{4}{l}{ AUC = area under the curve;} \\ \\multicolumn{4}{l}{MRHD = maximum recommended human dose} \\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: AUC({}_{0_24hr}) at the Maximum Dose\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe following additional studies were done with M4:\n\nSubchronic toxicity study: 3 months in rats\n\nEmbryo-fetal development study in the rats\n\nIn vitro genotoxicity testing: M4 was positive for point mutation and chromosomal aberration; the parent drug was negative\n\nBecause of the positive genotoxicity, a carcinogenicity study that included M4 was recommended\n\n4.2.3 Case 3.\n\nM2 is a phase 1 oxidative metabolite that formed up to 50 percent of total drug-related exposure in humans, 10 percent of total drug-related exposure in mice, 15 percent of total drug-related exposure in dogs, and only trace amounts in rats. In vitro metabolism studies in these species supported the in vivo findings. Based on structure activity relationship analyses, there was no reason to anticipate any difference or exaggeration in toxicity of the metabolite compared with the parent molecule. The parent drug showed no significant toxicity or identifiable target organ of toxicity in any of the animal species tested in safety assessment studies. Because disproportionate human exposure was identified, further safety testing was needed. When M2 was tested in a short-term tolerance study in the dog, it produced unexpected and significant cardiotoxicity at all doses and in all of the dogs. M2 was pharmacologically inactive at the therapeutic target receptor.\n--------------------\nContext title: Safety Testing of Drug Metabolites']","['The guidance does not specifically address prodrugs.

70,"Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?","['--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.3 Step 1 - Determine That There is Sufficient Justification to Enroll the Subject Without Using a Translated Long Form to Document the Subject\'s Informed Consent\n\nThe investigator, in consultation with the IRB chairperson (or another IRB member designated by the chairperson, hereafter referred to as designee) whenever feasible, determines that there is sufficient justification (e.g., due to a limited therapeutic window) for obtaining the subject\'s consent without waiting for a translated long form to be reviewed and approved by the IRB prior to enrollment of the subject. In making a decision to allow enrollment of a subject who does not understand English into a research protocol without waiting for a written translation of the long form, the investigator (and whenever feasible the IRB chairperson or designee) should consider whether the consent process, under this circumstance, will provide the subject with sufficient opportunity to understand the information being presented. If consent is sought and the investigator believes that the prospective subject has not understood the information presented, then the individual should not be enrolled in the research.\n\n2.4 Step 2 - Obtain and Document the Subject\'s Informed Consent in Accordance with FDA Regulations at 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 50.25 and 21 CFR 50.27 Using a Translated Short Form and the English Language Version of the Long Form as the Written Summary\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of 21 CFR 50.27(b)(2), informed consent is documented using a short form that has been translated into a language understandable to the prospective subject and approved by the IRB. As a prerequisite to using this procedure, the investigator must have available a short form written in a language understandable to the prospective subject or LAR and previously approved by the IRB (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.27(a)). To meet this prerequisite, the IRB mustrequire that the sponsor or investigator arrange for translation of a generic short form into a language understandable by the prospective subject or LAR, and the IRB must have approved the prospective use of such short forms for enrollment of subjects who do not understand English, as needed. Additionally, the IRB must approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The IRB-approved English long form often serves as this written summary. The translator should be fluent in both English and in the subject\'s language. It may be appropriate to have a translator available for all subsequent study visits to relay information between the subject and study personnel.\n\nThe procedure for obtaining and documenting the subject\'s informed consent with a translated short form and an English version of the long form includes the following:\n\nThe investigator (or their designee) obtaining informed consent, with the assistance of an interpreter if needed (e.g., if the investigator is not bilingual), provides orally to the subject the elements of informed consent required by FDA regulations at 21 CFR 50.25 and any additional pertinent information included in the IRB-approved English version of the long form. This presentation may be an oral translation of the IRB-approved English version of the long form. The oral presentation must be in language understandable to the subject (21 CFR 50.20). The investigator, with the assistance of an interpreter if needed, answers any questions from the prospective subject. There must be a witness to the oral presentation who must not be the person obtaining informed consent (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). Furthermore, FDA strongly recommends the witness be fluent in the language of the oral presentation. The witness must, at a minimum, have sufficient proficiency in the language of the oral presentation to be able to attest to the information that was to the presented orally to the prospective participant (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2).) In addition, if possible, the witness should not be related to the subject.\n\nAt the time informed consent is sought, the subject is given the IRB-approved translated short form and a copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form, which serves as the written summary.\n\nThe short form is signed and dated by the subject or LAR.\n\nThe witness signs both the short form and the copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form. (Note that when an interpreter assists the person obtaining consent, the interpreter may serve as the witness, but is not required to do so.)\n\nThe person actually obtaining consent signs the copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form.\n\nStep 3 - Take Additional Actions Following Subject Enrollment\n\nAfter the subject has been enrolled in the research, the investigator takes the following additional actions:1. If a subject was enrolled in the research using an untranslated long form to serve as the written summary, and if the investigator did not consult with the IRB chairperson (or designee) prior to enrollment of the subject who does not understand English, the investigator should promptly notify the IRB chairperson (or designee) that such a subject was enrolled.\n2. The investigator must obtain a translated copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form that served as the written summary, which should be done promptly. The investigator promptly submits it to the IRB for review and approval. Once the translated long form/written summary is approved by the IRB, the investigator must provide it to the subject or LAR and should do so as soon as possible. FDA considers this step essential to the requirement that informed consent be documented by the use of a written consent document and that the subject be provided a copy (21 CFR 50.27). Many of the clinical investigations regulated by FDA involve ongoing interventions and may involve long-term follow-up. For this reason, translation of the long form is critically important as a means of providing subjects or their LAR an ongoing source of information understandable to them.\n\nAdditionally, as noted above in Frequently Asked Question#3, FDA recommends that whenever subjects who do not understand English are involved in research, appropriate interpreter services be made available throughout the course of the research.\n\nix.1.6 What should be considered when enrolling subjects with low literacy and numeracy?\n\nAlthough a competent person who does not read and write well can give informed consent and enroll in a clinical investigation, the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB should consider whether any modifications to the informed consent process are necessary to ensure that the informed consent process is understandable.\n\nFor subjects with apparent low literacy and/or low numeracy, oral presentation of the information contained in the consent document is especially important. When the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject or the subject\'s LAR, the IRB may want to consider approving the use of a short form and written summary (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)), which includes a witness to the oral presentation of the informed consent elements who also signs the consent document (see _section_III.E.4.b, ""Short Form""). It should be noted that, even if the information is presented orally, the subject or the subject\'s LAR is required to sign the consent form (whether the long form or short form is used) unless the IRB has waived documentation of informed consent under 21 CFR 56.109(c).\n\nSubjects who cannot write can indicate their consent by ""making their mark"" on the consent document, in lieu of signing and dating the consent form when consistent with applicable law. In these situations, a note should be included in subject case histories required to be maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21CFR 812.140(a)(3) indicating the reason for the lack of a signature and date as required by 21 CFR 50.27(a). The date consent was obtained should be recorded in this note.\n\nvi.2.7 What should be considered when enrolling subjects with physical or sensory disabilities?\n\nA person with physical or sensory disabilities (for example, physically unable to talk or write or has hearing or visual loss) can enroll in a clinical investigation if competent and able to signal consent consistent with applicable law. Enrolling such subjects into a clinical investigation does not require a LAR to be involved with the informed consent process or to sign the consent document unless required by State or local law. The records relating to the clinical investigation must include documentation of the informed consent process (21 CFR 50.27) unless excepted under 21 CFR 56.109(c). FDA recommends including in subject case histories required under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3) a description of the specific means by which the prospective subject communicated agreement to take part in the clinical investigation and how questions were answered. FDA recommends that investigators provide reasonable modifications and auxiliary aids and services when necessary to meet the specific needs of the study population.80 For example, for subjects with vision disabilities, the investigator could use an audio recording of the contents of the consent form or a consent form with enlarged font, depending on the degree of impairment.\n\nFootnote 80: FDA strongly encourages stakeholders to ensure that informed consent documents are accessible to individuals with disabilities. To the extent an organization receives Federal financial assistance from HHS, the organization must comply with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This guidance provides information to assist IRBs, clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA’s informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. It does not provide guidance on how to comply with any regulatory obligations stemming from a source outside of the statutes FDA administers and FDA’s regulations.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: As noted in the previous answer, on April 24, 2001, FDA issued an interim final rule, Additional Protections for Children, as subpart D to 21 CFR Part 50. Informed consent of children who participate in clinical trials is addressed in subpart D. This interim final rule and its preamble are available at Additional Protections for Children (/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/additional-protections-children).\n\n49 Who should be listed on the consent as the contact to answer questions?\n\n21 CFR 50.25(a)(7) requires contacts for questions about the research, the research subject\'s rights and in case of a research-related injury. It does not specify whom to contact. The same person may be listed for all three. However, FDA and most IRBs believe it is better to name a knowledgeable person other than the clinical investigator as the contact for study subject rights. Having the clinical investigator as the only contact may inhibit subjects from reporting concerns and/or possible abuses.\n\nMay the ""compensation"" for participation in a trial offered by a sponsor include a coupon good for a discount on the purchase price of the product once it has been approved for marketing?No. This presumes, and inappropriately conveys to the subjects, a certainty of favorable outcome of the study and prompt approval for marketing. Also, if the product is approved, the coupon may financially coerce the subject to insist on that product, even though it may not be the most appropriate medically.\n\n51. Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n\nThe signed informed consent document is the written record of the consent interview. Study subjects are given a copy of the consent to be used as a reference document to reinforce their understanding of the study and, if desired, to consult with their physician or family members about the study.\n\nIn order to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, the consent document must be in language understandable to the subject. When the prospective subject is fluent in English, and the consent interview is conducted in English, the consent document should be in English. However, when the study subject population includes non-English speaking people so that the clinical investigator or the IRB anticipates that the consent interviews are likely to be conducted in a language other than English, the IRB should assure that a translated consent form is prepared and that the translation is accurate.\n\nA consultant may be utilized to assure that the translation is correct. A copy of the translated consent document must be given to each appropriate subject. While a translator may be used to facilitate conversation with the subject, routine ad hoc translation of the consent document may not be substituted for a written translation.\n\nAlso see FDA Information Sheets: ""A Guide to Informed Consent Documents"" and ""Informed Consent and the Clinical Investigator""\n\n52. Is it acceptable for the consent document to say specimens are ""donated""?\n\nWhat about a separate donation statement? It would be acceptable for the consent to say that specimens are to be used for research purposes. However, the word ""donation"" implies abandonment of rights to the ""property"". 21 CFR 50.20 prohibits requiring subjects to waive or appear to waive any rights as a condition for participation in the study. Whether or not the wording is contained in ""the actual consent form"" is immaterial. All study-related documents must be submitted to the IRB for review. Any separate ""donation"" agreement is regarded to be part of the informed consent documentation, and must be in compliance with 21 CFR 50.\n\n53. Do informed consent forms have to justify fees charged to study subjects?\n\nFDA does not require the consent to contain justification of charges.\n\nVII. Clinical Investigations\n\n54. Does a physician, in private practice, conducting research with an FDA regulated product, need to obtain IRB approval?Yes. The FDA regulations require IRB review and approval of regulated clinical investigations, whether or not the study involves institutionalized subjects. FDA has included non-institutionalized subjects because it is inappropriate to apply a double standard for the protection of research subjects based on whether or not they are institutionalized. An investigator should be able to obtain IRB review by submitting the research proposal to a community hospital, a university/medical school, an independent IRB, a local or state government health agency or other organizations.\n\n55. Does a clinical investigation involving a marketed product require IRB review and approval?\n\nYes, if the investigation is governed by FDA regulations [see 21 CFR 56.101, 56.102(c), 312.2(b)(1), 361.1, 601.2, and 812.2]. Also, see the information sheet entitled ""Off-label\' and Investigational Use of Marketed Drugs and Biologics"" for more information.\n\nVIII. General Questions\n\nWhich FDA office may an IRB contact to determine whether an investigational new drug application (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE) is required for a study of a test article?\n\nFor drugs, the IRB may contact the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Office of Communications, Division of Drug Information at (301) 796-3400.\n\nFor biological products, contact the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Office of Communication, Outreach and Development, at (800)-835-4709 or (301) 827-1800.\n\nFor medical devices, contact the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) Staff, Office of Device Evaluation, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), at (301) 796-5640.\n\n57. What happens during an FDA inspection of an IRB?\n\nFDA field investigators interview institutional officials and examine the IRB records to determine compliance with FDA regulations. Also, see the information sheet entitled ""FDA Institutional Review Board Inspections"" for a complete description of the inspection process.\n\n58. Does a treatment IND/IDE [21 CFR 312.34/812.36 ] require prior IRB approval?\n\nTest articles given to human subjects under a treatment IND/IDE require prior IRB approval, with two exceptions. If a life-threatening emergency exists, as defined by 21 CFR 56.102(d), the procedures described in 56.104(c) (""Exemptions from IRB Requirement"") may be followed. In addition, FDA may grant the sponsor or sponsor/investigator a waiver of the IRB requirement in accord with 21 CFR 56.105. An IRB may still choose to review a study even if FDA has granted a waiver. For further information see the information sheets entitled""Emergency Use of an Investigational Drug or Biologic,"" ""Emergency Use of Unapproved Medical Devices,"" ""Waiver of IRB Requirements"" and ""Treatment use of Investigational Drugs and Biologics.""\n\n59. How have the FDA policies on enrollment of special populations changed?\n\nOn July 22, 1993, the FDA published the Guideline for the Study and Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Drugs, in the Federal Register [58 FR 39406]. The guideline was developed to ensure that the drug development process provides adequate information about the effects of drugs and biological products in women. For further information, see the information sheet entitled ""Evaluation of Gender Differences in Clinical Investigations.""\n\nOn December 13, 1994, FDA published a final rule on the labeling of prescription drugs for pediatric populations [59 FR 64240]. The rule [21 CFR 201.57] encourages sponsors to include pediatric subjects in clinical trials so that more complete information about the use of drugs and biological products in the pediatric population can be developed.\n\n6o. What is a medical device?\n\nA medical device is any instrument, apparatus, or other similar or related article, including component, part, or accessory, which is: (a) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopeia, or any supplement to them; (b) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in humans or other animals; or (c) intended to affect the structure or any function of the human body or in animals; and does not achieve any of its principal intended purposes through chemical action within or on the human body or in animals and is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its principal intended purposes.\n\nApproximately 1,700 types of medical devices are regulated by FDA. The range of devices is broad and diverse, including bandages, thermometers, ECG electrodes, IUDs, cardiac pacemakers, and hemodialysis machines. For further information, see the information sheets entitled ""Medical Devices,"" ""Frequently Asked Questions about IRB Review of Medical Devices"" and ""Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies.""\n\n61. Are in vitro diagnostic products medical devices?\n\nYes. The definition of a ""device"" includes in vitro diagnostic products - devices that aid in the diagnosis of disease or medical/physiological conditions (e.g., pregnancy) by using human or animal components to cause chemical reactions, fermentation, and the like. A few diagnostic products are intended for use in controlling other regulated products (such as those used to screen the blood supply for transfusion-transmitted diseases) and are regulated as biological products.\n\n62. What are the IRB\'s general obligations towards intraocular lens (IOL) clinical investigations?An IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of all IOL clinical investigations. Each individual IOL style is subject to a separate review by the IRB. This does not, however, preclude the IRB from using prior experience with other IOL investigations in considering the comparative merits of a new lens style. All IOL studies are also subject to FDA approval.\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: How do you obtain informed consent from someone who speaks and understands English but cannot read? Illiterate persons who understand English may have the consent read to them and ""make their mark,"" if appropriate under applicable state law. The 21 CFR 50.27(b)(2) requirements for signature of a witness to the consent process and signature of the person conducting consent interview must be followed, if a ""short form"" is used. Clinical investigators should be cautious when enrolling subjects who may not truly understand what they have agreed to do.\n\nThe IRB should consider illiterate persons as likely to be vulnerable to coercion and undue influence and should determine that appropriate additional safeguards are in place when enrollment of such persons is anticipated, see 21 CFR 56.111(b).\n\n41. Must a witness observe the entire consent interview or only the signature of the subject?\n\nFDA does not require the signature of a witness when the subject reads and is capable of understanding the consent document, as outlined in 21 CFR 50.27(b)(1). The intended purpose is to have the witness present during the entire consent interview and to attest to the accuracy of the presentation and the apparent understanding of the subject. If the intent of the regulation were only to attest to the validity of the subject\'s signature, witnessing would also be required when the subject reads the consent.\n\n42. Should the sponsor prepare a model informed consent document?\n\nAlthough not required by the IND regulations, the sponsor provides a service to the clinical investigator and the IRB when it prepares suggested study-specific wording for the scientific and technical content of the consent document. However, the IRB has the responsibility and authority to determine the adequacy and appropriateness of all of the wording in the consent, see 21 CFR 56.109(a), 111(a)(4) and 111(a)(5). If an IRB insists on wording the sponsor cannot accept, the sponsor may decide not to conduct the study at that site. For medical device studies that are conducted under an IDE, copies of all forms and informational materials to be provided to subjects to obtain informed consent must be submitted to FDA as part of the IDE, see 21 CFR 812.25(g).\n\n43. Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n\nFor investigational devices, the informed consent is a required part of the IDE submission. It is, therefore, approved by FDA as part of the IDE application. When an IRB makes substantive changes in the document, FDA reapproval is required and the sponsor is necessarily involved in this process.\n\nFDA regulations for other products do not specifically require the sponsor to review IRB approved consent documents. However, most sponsors do conduct such reviews to assure the wording is acceptable to the sponsor.\n\n44. Are there alternatives to obtaining informed consent from a subject?\n\nThe regulations generally require that the investigator obtain informed consent from subjects. Investigators also may obtain informed consent from a legally authorized representative of the subject. FDA recognizes that a durable power of attorney might suffice as identifying a legally authorized representative under some state and local laws. For example, a subject might have designated an individual to provide consent with regard to health care decisions through a durable power of attorney and have specified that the individual also has the power to make decisions on entry into research. FDA defers to state and local laws regarding who is a legally authorized representative. Therefore, the IRB should assure that the consent procedures comply with state and local laws, including assurance that the law applies to obtaining informed consent for subjects participating in research as well as for patients who require health care decisions.""\n\nAlternatives 1 and 2 are provided for in the regulations and are appropriate. Alternative 3 allows a designated individual to provide consent for a patient with regard to health care decisions and is appropriate when it specifically includes entry into research. FDA defers to state and local laws regarding substituted consent. Therefore, the IRB must assure itself that the substituted consent procedures comply with state and local law, including assurance the law applies to obtaining informed consent for subjects participating in research as well as for patients who require health care decisions.\n\n45 When should study subjects be informed of changes in the study?\n\nProtocol amendments must receive IRB review and approval before they are implemented, unless an immediate change is necessary to eliminate an apparent hazard to the subjects (21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)). Those subjects who are presently enrolled and actively participating in the study should be informed of the change if it might relate to the subjects\' willingness to continue their participation in the study (21 CFR 50.25(b)(5)). FDA does not require reconsenting of subjects that have completed their active participation in the study, or of subjects who are still actively participating when the change will not affect their participation, for example when the change will be implemented only for subsequently enrolled subjects.\n\n61 Informed Consent Document Content\n\nMay an IRB require that the sponsor of the study and/or the clinical investigator be identified on the study\'s consent document?\n\nYes. The FDA requirements for informed consent are the minimum basic elements of informed consent that must be presented to a research subject [21 CFR 50.25]. An IRB may require inclusion of any additional information which it considers important to a subject\'s decision to participate in a research study [21 CFR 56.109(b)].\n\n63 Does FDA require the informed consent document to contain a space for assent by children?\n\nNo, however, many investigators and IRBs consider it standard practice to obtain the agreement of older children who can understand the circumstances before enrolling them in research. While the FDA regulations do not specifically address enrollment of children (other than to include them as a class of vulnerable subjects), the basic requirement of 21 CFR 50.20 applies, i.e., the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject\'s legally authorized representative must be obtained before enrollment. Parents, legal guardians and/or others may have the ability to give permission to enroll children in research, depending on applicable state and local law of the jurisdiction in which the research is conducted. (Note: permission to enroll in research is not the same as permission to provide medical treatment.) IRBs generally require investigators to obtain the permission of one or both of the parents or guardian (as appropriate) and the assent of children who possess the intellectual and emotional ability to comprehend the concepts involved. Some IRBs require two documents, a fully detailed explanation for parents and older children to read and sign, and a shorter, simpler one for younger children. [For research supported by DHHS, the additional protections at 45 CFR 46 Subpart D are also required. The Subpart D regulations provide appropriate guidance for all other pediatric studies.] On April 24, 2001, FDA issued an interim final rule, Additional Protections for Children, as subpart D to 21 CFR Part 50. Assent by children is addressed in subpart D. This interim final rule and its preamble are available at Additional Protections for Children (/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/additional-protections-children).\n\n48 Does FDA require the signature of children on informed consent documents?\n\nAs indicated above, researchers may seek assent of children of various ages. Older children may be well acquainted with signing documents through prior experience with testing, licensing and/or other procedures normally encountered in their lives. Signing a form to give their assent for research would not be perceived as unusual and would be reasonable. Younger children, however, may never have had the experience of signing a document. For these children requiring a signature may not be appropriate, and some other technique to verify assent could be used. For example, a third party may verify, by signature, that the assent of the child was obtained.\n\nAs noted in the previous answer, on April 24, 2001, FDA issued an interim final rule, Additional Protections for Children, as subpart D to 21 CFR Part 50. Informed consent of children who participate in clinical trials is addressed in subpart D. This interim final rule and its preamble are available at Additional Protections for Children (/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/additional-protections-children).\n\n49 Who should be listed on the consent as the contact to answer questions?\n\n21 CFR 50.25(a)(7) requires contacts for questions about the research, the research subject\'s rights and in case of a research-related injury. It does not specify whom to contact. The same person may be listed for all three. However, FDA and most IRBs believe it is better to name a knowledgeable person other than the clinical investigator as the contact for study subject rights. Having the clinical investigator as the only contact may inhibit subjects from reporting concerns and/or possible abuses.\n\nMay the ""compensation"" for participation in a trial offered by a sponsor include a coupon good for a discount on the purchase price of the product once it has been approved for marketing?No. This presumes, and inappropriately conveys to the subjects, a certainty of favorable outcome of the study and prompt approval for marketing. Also, if the product is approved, the coupon may financially coerce the subject to insist on that product, even though it may not be the most appropriate medically.\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 64: See section IV.A.4 for guidance regarding identification of the most up-to-date version of the informed consent form.\n\niv.2.4 Identification of Revised Consent Forms\n\nThe IRB should ensure that there is a way to identify a revised consent form so that continued use of a previously approved version does not occur. While not required by FDA regulations, the use of date stamps is one possible mechanism for ensuring use of the most recently approved version of the consent form.\n\nThe Clinical Investigator\n\nThe clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects during a clinical investigation, and for ensuring that, unless an exception applies, legally effective informed consent is obtained from each subject or the subject\'s LAR before that subject takes part in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.20(a), 312.60, and 812.100). Legally effective informed consent includes meeting all applicable Federal, State, and local laws that require additional information in the informed consent form beyond what FDA regulations require. Sponsors and investigators may wish to seek legal guidance regarding specific local consent requirements applicable to their research.\n\nThe clinical investigator should notify the IRB regarding the consent process, including who (e.g., the investigator or another study team member) will conduct the consent discussion. Any information that will be given to subjects to review and discuss as part of informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)). An investigator may not begin the informed consent process with prospective subjects until the IRB reviews and approves the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process (21 CFR 50.20, 50.27, and 56.109).\n\nThe clinical investigator\'s institution may have standard language or a standard format for consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation). FDA recognizes that investigators may also need to identify and meet institutional requirements and incorporate them into the consent form for the IRB\'s initial review of the clinical investigation.\n\nDuring the clinical investigation, the investigator may need to revise the consent form to address new information that might arise during the conduct of the trial, such as a change to the protocol or new safety information. The investigator will need to obtain IRB review and approval of the revised consent form (21 CFR 50.27 and 56.109). In addition, because the consent form is being modified to reflect new information that might affect the willingness of already enrolled and actively participating subjects to continue in the clinical investigation, the IRB should determine the need to inform the previously enrolled subjects of the new information and determine their willingness to continue in the research (see\n\nFrequently Asked Questions #16).\n\nAny new information that is part of the consent process must be reviewed and approved by the IRB as a change in approved research before it is initiated, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject (see 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)). In the rare event that urgent safety information is provided to the subject prior to IRB approval, the IRB should promptly be notified of both the safety issue and the notification of subjects.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the clinical investigator:\n\niv.2.1 Delegation of Consent Discussion\n\nFDA regulations require that the investigator obtain the legally effective informed consent of subjects (21 CFR 50.20, 312.60 and 812.100). If the investigator delegates this responsibility, FDA expects that the individual to whom the responsibility is delegated be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform this activity. The individual obtaining informed consent should be knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and have the appropriate training and credentials to be able to address any questions or concerns the subject may have about the study and/or alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject. The investigator should have a detailed plan for the supervision and training of staff, and oversight of the clinical investigation, including the informed consent process.65 Even when a task is delegated to another individual, the investigator remains responsible for ensuring that legally effective informed consent is obtained for all subjects in accordance with 21 CFR part 50.\n\niv.2.2 Financial Relationships and Interests\n\nThe clinical investigator should consider whether information related to financial relationships or interests should be provided to subjects.66 Clinical investigators should consider the potential effects that a financial relationship might have on the clinical investigation or on interactions with subjects. When there are financial relationships or interests, clinical investigators should consider the following actions:\n\nFootnote 66: See the HHS guidance document, “Financial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidance for Human Subject Protection,” available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/financial-conflict-of-interest/index.html#.\n\nIncluding information in the informed consent form, such as:\n\nThe source of funding and funding arrangements for the conduct and review of the clinical investigation, or\n\nInformation about a financial arrangement or interest (e.g., stock in the study sponsor, patent on the investigational product) of an institution or an investigator and how it is being managed.\n\nUsing special measures to modify the informed consent process when a potential or actual financial conflict exists, such as:\n\nHaving another individual who does not have a potential or actual conflict of interest involved in the consent process, especially when a potential or actual conflict of interest could influence the tone, presentation, or type of information presented during the consent process.\n\nUsing independent monitoring of the consent process.\n\nAlthough the clinical investigator should consider these issues regarding financial relationships and interests, IRBs have the final responsibility of determining whether subjects should be provided with information regarding the source of funding, funding arrangements, or financial interests of parties involved in the clinical investigation as part of the informed consent process (see 21 CFR 56.109 and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).\n\nThe Sponsor\n\nSponsors often provide clinical investigators with a model consent form that may be adapted by the clinical investigator to meet local needs. When the consent form for studies that require an IND or IDE application is submitted to FDA for review, FDA\'s comments are generally directed to the sponsor (see sectionIV.4.1, ""Investigational New Drugs and Biologics,"" and sectionIV.4.2, ""Investigational Medical Devices""). The sponsor should promptly provide the clinical investigator with any necessary modifications required to satisfy the regulations at 21 CFR 50.25 so that changes can be made to the consent forms. A modified model consent form reflecting the changes may be used to convey the necessary edits. Because the clinical investigator must receive IRB approval before starting the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 312.66 and 21 CFR 812.110(a)), the sponsor should work closely with the clinical investigator to make certain the modified consent form is reviewed and approved by the IRB. The clinical investigator should provide the sponsor with a copy of the consent form approved by the IRB.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the sponsor:\n\niv.3.1 Considerations for Multicenter Clinical Investigations\n\nFor multicenter clinical investigations, changes may need to be made to the consent form to address local and institutional requirements. For multicenter clinical investigations reviewed by more than one IRB, when local IRB review results in substantive modifications to the consent form, i.e., changes that affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects, FDA expects the sponsor to share the revisions with all investigators and their IRBs. In this situation it may be more efficient to share the changes with the sites using a modified model consent form, when appropriate. If the multicenter clinical investigation has a central IRB cooperating with local IRBs or human research protection offices, the revisions should be forwarded to the central IRB.67 Alternatively, local issues may be addressed by the central IRB depending on the review agreement between the local IRB(s) and central IRB. Note that for medicaldevice studies that require submission of an IDE application, such changes must be submitted to FDA.68\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 812.35(a).\n\nFootnote 69: The 2018 Common Rule requires that any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States, unless the research is not subject to the provision (45 CFR 46.114(b)). The compliance date for research subject to this provision was January 20, 2020. On September 28, 2022, FDA issued a proposed rule to harmonize with this requirement to the extent practicable and consistent with statutory provisions (see https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/28/2022-21089/institutional-review-boards-cooperative-research). The January 19, 2017, final rule revising the Common Rule is available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/finalized-revisions-common-rule/index.html.\n\n.4.2 Sponsor Personnel\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 58: See 21 CFR 56.109(b).\n\nInvestigators must use an IRB-approved written consent form when documenting informed consent, in accordance with 21 CFR 50.27, except as provided in 21 CFR 56.109(c). Thus, the IRB should review the adequacy and appropriateness of all wording in the consent materials, as well as the overall length and presentation of information. Consent forms that are long, complex, legalistic, and have a high reading level may overwhelm prospective subjects and may inhibit reading of the full document and understanding of the relevant information.\n\nThe IRB should ensure that technical and scientific concepts and terms are explained, or common terms substituted, so that the anticipated subject population can understand all provided information (see 21 CFR 50.20).59 Pictures, diagrams, or other visual aids may be used to improve understanding of medical terms or how an investigational product functions. IRBs may wish to evaluate, through subject discussions, how well the consent materials communicate critical information. Additional guidance on the requirements at 21 CFR 50.20 can be found in section 1.1.2, ""General Requirements for Informed Consent"" above.\n\nFootnote 59: Various strategies exist to improve communication with patients, for example, see Doak CC, Doak LG, Friedell GH, Meade CD. Improving comprehension for cancer patients with low literacy skills: strategies for clinicians. CA Cancer J Clin. 1998 May-Jun;48(3):151-62. doi: 10.3322/canjclin.48.3.151. PMID: 9594918.\n\n1.1.2 Use of Standardized Language\n\nInstitutions may develop standard language or a standard format to use in portions of all consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation) to meet certain FDA regulatory requirements, as well as institutional and other Federal, State, or local requirements.\n\n5.3.2 Review of the Consent Process\n\nThe investigator should notify the IRB of the consent process to be used. The process may be described in the protocol, or the investigator may provide a brief document describing the process to be used. The materials and procedures used for subject recruitment, which typically include advertisements, must be reviewed and approved by the IRB to ensure that these materials are appropriate, as described in section4.1, ""Review of All Informed Consent Materials"" (see 21 CFR 56.109(b) and 56.111(a)(4)).60 The IRB must determine that investigators will seek consent from prospective subjects under circumstances that minimize the possibility of coercion and undue influence (21 CFR 50.20 and 56.111(a)(4)). FDA considers this to include ensuring that the consent process described by the investigator allows sufficient time for prospective subjects to consider the information, provides time and opportunity for the subjects to ask questions and have those questions answered, and allows time and opportunity for the subjects to consider fully whether to participate.\n\nFootnote 60: For further information, see the FDA Information Sheet “Recruiting Study Subjects,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects.\n\nTo approve a clinical investigation, the IRB must find that informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject\'s LAR and that informed consent will be appropriately documented, in accordance with and to the extent required by 21 CFR part 50 (21 CFR 56.111(a)(4) and (5)). FDA recommends that the IRB inquire as to who will conduct the consent discussion and what procedures will be followed. If procedures other than a face-to-face consent discussion are proposed, such as by telephone, the IRB should consider whether the procedures will provide effective communication and accomplish the goals of the informed consent process. Alternative procedures may be of special concern when the clinical investigation involves complex procedures or when risks may be difficult to comprehend.\n\nFDA regulations authorize the IRB to observe or have a third party observe the consent process, as well as the research (21 CFR 56.109(f)). IRBs should consider using this authority when it may be appropriate61 or enhance the protection provided to subjects (for example, when the investigator is alsothe treating physician for a prospective subject, when the person conducting the consent interview is relatively inexperienced, or when the clinical investigation involves vulnerable subjects). In addition to observing a sample of consent discussions, the IRB could interview subjects to assess the consent process and evaluate the subjects\' understanding of the clinical investigation.\n\n3.3.3 IRB Review of Updated Informed Consent Documents\n\nAll information given to subjects as part of the consent process is to be reviewed and approved by the IRB (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).62 During the clinical investigation, new information about the research or changes to the clinical investigation may arise that affect the rights or welfare of subjects. FDA recommends that IRBs have procedures in place for the timely, efficient, and effective review of such new information or changes. This would include procedures for the clinical investigator and/or sponsor to notify the IRB of any significant new findings that arise during the clinical investigation relevant to a subject\'s decision to continue participation (see section3.3.5, ""Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects"", and (\\mathtt{Frequently\\ Asked\\ Question}#16)). When new information or changes in the clinical investigation warrant revisions of the consent form (and any accompanying changes to the protocol), such revisions must be reviewed and approved by the IRB before the revisions are initiated, except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to subjects (21 CFR 56.108(a)(3)-(4)).\n\nFootnote 62: This would include all addenda to the consent form and other materials used in the consent process.\n\nSome changes may be reviewed and approved by expedited means, as provided for by 21 CFR 56.110. For example, an IRB may decide expedited review is appropriate for changes to the consent form that reflect minor changes in the protocol or recruitment plan (e.g., new advertising for subjects following initiation of the clinical investigation when the advertisement incorporates wording from the approved consent form). When expedited review is used, if the IRB reviewer is unsure whether the change qualifies for expedited review under 21 CFR 56.110(b), FDA recommends that the reviewer (if other than the IRB chair) consult with the IRB chair. If doubts persist as to whether the change qualifies for expedited review, then the change should be reviewed at a convened meeting of the IRB.63\n\nFootnote 63: As indicated at section4.2, when new information is added to the consent form that might affect the willingness of already enrolled and actively participating subjects to continue in the clinical investigation, the IRB should determine the need to inform the previously enrolled subjects of the new information and determine their willingness to continue in the research.\n\nAdministrative changes, such as the correction of typographical and spelling errors, and changes in telephone numbers, may be submitted to the IRB at any time, including during continuing review, and do not require formal review and approval. Although such changes do not need IRB review, updatedversions of the consent form should be sent to the IRB so that they have current copies of the informed consent form on file.64\n\nFootnote 64: See section IV.A.4 for guidance regarding identification of the most up-to-date version of the informed consent form.\n\niv.2.4 Identification of Revised Consent Forms\n\nThe IRB should ensure that there is a way to identify a revised consent form so that continued use of a previously approved version does not occur. While not required by FDA regulations, the use of date stamps is one possible mechanism for ensuring use of the most recently approved version of the consent form.\n\nThe Clinical Investigator\n\nThe clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects during a clinical investigation, and for ensuring that, unless an exception applies, legally effective informed consent is obtained from each subject or the subject\'s LAR before that subject takes part in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.20(a), 312.60, and 812.100). Legally effective informed consent includes meeting all applicable Federal, State, and local laws that require additional information in the informed consent form beyond what FDA regulations require. Sponsors and investigators may wish to seek legal guidance regarding specific local consent requirements applicable to their research.\n\nThe clinical investigator should notify the IRB regarding the consent process, including who (e.g., the investigator or another study team member) will conduct the consent discussion. Any information that will be given to subjects to review and discuss as part of informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)). An investigator may not begin the informed consent process with prospective subjects until the IRB reviews and approves the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process (21 CFR 50.20, 50.27, and 56.109).\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: The IRB may determine that the permission of one parent is sufficient for clinical investigations involving no greater than minimal risk to children to be conducted under 21 CFR 50.51, or clinical investigations involving greater than minimal risk to children but presenting the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects in accordance with 21 CFR 50.52 (21 CFR 50.55(e)(1)).\n\nFor clinical investigations to be conducted in accordance with either 21 CFR 50.53 or 21 CFR 50.54,75 where permission is to be obtained from parents, the permission of both parents is required unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child (21 CFR 50.55(e)(2)).76\n\nFootnote 76: For additional discussion on what is meant by “not reasonably available,” see the Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections (SACHRP) recommendations at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/sachrp-committee/recommendations/attachment-d-november-13-2018/indes.html.\n\nThe general requirements for informed consent, found in 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 50.25 and 21 CFR 50.27, apply to parental permission (21 CFR 50.55(e)-(f)). When obtaining parental permission, in the event the parents of a child do not understand English, the parental permission must be obtained and documented in language that is understandable to the parents (21 CFR 50.20). The child who will be participating in the research should not be used as an interpreter for the parent, even if the child is fluent in English and may be able to assent. Similarly, if child assent is required, the information given to the child should be in language that is understandable to the child.\n\n""Assent"" means a child\'s affirmative agreement to take part in a clinical investigation, not just the failure to object (21 CFR 50.3(n)). Child assent, when appropriate, and parental (or guardian) permission taken together meet the ethical requirement to obtain informed consent. Absent a waiver of the assent requirement (21 CFR 50.55(d)), the IRB must determine that there are adequate provisions for soliciting the assent of children when, in the IRB\'s judgment, the children are capable of providing assent (21 CFR 50.55(a)). In deciding whether children are capable of providing assent, the IRB must consider the ages, maturity, and psychological state of the children to be involved in the clinical investigation (21 CFR 50.55(b)).77 A child does not need to fully understand the clinical investigation in order to provide assent, provided the child is capable of understanding the interventions and the related procedures. For example, a child may be able to understand and provide assent if the child understands and agrees to the interventions and/or procedures in the trial (e.g., drawing a blood sample for a test), even though the child may not be capable of understanding a randomized clinical trial.\n\nFootnote 77: FDA recognizes that IRBs may adopt procedures setting an age below which children are presumed incapable of providing assent.\n\nAn IRB may determine that assent is not necessary or may waive the assent requirement in certain situations (21 CFR 50.55(c) and (d)). For example, the assent of children is not a necessary condition for proceeding with a clinical investigation if the IRB determines that the intervention or procedure involved in the clinical investigation holds out a prospect of direct benefit that is important to the health or well-being of the children and is available only in the context of the clinical investigation (21 CFR 50.55(c)(2)). Also, the IRB may waive the assent requirement for children capable of assenting if the IRB finds and documents that the clinical investigation involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects; the waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; the clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver; and, when appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation (21 CFR 50.55(d)). Parental permission requirements (to the extent consent is required under 21 CFR part 50) remain in these circumstances.\n\nWhen the IRB determines that assent is required, it must also determine whether and how assent must be documented (21 CFR 50.55(g)). Some of the same considerations noted above for determining capability of children to provide assent should be considered when determining whether assent should be in writing or oral.\n\nWhen a written assent process is appropriate or required by the IRB, FDA does not require the use of a written assent form (21 CFR 50.55(g)), but FDA strongly encourages the use of a separate assent form that is ""child-oriented"" and developmentally appropriate. A separate assent form does not need to include all of the elements of a consent document but should focus on those aspects of the clinical investigation that may impact on a child\'s willingness to participate.\n\nParental permission and child assent should be viewed as an ongoing process throughout the duration of a clinical investigation. If and when a child who was enrolled in a clinical investigation with parental permission reaches the legal age of consent, that subject no longer meets the definition of a child under 21 CFR 50.3(o), and the investigator should obtain the subject\'s informed consent under 21 CFR part 50, subpart B, prior to performing any further research interventions and/or procedures involving that subject.\n\nIn addition, SS 50.3(o) defines children as ""persons who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures involved in clinical investigations, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the clinical investigation will be conducted"". However, in some situations, a State may grant certain minors of a specific age the right to consent to treatments or procedures on their own behalf. These mature minors do not meet the definition of children for purposes of a clinical investigation that involves solely those ""treatments or procedures"" for which they can give consent outside the research context and thus, the requirements of 21 CFR part 50, subpart D, do not apply to the research with respect to these minors. Similarly, minors deemed ""emancipated"" by State law, such that they may provide consent to treatments and procedures in the clinical setting, also do not meet the definition of children under SS 50.3(o), and the requirements of 21 CFR part 50, subpart D do not apply to the research with respect to these emancipated minors. In these cases, the mature or emancipated minors can consent to participation in FDA-regulated research without the need for parental or guardian permission. For example, if a clinical trial is being conducted in a jurisdiction that has laws that explicitly allow a minor of a particular age, to consent to receive specific sexual transmitted disease (STD) services in the clinical setting, these minors may be able to provide informed consent for participation in a clinical trial of a product intended to treat or diagnose an STD.\n\n2.2 Are there any additional protections required when enrolling children who are wards of the state?\n\nChildren who are wards of the state or any other agency, institution, or entity can be included in a clinical investigation that is approved under 21 CFR 50.53 and 50.54 provided the clinical investigation is either: (1) related to their status as wards; or (2) conducted in schools, camps, hospitals, institutions, or similar settings in which the majority of children involved as subjects are not wards (21 CFR 50.56). In other words, one of these criteria must be satisfied in order for children who are wards to be enrolled in clinical investigations involving greater than minimal risk and no prospect of direct benefit, but likely to yield generalizable knowledge about the subjects\' disorder or condition (21 CFR 50.53) or clinical investigations not otherwise approvable that present an opportunity to understand, prevent, or alleviate a serious problem affecting the health or welfare of children (21 CFR 50.54).\n\nIf a clinical investigation is approved under 21 CFR 50.56(a), the IRB must require that an advocate be appointed for each child who is a ward (21 CFR 50.56(b)). The IRB must ensure that such an advocate is in place, but the IRB itself is not required to appoint the advocate. The advocate, who may serve as an advocate for more than one child, serves in addition to any other individual acting on behalf of the child as guardian or in loco parents78 (21 CFR 50.56(b)(1) and (2)). The advocate must be an individual who has the background and experience to act in, and agrees to act in, the best interest of the child for the duration of the child\'s participation in the clinical investigation (21 CFR 50.56(b)(3)). The appropriate expertise for an advocate should include, but is not limited to, education and/or experience in pediatric medicine, law, child advocacy, foster parenting, behavioral sciences, or child psychology. The advocate should be adequately informed about the potential risks and benefits of the proposed clinical investigation, and about how the intervention is likely to affect the individual child. The advocate must not be associated in any way (except in the role as advocate or member of the IRB) with the clinical investigation, the investigator(s), or the guardian organization (21 CFR 50.56(b)(4)).\n\nFootnote 78: FDA considers an individual acting in loco parents to be an individual having the legal authority and responsibility to act in place of a parent.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors']","['The signed informed consent document is the written record of the consent interview.

Please discuss the most appropriate metric to assess a drug's effect on QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study (i.e., when there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient). (4.1)\n--------------------\nContext: While the degree of QT prolongation is recognized as an imperfect biomarker for proarrhythmic risk, in general there is a qualitative relationship between QT prolongation and the risk of TdP, especially for drugs that cause substantial prolongation of the QT interval. Because of its inverse relationship to heart rate, the measured QT interval is routinely corrected by means of various formulae to a less heart rate dependent value known as the QTc interval. It is not clear, however, whether arrhythmia development is more closely related to an increase in the absolute QT interval or QTc. Most drugs that have caused TdP clearly increase both the absolute QT and the QTc (hereafter called QT/QTc). Documented cases of TdP (fatal and non-fatal) associated with the use of a drug have resulted in the withdrawal from the market of several drugs and relegation of other drugs to second-line status. Because prolongation of the QT/QTc interval is the ECG finding associated with the increased susceptibility to these arrhythmias, an adequate pre-marketing investigation of the safety of a new pharmaceutical agent should include rigorous characterization of its effects on the QT/QTc interval.\n\nObjectives\n\nThis document provides recommendations to sponsors concerning the design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation of clinical studies to assess the potential of a drug to delay cardiac repolarization. This assessment should include testing the effects of new agents on the QT/QTc interval as well as the collection of cardiovascular adverse events. The investigational approach used for a particular drug should be individualized, depending on the pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and safety characteristics of the product, as well as on its proposed clinical use.\n\nThe assessment of the effects of drugs on cardiac repolarization is the subject of active investigation. When additional data (non-clinical and clinical) are accumulated in the future, this document may be reevaluated and revised.\n\nScope\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline""

While increases in QT/QTc to >500 ms or of >60 ms over baseline are commonly used as thresholds forpotential discontinuation, the exact criteria chosen for a given trial will depend on the risk-tolerance level considered appropriate for the indication and patient group in question.\n\nThe Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nThe 'thorough QT/QTc study' is intended to determine whether the drug has a threshold pharmacologic effect on cardiac repolarization, as detected by QT/QTc prolongation. The threshold level of regulatory concern, discussed further below, is around 5 ms as evidenced by an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval around the mean effect on QTc of 10 ms. The study is typically carried out in healthy volunteers (as opposed to individuals at increased risk of arrhythmias) and is used to determine whether or not the effect of a drug on the QT/QTc interval in target patient populations should be studied intensively during later stages of drug development. It is not intended to identify drugs as being pro-arrhythmic. Although data are limited, it is not expected that the results of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' would be affected by ethnic factors.\n\nThe 'thorough QT/QTc study' would typically be conducted early in clinical development to provide maximum guidance for later trials, although the precise timing will depend on the specifics of the drug under development. It would usually not be the first study, as it is important to have basic clinical data for its design and conduct, including tolerability and pharmacokinetics. Some drugs might not be suitable for study in healthy volunteers because of issues related to tolerability (e.g., neuroleptic agents, chemotherapeutics).\n\nThe results of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' will influence the amount of information collected in later stages of development:\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline""

Please discuss the most appropriate metric to assess a drug\'s effect on QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study (i.e., when there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient). (4.1)\n--------------------\nContext: Regardless of the degree to which a drug prolongs the QT/QTc interval, decisions about its development and approval will depend upon the morbidity and mortality associated with the untreated disease or disorder and the demonstrated clinical benefits of the drug, especially as they compare with available therapeutic modalities. Demonstrated benefits of the drug in resistant populations or in patients who are intolerant of, or have a labeled contraindication to, approved drugs for the same disease represent additional relevant clinical considerations that might justify approval of the drug, if the indication were limited to use in such patients.\n\nSome factors have been proposed that can modify the risk of QT/QTc prolongation. For instance, it has been suggested that some drugs might prolong the QT/QTc interval up to a ""plateau"" value, above which there is no dose-dependent increase, although this has not been demonstrated adequately to date. It has also been suggested that proarrhythmic risk might be influenced by other pharmacokinetic effects (e.g., other channel effects). In any case, it is important to identify the ""worst case scenario"" for drugs that have demonstrated effects on QT/QTc interval as a part of risk assessment (i.e., the QT/QTc interval measured in the target patient population at the time of peak effect and under conditions of the highest blood levels that can be attained during therapy).\n\nLabelling Issues for Drugs that Prolong the QT/QTc Interval\n\nIt is recognized that there will be regional differences in labelling. However, it is recommended that the following be considered:\n\nA warning/precautionary statement about the risk;\n\nA description of the design and results of the trials investigating the effect on the QT/QTc interval, including the absence of demonstrated effect;\n\nThe dosage recommendations;\n\nA list of conditions known to increase the proarrhythmic risk (e.g., congestive heart failure, Long QT Syndrome, hypokalemia);\n\nA precautionary statement regarding the concomitant use of two or more QT/QTc interval prolonging drugs and other interactions increasing the risk;\n\nRecommendations for patient monitoring (ECG and electrolytes) and management of patients with QT/QTc prolongation or symptoms suggestive of an arrhythmia.\n\nPost-Marketing Risk Management for Drugs that Prolong the QT/QTc Interval\n\nThe use of dosing adjustments following institution of therapy appears to materially decrease the risk of TdP in hospitalized patients receiving an antiarrhythmic drug; no similar data are available for drugs of other therapeutic classes. For approved drugs that prolong the QT/QTc interval, risk-management strategies aimed at minimizing the occurrence of arrhythmias associated with their use have focused on education of the health-care providers and patients.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline'

The focus is on agents being developed for uses other than the control of arrhythmias, as antiarrhythmic drugs can prolong the QT/QTc interval as a part of their mechanism of clinical efficacy. While this document is concerned primarily with the development of novel agents, the recommendations might also be applicable to approved drugs when a new dose or route of administration is being developed that results in significantly higher exposure (i.e., C({}_{\\max}) or AUC). Additional ECG data might also be considered appropriate if a new indication or patient population were being pursued. The evaluation of the effect of a drug on the QT interval would also be considered important if the drug or members of its chemical or pharmacological class have been associated with QT/QTc interval prolongation, TdP, or sudden cardiac death during post-marketing surveillance.\n\n2 Clinical Trials\n\nOverall Approaches to Evaluating Drug Effects on QT/QTc Interval\n\nDrugs are expected to receive a clinical electrocardiographic evaluation, beginning early in clinical development, typically including a single trial dedicated to evaluating their effect on cardiac repolarization ('thorough QT/QTc study'). Factors that could reduce the need for such a study include the inability to conduct the study in healthy volunteers or patients, how the drug is studied and used (e.g., administered under continuous monitoring), as well as nonclinical data.\n\n2.1.1 Subject Enrollment\n\nSubject enrollment for a given trial would be influenced by the clinical and nonclinical information available on the effects of the drug on cardiac repolarization.

This last analysis would be especially important if the drug has large between-subject variability in the rate of absorption or metabolism.\n\niv.1.2 Categorical Analyses (3.2.2)\n\nCategorical analyses of QT/QTc interval data are based on the number and percentage of patients meeting or exceeding some predefined upper limit value. Clinically noteworthy QT/QTc interval changes might be defined in terms of absolute QT/QTc intervals or changes from baseline. Separate analyses should be provided for patients with normal and elevated baseline QT/QTc intervals. As with all QT/QTc interval analyses, categorical analyses are most informative when it is possible to compare the rate of supra-threshold readings in the treatment and control groups.\n\nThere is no consensus concerning the choice of upper limit values for absolute QT/QTc interval and changes from baseline. While lower limits increase the false-positive rate, higher limits increase the risk of failing to detect a signal of concern. In clinical trials, a prolongation of QTc (>500) ms during therapy has been a threshold of particular concern. Multiple analyses using different limits are a reasonable approach to this uncertainty, including:\n\n(\\mathrm{QTc}) interval (>450)\n\n(\\mathrm{QTc}) interval (>480)\n\n(\\mathrm{QTc}) interval (>500)\n\n(\\mathrm{QTc}) interval increases from baseline (\\star 30)\n\n(\\mathrm{QTc}) interval increases from baseline (\\star 60)\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAnalysis of Relationship Between Drug Exposure and QT/QTc Interval Changes (3.2.3)\n\nEstablishing the relationship of drug concentrations to changes in QT/QTc interval may provide additional information to assist the planning and interpretation of studies assessing cardiac repolarization. This area is under active investigation.\n\nMorphological Analyses of ECG Waveforms (3.3)\n\nWhile the predictive value of changes in ECG morphology, such as the development of U waves, has not been established, morphological abnormalities should be described and the data presented in terms of the number and percentage of subjects in each treatment group having changes from baseline that represent the appearance or worsening of the morphological abnormality. Typically these data will be obtained as a part of the ""thorough QT/QTc study.""\n\nIV Adverse Events (4)\n\nIn addition to data on changes in ECG intervals, adverse event data can be another source of information on proarrhythmic potential, including:\n\nPremature discontinuations and dosage adjustments during clinical studies\n\nPostmarketing adverse event reports if available\n\nClinical Trial Adverse Events (4.1)\n\nAlthough drug-induced prolongation of the QT/QTc interval is usually asymptomatic, an increased rate of certain adverse events in patients taking an investigational agent can signal potential proarrhythmic effects. The rates of the following clinical events should be compared in the treated and control patients, particularly when there is evidence of an effect on the QT/QTc interval:\n\nTorsade de pointes\n\nSudden death\n\nVentricular tachycardia\n\nVentricular fibrillation and flutter\n\nSyncope\n\nSeizures\n\nTorsade de pointes is very infrequently captured in clinical databases, even those for drugs known to have significant proarrhythmic effects. Given this, the failure to observe an episode of TdP in a drug application database is not considered sufficient grounds for dismissing the possible arrhythmogenic risks of a drug when these are suspected on the basis of ECG and other clinical data. The other adverse events listed above, while less specific for an effect on cardiac repolarization, are more commonly captured in clinical trials, and an imbalance in their frequency between study groups can signal a potential proarrhythmic effect of the investigational agent. Sub-group analyses should be conducted in terms of age, gender, pre-existing cardiac disease, electrolyte disturbances, and concomitant medications. Comparing cause-specific ratesof death is difficult, but a difference in the fraction of total deaths qualifying as ""sudden"" has also been proposed as a marker for proarrhythmic potential.\n\nDetailed patient narratives should be provided for all serious cardiac adverse events, as would be the case for any serious event or events leading to discontinuation. In assessing the possible causal relationship of drug-induced QT/QTc interval prolongation to the event, attention should be directed to considerations such as temporal relationship and ECG results collected at the time of the event. As the QT/QTc interval is subject to considerable fluctuation, a possible role for QT/QTc interval prolongation should not be dismissed on the basis of normal on-therapy ECG measurements performed prior to, or near the time of the adverse event. In addition to an appropriate adverse reaction report, patients with marked QT/QTc prolongation or an episode of TdP might provide useful information on risk management. When identified, they should therefore be examined closely for other risk factors (e.g., genetic predisposition, see section IV.C (4.3)). Rechallenge with the investigational drug under appropriately monitored conditions can provide useful information on dose- and concentration-response relationships.\n\nIn evaluating the safety database of a new drug, consideration should be given to the extent to which the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient eligibility might have influenced the study population with respect to the risk of QT/QTc interval prolongation and associated adverse events (e.g., exclusion of patients with cardiac co-morbidities or renal/hepatic impairment, prohibition of diuretics as concomitant medications). Ideally, the major clinical studies should include an adequate representation of female and elderly patients, as well as patients with co-morbidities and concomitant medications typical of the expected user population.\n\nIf a subject experiences symptoms or ECG findings suggestive of an arrhythmia during a clinical trial, immediate evaluation by a cardiac specialist is recommended, both for the purposes of treating the patient and for discussions related to continuation/ re-institution of the therapy.\n\nPremature Discontinuations or Dosage Reductions (4.2)\n\nParticular attention should be directed to subjects or patients who are discontinued from clinical trials due to QT/QTc interval prolongation. Information should be provided on the basis for premature discontinuation of the patient (e.g., a QT/QTc interval value in excess of a protocol-defined upper limit, occurrence of QT/QTc interval prolongation in association with symptoms of arrhythmia), as well as the dose and duration of treatment, plasma levels if available, demographic characteristics, and the presence or absence of risk factors for arrhythmia.\n\nDosage reductions prompted by QT/QTc interval prolongation should also be documented.\n\nPharmacokine Considerations (4.3)\n\nMany forms of Long QT Syndrome are now known to be linked to mutations in genes encoding cardiac ion channel proteins. Because of incomplete penetrance, not all carriers of mutated ion channel genes will manifest QT/QTc interval prolongation in screening ECG evaluations. Polymorphisms can affect ion channels, leading to an increased sensitivity to drugs that affect repolarization. Genotyping patients who experience marked prolongation of the QT/QTc or TdP while on drug therapy should be considered.\n\nPostmarketing Adverse Event Reports (4.4)\n\nBecause documented cases of TdP are relatively rare, even for drugs that prolong the QT/QTc, they are often not reported until large populations of patients have received the agent in postmarketing settings. The available postmarketing adverse event data should be examined for evidence of QT/QTc interval prolongation and TdP and for adverse events possibly related to QT/QTc interval prolongation, such as cardiac arrest, sudden cardiac death and ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation). A well-characterized episode of TdP has a high probability of being related to drug use, whereas the other events that are reported more commonly would be of particular concern if reported in a population at low risk for them (e.g., young men experiencing sudden death).\n\nV Regulatory Implications, Labeling, and Risk Management Strategies (5)\n\nRelevance of QT/QTc Interval Prolonging Effects to the Evaluation Process (5.1)\n--------------------\nContext title: E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , In the ICH E14 guidance, the recommended metric to analyze for a crossover study is the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period. Please discuss the most appropriate metric to assess a drug\'s effect on QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study (i.e., when there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient). (4.1)\n--------------------\nContext: In contrast, in a crossover study, a time-matched baseline is usually not necessary because adjustments for subject- and study-specific diurnal variation are implicit by design in the assessment of time-matched drug-placebo differences in QT/QTc effect. The predose baseline, therefore, is usually adequate for crossover studies.\n\nObtaining replicate ECG measurements (for example, the average of the parameters from about 3 ECGs) within several minutes of each nominal time point at baseline and at subsequent times will increase the precision of the estimated changes in QT/QTc effect.\n\nV Use of Concentration Response Modeling of QTc Data (5)\n\nQ12. The ICH E14 guidance states (in section III (3), page 12) that analysis of the relationship between drug concentration and QT/QTc interval changes is under active investigation. Has this investigation yielded a reasonable approach to concentration-response modeling during drug development? How can assessment of the concentration-response relationship guide the interpretation of QTc data? (5.1)\n\nConcentration-response analysis, in which all available data across all doses are used to characterize the potential for a drug to influence QTc, can serve as an alternative to the by-time-point analysis or intersection-union test as the primary basis for decisions to classify the risk of a drug. In either case, this result is an important component of the totality of evidence assessment of the risk of QT prolongation. The overall assessment of risk of QT prolongation includes nonclinical data, the time course of QT prolongation, the magnitude of QT prolongation, categorical analyses of outliers, and certain adverse events in patients that can signal potential proarrhythmic effects.\n\nThere are many different types of models for the analysis of concentration-response data, including descriptive pharmacodynamic (PD) models (e.g., linear or E({}_{\\text{max}}) models), or empirical models that link pharmacokinetic (PK) models (dose-concentration-response) with PD models. Itis recognized that concentration-response analyses of the same data using models with different underlying assumptions can generate discordant results. Therefore, it is important that the modeling methods and assumptions, criteria for model selection, rationale for model components, and potential for pooling of data across studies be specified prior to analysis to limit bias. Prospective specification of model characteristics (e.g., structural model, objective criteria, goodness of fit) based on knowledge of the pharmacology is recommended whenever possible. On occasion, the QT effect is not a direct function of plasma concentration. For example, drugs that cause QT prolongation as a result of changes in protein synthesis or trafficking or drugs with accumulation into myocardial tissues might demonstrate hysteresis. Testing for model assumptions, hysteresis (a plot of data by-time point and a hysteresis loop plot), and goodness of fit should be documented.\n\nConcentration-response analysis can be challenging when more than one molecular entity--multiple drugs or parent plus metabolites--contributes to the QTc effect.\n\nImportant considerations\n\nConcentration-response data would not necessarily come from a dedicated QT study, nor would it necessarily come from a single study. However, there are several new and important considerations that are described below.\n\nData can be acquired from first-in human studies, multiple-ascending dose studies, or other studies. Additional data would be useful to ensure information on exposure well above the exposure at the maximum therapeutic dose, to cover the impact of accumulation with repeated dosing, drug-drug and drug-food interactions, organ dysfunction, or genetically impaired metabolism. It is anticipated that one would collect new data to add to previous data, if appropriate, rather than use new data for independent analyses.\n\nEfficient concentration-response analysis using data acquired in studies with other purposes requires as much quality control as is needed for a dedicated study. This includes robust, high-quality ECG recording and analysis sufficient to support a valid assay for ECG intervals (see the E14 guidance and Question Q1 (1.1)).\n\nIf there is an intention to pool data from multiple studies, it is important to test for heterogeneity.\n\nIf there are data characterizing the response at a sufficiently high multiple of the clinically relevant exposure (see the E14 guidance, section II.B.2 (2.2.2)), a separate positive control would not be necessary.\n\nDecision-making\n\nBoth the intersection-union test and the concentration-response analysis can estimate the maximum effect of a drug treatment on the QTc interval, but they are not used to test the same hypothesis. As mentioned above, inspection of the time course of QT prolongation is important.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nHowever, hypothesis testing based on a by-time point analysis (intersection-union test or point estimate and confidence intervals) is inappropriate in studies designed for a concentration-response analysis, if not powered to assess the magnitude of QT prolongation for each time point.\n\nWhen using a concentration-response analysis as the primary basis for decisions to classify the risk of a drug, the upper bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval for the QTc effect of a drug treatment as estimated by exposure-response analysis should be (<10) ms at the highest clinically relevant exposure to conclude that an expanded ECG safety evaluation during later stages of drug development is not needed (see the E14 guidance, section II.B.4 (2.2.4), and Question Q16 (7.1)).\n\n4.2.3 Other uses\n\nIn addition to serving as the basis for regulatory decision-making, concentration-response analysis has established its utility in several settings enumerated below.\n\n4.2.4 Providing insight into regimens not studied directly\n\nAn understanding of the concentration-response relationship can help predict the QT effects of doses, dosing regimens, routes of administration, or formulations that were not studied directly. Interpolation within the range of concentrations studied is more reliable than extrapolation above the range.\n\n4.2.5 Predicting OTc effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that affect pharmacokinetics\n\nUnderstanding the concentration-response relationship can help predict the effects of intrinsic (e.g., cytochrome P450 isoenzyme status) or extrinsic (e.g., drug-drug PK interactions) factors, possibly affecting inclusion criteria or dosing adjustments in later phase studies.\n\n5 Special Cases (6)\n\nThe ICH E14 guidance states that in certain cases, a conventional thorough QT study might not be feasible. In such cases, what other methods should be used for evaluation of QT/QTc and proarrhythmic potential? (6.1)\n\nIn certain cases, the conventional ""thorough QT/QTc"" study design (a crossover study in healthy volunteers with short-term administration of the usual maximum dose and one higher dose with placebo and positive control) might need to be modified for a drug or active metabolite with a long half-life or delayed QT effect, or because of safety, tolerability, or practical issues that preclude use in healthy subjects. In most cases, alternative designs can be used that may affect power considerations, but do not compromise study interpretation. For example, multiple doses can be studied in a parallel design trial or can use patients with the disease for which the drug is intended rather than healthy volunteers.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhere a placebo-controlled comparison using appropriate doses is not possible, alternative study designs should incorporate as many of the usual ""thorough QT/QTc"" design features as possible, and the quality and extent of the preclinical evaluation (ICH S7B guidance) is particularly critical. Other useful supplementary data might include intensive ECG data acquisition in early phase single or multiple ascending dose studies, utilization of concentration-response analysis, and evaluation of exposures that are greater than those anticipated with the intended marketed dose.\n\nA single dose of a positive control is generally sufficient, even if it precedes the investigational drug treatment. In the absence of a positive control, there is reluctance to draw conclusions on the lack of an effect; however, if the upper bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval around the estimated maximal effect on QTc is less than 10 ms, it is unlikely to have an actual mean effect as large as 20 ms.\n\nWhen a thorough QTc study of usual or modified design is not feasible, the intensity of late phase ECG monitoring will be dependent upon the quality and extent of the nonclinical and clinical evaluation. In situations where it is not possible to study higher exposures than are anticipated with the intended marketed dose, more intensive ECG monitoring might be necessary during phase 3 trials. When the nonclinical and early clinical data do not suggest clinically relevant QTc prolongation, intensive late stage monitoring might not be necessary. Otherwise, monitoring could be conducted as if a thorough QT study had been positive to protect patients in later trials and to obtain information on the frequency of marked QTc prolongation in the patient population (see Question Q16 (7.1)).\n\n2.3 The ICH E14 guidance does not address the approach to QT measurement during drug development in the case of combination drug products. Is it recommended that measurement of QT prolongation be performed on drug combinations? (6.2)\n\nIn general, combinations of two or more drugs are unlikely to need a thorough QT/QTc study or intensive late stage monitoring, if the component drugs have been demonstrated to lack relevant effects in thorough QT/QTc studies as described in the ICH E14 guidance.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs - Questions and Answers (R1)']","['Regardless of the study design, ""the largest time-matched mean difference between drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted)"" is determined as follows: The mean QTc for the drug (i.e., averaged across the study population) is compared to the mean QTc for placebo (averaged across the study population) at each time point.

As of that date, drug products compounded using any of the four bulk drug substances that are identified as not being included on the list do not qualify for the exemptions under 503A of the FD&C Act. Drug products compounded using one of the six bulk drug substances that are on the list will qualify for the exemptions under section 503A of the FD&C Act provided the drug products are compounded in compliance with the other conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ5. Going forward, how will FDA decide whether to place a bulk drug substance on the 503A Bulks List?\n\nAs described in the final rule, FDA is evaluating nominated bulk drug substances using four criteria: the physical and chemical characteristics of the substance, the safety of the substance in compounded drug products, evidence of effectiveness, and historical use of the substance in compounded drug products. As required by section 503A of the FD&C Act, FDA is consulting with the Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee (PCAC) and USP regarding the 503A Bulks List and is developing the list through notice and comment rulemaking.\n\nQ6. Why did FDA find the four substances it is not placing on the 503A Bulks List to be inappropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act?\n\nFor reasons described at length in the proposed rule that published on December 16, 2016 (81 FR 91071), entitled ""List of Bulk Drug Substances That Can Be Used To Compound Drug Products in Accordance With Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,"" and in the briefing materials presented to the PCAC, applying the four criteria identified in Question 5 above, FDA determined that these four substances are not appropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ7. What information did FDA rely on to make its determinations for the bulk drug substances that are addressed in the final rule?\n\nAs stated in the December 16, 2016 proposed rule, FDA considered information obtained from publicly available sources, including peer-reviewed medical literature. Some of this information was referenced in the nominations, and the remainder FDA gathered through independent searches of medical and pharmaceutical databases. FDA did not review raw data. The nature, quantity, and quality of the information FDA assessed varied considerably from substance to substance. In some cases, there were very little data. For other substances, reports in the literature were more plentiful and sometimes comprised hundreds or thousands of articles. In those cases, generally, the Agency limited its review to a sample of the best literature sources available (e.g., review articles in widely known, peer-reviewed journals; meta-analyses; reports of randomized controlled trials).\n\nQ8. What should I do if I want to use one of the four bulk drug substances that has been identified in the final rule as not being placed on the list to compound a route of administration or dosage form different than what the bulk drug substance was nominated and considered for when it was determined that it would not be placed on the list (e.g., the bulk drug substance was considered in the context of compounding an injectable drug product, but I want to use it to compound a tablet)?\n\nIf you would like to compound a drug product using a bulk drug substance identified as not placed on the list, you may submit a citizen petition under 21 CFR 10.30. The petition should ask FDA to consider revising the rule to include the bulk drug substance. The petition should explain any differences in how you propose to use the bulk drug substance as compared with how it was previously nominated and evaluated for inclusion on the list.\n\nQ9. Does FDA plan to add additional substances to the 503A Bulks List going forward?\n\nMany substances have been nominated for the 503A Bulks List, and FDA has been evaluating them on a rolling basis. FDA intends to publish additional notice and comment rulemaking to address whether these substances should be included on the list.\n\nQ10. Where can I get more information, if needed?\n\nQuestions regarding compliance with the 503A Bulks List Final Rule should be directed to Compounding@fda.hhs.gov.\n--------------------\nContext title: Section 503A Bulks List Final Rule Questions and Answers; Small Entity Compliance Guide; Guidance for Industry'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: The available evidence of effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of a drug product compounded with the substance, if any such evidence exists\n\nIn evaluating candidates for the 503A bulks list under these criteria, FDA is using a balancing test. No single one of these criteria is dispositive; rather, FDA is considering each criterion in the context of the others and balancing them, on a substance-by-substance basis, to evaluate whether a particular substance is appropriate for inclusion on the list.\n\nOnce the evaluation of a substance is complete, FDA will present the results of its review to the PCAC to obtain its advice on whether to include the substance on the list.20Section 503A requires that FDA create the 503A bulks list by regulation in consultation with the USP. To this end, FDA has been periodically meeting with USP and discussing the list. FDA will publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that identifies substances FDA proposes for placement on the 503A bulks list and the substances FDA has evaluated but is not proposing to include on the 503A bulks list. After publication of the NPRM, the public will have an opportunity to comment on the proposed rule. After considering the comments submitted to the docket, FDA will publish a final rule that establishes the 503A bulks list and identifies the substances that were considered and will not be placed on the list. FDA does not intend to evaluate all of the sufficiently supported nominations before publishing the first NPRM. Instead, after FDA has made a decision on whether to propose a group of substances (e.g., 10 substances) it intends to publish an NPRM with respect to that group of substances and continue to prepare the list on a rolling basis.\n\nA final rule will list the substances that FDA has determined can be used in compounding under section 503A and those substances that have been evaluated and not placed on the 503A bulks list, if any.\n\nAfter a final rule is published, drug products compounded using the substances on the 503A bulks list will be eligible for the section 503A exemptions provided the drug product is compounded in compliance with the other conditions of section 503A. Those substances that have been evaluated and not placed on the 503A bulks list will not qualify for the policies described for the substances in Category 1.\n\n3 Policy21\n\nFootnote 21: See the Appendix for a chart summarizing FDA’s interim policy.\n\nCompounding from Bulk Drug Substances under Section 503A\n\nUnder section 503A of the FD&C Act, a bulk drug substance that is not the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph or is not a component of an FDA-approved drug cannot be used in compounding unless it appears on a list promulgated as a regulation pursuant to section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(III) of the FD&C Act. This list will be codified at 21 CFR part 216 subpart E.\n\nHowever, until a substance has been evaluated and is identified in a final rule as being included or not included on the 503A bulks list, FDA does not intend to take action against a State-licensed pharmacy, Federal facility, or licensed physician compounding a drug product using a bulk drug substance that is not a component of an FDA-approved drug product and that is not the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph, provided that the following conditions are met:\n\nThe bulk drug substance appears in 503A Category 1 on FDA's website at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Pharmac\n\nYCompounding/UCM467373.pdf. A Category 1 substance may be eligible for inclusion on the 503A bulks list, was nominated with sufficient supporting information for FDA to evaluate it and has not been identified by FDA as a substance that presents a significant safety risk in compounding prior to the publication of a final rule.\n2. The original manufacturer and all subsequent manufacturers of the bulk drug substance are establishments that are registered under section 510 (including foreign establishments that are registered under section 510(i)) of the FD&C Act);\n3. The bulk drug substance is accompanied by a valid COA; and\n4. The drug product compounded using the bulk drug substance is compounded in compliance with all other conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nOriginal manufacturer means the entity that originally produced the bulk drug substance and not a subsequent packer, repacker, labeler, or distributor.\n\nThis policy does not apply to a licensed pharmacist in a State-licensed pharmacy or Federal facility, or a licensed physician, that compounds a drug using a bulk drug substance that does not meet each of the above conditions, and the bulk drug substance is not the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph or a component of an FDA-approved drug.\n\n2 Substances Not Nominated or Nominated Without Adequate Support\n\nAs stated above, one of the categories of bulk drug substances FDA has identified on its website is substances nominated for the 503A bulks list that may be eligible for inclusion on the list, but that FDA is unable to evaluate for inclusion on the list at this time because the substances were nominated with insufficient supporting evidence for FDA to evaluate them (503A Category 3). In the Federal Register of October 27, 2015, FDA established a docket (October docket) where these substances can be re-nominated with sufficient supporting information or where nominations for substances that were not previously nominated can be submitted.\n\nAfter a substance is nominated to the October docket,22 FDA will determine whether the nomination is supported with sufficient information to allow FDA to evaluate it. After FDA makes that determination, the nominated substance will be placed in one of the three categories described in section 2.2 above, and the categorization will be published on the FDA website. Once the category of a substance is published, FDA intends to apply the policy described in Section 3.1 of this guidance to that substance. FDA generally expects to categorize bulk drug substances nominated to the October docket and to publish updated categories on its website on the first business day of each month. Please note that until substances nominated for the October docket have been categorized, the policy does not apply to those substances.\n\nFootnote 22: This includes re-nominations of substances with sufficient supporting information.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf you feel that a substance that you nominated does not appear on the appropriate list or category as described in this guidance you can submit your comment to docket number FDA-2015-N-3534. If you have new information on a previously nominated substance that was placed in Category 3, the substance can be re-nominated with the additional information.\n\nA nominator may also submit a comment to the docket requesting withdrawal of any of its nominations. If the party nominating the substance was the sole nominator, FDA will update the categories described in this guidance to reflect the withdrawn nomination.23 FDA intends to provide notice to the public before removing any nominated substances from Category 1 or Category 2.\n\nFootnote 23: If multiple parties nominated the same substance, each party that nominated the substance must withdraw its nomination for the nominated substance to be considered withdrawn and for the categories to be updated to reflect that withdrawal.\n\nWithdrawal of a nomination upon the nominator's request and the resulting updates to the categories described in this guidance, do not reflect a determination by FDA regarding the validity of the nomination or of any reasons given by the nominator for requesting withdrawal. In addition, FDA may continue to evaluate a substance at its discretion even if the nominator submits a comment requesting withdrawal of the nomination.\n\nAppendix: Summary of Policy\n\nThe following table summarizes the interim policy for bulk drug substances set forth in this guidance:\n--------------------\nContext title: Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry""
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 7: See section 503A(c)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nBulk drug substances used in compounding under section 503A must also meet certain other requirements, including: (1) the bulk drug substance must be manufactured by an establishment registered under section 510 of the FD&C Act and (2) the bulk drug substance must be accompanied by a valid certificate of analysis (COA).9\n\nFootnote 8: See section 503A(c)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn July 2014, FDA issued a guidance, Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that states:\n\nUntil a bulk drug substances list is published in the Federal Register as a final rule, human drug products should be compounded using only bulk drug substances that are components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, or are the subject of USP or NF monographs.10\n\nFootnote 9: See section 503A(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFDA has received comments that this policy could be causing unnecessary and inappropriate disruptions in patient care because there are patients receiving drugs compounded with bulk drug substances that are not components of FDA-approved drugs, or the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph, but that may ultimately be included on the 503A bulks list, and those patients' care should not be disrupted while the list is under development. After considering this issue, FDA has decided to use this guidance to describe its interim policy concerning compounding with bulk drug substances while the 503A bulks list is being developed. FDA has revised the July 2014 guidance to state:\n\nFDA's interim policy concerning bulk drug substances that are not components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or that are not the subject of applicable USP or NF monographs can be found in the guidance, Interim Policy on _Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCompounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n\nFDA seeks to avoid unnecessary disruption to patient treatment while the Agency considers the bulk drug substances that were nominated with sufficient support to permit FDA to evaluate them and promulgates the regulations required under section 503A. Therefore, as described further below, FDA is issuing this interim guidance stating that it does not intend to take regulatory action for compounding drug products under section 503A using a bulk drug substance when an applicable USP or NF monograph for the substance does not exist and the substance is not a component of an FDA-approved product if, among other conditions, FDA has determined that the nomination for the bulk drug substance included adequate information for FDA to evaluate the substance and at this time, the substance does not appear to present significant safety risks.\n\nB. Efforts to Develop the List of Bulk Drug Substances under Section 503A\n\n1. Section 503A Bulks List -- Early History\n\nSection 503A was enacted in 1997 as part of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act. In the Federal Register of April 7, 1998 (63 FR 17011), FDA invited all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on the list of bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding under section 503A and received nominations for 41 different drug substances. In November 1998, FDA published a guidance for industry, Enforcement Policy During Implementation of Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In this guidance, FDA announced that it would not normally take regulatory action relating to a drug product that had been compounded with a bulk drug substance that had been nominated for inclusion on the bulk drug substances list on or before November 21, 1999, while the substance was being evaluated, as long as the compounding complied with the other effective requirements in section 503A and did not appear to present a significant safety risk.11\n\nFootnote 11: The 1998 guidance was withdrawn in the Federal Register notice announcing the availability of the draft guidance Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. See 78 FR 72901 (Dec. 4, 2013). The final guidance was published in July 2014.\n\nIn January 1999, after evaluating the nominated drug substances and consulting with the Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee (PCAC) as required by section 503A, FDA published a proposed rule listing 20 drug substances on the section 503A bulks list (64 FR 996, January 7, 1999). The preamble to the proposed rule indicated that 10 of the 41 nominated substances were the subject of a USP or NF monograph, or components of FDA approved drugs and did not need to be considered for inclusion on the list.12 The proposed rule also described 10 nominated substances that were still under consideration for the bulk drug substances list and stated that one of the substances was withdrawn by its nominator at the first meeting of the PCAC. The PCAC reconvened in May 1999 to discuss bulk drug substances included in the proposed rule, in addition to other bulk drug substances (64 FR 19791; April 22, 1999).\n\nHowever, after a 2002 U.S. Supreme Court decision holding that certain provisions of section 503A were unconstitutional,13 FDA suspended its efforts to develop the bulk drugs list under section 503A.\n\nFootnote 13: For additional legal history of section 503A, see the guidance Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and cosmetic Act.\n\nBecause of the amount of time that had passed between the publication of the proposed rule and the enactment of the 2013 Drug Quality and Security Act, which removed the provisions of the FD&C Act that the U.S. Supreme Court held to be unconstitutional in 2002, FDA felt it was necessary to begin again to develop the section 503A bulk drug substance list. In the December 4, 2013, Federal Register (78 FR 72841), FDA published a notice withdrawing the 1999 proposed rule and inviting all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on a list of bulk drug substances that can be used for compounding under section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nii.2.2 Current Nominations for the 503A Bulks List\n\nIn response to the December 2013, Federal Register notice, over 2,000 substances were nominated for the 503A bulks list. However, many of the substances nominated for the 503A list were for substances that can be compounded without being on the list because they are the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph or are a component of an FDA-approved drug. In addition, many of the nominations were not for substances used in compounding as active ingredients, or did not include sufficient information for FDA to evaluate the nominated substances for inclusion on the list. To improve the efficiency of the process for developing the 503A bulks list, FDA reopened the nomination process in July 2014 (79 FR 37742) and provided more detailed information on what it needs to evaluate nominations for the 503A bulks list. FDA stated that bulk drug substances that were previously nominated would not be considered further unless they were re-nominated with adequate support to permit a meaningful evaluation. Substances that were already eligible for use in compounding or that were not adequately supported would not be evaluated for placement on the 503A bulks list.\n\nIn response to this request for nominations, approximately 740 unique substances were nominated. Of the nominated substances:\n\nApproximately 315 substances are already eligible for use in compounding under section 503A.\n\nThese are the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph or components of an FDA-approved drug product, which can be used in compounding pursuant to sections 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(I) and (II) and, therefore, can be compounded without being included on the 503A bulks list. To determine if a bulk drug substance is the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph, see the USP-NF available at www.USPNF.com. To determine if a bulk drug substance is a component of an FDA approved drug, see the FDA's Orange Book:_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, available at\n\nhttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/default.cfm.\n\nAt least one14 of the nominated substances is not a bulk drug substance.\n\nFootnote 14: The over-the-counter finished drug product Maalox was nominated. Maalox is not a bulk drug substance.\n\nThis is a finished drug product that was nominated by its brand name. Finished drug products are not eligible for the 503A bulks list because they do not meet the definition of a bulk drug substance in 21 CFR 207.3.\n\nAt least one of the substances is considered a biological product subject to approval in a biologics license application (BLA) under section 351 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act when used for the indication proposed in the nomination.\n\nThis substance is not eligible for the 503A bulks list because biological products subject to approval in a BLA under section 351 of the PHS Act are not eligible for the exemptions in section 503A of the FD&C Act.15 No biological products subject to approval in a BLA will be considered for the 503A bulks list.\n\nFootnote 15: The nominated substance is sodium hexachloroplatinate (IV) hexahydrate. See the revised draft guidance, Mixing, Diluting, or Repackaging Biological Products Outside the Scope of an Approved Biologics License Application for FDA’s proposed policies regarding State-licensed pharmacies, Federal facilities, and outsourcing facilities that mix, dilute, or repackage biological products outside the scope of an approved BLA.\n--------------------\nContext title: Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: 2 Provisions of Section 503A That Require Regulations or Other FDA Actions\n\nSpecific provisions of section 503A of the FD&C Act require rulemaking or other action by FDA. FDA\'s policy related to these specific provisions is described below.\n\n2.1.1 Withdrawn or Removed List\n\nFDA promulgated a final rule, codified at 21 CFR 216.24, which lists drug products that cannot be compounded because they have been withdrawn or removed from the market because the drug products or components of the drug products have been found to be unsafe or not effective. FDA intends to update this list periodically, and expects compounds to comply with the list as it currently exists and with any final updates.\n\n2.2.2 Bulk Drug Substances List\n\nSection 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(III) of the FD&C Act provides that a drug product can be compounded using bulk drug substances that do not have an applicable USP or NF monograph (section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(I) of the FD&C Act) and are not components of FDA-approved drugs (section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act) if the bulk drug substances appear on a list developed by FDA and issued through regulation.\n\nIn the Federal Register of April 7, 1998 (63 FR 17,011), FDA invited all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on the list. In the Federal Register of January 7, 1999 (64 FR 996), FDA published a proposed rule listing bulk drug substances that can be used in pharmacy compounding. In the Federal Register of December 4, 2013 (78 FR 72,841), FDA published a notice withdrawing the 1999 proposed rule and inviting all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on a list of bulk drug substances that can be used for compounding under section 503A of the FD&C Act. FDA\'s interim policy concerning bulk drug substances that are not components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or that are not the subject of applicable USP or NF monographs can be found in the guidance, Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n\n2.3.3 ""Demonstrable Difficulties"" for Compounding\n\nUnder section 503A(b)(3)(A) of the FD&C Act, a compounded drug product would not qualify for the exemptions provided in subsection (a) if it is identified by FDA through regulation as a drug product that presents demonstrable difficulties for compounding that reasonably demonstrate an adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. In the Federal Register of December 4, 2013 (78 FR 72,840), FDA published a notice inviting all interested persons to nominate drug products or categories of drug products for inclusion on a list of drug products that present demonstrable difficulties for compounding (difficult-to-compound list). This provision is not enforceable until FDA promulgates an implementing regulation.\n\niii.1.4 Memorandum of Understanding Between FDA and the States\n\nSection 503A(b)(3) of the FD&C Act states that FDA, in consultation with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) will develop a standard MOU for use between FDA and the states that will address the interstate distribution of inordinate amounts of compounded drug products and provide for appropriate investigation by a state agency of complaints relating to compounded drug products distributed outside that state. On January 21, 1999, FDA published a notice in the Federal Register announcing the availability of a draft standard MOU, developed in consultation with the NABP. This draft MOU was not finalized. FDA intends to publish a new draft MOU for comment that will replace the January 1999 draft.\n\nUnder section 503A(b)(3)(B)(ii), an individual or firm in a state that does not enter into an MOU with FDA that distributes, or causes to be distributed, compounded drug products out of the state in which they are compounded, can compound for interstate distribution outside the state only 5% of the total prescription orders dispensed or distributed by the individual or firm. FDA does not intend to enforce the 5% limit on interstate distribution until after FDA has finalized an MOU and made it available to the states for their consideration and signature. The Federal Register notice that will announce the availability of the draft MOU will specify a time period during which the MOU will be made available to the states to sign. After this time period expires, FDA intends to begin enforcing the 5% limit in states that have not signed the MOU.\n\nIV Guidance on Regulatory Action\n\nRequirements Applicable to Drug Products that Meet the Conditions of Section 503a\n\nAs stated above, a compounded drug product intended for use in humans that meets the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act and its associated regulations is exempt from the requirements under sections 501(a)(2)(B), 502(f)(1), and 505 of the FD&C Act.\n\nHowever, individuals and firms may be subject to a warning letter, seizure of product, injunction, and/or criminal prosecution for violations of other requirements of the FD&C Act. Such violations may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nThe drug product must not consist in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance, or be prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have been contaminated with filth or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health. (Sections 501(a)(1) and (a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act)\n\nIf the drug product purports to be a drug that is recognized in an official compendium, its strength must not differ from, and its quality or purity must not fall below, the standards set forth in the compendium, unless the difference is plainly stated on its label. (Section 501(b) of the FD&C Act)3. For a drug product not subject to section 501(b) of the FD&C Act, the drug\'s strength must not differ from, and its quality or purity must not fall below, that which it purports to have. (Section 501(c) of the FD&C Act)\n\nIf the drug product purports to be a drug that is recognized in an official compendium, it must be packaged and labeled as prescribed in the compendium. (Section 502(g) of the FD&C Act)\n\nThe drug product\'s labeling, advertising, and promotion must not be false or misleading. (Sections 502(a), 502(bb),10 and 201(n) of the FD&C Act)\n\nFootnote 10: Section 502(bb) was added to the FD&C Act by section 103(b) of the DQSA.\n\n2 Enforcement Action When a Drug Does Not Meet the Conditions of Section 503A\n\nIf FDA determines that an individual or firm compounds a drug product that does not meet the conditions of section 503A, then in addition to the violations listed above in section IV.A., the individual or firm that compounds the drug product may also be subject to a warning letter, seizure of product, injunction, and/or criminal prosecution for violations of sections 501(a)(2)(B), 502(f)(1), and 505 of the FD&C Act.11 Such violations may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nFootnote 11: See Medical Ctr. Pharm. v. Mukasey, 536 F.3d 383, 405 (5th Cir. 2008) (“compounded drugs are in fact ‘new drugs’ as defined by [21 U.S.C.] § 321(p) but are exempt from the requirements of [21 U.S.C.] § 351(a)(2)(B), 352(f)(1), and 355 if and only if they comply with the conditions set forth in [21 U.S.C.] § 353a.”).\n\n2.2.1 Producing Adulterated Drugs\n\nIn accordance with section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR parts 210 and 211, the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, and holding of a drug must conform with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements. If an individual or firm compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act, those drug products would be subject to CGMP requirements.\n\n2.2 Producing Unapproved New Drugs\n\nIn accordance with section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, an individual or firm must not introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any new drug unless an approved NDA or ANDA is in effect for that drug product. If an individual or firm compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act, those drug products would be subject to the new drug approval requirements.\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn accordance with section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 201.5, drug products that are not labeled with adequate directions for use are misbranded. If an individual or firm compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act, those drug products would be subject to the requirements for adequate directions for use.\n\nIn addition to sections 501(a)(2)(B), 502(f)(1), and 505 of the FD&C Act, an individual or firm that compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act would be subject to the requirements listed in section IV.A, above, as well as other requirements of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations.\n\nEnforcement Approach\n\nGenerally, FDA expects to employ a risk-based enforcement approach with respect to violative compounded drugs, giving the highest enforcement priority to compounded drugs and violations of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations that pose the greatest public health risks. However, FDA emphasizes that it need not identify a particular safety problem before pursuing enforcement action.\n--------------------\nContext title: Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to help small businesses better understand and comply with the final rule establishing the list of bulk drug substances2 that can be used in compounding under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 353a) (final rule or 503A Bulks List Final Rule). On February 19, 2019 (84 FR 4696), FDA published a final rule that establishes FDA\'s criteria for evaluating bulk drug substances for inclusion on the list of bulk drug substances that may be used to compound drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act (the 503A Bulks List or the list) and that places six substances on the list. The final rule, entitled ""List of Bulk Drug Substances That Can Be Used To Compound Drug Products in Accordance With Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,"" also identifies four substances that were considered for and not included on the list.\n\nFootnote 2: FDA is evaluating bulk drug substances nominated for the 503A Bulks List on a rolling basis and intends to address additional substances in future rulemaking.\n\nThe 503A Bulks List Final Rule is effective March 21, 2019. FDA has prepared this guidance in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28)3 to assist small businesses in complying with the 503A Bulks List Final Rule.\n\nFootnote 3: 5 U.S.C. 601.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.\n\nInstead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nSection 503A of the FD&C Act describes the conditions under which a compounded drug product qualifies for exemptions from certain requirements of the FD&C Act related to FDA approval prior to marketing, current good manufacturing practice requirements, and labeling with adequate directions for use. One of the conditions that must be met for a compounded drug product to qualify for these exemptions is that a licensed pharmacist in a State-licensed pharmacy or Federal facility or a licensed physician compounds the drug product using bulk drug substances that (1) comply with the standards of an applicable United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or National Formulary monograph, if a monograph exists, and the USP chapter on pharmacy compounding; (2) if such a monograph does not exist, are drug substances that are components of drugs approved by FDA; or (3) if such a monograph does not exist and the drug substance is not a component of a drug approved by FDA, appear on a list of bulk drug substances developed by FDA through regulation.4\n\nFootnote 4: See section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353a(b)(1)(A)(i)).\n\nAs noted above, the 503A Bulks List Final Rule establishes criteria for evaluating bulk drug substances for inclusion on the 503A Bulks List, identifies six bulk drug substances FDA is placing on the list, and identifies four other bulk drug substances that were considered and are not being included on the 503A Bulks List.\n\nIII Questions and Answers\n\nWhat active ingredients are subject to this final rule?\n\nThe 503A Bulks List Final Rule addresses only 10 of the substances nominated for the 503A Bulks List. The final rule identifies six bulk drug substances FDA is placing on the list: Brilliant Blue G, also known as Coomassiee Brilliant Blue G-250; cantharidin (for topical use only); diphenylcyclopropone (for topical use only); N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG) (for topical use only); squaric acid dibutyl ester (for topical use only); and thymol iodide (for topical use only). The final rule also identifies four other bulk drug substances that are not being included on the list: oxitriptan, piracetam, silver protein mild, and tranilast.\n\nAlthough only the 10 substances listed above are specifically addressed in the final rule, the criteria for evaluation identified in the final rule will be applied to all bulk drug substances that are considered for the 503A Bulks List.\n\nCan substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n\nNo. As stated above, section 503A provides compounded drug products with exemptions from certain requirements of the FD&C Act, including premarket approval, but only when those compounded drug products meet the conditions of section 503A. A compounded drug product that includes one of the four bulk drug substances that are not being placed on the list would not meet those conditions and therefore would not qualify for the exemptions from the FD&C Act.\n\nIn addition, as described in the Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry,5 substances that have been evaluated and not placed on the 503A Bulks List no longer qualify for the interim policy concerning compounding with bulk drug substances.\n\nFootnote 5: We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, be sure to check the Agency’s guidance website at http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/FDABasicsforIndustry/ucm234622.htm.\n\nQ3. What should I do if I am a pharmacist and I receive a prescription for a compounded drug product that includes one of the four bulk drug substances that is not being placed on the 503A Bulks List as part of this final rule?\n\nA drug product compounded using a bulk drug substance that is identified in a final rule as not being placed on the 503A Bulks List does not qualify for the exemptions under section 503A of the FD&C Act. Compounding with any of the four substances identified in the 503A Bulks List Final Rule, or with substances identified in any other final rule as not being placed on the 503A Bulks List, may subject the compounder to regulatory action.\n\nQ4. When and how do compounders have to comply with this final rule?\n\nThe 503A Bulks List Final Rule is effective March 21, 2019. As of that date, drug products compounded using any of the four bulk drug substances that are identified as not being included on the list do not qualify for the exemptions under 503A of the FD&C Act. Drug products compounded using one of the six bulk drug substances that are on the list will qualify for the exemptions under section 503A of the FD&C Act provided the drug products are compounded in compliance with the other conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ5. Going forward, how will FDA decide whether to place a bulk drug substance on the 503A Bulks List?\n\nAs described in the final rule, FDA is evaluating nominated bulk drug substances using four criteria: the physical and chemical characteristics of the substance, the safety of the substance in compounded drug products, evidence of effectiveness, and historical use of the substance in compounded drug products. As required by section 503A of the FD&C Act, FDA is consulting with the Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee (PCAC) and USP regarding the 503A Bulks List and is developing the list through notice and comment rulemaking.\n\nQ6. Why did FDA find the four substances it is not placing on the 503A Bulks List to be inappropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act?\n\nFor reasons described at length in the proposed rule that published on December 16, 2016 (81 FR 91071), entitled ""List of Bulk Drug Substances That Can Be Used To Compound Drug Products in Accordance With Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,"" and in the briefing materials presented to the PCAC, applying the four criteria identified in Question 5 above, FDA determined that these four substances are not appropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ7. What information did FDA rely on to make its determinations for the bulk drug substances that are addressed in the final rule?\n--------------------\nContext title: Section 503A Bulks List Final Rule Questions and Answers; Small Entity Compliance Guide; Guidance for Industry'

You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction and scope\n\nThis guidance sets forth the Food and Drug Administration\'s (FDA or Agency) interim regulatory policy concerning compounding using bulk drug substances under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act or Act). Section 503A of the FD&C Act includes certain restrictions on the bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding and directs FDA to develop a list of bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding under that section. FDA is developing this list of bulk drug substances (the 503A bulks list), and this guidance describes FDA\'s interim regulatory policy for licensed pharmacists in State-licensed pharmacies and Federal facilities and for licensed physicians that compound human drug products using bulk drug substances while the list is being developed.2,3\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance does not apply to drugs compounded from bulk drug substances for use in animals. For proposed policies pertaining to compounding drug products from bulk drug substances for use in animals, see FDA’s draft guidance, Compounding Animal Drugs from Bulk Drug Substances.\n\nAll FDA guidances are available on the FDA guidance web page. FDA updates guidances regularly. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, always consult the guidance web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformationGuidances/default.htm.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nCompounding From Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Act\n\nSection 503A of the FD&C Act describes the conditions that must be satisfied for human drug products compounded by a licensed pharmacist in a State-licensed pharmacy or Federal facility, or by a licensed physician, to be exempt from the following three sections of the FD&C Act: section 505 (concerning the approval of drugs under new drug applications or abbreviated new drug applications); section 502(f)(1) (concerning the labeling of drugs with adequate directions for use); and section 501(a)(2)(B) (concerning current good manufacturing practice requirements).\n\nOne of the conditions that must be met for a compounded drug product to qualify for these exemptions is that a licensed pharmacist, or licensed physician compounds the drug product using bulk drug substances that:\n\nComply with the standards of an applicable United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or National Formulary (NF) monograph, if a monograph exists, and the USP chapter on pharmacy compounding;\n\nIf such a monograph does not exist, are drug substances that are components of drugs approved by the Secretary; or\n\nIf such a monograph does not exist and the drug substance is not a component of a drug approved by the Secretary, appears on a list developed by the Secretary through regulations issued by the Secretary under subsection (c) of section 503A.4 Footnote 4: See Section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act.\n\nA bulk drug substance is defined as meaning ""the same as active pharmaceutical ingredient as defined in 21 CFR 207.1(b)."" See 21 CFR 207.3. Active pharmaceutical ingredient is defined as ""any substance that is intended for incorporation into a finished drug product and is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body,"" but the term ""does not include intermediates used in the synthesis of the substance"" (see section 503A(b)(1)(A) and 21 CFR 207.3).5({}^{,})6 FDA has interpreted ""an applicable USP or NFmonograph"" to mean an official USP or NF drug substance monograph. Accordingly, FDA does not consider USP monographs for dietary supplements to be ""applicable"" USP or NF monographs within the meaning of section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(I).\n\nUnder section 503A(c)(1), before developing this list through regulation, FDA must convene and consult an advisory committee on compounding unless FDA determines that the issuance of such regulation before consultation with the advisory committee is necessary to protect the public health. FDA must also consult with USP when promulgating the regulations.7 The criteria for determining which bulk drug substances should appear on the section 503A bulks list ""shall include historical use, reports in peer reviewed medical literature, or other criteria the Secretary may identify.""8\n\nFootnote 7: See section 503A(c)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nBulk drug substances used in compounding under section 503A must also meet certain other requirements, including: (1) the bulk drug substance must be manufactured by an establishment registered under section 510 of the FD&C Act and (2) the bulk drug substance must be accompanied by a valid certificate of analysis (COA).9\n\nFootnote 8: See section 503A(c)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn July 2014, FDA issued a guidance, Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that states:\n\nUntil a bulk drug substances list is published in the Federal Register as a final rule, human drug products should be compounded using only bulk drug substances that are components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, or are the subject of USP or NF monographs.10\n\nFootnote 9: See section 503A(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFDA has received comments that this policy could be causing unnecessary and inappropriate disruptions in patient care because there are patients receiving drugs compounded with bulk drug substances that are not components of FDA-approved drugs, or the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph, but that may ultimately be included on the 503A bulks list, and those patients\' care should not be disrupted while the list is under development. After considering this issue, FDA has decided to use this guidance to describe its interim policy concerning compounding with bulk drug substances while the 503A bulks list is being developed. FDA has revised the July 2014 guidance to state:\n\nFDA\'s interim policy concerning bulk drug substances that are not components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or that are not the subject of applicable USP or NF monographs can be found in the guidance, Interim Policy on _Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCompounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n--------------------\nContext title: Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry']","['No. As stated above, section 503A provides compounded drug products with exemptions from certain requirements of the FD&C Act, including premarket approval, but only when those compounded drug products meet the conditions of section 503A. A compounded drug product that includes one of the four bulk drug substances that are not being placed on the list would not meet those conditions and therefore would not qualify for the exemptions from the FD&C Act.\n\nIn addition, as described in the _Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry_,5 substances that have been evaluated and not placed on the 503A Bulks List no longer qualify for the interim policy concerning compounding with bulk drug substances.']",0.9999999999833332,0.4
73,"As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?","['--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: Consequently, in appropriate cases, FDA may take additional steps within its authority to assure that pediatric use information is included in biological product labeling.12 Such actions may include invoking the ""marketed drugs"" provision under PREA, in certain circumstances, to require sponsors to conduct pediatric assessments, or take other appropriate steps, to support pediatric labeling for both the biosimilar product and the reference product.13\n\nFootnote 13: See section 505B(b) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIf a biosimilar applicant believes that none of the situations described above apply to its proposed product, the applicant should contact FDA for further information.\n\nQ.I.17: When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n\n[Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n\nA.I.17. Section 505B(e) of the FD&C Act requires applicants subject to PREA to submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP) before the date on which the applicant\n\nsubmits the required assessments or investigation, and no later than 60 calendar days after the date of an end-of-phase 2 (EOP2) meeting or at such other time as agreed upon by FDA and the applicant. FDA has issued guidance on the PSP\n\nprocess, including the timing of PSP submission.14\n\nFootnote 14: See the guidance for industry Pediatric Study Plans: Content of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans (July 2020).\n\nSections 505B(e)(2)(C) and 505B(e)(3) of the FD&C Act set forth a process for reaching agreement between an applicant and FDA on an initial PSP that generally lasts up to 210 days. Given the potential length of this process, and in the absence of an EOP2 meeting for a proposed biosimilar product, FDA\n\nrecommends that if a sponsor has not already initiated a comparative clinical study intended to address the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I)(cc) of the PHS Act, the sponsor should submit an initial PSP as soon as feasible, but no later than 210 days before initiating such a study. This is intended to provide adequate time to reach agreement with FDA on the initial PSP before the study is initiated. Depending on the details of the clinical program, it may be appropriate to submit an initial PSP earlier in development. FDA encourages the sponsor to meet with FDA to discuss the details of the planned development program before submission of the initial PSP.\n\nFor additional information on submission of the PSP, including a PSP template, please refer to:\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResource\n\ns/ucm049867.htm. After the initial PSP is submitted, FDA and the sponsor work to reach timely agreement on the plan; this process is set forth in section\n\n505B(e)(2)-(3) of the FD&C Act. FDA does not formally grant or deny a request for a waiver or deferral in response to the initial PSP.\n\nQ.I.18: For biological products intended to be injected, how can an applicant demonstrate that its proposed biosimilar product has the same dosage form as the reference product? [Final December 2018]\n\nA.I.18. Under section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the PHS Act, an applicant must demonstrate that the ""dosage form"" of the proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product is the same as that of the reference product. For purposes of implementing this statutory provision, FDA considers the dosage form to be the physical manifestation containing the active and inactive ingredients that delivers a dose of the drug product. In the context of proposed biosimilar products intended to be injected, FDA considers, for example, ""injection"" (e.g., a solution) to be a different dosage form from ""for injection"" (e.g., a lyophilized powder). Thus, if the dosage form of the reference product is ""injection,"" an applicant could not obtain licensure of a proposed biosimilar product with a dosage form of ""for injection"" even if the applicant demonstrated that the proposed biosimilar product, when constituted or reconstituted, could meet the other requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product.\n\nFor purposes of section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the PHS Act, FDA also considers emulsions and suspensions of products intended to be injected to be distinct dosage forms. Liposomes, lipid complexes, and products with extended-release characteristics present special scenarios due to their unique composition, and prospective applicants seeking further information should contact FDA.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that this interpretation regarding the same dosage form is for purposes of section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the PHS Act only. For example, this interpretation should not be cited by applicants seeking approval of a new drug application under section 505(c) of the FD&C Act, approval of an abbreviated new drug application under section 505(j) of the FD&C Act, or licensure of a BLA under section 351(a) of the PHS Act for purposes of determining whether separate applications should be submitted and assessed separate fees for different dosage forms.\n\nQ.I.19: If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n\nA.I.19. A sponsor may submit a single IND application for a development program that is intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act and includes use of a non-U.S.-licensed product. The sponsor should submit information supporting the proposed clinical investigation with the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product under the IND application. This scenario may occur, for example, if a sponsor seeks to use data from a clinical study comparingits proposed biosimilar product to a non-U.S.-licensed product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act, and proposes to conduct a clinical PK study, with PD data, as appropriate, in the United States with all three products (i.e., the proposed biosimilar product, the U.S.-licensed reference product, and the non-U.S.-licensed product) to support establishment of a bridge between all three products and scientific justification for the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity to the U.S.-licensed reference product.\n\nA non-U.S.-licensed comparator product is considered an investigational new drug in the United States, and thus would require an IND application for importation and use in the United States (see 21 CFR 312.110(a)). If a sponsor intends to conduct a clinical investigation in the United States using a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product, the IND requirements in 21 CFR part 312 also would apply to this product (see, e.g., 21 CFR 312.2).\n\nWith respect to chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) information, a sponsor should submit to the IND application as much of the CMC information required by 21 CFR 312.23(a)(7) as is available. However, FDA recognizes that a sponsor may not be able to obtain all of the CMC information required by 21 CFR 312.23(a)(7) for a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product for which it is not the manufacturer. In these circumstances, the sponsor can request in an IND submission that FDA waive the regulatory requirements related to CMC information on the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product (21 CFR 312.10). The waiver request must include at least one of the following:\n\nAn explanation why compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.23(a)(7) is unnecessary or cannot be achieved\n\nInformation that will satisfy the purpose of the requirement by helping to ensure that the investigational new drug will have the proper identity, strength, quality, and purity\n\nOther information justifying a waiver15 Footnote 15: See 21 CFR 312.10(a).\n\nInformation that is relevant to whether the investigational new drug will have the proper identity, strength, quality, and purity may include, for example, information indicating whether the investigational new drug has been licensed by a regulatory authority that has similar scientific and regulatory standards as FDA (e.g., ICH countries). This should include, to the greatest extent possible, summary approval information and current product labeling made public by the foreign regulatory authority. In addition, a sponsor should also provide information on the conditions and containers that will be used to transport the drug product to the U.S. clinical site(s) and information on the relabeling and repackaging operations that will be used to relabel the drug product vials for investigational use. This should include information on how exposure of the product to light and temperature conditions outside of the recommended storage conditions will be prevented. A risk assessment on the impact the relabeling operations may have on drug product stability should also be included.\n\nThe sponsor should consult with the appropriate FDA review division regarding the CMC information necessary to support the proposed clinical study.\n\nAs would be applicable to all investigational new drugs, FDA reminds sponsors that the investigator brochure (IB) for studies to be conducted under the IND application should be carefully prepared to ensure that it is not misleading, erroneous, or materially incomplete, which can be a basis for a clinical hold (see 21 CFR 312.42(b)(1)(iii) and (b)(2)(i)). For example, the term reference product should be used in the IB only to refer to the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which the proposed product is evaluated for purposes of submitting a 351(k) application.\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 22: See section 505B(e)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(2)(A).\n\nThe sponsor should submit the iPSP to the relevant drug\'s IND for review by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research as appropriate. In cases where the sponsor has no active IND for the drug but the sponsor expects to open the IND with an initial phase 3 study, the sponsor should submit the iPSP as a pre-IND submission. In this situation, the FDA encourages the sponsor to schedule a pre-IND meeting before submission of the iPSP, and such submission should precede initiation of any phase 3 studies or combined phase 2 and phase 3 studies. In cases where the drug development program includes the possibility of using expedited programs,23 the FDA encourages the sponsor to have discussions about the pediatric development plans with the review division as early as possible.\n\nFootnote 23: For further information on expedited programs, see the guidance for industry Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions—Drugs and Biologics (May 2014).\n\nAfter the sponsor submits an iPSP, the FDA has 90 days to review the iPSP and provide a written response to the iPSP, or meet with the sponsor to discuss the iPSP, as appropriate.24 This review process includes consultation with FDA\'s internal Pediatric Review Committee (PeRC).25 The sponsor then has a second 90-day period during which it may review FDA comments and initiate any needed negotiations to discuss the iPSP. By the end of this second 90-day review period, the sponsor must submit an agreed iPSP.26 The FDA then has 30 days after receipt of the agreed iPSP to review and issue correspondence confirming agreement or issue correspondence stating disagreement.27 If the FDA does not agree, the iPSP is considered a non-agreed iPSP (see section VIII., Non-Agreed Initial PSPs). The total length of time forreview of an iPSP should not exceed 210 days. A sponsor should not submit a marketing application or supplement until the FDA confirms agreement on the iPSP.\n\nV Content of the Initial Psp\n\nThe FD&C Act requires that an iPSP include ""(i) an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct (including, to the extent practicable, study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints, and statistical approach); (ii) any request for a deferral, partial waiver, or waiver (\\ldots) if applicable, along with any supporting information; and (iii) other information specified in the regulations"" issued by the FDA.28 This section of the guidance describes information that is required or recommended to be included in the iPSP submission. In certain situations, it may be premature to include a detailed outline of a planned pediatric study (or studies) because additional data are needed (e.g., efficacy, safety, potential endpoints). In such cases, the outline of the pediatric studies should include a brief explanation for the lack of more detailed information. The sponsor receives feedback at the time of the review of the iPSP on the planned request for waivers and/or deferrals. For example, the FDA feedback may indicate concurrence with the planned deferral and/or waiver or, if FDA does not concur, include recommendations for the sponsor on the timing of pediatric drug development and on whether to include pediatric data in the initial marketing application instead of obtaining a deferral. However, FDA does not make a formal decision about granting a waiver and/or deferral of required pediatric assessments, or reports on the molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation, until the time of the approval of the marketing application.\n\nFootnote 28: See section 505B(e)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(2)(B).\n\nAppendix: Initial Pediatric Study Plan Template provides a template that we recommend sponsors complete for the iPSP submission.29 The FDA acknowledges that the development program for a drug, including the design of the pediatric studies, may change as the sponsor collects new data from nonclinical studies, clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs (e.g., data from drugs in the same or similar class). The iPSP should include a well-constructed pediatric plan based upon current knowledge of the drug and disease epidemiology; sponsors can submit amendments to an agreed iPSP at any time,30 including changes to the pediatric plan that need to be considered based on additional data described above (see also section VII., Content and Timing of Requested Amendment to an Initial PSP).\n\nFootnote 29: The template also is available at https://www.fda.gov/media/84944/download.\n\nFootnote 30: See section 505B(e)(5) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(5).\n\nIn addition, sponsors can include information in the iPSP (see section 2 in section V.B., Recommendations for the Content of Each Section of the iPSP) about plans for submission of a concurrent or future proposed pediatric study request (PPSR), as appropriate. However, the sponsor should submit the iPSP and PPSR as separate documents to facilitate the FDA\'s appropriate review and comment.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAlthough, as stated above, the FDA does not make a formal decision about granting a waiver and/or deferral of required pediatric assessments or reports on the molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation until approval of the marketing application, the FDA considers the information contained in an agreed iPSP when considering any requests for waiver and/or deferral at the time of the marketing application review.\n\nMaterially Incomplete iPPs\n\nFailure to include required information may result in an iPSP that the FDA considers materially incomplete. For example, if a sponsor fails to address all pediatric age groups and all indications for which the drug is being developed that are subject to PREA, the FDA generally considers the iPSP to be materially incomplete.31 Additionally, if a sponsor fails to provide justification for any planned waivers or deferrals, the FDA may consider the iPSP to be materially incomplete. If the iPSP is considered materially incomplete, the FDA intends to contact the sponsor, and the sponsor should submit a complete iPSP within 30 days to address the identified deficiencies. A new 210-day review period will start when the sponsor submits a complete iPSP.32\n\nFootnote 31: The FDA anticipates that there will be additional considerations for applications described in section 505B(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act that require submission of reports on the molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation described in section 505B(a)(3) of the FD&C Act. For additional information, see the draft guidances for industry FDARA Implementation Guidance for Pediatric Studies of Molecularly Targeted Oncology Drugs: Amendments to Sec. 505B of the FD&C Act and Pediatric Study Plans for Oncology Drugs: Transitional Information Until Full Implementation of FDARA Section 504: Questions and Answers. When finalized, these guidances will represent FDA’s current thinking on these topics.\n\nHowever, if the sponsor includes sufficient information for the FDA to evaluate the plan, even if the FDA disagrees with the proposed plan, the FDA in general considers the iPSP to be sufficient for initial review. For example, if a sponsor includes a plan to request a full waiver with a justification and the FDA disagrees with this plan, the FDA does not intend to consider such disagreement as grounds for a determination that the iPSP is materially incomplete.\n\nRecommendations for the Contents of Each Section of the iPSP\n\nThis section provides specific recommendations for the content of each section of the iPSP.\n\nTitle Page\n\nSponsors should include relevant administrative information on the title page (e.g., drug name, IND number, indication or indications that apply) (see Appendix: Initial Pediatric Study Plan Template).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n1 Overview of the Disease/Condition in the Pediatric Population\n\nThis section should briefly summarize (1 to 3 pages)33 available information on the pathophysiology of the disease, methods of diagnosis, and currently available treatments and/or prevention strategies in the pediatric population, including neonates. The sponsor should also include available information on the incidence and prevalence of the disease in both the overall population and the pediatric population, including in specific age subgroups when appropriate. Additionally, the sponsor should discuss current understanding of and available evidence supporting any similarities and differences between the disease in adults and in the pediatric population.\n\nFootnote 33: The recommended page count for each section of the iPSP applies to the overall iPSP and not to the individual active ingredients in the case of a fixed-dose combination product.\n\n2 Overview of the Drug or Biological Product\n--------------------\nContext title: Pediatric Study Plans- Content of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans'

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to help applicants develop draft labeling for proposed biosimilar products for submission in an application under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262(k)). The recommendations for prescription drug labeling in this guidance pertain only to the prescribing information (commonly referred to as the package insert), except for certain recommendations in section V pertaining to FDA-approved patient labeling (e.g., Patient Information, Medication Guide, and Instructions for Use).2 This guidance does not provide specific labeling recommendations for interchangeable products (see section VIII of this guidance).\n\nFootnote 2: Unless otherwise specified, the terms biosimilar product labeling and labeling as used in this guidance address only the prescribing information as described in 21 CFR 201.56 and 201.57.\n\nIn general, FDA\'s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) (Public Law 111-148) on March 23, 2010. The BPCI Act amends the PHS Act and other statutes to create an abbreviated license pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference product3 (see sections 7001 through 7003 of the Affordable Care Act). Section 351(k) of the PHS Act, added by the BPCI Act, sets forth the requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product and an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product.\n\nFootnote 3: Reference product means the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in a 351(k) application (section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nSection 351(i) of the PHS Act defines biosimilarity to mean ""that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components"" and that ""there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product.""\n\nTo meet the standard for interchangeability, an applicant must provide sufficient information to demonstrate biosimilarity and also to demonstrate that the biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, if the biological product is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch (see section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act). Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nAn application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based upon data derived from:\n\nAnalytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;\n\nAnimal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and\n\nA clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.\n\nUnder the PHS Act, FDA has the discretion to determine that an element described above is unnecessary in a 351(k) application.\n\nUnder FDA regulations, prescription drug labeling must provide adequate information to enable health care providers to ""use the drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended""; and to this end, the approved prescribing information summarizes the essential scientific information needed by health care providers for the safe and effective use of a drug.4 Prescription drug labeling reflects FDA\'s finding of safety and effectiveness5({}^{,})6 for the drug under the labeled conditions of use and facilitates prescribing decisions, thereby enabling the safe and effective use of drugs, including biological products, and reducing the likelihood of medication errors.\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 CFR 201.100 and 201.56(a)(1).\n\nFootnote 5: The standard for licensure of a biological product as potent under section 351(a) of the PHS Act has long been interpreted to include effectiveness (see 21 CFR 600.3(s) and the guidance for industry Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nFootnote 6: In this guidance, we use the terms safety and effectiveness and safety, purity, and potency interchangeably in the discussions pertaining to biosimilar products.\n\nIII General principles for draft labeling of proposed biosimilar products (biosimilar product labeling)\n\nThe goal of a biosimilar product development program is to demonstrate biosimilarity between the proposed product and the reference product -- not to independently establish safety and effectiveness of the proposed product. A demonstration of biosimilarity means, among other things, that FDA has determined that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.7 Thus, FDA\'s finding of safety and effectiveness for the reference product, as reflected in its FDA-approved prescribing information, may be relied upon to provide health care providers with the essential scientific information needed to facilitate prescribing decisions for the proposed biosimilar product\'s labeled conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)). Accordingly, FDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, such as those described in sections V and VI of this guidance.8\n\nFootnote 7: Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act.\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry'

[Moved to Final from Draft September 2021]\n\nA.I.24.: When an applicant is seeking licensure for an indication for which the reference product has unexpired orphan exclusivity, an applicant should submit data and information to support approval of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product for this indication.18 For example, an applicant may submit data and information intended to provide sufficient scientific justification for extrapolation to support approval of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product for one or more indications, including an indication(s) for which the reference product has unexpired orphan exclusivity. In reviewing such information under section 351(k), FDA will not approve the proposed product for the protected indication(s).19\n\nFootnote 19: See License for Fewer than All Conditions of Use Guidance for information about timing of submissions for supplements seeking licensure for indications protected by unexpired exclusivity. This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nII Provisions Related to Requirement to Submit a Bla for a ""Biological Product""\n\nThis question and its answer have been withdrawn. For information on the definition of ""protein"" in section 351(i)(1) of the PHS Act, see Final Rule on Definition of the Term ""Biological Product"" (85 FR 10057, February 21, 2020) and 21 CFR 600.3(h)(6). [\\ast\\ast\\ast\\ast]\n\nHow is ""product class"" defined for purposes of determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period? [Final April 2015]\n\nFor purposes of section 7002(e)(2) of the ACA, a proposed biological product will be considered to be in the same product class as a protein product previously approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2010, if both products are homologous to the same gene-coded sequence (e.g., the INS gene for insulin and insulin glargine) with allowance for additional novel flanking sequences (including sequences from other genes). Products with discrete changes in gene-coded sequence or discrete changes in post-translational modifications may be in the same product class as the previously approved product even if the result may be a change in product PK.\n\nFor naturally derived protein products that do not have identified sequences linked to specific genes and that were approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2010, a proposed biological product is in the same product class as the naturally derived protein product if both products share a primary biological activity (e.g., the 4-number Enzyme Commission code for enzyme activity).\n\nHowever, for any protein product (whether naturally derived or otherwise), if the difference between the proposed product and the protein product previously approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act alters a biological target or effect, the products are not in the same product class for purposes of section 7002(e)(2) of the ACA.\n\nQ.II.3: What type of marketing application should be submitted for a proposed antibody-drug conjugate? [Final December 2018]\n\nA.II.3. A BLA should be submitted for a proposed monoclonal antibody that is linked to a drug (antibody-drug conjugate). FDA considers an antibody-drug conjugate to be a combination product composed of a biological product constituent part and a drug constituent part (see 21 CFR 3.2(e)(1); 70 FR 49848, 49857-49858 (August 25, 2005)).\n\nCDER is the FDA center assigned to regulate antibody-drug conjugates, irrespective of whether the biological product constituent part or the drug constituent part is determined to have the primary mode of action. For more information, see section 503(g) of the FD&C Act; see also, e.g., Transfer of Therapeutic Biological Products to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (June 30, 2003), available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/JurisdictionalInformation/ucm136265.htm; Intercenter Agreement Between the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (October 31, 1991), available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/JurisdictionalInformation/ucm121179.htm.\n\nTo enhance regulatory clarity and promote consistency, CDER considered several factors to determine the appropriate marketing application type for antibody-drug conjugates, including the relative significance of the safety and effectiveness questions raised by the constituent parts, particularly the highly specific molecular targeting by the antibody to a cell type, cellular compartment, or other marker at the site of action (as distinguished from mere alteration of systemic PK).\n\nIn light of such factors, CDER considers submission of a BLA under section 351 of the PHS Act to provide the more appropriate application type for antibody-drug conjugates.\n\nSponsors seeking to submit a BLA for a proposed antibody-drug conjugate may contact CDER\'s Office of New Drugs at 301-796-0700 for further information.\n\nIII Exclusivity\n\nCan an applicant include in its 351(a) BLA submission a request for reference product exclusivity under section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act? [Final December 2018]\n\nYes. An applicant may include in its BLA submission a request for reference product exclusivity under section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act, and FDA will consider the applicant\'s assertions regarding the eligibility of its proposed product for exclusivity. For more information, see FDA\'s draft guidance for industry Reference Product Exclusivity for Biological Products Filed Under Section 351(a) of the PHS Act.20 The draft guidance describes the types of information that reference product sponsors should provide to facilitate FDA\'s determination of the date of first licensure for their products. Footnote 20: This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nHow can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n\nThe FDA\'s Orphan Drug Product designation database is available to search for orphan drug designations and/or approvals. The database is updated monthly (see https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/index.cfm). FDA will not approve a subsequent application for the same drug for the same indication during the 7-year period of orphan exclusivity, except as otherwise provided in the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 316.\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: A.I.7. An applicant generally may obtain licensure of a proposed biosimilar product for fewer than all conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed. The 351(k) application must include information demonstrating that the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling submitted for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product (see section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act).\n\nFor information about the licensure of a proposed interchangeable product, see FDA's guidance for industry Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference Product.5\n\nFootnote 5: As explained in that guidance, FDA generally expects that applicants seeking to demonstrate interchangeability will submit data and information to support a showing that the proposed interchangeable product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in all of the reference product’s licensed conditions of use.\n\nQ.1.8. Can a sponsor use comparative animal or clinical data with a non-U.S.-licensed product to support a demonstration that the proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n\nA.I.8. A sponsor may use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in certain studies to support a demonstration that the proposed biological product is biosimilar to the U.S.-licensed reference product. However, as a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) study, which may include pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoint(s) intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed.\n\nIf a sponsor seeks to use data from an animal study6 or a clinical study comparing its proposed biosimilar product to a non-U.S.-licensed product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. As a scientific matter, the type of bridging data needed will always include data from analytical studies(e.g., structural and functional data) that directly compare all three products (i.e., the proposed biosimilar product, the U.S.-licensed reference product, and the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product), and is likely to also include bridging clinical PK data or, when appropriate, PD data, for all three products. All three pairwise comparisons should meet the prespecified acceptance criteria for analytical and PK or PD similarity. The acceptability of such an approach will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and should be discussed in advance with the Agency. For certain complex biological products, a modified approach may be needed. A final determination about the adequacy of the scientific justification and bridge will be made during the review of the application.\n\nIssues that a sponsor may need to address to use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in a biosimilar development program include but are not limited to the following:\n\nRelevance of the design of the clinical program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity to the U.S.-licensed reference product for the condition(s) of use and patient population(s) for which licensure is sought\n\nRelationship between the license holder for the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product and BLA holder for the U.S.-licensed reference product\n\nWhether the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product was manufactured in a facility(ies) licensed and inspected by a regulatory authority that has similar scientific and regulatory standards as FDA (e.g., International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) countries)\n\nWhether the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product was licensed by a regulatory authority that has similar scientific and regulatory standards as FDA (e.g., ICH countries) and the duration and extent to which the product has been marketed\n\nScientific bridge between the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product and the U.S.-licensed reference product, including comparative physicochemical characterization, biological assays/functional assays, degradation profiles under stressed conditions, and comparative clinical PK or, when appropriate, PD data, to address the impact of any differences in formulation or primary packaging on product performance\n\nA sponsor should also address any other factors that may affect the relevance of comparative data with the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to an assessment of biosimilarity with the U.S.-licensed reference product.\n\nA sponsor may submit publicly available information regarding the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to justify the extent of comparative data needed to establish a bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. The complexity of the products, particularly with respect to higher order structure, post-translational modifications (e.g., glycosylation), and the degree of heterogeneity associated with the product may affect the considerations for the scientific justification regarding the extent of bridging data. Additional factors that FDA may consider regarding the extent of bridging data include but are not limited to the following:\n\nWhether the formulation, dosage form, and strength of the U.S.-licensed reference product and non-U.S.-licensed comparator products are the same\n\nRoute of administration of the U.S.-licensed reference product and non-U.S.-licensed comparator products\n\nDesign of the physicochemical and biological/functional assessments and the use of multiple orthogonal methods with adequate sensitivity to detect differences among the products\n\nScientific justification for the selection of the non-U.S.-licensed comparator lots used to establish the scientific bridge and how the selected lots relate to the material used in the nonclinical and clinical studies; the scientific bridge should include a sufficient number of lots of non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to adequately capture the variability in product quality attributes, and when possible, the non-U.S.-licensed comparator lots used in the nonclinical or clinical studies should be included in the assessment performed to establish the analytical bridge\n\nSponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program the adequacy of the scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of this scientific justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFor more information about whether a non-U.S.-licensed comparator can be used in studies intended to support the additional criteria required for a determination of interchangeability with the reference product, see FDA's guidance for industry Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference Product.\n\nQ.I.9.: Is a clinical study to assess the potential of the biological product to delay cardiac repolarization (a QT/QTc study) or a drug-drug interaction study generally needed for licensure of a proposed biosimilar product? [Final December 2018]\n\nA.I.9. In general, a 351(k) application for a proposed biosimilar product may rely upon the Agency's previous determination of safety, purity, and potency for the reference product, including any clinical QT/QTc interval prolongation and proarrhythmic potential and drug-drug interactions. If such studies were not required for the reference product, then these data generally would not be needed for licensure of a proposed biosimilar product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. However, if the BLA holder for the reference product has been required to conduct postmarket studies or clinical trials under section 505(o)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to assess or identify a certain risk related to a QT/QTc study or a drug-drug interaction study and those studies have not yet been completed, then FDA may impose similar postmarket requirements on the 351(k) applicant in appropriate circumstances.\n\nQ.1.10: How long and in what manner should sponsors retain reserve samples of the biological products used in comparative clinical PK and/or PD studies intended to support a 351(k) application? [Final December 2018]\n\nA.I.10.: Reserve samples establish the identity of the products tested in the actual study, allow for confirmation of the validity and reliability of the results of the study, and facilitate investigation of further follow-up questions that arise after the studies are completed. FDA recommends that the sponsor of a proposed biosimilar product retain reserve samples for at least 5 years following the date on which the 351(k) application is licensed, or, if such application is not licensed, at least 5 years following the date of completion of a comparative clinical PK and/or PD study of the reference product and the proposed biosimilar product (or other clinical study in which PK or PD samples are collected with the primary objective of assessing PK or PD similarity) that is intended to support a submission under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. Contact FDA for specific advice if an alternative approach is being considered. For a three-way PK similarity study, FDA recommends that samples of both comparator products be retained, in addition to samples of the proposed biosimilar product.\n\nFor most protein therapeutics, FDA recommends that a sponsor retain the following quantities of product and dosage units, which are expected to be sufficient for evaluation by state of the art analytical methods:\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: In the interest of efficient review and approval of product applications, FDA encourages sponsors of unapproved applications or products under IND to consult with FDA regarding proposed manufacturing changes before implementing such changes prior to product approval. A sponsor may provide FDA with information regarding a manufacturing change by including a description of the change, a description of corresponding comparability tests conducted, and the comparability test data and validation information in license/ new drug applications, INDs, or amendments to pending license/ new drug applications and INDs in effect. For biological products that FDA has approved, an applicant should submit information about manufacturing changes pursuant to 21 CFR $ 601.12 or 21 CFR $ 314.70(g), and any FDA guidance on changes to be reported.\n\n21 CFR $ 601.12 prescribes which changes must be reported to FDA and which changes require prior approval. FDA has proposed amendments to this regulation. Manufacturers should consult the current regulation and any applicable guidance to determine the need and mechanism of reporting.\n\nIn each instance, adequate information should be available in order that FDA reviewers and investigators may understand the type of change made, the stage of production at which the change was made, and the product(s) affected. Such information should include appropriate validation of non-clinical studies and clinical studies which may vary for different products and for the manufacturing stage at which the change is implemented.\n\n5 Conclusion\n\nFDA may determine that manufacturers of biological products, including therapeutic biotechnology-derived products regulated as biologics or drugs, may make manufacturing changes without conducting additional clinical efficacy studies if comparability test data demonstrate to FDA that the product after the manufacturing change is safe, pure, potent/ effective.\n\n6 References\n\nPoints to Consider in the Production and Testing of Interferon Intended for Investigational Used in Humans (1983).\n\nCytokine and Growth Factor Pre-Pivotal Information Package (1990).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]\n--------------------\nContext title: Demonstration of Comparability of Human Biological Products, Including Therapeutic Biotechnology-derived Products']","['Section 505B(e) of the FD&C Act requires applicants subject to PREA to submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP) before the date on which the applicant\n\nsubmits the required assessments or investigation, and no later than 60 calendar days after the date of an end-of-phase 2 (EOP2) meeting or at such other time as agreed upon by FDA and the applicant.

Having one reference source of information that can be applied across the three ICH regions would facilitate a practical, efficient, and consistent approach to the benefit-risk evaluation and make the PBRER a unique report accepted in all countries and regions.\n\nThe reference product information for the PBRER would include ""core safety"" and ""approved indications"" components. In order to facilitate the assessment of benefit and benefit-risk by indication in the evaluation sections of the PBRER, the reference product information document should list all approved indications in ICH countries or regions. It is likely that these indications will also apply in other countries or regions. However, when the PBRER is also to be submitted to other countries in which there are additional locally approved indications, these indications may either be added to the reference product information or handled as a regional appendix/appendices as considered most appropriate by the MAH. The basis for the benefit evaluation should be the baseline important efficacy/effectiveness information summarised in Section 17.1 of the PBRER.\n\nThe following possible options can be considered by MAHs in selecting the most appropriate reference product information for a PBRER:\n\nCompany Core Data Sheet\n\nIn accordance with ICH E2C(R1) recommendations, it is a common practice for MAHs to prepare their own CCDS, which includes sections relating to safety, indications, dosing, pharmacology, and other information concerning the medicinal product. The core safety information contained within the CCDS is referred to as the CCSI. A practical option is for MAHs to use the latest CCDS in effect at the end of the reporting interval as the reference product information for both the risk sections of the PBRER as well as the main approved indications for which benefit is evaluated.\n\nWhen the CCDS for a medicinal product does not contain information on approved indications, the MAH should clearly specify which document is used as the reference information for the approved indications in the PBRER.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline'

 '--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , What efficacy/effectiveness information should be presented in section 17.1 (Important Baseline Efficacy/Effectiveness Information) of the PBRER?\n--------------------\nContext: If stipulated by applicable regional requirements, the MAH should provide, in a regional appendix, information on any final, ongoing, or proposed changes to the national or local authorised product information.\n\nLevel of Detail Within PBRER\n\nThe level of detail provided in certain sections of the PBRER should depend on the medicinal product\'s known or emerging important benefits and risks. This approach is applicable to those sections of the PBRER in which there is evaluation of safety data, efficacy/effectiveness data, safety signals, and benefit-risk. Therefore, the extent of information provided in such PBRER sections will vary among individual PBRERs.\n\nFor example, when there is important new safety information, a detailed presentation of that information should be included, plus the relevant benefit information, in order to facilitate a robust benefit-risk analysis. Conversely, when little new important safety information has become available during the reporting interval, a concise summary of baseline benefit information should be sufficient, and the benefit-risk evaluation would consist primarily of an evaluation of updated interval safety data.\n\nEfficacy/Effectiveness\n\nFor the purpose of this Guideline, evidence on benefits in clinical trials and in everyday medical practice should be reported. Because the terms are not harmonized across regions, the terms ""efficacy/effectiveness"" are used in this Guideline to clarify that information from both clinical trials and everyday medical practice are within the scope of the information on benefit to be included within the PBRER. In some regions, efficacy refers to evidence of benefit from controlled clinical trials while effectiveness implies use in everyday medical practice. Conversely, in other regions, this distinction is not made.\n\nBenefit-Risk Evaluation\n\nWhen a drug is approved for marketing, a conclusion has been reached that, when used in accordance with approved product information, its benefits outweigh its risks. As new information about the drug emerges during marketing experience, benefit-risk evaluation should be carried out to determine whether benefits continue to outweigh risks, and to consider whether steps need to be taken to improve the benefit-risk balance through risk minimisation activities, e.g., labelling changes, communications with prescribers, or other steps.\n\nPeriodicity and PBRER Data Lock Point\n\n2.8.1 International Birth Date and Data Lock Point\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline']","['In addition to the guidance provided in section III.Q.1 (3.17.1) of the E2C(R2) guidance, the MAH may wish to consider the following points when presenting efficacy/effectiveness information in section 17.1 of the PBRER.\n\n_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nThe MAH should present any efficacy/effectiveness information on approved indications that is relevant and supports the characterization of benefit presented in section 17.3 of the PBRER. The content should focus on important evidence that supports the benefit of the product. The MAH can use tables, graphs, and/or narrative descriptions to communicate this information.\n\nThe following are examples of points to consider for information that might be included in section 17.1 of the PBRER:\n\n* A statement about the intended purpose and impact of the product on the outcome(s) of each approved indication in the populations treated, including the nature of the benefit (diagnostic, preventative, symptomatic, or disease-modifying treatment).\n* Evidence including (but not limited to) clinical trial data, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, clinical pharmacology, relevant outcome studies.\n* Information described in Appendix E in the guidance (Examples of Possible Sources of Information that May Be Used in the Preparation of the PBRER). The MAH should also consider the following:\n* Evidence that the benefits are applicable to subpopulations, for example, pediatric, elderly, pregnant, vulnerable populations.\n* Information about multiple efficacy endpoints, where they support efficacy/effectiveness.\n* Evidence of efficacy/effectiveness from various sources (e.g., placebo-controlled trials, active controlled trials, meta-analyses, observational studies).\n* Trends, patterns, and/or evidence of benefit or lack of benefit in important subgroups.']",0.8099999999838,0.3170731707317073

This document includes a glossary, a reference list with related web addresses, and a quick-reference table.\n\nThe Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) each have regulatory responsibilities for IVD devices; information included in this document applies to Class I, II, and III IVD devices regulated by either Center.\n\nNote: Some devices used to test blood donor suitability, and blood donor and recipient compatibility are licensed as biological products under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act and are subject to the applicable regulations in 21 CFR Parts 600-680. Examples of licensed biologics devices include blood donor screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and C tests intended for blood screening and reagents used in blood grouping, antibody detection and identification, and crossmatching for pre-transfusion compatibility testing. This guidance is written to address only IVD devices that are approved or cleared under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and Part 800 of the device regulations, regardless of which Center reviews the submission. If you have questions about a device licensed by CBER, you may go to the CBER website for published guidance\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/default.htm) or contact CBER for further information on applicable guidance and regulations. (See Introduction, Section II, question # 4, of this guidance for a listing of CBER contact numbers).\n\nFDA\'s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency\'s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. Introduction\n\n1. What is the purpose of this guidance document and how does it differ from other guidance documents related to IVD products?\n\nFDA prepared this comprehensive document as a resource for you and for its own staff to address issues concerning IVD studies. This guidance document contains information relevant to studies conducted during the development of a new IVD product, as well as other general considerations about applicable requirements and marketing of the new device. It addresses particularly those investigational studies that are exempt from the majority of requirements under 21 CFR Part 812. IVD study investigators and members of IRBs who review and approve such studiesmay also find it helpful. There are also device-specific guidance documents available for specific IVD products that can be found at\n\nhttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfggp/search.cfm. The use of\n\ninvestigational IVD devices in clinical studies designed to evaluate new drug products falls outside the scope of this guidance.\n\n2 Why are in vitro diagnostics considered devices?\n\nIn vitro diagnostics (IVDs) meet the definition of a device under the Act. Section 201(h) of the Act defines a device as:\n\n""an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or accessory, which is--\n\n(1) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United\n\nStates Pharmacopeia, or any supplement to them,\n\n(2) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions,\n\nor in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in\n\nman or other animals, or\n\n(3) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of\n\nman or other animals, and\n\nwhich does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical\n\naction within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not\n\ndependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary\n\nintended purposes."" 21 U.S.C. 321(h) (emphasis added).\n\n3 How do IVD devices differ from other devices?\n\nMost other devices function on or in a patient. In contrast, IVDs include products\n\nused to collect specimens, or to prepare or examine specimens (e.g., blood, serum, urine, spinal fluid, tissue samples) after they are removed from the human body.\n\n4 Which Divisions at FDA are responsible for review of IVD products?\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)\n\n({}^{\\star}) Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety (OIVD)\n\n({}^{\\star}) Division of Chemistry and Toxicology Devices - Phone: (301) 796-5470\n\n({}^{\\star}) Division of Immunology and Hematology Devices - Phone: (301) 796-5481\n\n({}^{\\star}) Division of Microbiology Devices - Phone: (301) 796-5461\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\n({}^{\\star}) Office of Cell, Tissues, and Gene Therapy (OCTGT) - Phone: (301) 827-5102\n\n({}^{\\star}) Office of Blood Research and Review (OBRR)\n\n({}^{\\star}) Division of Blood Applications (DBA) - Phone: (301) 827-3524DBA schedules all review-related meetings for OBRR\n\n(\\bullet)Division of Emerging and Transfusion Transmitted Diseases\n\n(DETTD) - Phone: (301) 827-3008\n\n(\\bullet)Division of Hematology (DH) - Phone: (301) 496-4396\n\n5.

General Regulatory Issues\n\n1. Which regulations contain provisions relevant to the IVD industry?\n\nListed below are some of the regulations that implement the Act and that are relevant to IVDs covered by this guidance. See Table 1 (Appendix 1) for additional information. This is not an all-inclusive list.\n\nTitle 21, Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR)\n\nPart 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures\n\nPart 50, Protection of Human SubjectsPart 54, Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators\n\nPart 56, Institutional Review Boards\n\nPart 801, Labeling\n\nPart 803, Medical Device Reporting\n\nPart 807, Establishment Registration and Device Listing for\n\nManufacturers and Initial Importers of Devices\n\nPart 809, In Vitro Diagnostic Products for Human Use\n\nPart 810, Medical Device Recall Authority\n\nPart 812, Investigational Device Exemptions\n\nPart 814, Premarket Approval of Medical Devices\n\nPart 820, Quality System Regulation\n\nPart 860, Medical Device Classification Procedures\n\nPart 862, Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices\n\nPart 864, Hematology and Pathology Devices\n\nPart 866, Immunology and Microbiology Devices\n\nIn addition, certain sections of Part 610 apply to devices that employ\n\nhuman blood components. For example:\n\n610.40, Test Requirements (Testing Requirements for Communicable\n\nDisease Agents)\n\n610.42, Restrictions on Use for Further Manufacture of Medical Devices\n\n2. How do I determine the applicability of the IDE regulation to my IVD study?\n\nWe recommend that you begin with the exemptions in 21 CFR 812.2(c). Your\n\nproposed IVD study is exempt from most provisions of the IDE regulation if it fits any one of the following three categories:\n\na. The IVD is a pre-amendments device (i.e., a device that was in\n\ncommercial distribution prior to the enactment of the 1976 Medical\n\nDevice Amendments to the Act), other than a transitional device (see the\n\nGlossary for definition), and is used or investigated according to the\n\nindications in the labeling at that time.\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the ""Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies"" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: Yes, it is possible for an IVD device to be approved for marketing under the\n\nHDE. See the Glossary for definitions, 21 CFR Part 814, Subpart H, and\n\nAppendix 1 for more information.\n\n12. Can an IVD device qualify for HUD designation if the affected patient population is fewer than 4,000 per year but each patient may need to be tested multiple times?\n\nIVD devices qualify for an HUD designation when the number of persons tested with the device is fewer than 4,000 per year. FDA recognizes that the number of tests with the device may exceed one per patient. A device that involves multiple patient uses may still qualify for HUD designation as long as the IVD device is designed for diagnosis or treatment of a total of fewer than 4,000 patients per year in the US.\n\nIf a device is being developed to diagnose or to help diagnose a disease or condition with an incidence of fewer than 4,000 patients per year, but there are more than 4,000 patients a year ""at risk"" who would be subject to testing using the device, then the device may not qualify as a HUD. 21 CFR 814.102(a)(5).\n\n13. Is there a regulation that specifically addresses labeling of IVD products?\n\nYes. The regulation, ""Labeling for in vitro diagnostic products,"" (21 CFR809.10), specifies the information required on labeling and in package inserts of marketed products as well as products in development that are distributed for use in studies. We recommend that you design IVD studies so that the results will support the proposed indications for use in the package insert and labeling.\n\n14. Are there different goals for IVD studies compared to other device studies?\n\nNo. The goals for IVD studies are the same as the goals for other device studies, even if the IVD study is exempt from most IDE requirements under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3). We recommend that the sponsor and the investigators conduct an IVD device study with the goals of\n\n({}^{\\bullet}) producing valid scientific evidence (for a definition, see 21 CFR 860.7(c)(2) and answer #1 of section IV) demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the product, as described below, and\n\n({}^{\\bullet}) protecting the rights and welfare of study subjects. (See Human Subject Protection, Section V of this guidance).\n\n15. What regulations describe the content requirements for IVD premarket submissions?\n\nRegulations that describe the basic content requirements by submission type include:\n\n({}^{\\bullet}) Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) - 21 CFR 812.20\n\n({}^{\\bullet}) Premarket Notification (510(k)) - 21 CFR 807.87\n\n({}^{\\bullet}) Premarket Approval (PMA) - 21 CFR 814.20\n\n({}^{\\bullet}) Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) - 21 CFR 814.104\n\nCurrently, there is no regulation describing the contents for a Product\n\nDevelopment Protocol (PDP). However, section 515(f)(1) of the Act and the\n\nCDRH website at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarke\n\ntYourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketApprovalPMA/ucm048168.htm#p\n\ndp describe PDP requirements.\n\nIn addition, the FDA 510(k) substantial equivalence determination summaries and FDA PMA summaries of safety and effectiveness are currently available on the\n\nCDRH OIVD web page at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/InVitroDiag\n\nnostics/LabTest/ucm126189.htm or for CBER products at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/BloodBloodProducts/ApprovedProducts/PremarketApprovalsPMAs/ucm089793.htm and\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/510k\n\nProcess/ucm133429.htm. We recommend that the sponsor structure submissionsaccording to the relevant regulations and provide sufficient detail to give the reader an understanding of the scientific data and information supplied. OIVD has issued many device specific guidances that describe FDA\'s recommendations for premarket submissions for particular types of IVDs.\n\n16. Can published literature be used to support an IVD premarket submission?\n\nFDA has developed a guidance document entitled ""Supplements to Approved Applications for Class III Medical Devices: Use of Published Literature, Use of Previously Submitted Materials, and Priority Review,"" which can be found on the CDRH website at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo\n\ncuments/ucm080183.htm. CDRH and CBER believe that the principles outlined in this guidance are applicable to other submissions, specifically those for a 510(k), PMA, and HDE. (See the Glossary for definitions of these submission types.)\n\n17. Can data from studies performed outside of the United States (U.S.) be used to support an IVD premarket submission?\n\nYes. FDA recognizes that clinical investigations may be conducted outside of the U.S., for example, in order to find adequate numbers of subjects for certain disease states, conditions, or pathogens. The PMA regulation contains information regarding research conducted outside of the U.S. (21 CFR 814.15). FDA can also accept data from foreign studies in support of 510(k)s.\n\n18. Can foreign/international data be used as the sole support of a marketing application?\n\nYes, but only if warranted. The PMA regulation, 21 CFR Part 814, allows foreign data to be used as the sole support of a marketing application but only if (1) the data are applicable to the U.S. population and to U.S. medical practices, including laboratory practices, (2) the studies have been performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence, and (3) the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site FDA inspection or, if necessary, FDA can validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means (21 CFR 814.15(d)).\n\nFor IVD devices, FDA would consider differences in population demographics, disease prevalence, disease presentation, laboratory practices, and medical standards of care. If the sponsor plans to submit an application based solely on foreign data, FDA recommends that the sponsor consult with the reviewing division prior to submission of the application.\n\nSee Introduction, Section II, question # 4 of this guidance for a list of reviewing divisions in both CDRH and CBER.\n\n19. What is a master file and how is one submitted?\n\nA device master file (MAF) is a reference source that a person submits to FDA. In general, it is a file of trade secret or confidential commercial/financial information submitted by a third party (i.e., someone other than the applicant) for use as a reference source in support of at least one application. FDA will accept MAFs from organizations or persons who have not submitted or will not directly submit the information in a PMA, IDE, 510(k), or other device-related submission to FDA. MAFs may include information on the following:\n\nfacilities and manufacturing procedures and controls;\n\nsynthesis, formulation, purification and specifications for chemicals, materials (an alloy, plastic, etc.) or subassemblies for a device;\n\npackaging materials;\n\ncontract packaging and other manufacturing (such as sterilization);\n\nnonclinical study data; and\n\nclinical study data.\n\nWe recommend that a MAF include a cover letter, preferably on company letterhead, signed by a responsible company official that identifies the submission as a MAF and provides the name of a contact person at the company or a designated agent. For more information concerning MAFs see the CDRH website at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarke\n\nYourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketApprovalPMA/ucm142714.htm\n\n20. How do I arrange to reference a MAF?\n\nYou, the sponsor, should contact the company that owns the information you would like to incorporate by reference in your premarket submission to FDA, and find out if this information is currently in a master file. If it is, you should obtain a written authorization from the master file holder (or an authorized designated agent/representative) on company letterhead. You should include the original authorization letter in the original copy of the premarket submission to FDA, and a copy of the authorization letter in each subsequent copy of the premarket submission. The master file holder should not send the authorization letter directly to FDA for inclusion in the master file or for inclusion in your premarket submission.\n\nIf the information you, the sponsor, would like to incorporate by reference in yourpremarket submission to FDA is not already in a master file, you should request that the company that owns this information submit a master file to FDA.\n\nFor more information on referencing MAFs see the CDRH website at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarke\n\ntYourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketApprovalPMA/ucm142714.htm.\n\nIV. Investigational Studies\n\n1. What does FDA consider to be valid scientific evidence?\n\nValid scientific evidence is defined in the ""Medical Device Classification Procedures"" regulation, 21 CFR Part 860, as:\n\nEvidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience with a marketed device, from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device under its conditions of use (21 CFR 860.7(c)(2)).\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff'

Which regulations contain provisions relevant to the IVD industry?\n\nListed below are some of the regulations that implement the Act and that are relevant to IVDs covered by this guidance. See Table 1 (Appendix 1) for additional information. This is not an all-inclusive list.\n\nTitle 21, Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR)\n\nPart 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures\n\nPart 50, Protection of Human SubjectsPart 54, Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators\n\nPart 56, Institutional Review Boards\n\nPart 801, Labeling\n\nPart 803, Medical Device Reporting\n\nPart 807, Establishment Registration and Device Listing for\n\nManufacturers and Initial Importers of Devices\n\nPart 809, In Vitro Diagnostic Products for Human Use\n\nPart 810, Medical Device Recall Authority\n\nPart 812, Investigational Device Exemptions\n\nPart 814, Premarket Approval of Medical Devices\n\nPart 820, Quality System Regulation\n\nPart 860, Medical Device Classification Procedures\n\nPart 862, Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices\n\nPart 864, Hematology and Pathology Devices\n\nPart 866, Immunology and Microbiology Devices\n\nIn addition, certain sections of Part 610 apply to devices that employ\n\nhuman blood components. For example:\n\n610.40, Test Requirements (Testing Requirements for Communicable\n\nDisease Agents)\n\n610.42, Restrictions on Use for Further Manufacture of Medical Devices\n\n2. How do I determine the applicability of the IDE regulation to my IVD study?\n\nWe recommend that you begin with the exemptions in 21 CFR 812.2(c). Your\n\nproposed IVD study is exempt from most provisions of the IDE regulation if it fits any one of the following three categories:\n\na. The IVD is a pre-amendments device (i.e., a device that was in\n\ncommercial distribution prior to the enactment of the 1976 Medical\n\nDevice Amendments to the Act), other than a transitional device (see the\n\nGlossary for definition), and is used or investigated according to the\n\nindications in the labeling at that time.\n\nb. The IVD is a device, other than a transitional device, that has been\n\nfound to be substantially equivalent to a pre-amendments device and is\n\nused or investigated according to the indications in the labeling reviewed\n\nby FDA in determining substantial equivalence.\n\nc. The IVD\n\n({}^{\\star}) is properly labeled in accordance with 21 CFR 809.10(c);\n\n({}^{\\star}) is noninvasive (see question #5 below);\n\n({}^{\\star}) does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents\n\nsignificant risk (see question #4 below);\n\n({}^{\\star}) does not by design or intention introduce energy into a subject;\n\nand(\\bullet) is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure (see question # 6 below).\n\nFor your study to be exempt from most of the requirements of the IDE regulation under this third category, it must meet all of the conditions listed in ""c"" above. (See also the decision tree in Appendix 1.) You should refer to 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 for applicable requirements relating to IRBs and informed consent, including for device studies that meet the criteria described in 21 CFR 812.2(c). Additionally, investigators for those studies are still subject to 21 CFR 812.119 (the provision entitled ""Disqualification of a clinical investigator."")\n\nIf your proposed study does not fit into one of the three categories listed above, you, the sponsor, must have an approved IDE (21 CFR 812.2) before you may begin your investigation, including any shipment of your investigational IVD. (Note: A device that is approved under a premarket approval application (PMA) or cleared under a 510(k) and then used in a study in accordance with the approved or cleared labeling is not investigational and, therefore, is not subject to the IDE regulation.)\n\nThe requirements for an IDE depend on the level of risk that the study presents to subjects.\n\nFor a significant risk device (see the Glossary for definition), the sponsor must apply to FDA for an IDE approval (see 21 CFR 812.1, 812.20). For a non-significant risk device (see the Glossary for definition), the sponsor must meet the abbreviated requirements of 21 CFR 812.2(b), including review and approval of the investigation by an institutional review board (IRB) and compliance with informed consent requirements. A non-significant risk study is considered to have an approved IDE when the abbreviated requirements are met.\n\nNote: The requirements of the ""Protection of Human Subjects"" and ""Institutional Review Boards"" regulations (21 CFR Parts 50 and 56) apply to all clinical investigations regulated by FDA under section 520(g) of the Act, as well as other clinical investigations that support applications for research or marketing permits. (21 CFR 50.1, 56.101; see also Section V, Human Subject Protection, of this guidance.) Therefore, all studies of investigational IVDs that will support applications to FDA are subject to 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, even if they are not subject to most requirements of 21 CFR Part 812.\n\n3. How do I determine if the study is a significant or non-significant risk study under 21 CFR 812.2(b)?A significant risk IVD device is generally one that is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to health, safety, or welfare of a subject. 21 CFR 812.3(m).\n\nFor IVDs, we interpret ""potential for serious risk"" in relation to the nature of the harm that may result to the subject. Misdiagnosis and/or error in treatment caused by inaccurate test results would be considered a significant risk if the potential harm to the subject could be life-threatening, or could result in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to the body structure.\n\nFalse positive results can lead to unnecessary confirmatory testing, unnecessary treatment that can be invasive or have harmful side effects, and/or unnecessary psychological trauma when serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions are involved. False negative results can lead to a delay in establishing the correct diagnosis, failure to start or continue needed treatment, false security that may prevent timely follow-up and retesting, and contribute to the potential spread of infectious agents to others. If the potential risk does not rise to the level described above, the study is not considered to pose a significant risk. FDA recommends the sponsor consider all these factors when determining the risk associated with your investigational IVD. (See 21 CFR 812.3(m) and also ""Information Sheet Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors,"" available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/Guida\n\nncesInformationSheetsandNotices/ucm113709.htm, particularly the one on\n\n""Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Devices"" at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo\n\ncuments/ucm126622.htm.)\n\nHow do I determine if an invasive sampling technique presents a significant risk under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3)?\n\nTo determine whether an invasive sampling technique presents a serious risk, we recommend that you base your risk determination on the nature of the harm that may result from sampling. For example, FDA considers sampling techniques that require biopsy of a major organ, use of general anesthesia, or placement of a blood access line into an artery or large vein (subclavian, femoral, or iliac) to present a significant risk.\n\n5 What does noninvasive mean?\n\nA noninvasive device is one that does not, by design or intention:\n\na. penetrate or pierce the skin or mucous membranes of the body, the ocular cavity, or the urethra; or b. enter the ear beyond the external auditory canal, the nose beyond the nares, the mouth beyond the pharynx, the anal canal beyond the rectum, or the vagina beyond the cervical os.\n\n(21 CFR 812.3(k)).\n\nBlood sampling that involves simple venipuncture is considered noninvasive, and the use of surplus samples of body fluids or tissues that are left over from samples taken for noninvestigational purposes is also considered noninvasive (21 CFR 812.3(k)).\n\n6. What does it mean to have ""confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure?""\n\nFor an investigational study to be exempt under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3), clinical investigators must use a medically established means of diagnosis (e.g., another cleared or approved IVD or culture) of the disease or condition as the basis for decisions regarding treatment of all subjects participating in the study. 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3)(iv). Additionally, test results from the exempt IVD investigation should not influence patient treatment or clinical management decisions before the diagnosis is established by a medically established product or procedure.\n\nIf an investigational test uses a new technology or represents a significant technological advance, established diagnostic products or procedures may not be adequate to confirm the diagnosis provided by the investigational IVD. For example, if an investigational test is designed to identify an infection at the earliest stages of viral infection (before formation of antibodies), established diagnostic products or procedures that rely on the detection of antibodies to the virus would be inadequate to confirm diagnoses. Under these conditions the study would not meet the criteria for exemption under 812.2(c)(3) since the testing could not be confirmed with a medically established diagnostic product or procedure. You may consider whether the device is a non-significant risk device subject to abbreviated IDE requirements (21 CFR 812.2(b)).\n\n7.

A subject may be in normal health or may have a medical condition or disease (21 CFR 812.3(p)).\n\nSurplus samples - see excess samples.\n\nTransitional device - a product defined as a device as of May 28, 1976, but previously considered by FDA to be a new drug or an antibiotic drug (21 CFR 812.3(r)).\n\nTreatment IDE - use of an unapproved investigational device for the treatment or diagnosis of patients during the clinical trial or prior to final FDA action on the marketing application, if during the course of the clinical trial the data suggest that the device is effective. A treatment IDE may cover a large number of patients that exceeds the number of clinical sites and patients stipulated in the original IDE. The device must be for treatment or diagnosis of a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition; there must be no comparable or satisfactory alternative device or therapy available; the device must be under investigation in a controlled clinical study for the same use under an approved IDE, or such clinical studies have been completed; and the sponsor must be actively pursuing marketing approval or clearance of the device. Requirements for an application for a treatment IDE are found in the Investigational Device Exemptions regulation at 21 CFR 812.36.\n\nTruth Standard (""Gold"" Standard) - any medical procedure or laboratory method or combination of procedures and methods that the clinical community relies upon for diagnosis, that is accepted by FDA, and that is regarded as having negligible risk of either a false positive or a false negative result. The truth standard result should be definitive (positive/negative, present/absent, or diseased/non-diseased), and should not give an indeterminate result. As science and technology improve, newer, more reliable standards may replace previous standards, particularly in the case of new disease markers.\n\nVIII.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the ""Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies"" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: It is important to verify the data quality, integrity, and reliability of the BD evaluation. In principle, nonclinical BD studies that are not conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) are acceptable. However, when BD evaluation is performed as part of a GLP-compliant toxicology study, it is important that all in-life evaluations and sample collection procedures remain in compliance with GLP. Sample analysis for BD can be conducted in non-GLP manner.\n\nConsiderations specific to ex vivo genetically modified cell products are addressed in Section 5.4.\n\nTest Article\n\nThe test article administered in the nonclinical BD studies should be representative of the intended clinical GT product, taking into consideration the manufacturing process, important product characteristics (e.g., titre), and the final clinical formulation. In some situations, nonclinical BD data generated with a GT product consisting of the same vector intended for clinical use and a different therapeutic transgene or an expression marker gene (e.g., adeno-associated virus vector of the same serotype and promoter that directs expression of a fluorescent marker protein transgene) can be leveraged to support the BD profile (see Section 5.7).\n\nAnimal Species or Model\n\nBD assessment should be conducted in a biologically relevant animal species or model that supports transfer and expression of the genetic material (Note 1). Selection factors can include species differences in tissue tropism of the GT product, gene transfer efficiency, and transgene expression in target and non-target tissues/cells. If working with a replication competent viral vector, it is important that the animal species or model be permissive to vector replication.\n\nThe influence of species, sex, age, physiologic condition (e.g., healthy animal vs. animal disease model) on the BD profile can also be important. In addition, the potential for the animal species to mount an immune response against the administered vector and/or expression product should be considered (see Section 5.3).\n\nGroup Size and Sex of Animals\n\nAn appropriate number of animals per sex (as applicable) should be evaluated at each predetermined sampling time point to generate sufficient data that support comprehensive BD assessment (see Note 2). In keeping with the principles of the 3Rs, the total number of animals can be an aggregate from several studies. Justification should be provided for the number of animals evaluated at each time point, as well as the use of combined data from multiple studies, as applicable. Justification should also be provided when only one sex is evaluated.\n\nRoute of Administration and Dose Level Selection\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_S12_Step4_Guideline_2023_0314_WithCorrection_0'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the ""Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies"" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 16: 21 CFR 812.20(a)(4)(i); 21 CFR 56.103(a); 21 CFR 50.24\n\n(See also Question 10.)\n\nMay studies involving in vitro diagnostic devices be conducted under 21 CFR 50.24?\n\nYes. An in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) study may be conducted provided that it meets the requirements of 21 CFR 50.24. IVD studies falling within the scope of section 50.24 would include, for example, studies in which diagnosis of a life-threatening condition cannot be confirmed by an approved product or well-established procedure (e.g., research involving an investigational test for a neurotoxin that when inhaled or in contact with skin, can cause patients to become sick within minutes, and at high doses, to lose consciousness, develop seizures and die). The regulation\'s use of language usually associated with therapeutic products does not exclude IVDs because the administration of therapy in a life-threatening situation can depend upon a diagnostic intervention. Sponsors should contact FDA if they have questions as to whether a particular IVD study may be conducted under 21 CFR 50.24.\n\nWill FDA accept data from emergency research studies conducted at non-US sites?\n\nYes, provided appropriate regulatory requirements are satisfied. For drug/biological drug studies, if the non-U.S. sites are under an IND, all 21 CFR 50.24 requirements must be met, as well as other provisions of 21 CFR Part 312.\n\nIf the sites operate as non-IND sites, but the data are included in a marketing application, then 21 CFR 312.120 would apply. 21 CFR 312.120(a)(1)(i) ""does not require informed consent in life-threatening situations when the [International Ethics Committee] reviewing the study finds, before initiation of the study, that informed consent is not feasible and either that the conditions present are consistent with those described in SS50.23 or SS50.24(a)...or that the measures described in the study protocol or elsewhere will protect the rights, safety, and well-being of subjects..."" FDA will accept data from non-IND emergency research studies/sites provided the emergency research is conducted in accordance with both internationally accepted standards for good clinical practice (e.g., ICH E6) and applicable national laws.\n\nFor devices, under 21 CFR 814.15(b), FDA will accept foreign studies submitted in support of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application if the data are valid and the investigator has conducted the studies in conformance with the ""Declaration of Helsinki"" or the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever accords greater protection to the human subjects.\n\nNote that some countries\' laws may allow expedited appointment of legally acceptable representatives17 (e.g., judge, independent physician), who can provide consent, removing the need to waive informed consent. (See 21 CFR 312.120 and 814.15 for FDA\'s requirements for acceptance of data from non-US studies that are not conducted under an IND or IDE, respectively.)\n\nFootnote 17: FDA’s regulations define the term, “legally authorized representative” as “an individual or judicial or other body authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject to the subject’s participation in the procedure(s) involved in the research.” ICH E6 defines the term “legally acceptable representative” in almost identical language. See ICH E6, 1.37\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm073122.pdf).\n\n19. Must studies conducted under 21 CFR 50.24 be registered?\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA)18, Title VIII, Section 801 mandates that a ""responsible party"" (i.e., the sponsor or designated principal investigator) register an applicable clinical trial in the registry database, Clinicaltrials.gov,19 and defines an ""applicable clinical trial.""20 In addition, the statute describes the responsible party\'s obligation to report results of certain ""applicable clinical trials.""21 Results must be reported if the trial conducted under 21 CFR 50.24 meets the criteria for an ""applicable clinical trial"" as described at ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\nFootnote 18: U.S. Public Law 110-85\n\nFootnote 19: http://clinicaltrials.gov\n\nFootnote 20: http://grants.nih.gov/ClinicalTrials fdaaa/definitions.htm\n\nII. Qualifications for a study to be conducted under 21 CFR 50.24\n\n20. What conditions must be present for a study to be eligible to be conducted under 21 CFR 50.24?\n\nAll of the following conditions must be present:\n\nThe human subjects are in a life-threatening situation that necessitates urgent intervention;\n\nAvailable treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory (See also Questions 23, 24, and 25);\n\nCollection of valid scientific evidence is necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of the intervention;\n\nObtaining informed consent is not feasible because the subjects are not able to give their informed consent as a result of their medical condition;\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe intervention must be administered before consent can be obtained from the subject\'s legally authorized representative;\n\nThere is no reasonable way to identify prospectively individuals likely to become eligible for participation;\n\nParticipation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects (See also Question 21); and\n\nThe clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver (See also Question 29).\n\n(See Appendix A for the complete text of 21 CFR 50.24.)\n\n2.2.2 What is meant by ""prospect of direct benefit""?\n\nThe information from animal and preclinical studies, other clinical data (e.g., use of the product in another setting or for another diagnosis or in a different study population) or other evidence should support the potential for the investigational product to provide a direct benefit to the individual subjects.\n\nUnder 21 CFR 50.24(a)(3), the IRB must find and document that participation in an emergency research study holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects because\n\n(1) the subjects are in a life-threatening situation that necessitates intervention;\n\n(2) information from appropriate animal and other preclinical studies support the potential for the intervention to provide a direct benefit to the individual subjects; and\n\n(3) the risks associated with the investigation are reasonable in relation to what is known about the medical condition of the potential class of subjects, the risks and benefits of standard therapy, if any, and what is known about the risks and benefits of the proposed intervention or activity.\n\n2.2.3 Are trials with morbidity endpoints allowed under this regulation?\n\nTrials that have morbidity endpoints (e.g., multiple organ failure free days), rather than mortality endpoints, can meet the requirements of 21 CFR 50.24(a)(3) if the study is evaluating severe morbidity that is closely associated with mortality, and therefore clinically relevant. For example, patients with stroke or head injury are at risk of both death and severe disability. A study of an intervention to improve stroke outcome would always consider survival, but could also examine functional status, which might be the primary endpoint of the trial.22 Similarly, a study intended to improve treatment of status epilepticus, a life-threatening condition, might focus on reduced time to seizure control, a benefit likely to affect survival, even if the study itself is not large enough to show improved survival.\n\nFootnote 22: 61 Fed. Reg. 51508 (Comment #38)\n\nFDA recognizes that it may be important to obtain preliminary information on dose tolerability or effect on a critical biomarker (e.g., measurement of brain infarcted area, degree and extent of acidosis) before proceeding to a study that evaluates effectiveness. Considered from the point of view of the individual study subject, the study intervention could hold out the prospect of direct benefit even if the overall study were not large enough to prove this. Such a study would be acceptable only if it could not be done in subjects capable of consenting, and all the other requirements of 21 CFR 50.24 are satisfied. In suchcases, FDA would expect sponsors to provide a clear rationale for conducting these studies in non-consenting subjects.\n\nFDA will consider all proposed morbidity endpoints on a case-by-case basis. Early discussions with the appropriate FDA review divisions are encouraged.\n\nWhat is meant by ""available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory""?\n\n21 CFR 50.24(a)(1) requires IRBs to document that ""available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory..."" For studies involving drugs, FDA has interpreted the term ""available therapy"" to mean therapy that is specified in the approved labeling of regulated products, with only rare exceptions. For example, a treatment that is not FDA-regulated (e.g., surgery) or a drug that is not labeled for a specific use but which is nevertheless supported by compelling evidence in the medical literature23 may be considered an ""available treatment.""\n\nFootnote 23: See Guidance for Industry, “Available Therapy”\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126637.pdf ) issued July 2004, by CBER and CDER.\n\nFor studies conducted under 21 CFR 50.24, sponsors, investigators, and IRBs should consider the following:\n\nWhat is the current ""standard of care""?\n\nWhat treatments are available?\n\nAre available treatments (including standard of care treatments) ""unproven""? (See also Question 24)\n\nIf a product is not approved, but widely used, could a study be done to support approval?\n\nAre available treatments unsatisfactory, and if so, how? (See also Question 25)\n\nWhat is meant by ""unproven""?\n\nIn general, ""unproven"" means that there is not substantial evidence that a treatment is effective for the condition of interest. This may reflect the absence of any data or the absence of studies of acceptable quality. The term ""unproven therapy"" includes:\n--------------------\nContext title: Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors']","['Part 58 applies only to **nonclinical** laboratory studies, which are defined as in vivo or in vitro experiments in which test articles are studied prospectively in test systems under laboratory conditions to determine their safety.

The term does not include basic exploratory studies carried out to determine whether a test article has any potential utility or to determine physical or chemical characteristics of a test article (21 CFR 58.3(d)).\n\nMoreover, because the safety of IVDs is related to the accuracy of the result, most IVD studies that are intended to establish safety would necessarily use human specimens. As noted above, an IVD study using human specimens involves human subjects and thus is excluded from the definition of nonclinical laboratory studies. Such studies to establish safety are subject to 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 and 21 CFR Part 812 as applicable, dealing with human subject research, rather than to 21 CFR Part 58.']",0.0,0.2

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n--------------------\nContext: Answer: In addition to the names of the investigators, the names and addresses of all facilities that took part in the investigation are required, such as the investigational sites, laboratories, and specimen collection sites.34 Additionally, if study records are maintained at other locations, such as an investigator\'s office, the names and addresses of those locations must also be provided.35 If the location(s) of the records change, FDA should be notified. No additional information is needed to meet this requirement.\n\nFootnote 34: §3 FR 7366, see comment 29.\n\n(2) Investigator qualifications (Section 812.28(b)(2))\n\nHow may the sponsor or applicant meet this requirement?\n\nAnswer: In general, the information provided on investigator qualifications should be adequate to show that the investigator is qualified to serve as an investigator based on his or her training and experience specifically related to the clinical investigation.36\n\nFootnote 36: §3 FR 7366, see comment 30.\n\nSuch documentation generally includes a curriculum vitae or summary of training and experience. If this information is already included elsewhere within the application or submission, referencing the appropriate section within the application or submission is acceptable. For research involving novel technologies and/or the potential for increased risk of morbidity and/or mortality, the sponsor or applicant should include additional documentation identifying the clinical investigator\'s specific experience in this field (e.g., as demonstrated by recent presentations or publications) and with the test article.\n\nAdditionally, the GCP standard the sponsor or applicant follows may address information to maintain on investigator qualifications. See Section III.B.(3) below for further information.\n\n(3) Description of the research facilities (Section 812.28(b)(3))\n\nIs the name and address of the research facility a sufficient description to address this requirement?__Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAnswer: No, the name and address of the research facility is generally not a sufficient description to meet the requirement in 21 CFR 812.28(b)(3). Because FDA is generally less likely to be familiar with the research facilities in which OUS investigations are conducted, greater detail is usually needed. It would generally be adequate to identify and describe the academic medical center, hospital, physician\'s office, clinical research unit or other type of facility at which the investigation was conducted. The description should include enough information to enable FDA to determine the adequacy of the facilities to execute the investigation and meet its requirements (e.g., whether the site is appropriately staffed and equipped to conduct the investigation and is able to provide the appropriate emergent or specialized care, if required).37\n\nFootnote 37: 83 FR 7366, see comment 30.\n\nAdditionally, the GCP standard the sponsor or applicant follows may address information to maintain on investigator and research facility selection. For example, ISO 14155:2011 addresses verification and documentation of the qualifications of the principal investigator(s) and the adequacy of the research facility and the rationale for selecting the facility in sections 5.8, 9.2, and 9.3.\n\nThe investigator\'s qualifications and the description of the research facilities will also help us to assess the need for an onsite inspection.\n\n(4) Detailed summary of the protocol and results of the investigation, and if requested, case records or additional background data (Section 812.28(b)(4))\n\nWould a clinical investigation report satisfy the requirement to provide a detailed summary of the protocol and results of the investigation?\n\nAnswer: Yes, submitting an integrated, detailed clinical investigation report that includes a detailed summary of the protocol and results of the investigation would meet this requirement, although alternative approaches may also be acceptable. For example, if a sponsor or applicant chooses, FDA would accept the clinical investigation report as described in Annex D of ISO 14155:2011 as a detailed summary of the protocol and results of the investigation.38\n\nFootnote 38: 83 FR 7366, see comment 31.\n\nA detailed clinical investigation report is commonly submitted for clinical investigations that contribute to the evaluation of the safety or effectiveness of the device for the proposed indication or that otherwise support information included in proposed labeling for the product. Sponsors and applicants are reminded that, even if they submit such a detailed clinical investigation report, they must also submit any additional information that is required elsewhere in 21 CFR parts 807, 812 or 814.\n\nWill FDA need access to case records maintained by the investigator or additional background data such as hospital or other institutional records?\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:13]\n\n(6) Discussion demonstrating that the data and information constitute valid scientific evidence (Section 812.28(b)(6))\n\nWhat data and information constitute valid scientific evidence under 21 CFR 860.7?\n\nAnswer: Adherence to GCP standards alone does not ensure that the data collected constitute valid scientific evidence. As defined in 21 CFR 860.7, valid scientific evidence is evidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience with a marketed device, from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device under its conditions of use. The evidence required may vary according to the characteristics of the device, its conditions of use, the existence and adequacy of warnings and other restrictions, and the extent of experience with its use. Isolated case reports, random experience, reports lacking sufficient details to permit scientific evaluation, and unsubstantiated opinions are not regarded as valid scientific evidence to show safety or effectiveness.49 Note: the sponsor or applicant should also explain how the OUS data are applicable to the US population and US medical practice.50\n\nFootnote 49: 21 CFR 860.7(c)(2).\n\nFootnote 50: Under 21 CFR 814.15, if a PMA application is based solely on OUS clinical data, the application may be approved if, among other criteria, the OUS clinical data are applicable to the US population and US medical practice.\n\n(7) The name and address of the IEC that reviewed the investigation and a statement that the IEC meets the definition in section 812.3(t) (Section 812.28(b)(7))\n\nWhat does FDA consider an ""adequately constituted"" IEC?\n\nAnswer: FDA regulations at 21 CFR 812.3(t) define an IEC as ""an independent review panel that is responsible for ensuring the protection of the rights, safety, and well-being of subjects involved in a clinical investigation and is adequately constituted to ensure that protection."" FDA believes an ""adequately constituted"" IEC is one that consists of a reasonable number of members who collectively have the qualifications and experience to review and evaluate the science, medical aspects and ethics of the proposed clinical investigation.\n\nFDA recommends that every nondiscriminatory effort be made to ensure that the IEC composition is not limited to only one gender and that it reflects the social and cultural diversity of the community(ies) from which research participants are most likely to be drawn.51 It is further advised that only those members who are independent of the investigator and the sponsor of the investigation vote on investigation-related matters.52 FDA recognizes that the organization and membership of IECs may differ among countries because of the local needs ofthe host country. Such variation is acceptable as long as the IEC can ensure the protection of the rights, safety, and well-being of human subjects involved in the clinical investigation.\n\nHow may the sponsor or applicant meet the requirement to provide a statement that the IEC meets the definition in section 812.3(t)?\n\nAnswer: The sponsor or applicant is required by 21 CFR 812.28(b)(7) to provide the name and address of the IEC that reviewed the investigation and a statement that the IEC meets the definition in 21 CFR 812.3(t). As stated in the preamble, in addition to the sponsor or applicant, it would be acceptable for the IEC to submit a statement that the IEC that reviewed the investigation meets the definition of an IEC in the rule.53\n\nSponsors and applicants may also consider a waiver request, as described in Section III.C, if they are unable to provide a statement that the IEC meets the definition in section 812.3(t). A waiver request could identify, as an alternative to the statement that the IEC meets the definition in section 812.3(t), a statement that the IEC is organized and operates according to the applicable laws and regulations of the country where it operates and provide a description of the laws and regulations under which the IEC is organized and operates.54 FDA will decide whether to grant or deny a waiver on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all appropriate circumstances.\n\nHow may the sponsor or applicant meet the requirement to maintain information to support the statement required by section 812.28(b)(7) that the IEC meets the definition in section 812.3(t)?\n--------------------\nContext title: Acceptance of Clinical Data to Support Medical Device Applications and Submissions- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsor\n\nFor studies conducted under an IND, 21 CFR part 312 provides that a sponsor is responsible for obtaining a commitment from each investigator that he or she will ensure that requirements in part 56 relating to IRB review and approval are met with respect to the research conducted by the investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d)). Sponsors can also initiate plans for use of a centralized IRB review process and facilitate agreements and other necessary communications among the parties involved.\n\n3.1.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.1.2 Investigator\n\nUnder 21 CFR part 312, an investigator is responsible for ensuring that there will be initial and continuing review by a qualified IRB of research conducted by that investigator (21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vi)(d); 312.66). If the investigator is conducting clinical research as part of a multicenter study at an institution with its own IRB and is subject to the policies of that institution, those policies would dictate how the investigator will ensure IRB review. Those policies may provide that the investigator\'s responsibility can be met by ensuring review through a centralized IRB review, through the institution\'s IRB, or through apportionment of IRB review responsibilities between a centralized IRB and the institution\'s IRB.\n\nCentral IRB\n\nFor multicenter studies, the central IRB is the IRB that conducts reviews on behalf of all study sites that agree to participate in the centralized review process. For sites at institutions that have an IRB that would ordinarily review research conducted at the site, the central IRB should reach agreement with the individual institutions participating in centralized review and those institutions\' IRBs about how to apportion the review responsibilities between local IRBs and the central IRB (21 CFR 56.114).\n\nIV Addressing Local Aspects of IRB Review\n\nThe implementation of a centralized IRB review process involves addressing a number of issues related to the communities where the research will take place. The requirements for IRB membership in 21 CFR 56.107(a) specify that the membership of an IRB must have sufficient experience, expertise, and diversity to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. This requirement was intended to implement a recommendation of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research that IRB members be ""men and women of diverse backgrounds and sufficient maturity, experience, and competence to assure that the Board will be able to discharge its responsibilities and that its determinations will be accorded respect by investigators and the community served by the institution or in which it is located.""1 In addition, IRB members must ""be able to ascertain the acceptability of the proposed research in terms of institutional commitments and regulations, applicable law, and standards or professional conduct and practice"" (21 CFR 56.107(a)). Thus, IRB review, through its membership, is intended to provide meaningful consideration of various local factors in assessing research activities, including the cultural backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, educational level, religious affiliations) of the population from which research subjects will be drawn, community attitudes10 about the nature\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nof the proposed research, and the capacity of the institution to conduct or support the proposed research. Inter-community differences could influence, among other things, assessments of whether mechanisms of subject selection will be equitable, whether adequate provision is made to minimize risks to vulnerable populations, and the adequacy of the informed consent process.\n\nThe preamble to the final rule indicates that where a centralized IRB review process is used (21 CFR 56.114), the review should consider the ethical standards of the local community.11 Therefore, a centralized IRB review process should include mechanisms to ensure meaningful consideration of these relevant local factors. Possible mechanisms include:\n\nFootnote 11: Federal Register, Vol. 46, p. 8966, January 27, 1981\n\nProvision of relevant local information to the central IRB in writing by individuals or organizations familiar with the local community, institution, and/or clinical research\n\nParticipation of consultants with relevant expertise, or IRB members from the institution\'s own IRB, in the deliberations of the central IRB\n\nLimited review of a central IRB-reviewed study by the institution\'s own IRB, with that limited review focusing on issues that are of concern to the local community\n\nOther mechanisms may also be appropriate.12 IRB meeting minutes or other records should document how relevant community issues were considered in the review (21 CFR 56.115(a)) (see section 5).\n\nFootnote 12: Guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) (IRB Knowledge of Local Research Context) discusses mechanisms for ensuring adequate consideration of local factors by IRBs in review of clinical research that is supported by DHHS funding. Although the guidance applies only to DHHS funded research, it may be also helpful to off-site IRBs seeking to provide meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for non-DHHS funded clinical research.\n\n5 IRB Records -- Documenting Agreements and Procedures\n\nIRBs and institutions are required to prepare and maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities (21 CFR 56.115(a)). IRBs are also required to follow written procedures for the conduct of initial and continuing review of clinical research and for reporting their findings and actions to the investigator and the institution (21 CFR section 56.108(a), 56.115(a)(6)). The following recommendations should help IRBs fulfill these requirements.\n\nDocumenting Agreements\n\nIf an institution, its IRB, and a central IRB agree (under 21 CFR 56.114) to participate in a centralized IRB review process, they should document that action in an agreement signed by the parties. IRBs should report this action to the investigator and the institution, for example, by providing copies of the agreement to the investigator, and the institution.13 If the agreement\n\n3.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApportions IRB review responsibilities between a central IRB and the institution\'s IRB, the agreement should delineate the specific responsibilities of the central IRB and the institution\'s IRB for the initial and continuing review of the study.\n\nWritten Procedures\n\nWhen an institution and an institution\'s IRB rely on review by a central IRB, both IRBs must have written procedures in place to implement the centralized IRB review process (21 CFR 56.108, 56.114). For example, procedures should address the following:\n\nHow the institution\'s IRB determines that the central IRB is qualified to review research conducted at the institution\n\nHow the central IRB intends to communicate with relevant institutions, the institutions\' IRBs, and investigators regarding its review\n\nHow the central IRB ensures that it provides meaningful consideration of relevant local factors for communities from which research subjects will be drawn (see Section 4)\n\nHow the central IRB assesses the ability of a geographically remote site to participate in a study (e.g., whether the site has medical services appropriate to the complexity of the study)\n\nWhen an institution, an institution\'s IRB, and a central IRB agree to apportion IRB review responsibilities between the two IRBs, each IRB must have written procedures describing how it implements its responsibilities under the agreement (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)).\n\nVI Using a Central IRB at Unaffiliated Sites\n\nAt clinical sites that are not already affiliated with an IRB, investigators and sponsors typically rely on the review and oversight of a central IRB. In this situation, the central IRB should document in meeting minutes or other records how it considered relevant local factors for the various communities from which research subjects are to be drawn (see Section 4). The central IRB must also document its action in agreeing to conduct IRB review for the site (21 CFR 56.115) and must have written procedures in place that describe how it will perform its initial and continuing review responsibilities at remote sites (21 CFR 56.108, 56.115(a)(6)) (see Section 5).\n\nVII Examples of Cooperative IRB Review Models\n\nThere are a variety of mechanisms that have been used to distribute IRB review responsibilities between an institution\'s IRB and a central IRB. This guidance is not intended to endorse any particular mechanism. These examples are provided only to illustrate possible mechanisms.\n\nTrial in Which Multiple Sites Rely on a Central IRB\n\nThe primary model contemplated by this guidance is a centralized IRB review process used for a single multicenter trial performed by a commercial or publicly funded sponsor. Under 21 CFR 56.114, IRBs affiliated with the study sites could enter into agreements with a central IRB to rely on all or some of the review findings of the central IRB, or could decline to participate in a centralized IRB review (i.e., do their own complete review). Study sites not already affiliated with an IRB would rely on a central IRB for all IRB review responsibilities.\n\nCentral IRB Formed to Review Multicenter Trials in a Therapeutic Category\n--------------------\nContext title: Using a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials Guidance for Industry'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n--------------------\nContext: Do individuals who are listed in Section #6 on the 1572 have to submit information about their financial interests?\n\nYes. Under 21 CFR Part 54 (Disclosure of Financial Interests by Clinical Investigators), a person listed or identified as an investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects must submit financial disclosure information to the sponsor. For purposes of this financial disclosure regulation, the term investigator also includes the spouse and each dependent child of the investigator and subinvestigator. (21 CFR 54.2(d) and 54.4). For additional information about financial disclosure, see FDA's Guidance for Industry Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators (http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126832.htm)VIII Section #7: Name and Code Number, If Any, of the Protocol(s) in the Ind for Study(ies) to be Conducted by the Investigator\n\n36. What information should be included in this section?\n\nList the name and code number (if any) of all the protocols under the IND that will be conducted by the investigator signing the 1572. A code number is an identifying number assigned by the sponsor.\n\nAs a reminder, some investigators may be responsible for submitting certain clinical trial information to the National Institutes of Health clinical trials data bank under 42 U.S.C. 282(j), 402(j) of the Public Health Service Act. Although not all investigators will be expected to meet this requirement, go to www.clinicaltrials.gov for further information about potential responsibilities.\n\nIX Section #8: Clinical Protocol Information\n\n37. How should Section #8 be completed for a phase 4 study?\n\nPhase 4 refers to the timing of a clinical study (i.e., postmarketing) rather than the characteristics of the study, which are described under 21 CFR 312.21, Phases of an investigation. A postmarketing clinical trial would meet the description of a phase 2 or 3 investigation and a full protocol would be submitted. The investigator does not need to mark either of the boxes in Section #8, but should identify in Section #7 that the study is a phase 4 study.\n\n38. Can an investigator submit the study protocol instead of an outline of the study protocol?\n\nYes. The protocol or a detailed description is required for any phase 2 or 3 clinical trial. Phase 1 studies can be supported by an outline (see 21 CFR 312.53).\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions – Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572) Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs""

Inspections (21 CFR 812.145)\n\nInvestigators are required to permit FDA to inspect and copy any records pertaining to the investigation including, in certain situations, those which identify subjects.\n\n5. Submitting Reports (21 CFR 812.150)\n\nAn investigator shall prepare and submit the following complete, accurate, and timely reports:\n\na. To the sponsor and the IRB:\n\n(1) Any unanticipated adverse device effect occurring during an\n\ninvestigation. (Due no later than 10 working days after the investigator first learns of the effect.)\n\n(2) Progress reports on the investigation. (These reports must be provided at regular intervals, but in no event\n\nless often than yearly. If there is a study monitor, a copy of the report should also be sent to the monitor.)(3) Any deviation from the investigational plan made to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency. (Report is due as soon as possible but no later than 5 working days after the emergency occurs. Except in emergency situations, a protocol deviation requires prior sponsor approval; and if the deviation may affect the scientific soundness of the plan or the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects, prior FDA and IRB approval are required.)\n\n(4) Any use of the device without obtaining informed consent. (Due within 5 working days after such use.)\n\n(5) A final report. (Due within 3 months following termination or completion of the investigation or the investigator\'s part of the investigation. For additional guidance, see the discussion under the section entitled ""Annual Progress Reports and Final Reports."")\n\n(6) Any further information requested by FDA or the IRB about any aspect of the investigation.\n\nb. To the Sponsor:\n\n(1) Withdrawal of IRB approval of the investigator\'s part of an investigation. (Due within 5 working days of such action).\n\n6. Investigational Device Distribution and Tracking\n\nThe IDE regulations prohibit an investigator from providing an investigational device to any person not authorized to receive it (21 CFR 812.110(c)). The best strategy for reducing the risk that an investigational device could be improperly dispensed (whether purposely or inadvertently) is for the sponsor and the investigators to closely monitor the shipping, use, and final disposal of the device(s). Upon completion or termination of a clinical investigation (or the investigator\'s part of an investigation), or at the sponsor\'s request, an investigator is required to return to the sponsor any remaining supply of the device or otherwise to dispose of the device as the sponsor directs (21 CFR 812.110(e)). Investigators must also maintain complete, current and accurate records of the receipt, use, or disposition of investigational devices (21 CFR 812.140(a)(2)). Specific investigator recordkeeping requirements are set forth at 21 CFR 812.140(a).\n\n7. Prohibition of Promotion and Other Practices (21 CFR 812.7)\n\nThe IDE regulations prohibit the promotion and commercialization of a device that has not been first cleared or approved for marketing by FDA. This prohibition is applicable to sponsors and investigators (or any person acting on behalf of a sponsor or investigator), and encompasses the following activities:\n\na. Promotion or test marketing of the investigational device\n\nb. Charging subjects or investigators for the device a price larger than is necessary to recover the costs of manufacture, research, development, and handling c. Unduly prolonging an investigation beyond the point needed to collect data required to determine whether the device is safe and effective, and d. Representing that the device is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is being investigated.\n8. Annual Progress Reports and Final Reports\n\nThe IDE regulations do not specify the content of the annual progress or final reports. With respect to reports to the IRB, the IRB itself may specify what information it wishes to be included in these reports. Because FDA does require the information listed below, it is suggested that, at a minimum, the annual progress and final reports to the sponsor and the IRB also include the following items:\n\na. IDE number\n\nb. Device name\n\nc. Indications for use\n\nd. Brief summary of study progress in relation to investigational plan\n\ne. Number of investigators and investigational sites\n\nf.

Do I need an IND if my study uses a home-made version of a lawfully marketed drug?\n\nSome investigators, or research pharmacies affiliated with the institution in which an investigator is conducting a study, compound their own versions of lawfully marketed drug products for use in clinical studies. For example, FDA is aware of instances in which the methacholine used in respiratory studies for challenge purposes has been prepared locally from raw materials obtained from a chemical supply company. Studies that use a drug product that is prepared from raw materials in place of the approved, finished product marketed by the manufacturer must be conducted under an IND (21 CFR part 312). These studies cannot meet the criteria for an exemption from the IND requirements for marketed drugs (SS 312.2(b)) because the drug product manufactured by the investigator or research pharmacy is not considered to be the lawfully marketed drug.\n\n11. Do I need an IND if my study enrolls only a small number of subjects?\n\nThe number of subjects enrolled has no bearing on whether the study is subject to the IND regulations. The definition of clinical investigation specifically includes studies with as few as one subject (see section III.B).\n\n12 Do I need an IND if my study enrolls only healthy volunteers?\n\nThe clinical condition of study subjects (e.g., the presence or absence of disease) has no bearing on whether the study is subject to the IND requirements in part 312. The definition of clinical investigation refers only to subjects involved in an experiment. It makes no distinction between healthy subjects or those with a disease (see section III.B).\n\nVIII Process for addressing novelties concerning the application of the IND requirements\n\nThe sponsor (or sponsor-investigator of an individual investigator-initiated study) should, in most cases, be able to determine whether the IND regulations apply to a planned clinical investigation as required under 21 CFR 312.2(a). If a sponsor is uncertain, however, we recommend that the sponsor contact the appropriate review division (i.e., for the therapeutic area being studied) in the appropriate FDA center for advice about whether the IND regulations apply (21 CFR 312.2(e)). For products regulated by CDER, an inquiry concerning the application of the IND regulations should be directed to the Chief, Project Management Staff, in the appropriate CDER review division. For products regulated by CBER, the inquiry should be directed to the applications division of the appropriate review Office.\n\nOrganizational charts listing the CDER review divisions and their telephone numbers are available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OrganizationCharts/ucm135674.htm.\n\nOrganizational charts listing the CBER review divisions and their telephone numbers are available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/_OrganizationCharts/ucm135943.htm.\n\nIf the relevant review division is not known, we recommend the sponsor contact CDER's Division of Drug Information (druginfo@fda.hhs.gov) or CBER's Division of Manufacturer's Assistance and Training (matt@cber.fda.gov), Office of Communication, Outreach and Development (both addresses and telephone numbers are provided on the second title page of this guidance).\n\nFDA will categorize inquiries concerning the application of the IND regulations as either informal or formal based on the following factors:\n\nThe medium in which the inquiry is received\n\nThe relative complexity of the inquiry\n\nThe type of response requested by the inquirer or given by FDA\n\nInformal inquiries have the following features:\n\nThey can be communicated either orally or in writing (written communication includes email, fax, or other written correspondence).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:22]\n\nAppendix\n\nOther Guidances that May Be Relevant to Questions Concerning\n\nthe Application of the IND Requirements\n\nFDA has issued guidances in related areas.

As commonly used, the term is meant to indicate that each co-investigator is fully responsible for fulfilling all of the obligations of an investigator as identified in 21 CFR 312.60. Thus under 21 CFR 312.3(b), each co-investigator is an investigator, and as such must sign a separate 1572.\n\nIn some situations, it is preferable to have more than one investigator responsible for a clinical investigation. For example, when a study is conducted at multiple research facilities that are not in close proximity, FDA expects an investigator who has signed a 1572 to be available at each location to either personally conduct or supervise the study. This responsibility cannot be delegated to a subinvestigator.\n\nAlthough not necessary, it is acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site. For example, the conduct and supervision of a large investigation with many subjects or complicated procedures might be shared among several investigators, each of whom has signed a 1572 when the investigation is conducted under an IND.

The information and data to demonstrate comparability of the product pre- and post- change can include a combination of testing, validation studies, and non-clinical or clinical studies as necessary to evaluate potential effects of the change. Knowledge and experience accumulated during development and commercial manufacturing regarding how product performance relates to material attributes and process parameters is useful in assessing the impact of manufacturing changes (Ref. 8).\n\nWhen assessing the impact of a change on product quality, some or all of the following considerations should be taken into account by the applicant:\n\nPrior knowledge (e.g., established chemical and biological engineering principles; published, peer-reviewed scientific and technical literature; and applied manufacturing experience) (Ref. 9);\n\nDevelopment and manufacturing of the drug substance and drug product11 (Ref. 10); Footnote 11: For the purposes of this document, “Drug Substance” also refers to “In vitro Substance.”\n\nProcess validation activities and experience gained during commercial manufacture;\n\nQuality risk management activities;\n\nStudies conducted at less than commercial scale to gain an increased understanding of the effects of the change on product quality and process consistency; and\n\nCumulative impact of multiple related changes.\n\nAn integral component in successfully implementing any manufacturing change is an effectively-designed and effectively-managed change management process (Ref. 8). This requires an effective multidisciplinary team to implement the change and to evaluate the potential effects of the change on the product. Implementation of a change also requires oversight by the manufacturer's Quality Control Unit and includes the studies and data that support the change approved by the applicant.\n\nThe applicant may choose to take advantage of opportunities to reduce the potential risks associated with implementing a manufacturing change. The development of robust manufacturing processes12 and process controls that utilize innovative approaches to process validation and analytical testing provides an important component for the manufacture of high-quality products and may mitigate the risks associated with manufacturing changes. Product and process knowledge and understanding gained during development and commercial manufacturing provide a foundation for an informed change management process (Refs. 8 and 10). Thoroughly characterized products, processes, and components can provide meaningful acceptance criteria and limits that assist in evaluating the potential impact of the change and reduce the risk of an unintended outcome occurring because of a manufacturing change.\n\nFootnote 12: Process robustness is defined as an ability of a process to tolerate variability of materials and changes of the process and equipment without a negative impact on quality (Ref. 10).\n\nAn effective quality risk management system can enable the applicant to make informed decisions regarding manufacturing changes and can permit the FDA to have greater confidence regarding the applicant's ability to assure product quality and process consistency while continuously monitoring, verifying, and, as appropriate, acting upon identified risks (Ref. 3). Conducting and submitting to the FDA formal or informal risk assessments in support of a post-approval manufacturing change can allow the FDA to conduct a more effective assessment of the impact of a change, thereby facilitating timely review and decision.\n\n2 FDA Assessment of Change\n\nBased upon an initial assessment of the submission by the Agency, the applicant may be notified that the manufacturing change falls into a higher or lower reporting category than was proposed by the applicant. In those cases, the applicant must comply with the distribution requirements associated with the new reporting category (21 CFR 601.12(a)(2)).\n\nIn some circumstances, the applicant may request an expedited review of a PAS for public health reasons or if a delay in making the described change would impose an extraordinary hardship on the applicant.13 This expedited approach is not intended to compensate for an ineffective change management process by the applicant, but should be requested in situations that warrant its use, such as unexpected circumstances or product shortage.14\n\nFootnote 13: 21 CFR 601.12(b)(4).\n\nFootnote 14: If the applicant is requesting an expedited review due to potential product shortage, for public health reasons, or for other extraordinary hardship reasons, the applicant should mark the supplement and cover letter with “Prior Approval Supplement – Expedited Review Requested.” In the case of a potential drug shortage, the applicant should also notify the FDA Drug Shortage Staff or the CBER Product Shortage Coordinator.\n\nFor most supplements, the CGMP status of the manufacturer's applicable product(s) and establishment(s) must be determined before the Agency renders a final decision regarding the approvability of a supplement (21 CFR 601.20).\n\nCompliance with the CGMP regulations and statutory requirements are requiredregardless of how the change is reported to the Agency. Moreover, it is incumbent upon the applicant to ensure that contract manufacturing and testing sites have a satisfactory CGMP status for the type of operation involved. CGMP requirements include establishing and following appropriate written procedures reviewed and approved by the Quality Control Unit, qualifying equipment as suitable for its intended use, using validated test methods, and ensuring the manufacturing process is under control.15 When deemed necessary, the Agency may conduct an inspection as part of the complete review of a submission supporting the change.16\n\nFootnote 15: 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211.\n\nFootnote 16: The authority for FDA to conduct establishment inspections is included in both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act. Under section 351(c) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 262(c)) and section 704 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 374), the FDA has authority to inspect any establishment where biological products are manufactured.\n\nSubmission of Changes to FDA\n\nThe applicant should prominently label each submission with the reporting category under which the change is being reported, provide a description of the change, as well as data to demonstrate comparability of pre-change and post-change intermediates, drug substance, and/or drug products, as appropriate, for the type of change and the reporting category. Refer to the guidances for industry on chemistry, manufacturing and controls information for specific product class content information to consider in evaluating and submitting information (Refs. [11] through [14]), where applicable/available.\n\nA submission describing the change(s) should contain all the required and expected information (i.e., descriptive narrative and appropriate data) to support the approval of the change(s) in the submission. The submission should be well organized to facilitate timely review by the FDA (Ref. [15]).\n\nAn applicant is to include the following information in any supplement (PAS, CBE30, or CBE)17:\n\nFootnote 17: Itemized information must be provided in all supplements under 21 CFR 601.12(b) and (c). This paragraph does not apply to CBE supplements for certain types of labeling changes submitted under 21 CFR 601.12(f)(2).\n\nA detailed description of, including a rationale for, the change;\n\nThe product(s) involved18; Footnote 18: “Product(s) involved” means the licensed product(s) affected by the change being described in the supplement. Information about product(s) that are not covered by the BLA in question should be provided in the submission only if introduction of a new product into the manufacturing facility may affect the quality of a licensed product.\n\nThe manufacturing site(s) or area(s) affected;\n\nA description of the method(s) used, and studies performed to evaluate the effects of the change on the product quality, and data derived from these studies;\n\nRelevant validation protocols and data; and\n\nA reference list of relevant standard operating procedures (SOPs).\n\nAn applicant is to include the following information in an Annual Report19:\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA list of all products involved in the change;\n\nA full description of and rationale for the implemented changes including:\n\nthe manufacturing site(s) or area(s) involved;\n\nthe date the change was implemented;\n\na cross-reference to relevant validation protocols and/or SOPs;\n\nrelevant data from studies and tests performed to evaluate the effects of the change on product quality;20 and\n\nA statement by the holder of the approved application or license that the effects of the change have been assessed.\n\nFootnote 20: For some minor changes, summary of data or risk assessment may be provided, with full data being available upon request.\n\nComparability Protocols\n--------------------\nContext title: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved Application- Certain Biological Products Guidance for Industry""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: Changes to disposable manufacturing materials for nonapplication products, including nonprescription drug products, should be documented under the pharmaceutical quality system15 and must be approved by the quality unit.16\n\nFootnote 14: 21 CFR 211.22\n\nFootnote 15: See footnote 13.\n\nFootnote 16: See footnote 14.\n\nIII Questions and Answers\n\nThe following questions and answers provide information about making changes to disposable manufacturing materials.\n\nQ1: What are some possible changes an applicant can make to disposable manufacturing materials and what reporting categories are applicable?\n\nA1: Changes to disposable manufacturing materials can include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) changing suppliers, with or without a change in product-contacting material; (2) using similar materials that differ in composition or design; (3) reducing the number of materials used or extending the use of materials in manufacturing by increasing throughput; and (4) reusing a disposable manufacturing material. Current guidances for industry provide examples of relevant changes and corresponding reporting categories.17 Refer to Appendix A and Appendix B of this guidance for a summary of examples. These examples are not intended to be comprehensive.\n\nFootnote 17: See footnote 5-11.\n\nFactors to be considered when assessing risks to product quality and determining the reporting category for the change include the following: (1) intended use of the disposable manufacturing material in the manufacturing process; (2) whether a disposable manufacturing material is used upstream or downstream; (3) use of redundant steps within the manufacturing process; (4) enhanced product and process knowledge gained since application approval; (5) whether in-process and release/stability controls meet current regulations for detecting differences in product quality attributes; and (6) the extent of existing validation data.\n\nFor approved BLAs, NDAs, ANDAs, NADAs, and ANADAs, applicants should consider factors such as those described above to determine the potential scope and risk to product quality of the proposed change (i.e., major, moderate, or minor), considering the specific product and/or process affected by the change to disposable manufacturing material. The outcome of this assessment, in conjunction with regulations and guidances for CMC changes, can help determine which reporting category is appropriate for a proposed change. Changes that require an application supplement should be filed at the appropriate reporting category, commensurate with the level of risk to product quality. Additionally, as described in the FDA ICH guidance for industry Q9 Quality Risk Management(June 2006), the robustness of the data submitted in support of such a supplement should be commensurate with the level of risk to product and process. For a description of major, moderate, and minor changes, see 21 CFR SSSS 601.12 (BLAs), 314.70 (NDAs), 314.97 (ANDAs), and 514.8 (NADAs and ANAADAs). For elaboration on the potential risk to product quality for different changes to disposable manufacturing materials, including high-risk changes that could potentially affect critical quality attributes such as product sterility, see Appendix A and Appendix B of this guidance. Applicants should review the FDA ICH guidance for industry Q12 Technical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmaceutical Product Lifecycle Management(May 2021) and the draft guidance for industry ICH Q12: Implementation Considerations for FDA-Regulated Products(May 2021)18 for risk-based tools to facilitate streamlined change implementation.\n\nFootnote 18: When final, this guidance will represent the FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nQ2: Are there steps to lower the reporting category of a supplement?\n\nA2: A comparability protocol (CP) could be used as a tool for making changes to disposable manufacturing materials because a change to one material can be implemented to many products. As described in the guidance for industry Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs(April 2016) and draft guidance for industry Comparability Protocols for Human Drugs and Biologics: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information(April 2016),19 a CP is a comprehensive, prospectively written plan for assessing the effect of a proposed CMC postapproval change on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a drug product or a biological product.20\n\nFootnote 19: When final, this guidance will represent the FDA’s current thinking on this topic.\n\nFootnote 20: Additional information specific to biological products can be found in the FDA ICH guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process(June 2005).\n\nApplicants can use a CP to obtain feedback from FDA on prospective scientific approaches submitted as part of an original application or PAS to facilitate expeditious implementation of postapproval changes. CPs allow FDA to review a description of one or more proposed CMC postapproval changes covering approved products at one or more manufacturing establishments, supporting information (including any developmental batch data, analysis and risk assessment activities), the plan for implementing the change(s), and, if appropriate, a proposed reduced reporting category. If the original application or PAS containing the CP is approved, the change can be implemented under a lower reporting category than would ordinarily be expected based on current guidances for industry (e.g., changes otherwise requiring a PAS could be implemented under a CBE-30).\n\nAn approved CP can be used for a one-time change or be used repeatedly for a specified type of change over the lifecycle of a product. A CP can also be submitted to cover an identical change that affects multiple applications (e.g., grouped supplements, trans-BLA submissions). A CP is the same as a Postapproval Change Management Protocol as described in the FDA ICH guidance for industry Q12 Technical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmaceutical Product Lifecycle Management (May 2021).\n\nThe use of CPs can be limited for certain changes (e.g., major changes), where a reduced reporting category is not adequate or appropriate to ensure product quality and patient safety. Examples of such circumstances include insufficient understanding of the effect of the change on the product or process; when the CGMP compliance status of an establishment at the time of change impacts the reporting category; or whether data from nonclinical safety, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, or safety and efficacy studies are needed to evaluate the effect of changes on product quality. Even if a reduced reporting category is not justified, FDA can implement flexible assessment practices, such as expediting assessment of supplements, when warranted.21, 22, 23, 24\n\nFootnote 21: For FDA policies describing expedited review requests related to prior approval supplements for NDAs and BLAs, see 21 CFR 314.70(b)(4) and 601.12(b)(4). See also CDER Manual of Policies and Procedures (MAPP) 5310.3 Rev. 2: Requests for Expedited Review of New Drug Application and Biologics License Application Prior Approval Supplements Submitted for Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes (April 2021).\n\nQ3: When and how should an applicant contact FDA for feedback on a proposed change?\n\nA3: Applicants should review existing regulations and guidances for industry to determine the appropriate reporting category for a proposed change. Because the examples in guidances are not comprehensive and may not address novel situations, applicants should contact FDA for feedback on a proposed change, especially before submitting a supplement with a lower reporting category than what is required in existing regulations or recommended in existing guidance. FDA intends to provide timely assessment of and feedback on these types of proposed changes to meet urgent public health needs.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen contacting FDA about initiating changes to disposable manufacturing materials, the applicant should be ready to provide relevant information, including: (1) any affected products and processes; (2) proposed changes to mitigate effects of the component shortage on product quality and supply; (3) involvement of other products and/or manufacturing establishments (including contract manufacturing organizations); and (4) any information related to potential or actual drug shortage concerns. BLA, NDA, NADA, and ANADA applicants who want to request a meeting with FDA to discuss a particular product or application should contact the appropriate review team.25\n\nAppendix A\n\nThe following are examples of potentially relevant changes1 and corresponding reporting categories for a new drug application (NDA), abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), new animal drug application (NADA), and abbreviated new animal drug application (ANADA) products. Note: this does not include biologics license application (BLA) products. These examples come from the following guidances for industry: Changes to an Approved NDA or\n\nFootnote 1: For the examples listed in Appendix A, the term “change” refers to a change in a disposable manufacturing material or a change to a manufacturing process or process parameter that reduces the amount of a disposable manufacturing material needed to complete that process.\n\nANDA: Questions and Answers (January 2001), Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA (April 2004), Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Changes to Approved NADA/ANADA (May 2007), and CMC Postapproval Manufacturing Changes to be Documented in Annual Reports (March 2014).\n\nPrior Approval Supplement:\n\nChange from sterile filtration to moist heat sterilization for products containing heat-stable active pharmaceutical ingredients.\n--------------------\nContext title: Changes to Disposable Manufacturing Materials- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: Supplement-Changes Being Effected\n\nNo changes have been identified.\n\nMinor Changes (Annual Report)\n\nThe following are examples of changes considered to have a minimal potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a drug as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug.\n\n11 Contains Non-Binding Recommendations\n\nAn extension of an expiration dating period based on full shelf-life data on production batches obtained under a protocol approved in the application (21 CFR 514.8(b)(4)(ii)(F)).\n\nAddition of time points to the stability protocol or deletion of time points beyond the approved expiration dating period.\n\nA change from previously approved stability storage conditions to storage conditions recommended in Veterinary International Conference on Harmonization (VICH) guidances.\n\nNon-USP reference standards: * Replacement of an in-house reference standard according to procedures in an approved application. * Tightening of acceptance criteria for existing reference standards to provide greater assurance of drug product purity and potency.\n\nSubmitting updated stability data generated on commercial or production batches under an approved stability protocol or commitment (21 CFR 514.8(b)(4)(iii)(I)).\n\n12 Multiple Related Changes\n\nMultiple related changes involve various combinations of individual changes. For example, a site change also may involve equipment and manufacturing process changes, or a component and composition change may necessitate a change in a specification. For multiple related changes, where the recommended reporting categories for the individual changes differ, CVM recommends that the submission be in accordance with the most restrictive of the reporting categories recommended for the individual changes. When the multiple related changes all have the same recommended reporting category, CVM recommends that the submission be in accordance with the reporting category for the individual changes.\n\n4 Attachment A: Type of Operation and CGMP Inspections\n\nSection VI states that a change to a different manufacturing site should be submitted in a prior approval supplement when (1) the new manufacturing site has never been inspected by FDA for the type of operation being moved, (2) the move results in a restart of a type of operation that has been discontinued for more than two years at the new manufacturing site, or (3) the new manufacturing site does not have a satisfactory current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) inspection for the type of operation being moved.\n\nA profile class system is used by FDA to assist in (1) managing the CGMP inspection process, (2) evaluating the findings and the compliance follow-up needed, and (3) communicating the results of inspections. A profile class can relate to the manufacture of a particular dosage form (e.g., large volume parenterals, oral liquids), type of drug substance (e.g., sterile bulk by chemical synthesis), or specific function performed at a site (e.g., control testing laboratory). There are profile class codes for major categories of drug substance processes, dosage forms, and manufacturing functions (see table below). However, the system is not comprehensive for all operations performed in the pharmaceutical industry (see ""not elsewhere classified"" or NEC profile class code).\n\nThe term type of operation refers to the specialized or even unique conditions and practices that are employed to manufacture a class or category of drug or to perform a limited segment of the manufacturing process. These conditions and practices exist and are performed within the framework of CGMPs, along with general conditions and practices that contribute to the manufacture of all drug products at a given manufacturing site. The conditions and practices, both general and specific, are inspected to evaluate the CGMP acceptability of a manufacturing site. A wide variety of classes or categories of drugs may be produced at a manufacturing site, or the manufacturing site may produce only a single class of drug or perform a limited segment of a manufacturing process. Each type of operation is represented by a profile class code.\n\nGenerally, a satisfactory CGMP status for a profile class code is used to communicate a satisfactory CGMP clearance for all of the products and for all of the operations included within the category that code represents. Thus, the profile class code for a particular dosage form or type of drug substance is used to communicate the CGMP status for all aspects of manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding that are performed at the specific manufacturing site relating to that particular dosage form or type of drug substance, including packaging and labeling operations, testing, and quality control. The profile class code for a particular dosage form or type of drug substance also is used to communicate the CGMP status for manufacturing sites that produce in-process material (e.g., controlled-release beads), package drug products, or label drug products, even if these are stand-alone (e.g., contractor) operations.\n\nA few profile class codes that describe certain types of operations (see items in boldface in table)\n\n5 Conclusions non-binding Recommendations\n\nare provided to report the CGMP status for contractor firms whose only function in the manufacturing process is to perform this operation. If one of these operations (e.g., steam sterilization process) is performed at the manufacturing site involved in producing the drug product/drug substance, the CGMP status for that operation is reported as part of the profile class code for the particular dosage form or type of drug substance. For example, a manufacturing site producing a terminally sterilized small volume parenteral drug product would be reported with the profile class code for the dosage form (SVT), not by the profile code for the sterilization process (SSP).\n\nCertain inspections may be required by program priorities even if the rating for a profile class code indicates an acceptable CGMP status. The current profile codes/classes for drugs are:\n\nCONTAINS NON-BINDING RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \\hline LVP & Large volume parenterals & WSP & Water sterilization process \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nCGMP inspectional status, based on the profile class, is available through FDA\'s Freedom of Information (FOI) Office. (See Glossary under Satisfactory Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) Inspection for more information regarding FOI requests.)\n\nExamples of post-approval manufacturing site changes and recommended reporting categories:\n\nAn applicant wants to move the manufacture of an immediate-release tablet (TCM) to a different manufacturing site that currently manufactures, and has satisfactory CGMP status for, prompt-release capsules (CHG) and powders for oral solution (POW). This manufacturing site change should be filed in a prior approval supplement because the new manufacturing site does not have a satisfactory CGMP inspection for immediate-release tablets.\n\nAn applicant wishes to consolidate product testing to a single analytical laboratory site at a manufacturing site. This manufacturing site produces various solid oral dosage form drug products, has an operational analytical laboratory currently at the site, and satisfactory CGMP inspections for the manufacturing occurring at the facility. Some of the drug products that will be tested at the analytical laboratory when the consolidation occurs are not solid oral dosage form products. Unlike most other production operations, testing laboratories (and other operations in boldface in the table) are not inspected on a dosage form/type of drug substance specific basis. The satisfactory CGMP inspection of the analytical laboratory, which was performed as part of the CGMP inspection for manufacture of the solid oral dosage form drug products, is considered to apply to all dosage forms, including those not actually produced at the site. Therefore the change to consolidate product testing to a single analytical laboratory site with a satisfactory CGMP status may be filed in a supplement-changes-being-effected.\n\n6 Conclusions Non-Binding Recommendations\n\n6.1 Glossary\n\n6.1.1 Acceptance Criteria:\n\nNumerical limits, ranges, or other criteria for the tests described (21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(iv)).\n\n6.1.2 Assess the Effects of the Change:\n\nTo evaluate the effects of a manufacturing change on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of a drug as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug (21 CFR 514.8(a)(2)(i)).\n\n6.1.3 Container Closure System:\n\nThe sum of packaging components that together contain and protect the drug.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: Example 1: Multiple changes caused by a manufacturing process change\n\nA manufacturer decides to change the manufacturing process for a patient-contacting part from a machining process to a stamping process. The use of the stamping process requires a change in the grade of stainless steel and also results in a change of the dimensional tolerances. To evaluate the impact of this change, the manufacturer should use both Sections B (Technology, Engineering, and Performance) and C (Materials).\n\n4.1.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nExample 2: Multiple changes related to a change in shelf-life\n\nA manufacturer changes one or more materials in a device to improve the shelf-life of the product. The material change also affects some of the performance characteristics, resulting in the need to update the labeling. To evaluate the impact of the change, the manufacturer should use Sections A (Labeling), B (Technology, Engineering, and Performance) and C (Materials) or D (Technology, Engineering, Performance, and Materials Changes for IVD Devices).\n\n1.3 Changes not addressed in Sections A through D should be evaluated with a risk-based assessment using the recommendations provided in Section E.\n\nIn instances where the specific flowcharts do not address a given change, Section E provides recommendations for how manufacturers should utilize risk management principles to evaluate their own specific changes and modifications. Because 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3)(i) requires submission of a new 510(k) when a change ""could significantly affect safety or effectiveness,"" both safety and effectiveness should be considered in evaluating a device\'s risk profile, as explained in the Guiding Principles and Section E. For those circumstances where the proposed change is not addressed in this guidance or in a device-specific guidance document, manufacturers are encouraged to contact CDRH staff or CBER staff.\n\nAppendix A Labeling Changes\n\nAs noted above, the guidance focuses on the following types of changes: labeling changes, technology, engineering, or performance changes, and materials changes. This guidance identifies several types of labeling changes or modifications to an existing device, including certain changes to the indications for use, that can have a major impact on intended use and thus require submission of a new 510(k) under 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3)[2]. All labeling changes should be evaluated using a separate logic scheme that concentrates on changes in indications for use and applies a risk-based assessment framework for determining whether submission of a new 510(k) is required. Focusing on indications for use and using a risk-based assessment for labeling changes will also help identify those changes that are more frequently recommended for documentation only.\n\nFlowchart A describes the logic scheme to be used when determining when submission of a new 510(k) is required for a labeling change. Changes in device labeling often pose the most difficult questions to be addressed by device manufacturers when deciding whether submission of a new 510(k) is required. Frequently, an apparently subtle change in a device\'s labeling can have a significant impact on the safe and effective use of the device.\n\nConfusion often results when discussing the distinction between ""indications for use"" and the ""intended use"" of the device. For purposes of substantial equivalence, and for the purposes of this guidance, the term intended use means the general purpose of the device or its function, and encompasses the indications for use.3 The indications for use generally describe the disease orcondition the device will diagnose, treat, prevent, cure or mitigate, including a description of the patient population for which the device is intended.4 The indications include all the labeled patient uses of the device. As it relates to medical devices, the indications for use statement is a factor in determining a device\'s intended use; however, a change in indications for use that requires the submission of a new 510(k) does not necessarily mean that the device has a new intended use (such that the device would not be substantially equivalent under section 513(i) of the FD&C Act).5\n\nFootnote 4: See FDA’s guidance The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications (510(k)) (https://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm284443.pdf)\n\nFootnote 5: Ibid.\n\nFigure 2: Flowchart A: Labeling Changes\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA1.: Is it a change in the indications for use statement? Changes in the indications for use statement raise more Agency concern than any other aspect of labeling. In fact, most labeling changes that affect the substance, meaning, or scope of the indications for use could significantly affect safety or effectiveness and will require submission of a new 510(k). Changes that clarify the indications without affecting the substance or meaning of the indications usually do not require submission of a new 510(k). In addition, some changes in the indications for use that limit use within the currently cleared indication may occur without submission of a new 510(k). For example, if a device was cleared for use with three specific indications and the firm decides to market the device for only two of those indications, this change would not likely require submission of a new 510(k).\n\nIf the labeling change is to the indications for use statement, proceed to A.1.1. Otherwise, proceed to A.2.\n\nIt should be noted the decision points in A1.1-A1.5 may apply not only to changes to the indications for use statement of the labeling, but also to changes to other sections of the labeling, such as the directions for use of the device. You should review these decision points when directed by the text of this guidance and Flowchart A: Labeling Changes.\n\nIs it a change from a device labeled for single use only to a device labeled as reusable?\n\nFDA has found that the performance and risks associated with a reusable device can be significantly different from the performance and risks associated with that same device when it is labeled for single use only. Therefore, changing a device labeled for single use only to a device that is labeled as reusable typically could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness and would likely require submission of a new 510(k). Changing a device labeled for reuse to single use only, however, would likely not require submission of a new 510(k) because a single use is a limitation of the previously cleared indications for multiple uses, and the risks of single use were inherently considered within the risks of multiple uses.\n\nIf it is not this type of labeling change, proceed to A.1.2.\n\nIs it a change from prescription (Rx) to over the counter (OTC) use?\n\nFDA has found that the directions for use necessary for health care professionals to use a device safely and effectively can be significantly different from the directions for use necessary for lay users to use that same device safely and effectively. Therefore, changing a device labeled for prescription use only to a device that is labeled for OTC use typically could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness and would likely require submission of a new 510(k). Changing a device labeled for OTC use to prescription use, however, would likely not require submission of a new 510(k) because it is unlikely that the associated labeling changes could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device.\n\nIf it is not this type of labeling change, proceed to A.1.3.\n\na.1.3 Is it a change to the device name or a change solely to improve readability or clarity?\n\nChanges to the device name or description that are consistent with the cleared indications for use typically do not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness and would likely not require submission of a new 510(k). Changes that are solely to improve readability or clarity that are consistent with the cleared indications for use typically do not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness and likely would not require submission of a new 510(k).\n\nIf it is not this type of labeling change, proceed to A.1.4.\n\na.1.4 Does the change describe a new disease, condition, or patient population that the device is intended for use in diagnosing, treating, preventing, curing or mitigating?\n\nDifferences in indications for use should be analyzed to explain how they are or are not critical to the intended therapeutic, diagnostic, prosthetic, or surgical use of the device, and how the differences do or do not affect the safety and effectiveness of the device. Specific changes that could significantly affect the safety and effectiveness include describing a new disease, condition, or patient population that the device is intended for use in diagnosing, treating, preventing, curing or mitigating (or an anatomical site from which a new disease, condition, or population may be inferred). The criticality of these types of changes and their direct effect on safety and effectiveness means that a change to add a new disease, condition, or patient population likely requires submission of a new 510(k).\n--------------------\nContext title: Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: Changes in Production Output\n\nSeveral approaches to changing production output_are discussed below; other approaches are also possible. For already approved products manufactured using a CM process, it is important to justify the selected approach, assess risk and understand its impact on the overall control strategy and process performance, and as needed, update the control strategy to ensure risk control. Some changes may require process modification and process validation.\n\nChange in run time with no change to mass flow rates and equipment: Issues not observed over shorter run times may become visible as run time increases. Additional risks and constraints should be considered and may include, for example, process drift, increased equipment temperatures, material build-up, exceeding the performance limit of components (e.g., validated in vitro cell age, resin cycle number), material degradation, membrane or sensor fouling, and microbial contamination. Decreasing production output (below the longest run time previously validated) generally would not imply additional risks, given the same equipment, process and control strategy are used.\n\nIncrease mass flow rates with no change to overall run time and equipment: The risks associated with this approach may impact output material quality and are related to changes in process dynamics and system capability to handle increased mass flow rates. Therefore,this approach may require re-evaluation and modification of the control strategy, including process parameters and controls, material traceability, RTD, sampling, and diversion strategies to reduce risk.\n\n*Increase output through duplication of equipment (i.e., scale-out):\n\nConsiderations for two commonly used scale-out approaches are provided below.\n\nReplication of production lines (like-for-like): Replicating the integrated CM production line (i.e., same equipment and setup as the original CM system) can be used to increase production output. The replicate production lines follow the same control strategy.\n\nParallel unit operations on the same production line: When only some unit operations are replicated on the same line, risks are associated with maintaining control across parallel unit operations. Aspects to consider are maintenance of uniform flow distribution among the parallel operations, synchronisation and re-integration of parallel flow streams, changes to process dynamics, increasing the rate of other unit operations to handle the increased capacity, and material traceability.\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_Q13_Step4_Guideline_2022_1116'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: An approved CP with a reduced reporting category can be useful for the proposed addition, modification, or replacement of manufacturing equipment that would otherwise require submission of a supplement thereby facilitating increased manufacturing flexibility. The CP submission should address any differences in equipment design, operating principles, and/or size, as applicable.77\n\nFootnote 77: See footnote 19 regarding guidances on postapproval CMC changes.\n\nSpecification, Including Analytical Procedure (Method) Changes\n\nDoes FDA have any recommendations or issues for industry to consider regarding specification changes in a CP?\n\nSpecifications are the quality standards (i.e., tests, analytical procedures, and acceptance criteria) provided in an approved application to confirm the quality of drug substances, products, intermediates, raw materials, reagents, components, in-process materials, container closure systems, and other materials used in the production of a drug substance or product.78 Changes to the approved specification that provide the same or greater assurance of product quality can be included in a CP. A CP submission for a specification change should include a justification for the change.\n\nFor replacement or modification of an existing analytical procedure in an approved application, the new procedure must be scientifically sound79 and should provide the same or greater assurance of product quality than the currently approved procedure.80 The CP should include the specific plan, description of statistical method(s) to be used, and acceptance criteria to be achieved for evaluating the performance of the new procedure. Method validation data should be submitted with the notification of the change.\n\nFootnote 79: See 21 CFR 211.160.\n\nFootnote 80: See ICH Q2(R1) and FDA guidance for industry Analytical Procedures and Methods Validation for Drugs and Biologics (July 2015).\n\nA CP can also be used for replacing a quality reference standard used in an analytical procedure(s).\n\nG. Packaging Changes\n\nDoes FDA have any recommendations or issues for industry to consider regarding packaging changes in a CP?\n\nYou can use a CP for packaging changes. The CP can apply to components of the container closure system or their manufacturing processes. CPs for changes to multiple components of a container closure system should adequately address the potential effects of the interchangeability of container closure system components on product quality, where applicable.\n\nH. Process Analytical Technology Changes\n\nDoes FDA have any recommendations regarding process analytical technology implementation or changes in a CP?\n\nYou can propose the implementation of process analytical technology (PAT) or propose a change in PAT in a CP. Information on the suitability of a PAT tool on experimental and/or production equipment and processes can be submitted to support a CP for PAT implementation or change(s).81\n\nFootnote 81: See footnote 34.\n\nI. Changes to Drug-Device or Biologic-Device Combination Products\n\nDoes FDA have any recommendations regarding changes to drug-device or biologic-device combination products in a CP?\n\nIn general, a CP can be submitted for changes to a drug-device or biologic-device combination product where CDER or CBER is the lead center. The nature of the proposed change to the device constituent part would need to be considered in determining if a CP would be suitable.\n\nFor questions as to whether a CP would be suitable for a specific drug-device or biologic-device combination product, we recommend that you contact the appropriate FDA review division.\n\nJ. Master Files\n\n1. Can a drug master file (DMF) be cross-referenced in a CP that is included in an application submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act?\n\nIn an application approved or seeking approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act, a DMF can be cross-referenced82 in a CP that provides for postapproval CMC changes (e.g., addition of a supplier of a drug substance used in an FDA-approved drug product, a change in an excipient supplier, a change in the supplier of a container and/or closure). The CP should indicate the type of CMC information that will be incorporated by reference to the DMF. Also, the CP should include the tests and studies to be performed and the acceptance criteria to be achieved to demonstrate the suitability of the material supplied by the DMF holder (e.g., conformance to approved specification, compatibility studies, stability studies). We recommend that the CP submission specify that a copy of the letter authorizing incorporation by reference of the information in the DMF will be provided when reporting a postapproval CMC change implemented using the approved CP to FDA. If the subsequent submission notifying FDA of the postapproval CMC change does not include the letter of authorization, the notification to FDA would be incomplete. The applicant is responsible for ensuring that the DMF holder's methods, facilities, and controls relevant to the change are in accordance with CGMP. A CP for a change in drug substance supplier is generally not recommended if the proposed change is to a drug substance supplier that does not already supply drug substance used in an FDA-approved drug product (see question and answer A.2).\n\nFootnote 82: See 21 CFR 314.420.\n\n2. Can a master file be cross-referenced in a CP that is included in an application submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act?\n\nIn general, in an application approved or seeking approval under section 351 of the PHS Act, a master file, including a DMF, can be cross-referenced83 in a CP that provides for postapproval CMC changes (e.g., changes to the information about excipients or materials used in the preparation of drug substance, drug substance intermediate, or drug product), except if the information in the master file is drug substance, drug substance intermediate, or drug product information. The CP should indicate the type of CMC information that will be incorporated by reference to the master file. Also, the CP should include the tests and studies to be performed and the acceptance criteria to be achieved to demonstrate the suitability of the material supplied by the master file holder (e.g., conformance to approved specification, compatibility studies, stability studies). We recommend that the CP submission specify that a copy of the letter authorizing incorporation by reference of the information in the master file will be provided when reporting a postapproval CMC change implemented using the approved CP to FDA. If the subsequent submission notifying FDA of the postapproval CMC change does not include the letter of authorization, the notification to FDA would be incomplete. The applicant is responsible for ensuring that the master file holder's facilities, methods, and controls relevant to the change are in accordance with CGMP.\n\n3.3.3 Can a CP be submitted to a master file?\n\nA CP for postapproval CMC changes can be submitted to a master file, including a DMF, by the master file holder. For example, a CP submitted to a master file may be useful to support changes affecting multiple applications. However, FDA neither independently reviews nor approves or disapproves submissions to master files; instead, FDA reviews a CP or other information in a master file only in connection with applications that incorporate by reference such information. Administrative considerations relating to reviewing CPs in master files can present some unique challenges; therefore, a master file holder should coordinate with FDA prior to submitting such a CP.84\n--------------------\nContext title: Comparability Protocols for Postapproval Changes to the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information in an NDA, ANDA, or BLA""]",['Changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding fill heads can be reported in an annual report as long as the total processing time is not extended beyond the validated limits in the approved application.'],0.699999999965,0.1176470588235294
78,"Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?","[""--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: The definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n\nThe determination of the amount of added sugars contributed by a powdered fruit or vegetable juice that is added as an ingredient to a product and that is not reconstituted to single strength juice during processing (e.g., that is added to a pureed fruit or to a yogurt) would be the same as the determination of the sugars contributed by a liquid or frozen fruit or vegetable juice concentrate. In our response to question 11, we have suggested that when calculating the added sugars declaration for a product containing concentrated fruit or vegetable juice, the total moisture content of the finished product can be considered to go towards reconstitution of the fruit juice concentrate in the formulation. Thus, the total moisture content of a finished product formulated with powdered fruit or vegetable juice concentrates can be considered to contribute towards the dilution of the powdered fruit or vegetable juice. Further, the sugars contributed by the powdered fruit or vegetable juice that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type must be declared as added sugars on the label, as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule.\n8. Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates? We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12). We require that, when a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)). If you use Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 to calculate the amount of added sugars in a product containing juice concentrate, you must document this information in the records regarding the amount of added sugars added to the food during processing (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). If you use the amount of sugars present in a single strength juice and/or a juice concentrate, that is determined through chemical analysis or other available information, when calculating the amount of added sugars in a product containing fruit juice concentrate, you must document the source of the information and/or the amount of sugars determined through chemical analysis in the records that you make and keep (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). If a diluted juice concentrate slightly exceeds the amount of sugar that would be found in the same volume of the same type of 100 percent fruit juice, manufacturers should document the average and consistency with cGMPs in the records that they make and keep.\n9. Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis? The amount of added sugars declared on the label must be in grams (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The added sugars definition includes sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. For juice, the serving size is based on volume (e.g., 8 oz. or 240 ml) while the amount of added sugars per serving is based on weight. Therefore, when calculating the weight of added sugars per serving, you may need to consider the densities of both the finished juice product and the single strength juice of the same type. You may choose to arrive at the gram amount of added sugars in different ways. Please see our responses to questions 11 and 12 for examples of how to calculate the amount of added sugars in products containing concentrated fruit juices on both a volume and weight basis.\n10. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit or vegetable juice (juice made from a single type of fruit or vegetable) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength juice where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)? In the hypothetical example below, we provide three general steps to calculate the amount of added sugars (in grams) for an apple juice product (240 ml serving size) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength apple juice. The product in this hypothetical example is reconstituted to have juice soluble solids above the minimum Brixrequirement in 21 CFR 101.30 where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9). Therefore, all sugars in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice must be declared as added sugars. The apple juice example here uses the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration. This example is provided solely to demonstrate one method of calculating the added sugars content of the product. You can use alternate methods.\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines includes a recommendation for healthy eating patterns that limit added sugars (including honey, syrups, and other caloric sweeteners) to less than 10 percent of calories per day (Ref. 3).\n\nNutrition Facts Label Final Rule\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016, we issued a final rule updating the Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods to reflect new scientific information (see 81 FR 33742). The Nutrition Facts label final rule includes changes in the individual nutrients that must be declared and also changes some of the DVs. The science underlying the Nutrition Facts label final rule, referenced above, is also reflected in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires that added sugars be included in the Nutrition Facts label and established a DV for added sugars. The Nutrition Facts label final rule defines ""added sugars,"" in part, to include sugars that are either added during the processing of foods or are packaged as such (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The term includes free sugars (free mono- and disaccharides), sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The Nutrition Facts label final rule requires added sugars to be declared on the food label by stating ""Includes Xg Added Sugars"" indented directly below ""Total Sugars"" (see 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(ii)).\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires a declaration for added sugars, in part, because excess consumption of added sugars makes it difficult to meet nutrient needs within the calorie limits generally needed to maintain a healthy weight and can lead to an increase in overall caloric intake. Further, healthy dietary patterns characterized, in part, by lower amounts of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, as compared to less healthy dietary patterns, are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary_Guidelines demonstrates that meeting nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits is difficult with more than 10 percent of total daily calories from added sugars (50 grams of added sugars based on a 2,000 calorie diet). Based on this science, the Nutrition Facts label final rule establishes a DV for added sugars, 50 grams based on a 2,000 calorie diet for adults and children 4 years of age and older and 25 grams based on a 1,000 calorie diet for children 1 through 3 years of age (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(vii)).\n\nPure (100%) honey, pure (100%) maple syrup, other single-ingredient sugars and syrups, and certain cranberry products sweetened with added sugars contribute to the DV of added sugars, regardless of whether they are added by consumers to foods (e.g., maple syrup poured over pancakes; sugar added to dried cranberries to increase palatability) or consumed in isolation (e.g., a spoonful of honey). FDA\'s definition encompasses the types of added sugars that were evaluated in the science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommendation that no more than 10 percent of calories be from added sugars. These sugars were considered ""empty calories"" or ""calories for other uses"" in the USDA Food Patterns.\n\nDraft Guidance\n\nIn the Federal Register of March 2, 2018 (83 FR 8953), we made available a draft guidance for industry entitled ""The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, and Certain Cranberry Products; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availability"" (hereafter referred to as ""the draft guidance"") and asked interested parties to submit comments by May 1, 2018. In the Federal Register of April 25, 2018 (83 FR 17961), we extended the comment period to June 15, 2018. We have considered comments to the draft guidance, and we have made modifications, where appropriate, that are now reflected in this final guidance.\n\nFarm Bill\n\nAfter we published the Nutrition Facts label final rule and the Serving Size final rule, and draft guidance, the President signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (""the Farm Bill""). Section 12516 of the Farm Bill states that the food labeling requirements under section 403(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)) shall not require that the Nutrition Facts label of any single-ingredient sugar, honey, agave, or syrup, including maple syrup, that is packaged and offered for sale as a single-ingredient food bear the declaration ""Includes Xg Added Sugars."" Therefore, single-ingredient sugars, honey, agave, and syrups, including maple syrup, do not need to have this statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving of their product on their label. At the same time, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nAlthough the gram amount of added sugars in a serving of pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups does not need to be declared on the label, these single-ingredient sugars and syrups are required under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV that they contribute to added sugars in the diet. The percent DV on pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups provides important information to consumers about how the addition of sugar from these products contributes to their total daily diet. In the absence of the declaration of the amount of added sugars in a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product, a statement that includes information about the amount of sugars in a serving, as well as how that amount contributes to the consumer\'s diet and the percent DV for added sugars, provides information that can assist consumers in constructing a diet that is consistent with recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nTherefore, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the use of a ""(\\dagger)"" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV and, per the Farm Bill, the term ""Includes Xg Added Sugars"" would not need to appear on the line on the Nutrition Facts label disclosing the added sugars percent DV. The ""(\\dagger)"" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading within a footnote in the Nutrition Facts label box that includes a description of the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent DV for added sugars in the diet. The footnote containing this factual statement should be placed beneath the required footnote that states, ""The % Daily Value (DV) tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice"" (see illustration below).5 Our intent to exercise enforcement discretion is limited to any pure, single-ingredient honey and maple syrup, and other pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups.\n\nFootnote 5: Note that the illustration provides an example of a truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet. FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for the use of any truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet.\n\nWe also intend to exercise our enforcement discretion for certain cranberry products described here (dried cranberries without added flavorings and cranberry beverages made up of cranberry juice that is sweetened with added sugars that provide an amount of total sugars in a serving that does not exceed the level of total sugars in a serving of a comparable product with no added sugars) to allow for the use of a ""(\\dagger)"" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV. The ""(\\dagger)"" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nManufacturers could explain, through the use of such statements, that the sugars added to dried cranberries or the cranberry beverage product are meant to increase the palatability of the naturally tart fruit and that the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. We have provided illustrations of such statements that we consider to be truthful and not misleading below.\n\nAt this time, we are not aware of products, other than the dried cranberry and cranberry beverage products previously discussed, for which the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. Therefore, at this time we only intend to exercise enforcement discretion for cranberry products previously discussed with respect to the use of the ""(\\uparrow)"" that would direct consumers to truthful and not misleading statements on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label, and do not intend to exercise enforcement discretion on other products (e.g., a granola bar or trail mix containing dried sugar-sweetened cranberries). We note that we would consider whether the same type of enforcement discretion discussed with respect to the cranberry products previously described might be warranted for other products where the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, such as naturally tart fruits, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products'
 ""--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: Step 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n\na) Single strength apple juice has a Brix value of 11.5 (21 CFR 101.30). You may use the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration in a single strength apple juice or other information such as data obtained through chemical analysis, information from databases, or reference documents (see response to Q&A 9). Therefore, the sugar concentration in a single strength apple juice is 11.5% (based on weight).\n\nb) Determine the density of single strength apple juice with a Brix value of 11.5. You can either measure the density or look up references that convert Brix values to densities.\n\nc) The amount of sugars in 240 ml serving size of single strength apple juice of the same type = 240 ml x density (g/ml) x 11.5 % (or.115).\n\nStep 3: The weight of added sugars (in grams) is the weight of sugars obtained from step 1 minus that from step 2.\n\n11. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit juice blend containing the juices of multiple fruit types that is reconstituted above 100 percent where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)?\n\nIf the juice blend is reconstituted such that the amount of sugar in the finished product is equal to or less than what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice (e.g., less than 100% juice), the added sugar declaration would be zero.\n\nIf the juice blend is reconstituted such that the amount of sugar in the finished product is greater than what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final juice blend.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished juice blend product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the juice blend were reconstituted to single strength juice of the same type (i.e., the weight of sugars in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type). The single strength juice of the same type is a juice that contains the same ratios of the apple, mango, and pear juices in our hypothetical example.\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you can make a single strength juice blend with the same ratios of the three juices and measure the amount of total sugars per 240 ml serving size.\n\nYou can also calculate the sugar weight in the theoretical single strength juice blend of the same type by the following method:\n\na) Calculate the ratios of the three juices in your formulation based on weight.\n\nTo obtain the weight-based ratios of the three juices in this hypothetical juice blend example, you need to first determine the weight-based concentration factors for the three types of juice. The weight-based concentration factor is the ratio of the Brix values between the concentrate and the single strength juice. For example, the weight-based concentration factor for the apple juice in the hypothetical example is 70 / 11.5 = 6.087. Using a similar calculation, the weight based concentration factor for the mango juice is 5.385 and the weight based concentration factor for the pear juice is 5.833.\n\nBecause the hypothetical juice blend formulation has 10% apple juice concentrate (70 Brix), 10% mango juice concentrate (70 Brix), and 20% pear juice concentrate (70 Brix), the theoretical single strength juice blend of the same type would have the following ratios of single strength apple juice, single mango juice, and single pear juice:\n\nPercentage apple juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) apple juice concentration factor; percentage mango juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) mango juice concentration factor; percentage pear juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) pear juice concentration factor\n\nOr\n\n10% (\\times) 6.087; 10% (\\times) 5.385; 20% (\\times) 5.833\n\nOr\n\n0.6087; 0.5385; 1.167_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nThe above ratios for the three types of juice can be converted to percentage-based ratios with the sum of the ratios being 100%. The sum of the ratios is 100% because all of the sugars in the juice blend are from the three types of juices.\n\nTherefore:\n\nSingle apple juice: single strength mango juice: single strength pear juice =\n\n({)[0.6087 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (}):\n\n({)[0.5385 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (}):\n\n({)[1.167 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (})\n\nOr\n\n26.30%: 23.27%: 50.42%\n\nb) Calculate the theoretical Brix value of the single strength juice blend of the same type juice with the same ratios of the three juices.\n\nThe theoretical Brix value of the juice blend is the sum of the multiplication products of the Brix value and the percentage contribution (the ratio percentage from step 2a) for each type of juice.\n\n(Single strength apple juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single strength apple juice) + (single strength mango juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single strength mango juice) + (single strength pear juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single pear juice) = theoretical Brix value of the hypothetical juice blend.\n\n11.5% (\\times) 26.31% + 13% (\\times) 23.27% + 12% (\\times) 50.42% = 12.10%.\n\nc) Determine the density of single strength juice blend with a Brix value of 12.10. You can either experimentally measure the density or look up references that convert Brix values to densities.\n\nd) The amount of sugars in 240 ml serving size of the theoretical single strength juice blend of the same type with the same ratios of the three types of juice = 240 ml (\\times) density (g/ml) (\\times) 12.10 %.\n\nStep 3: The weight of added sugars (in grams) is the weight of sugars obtained from step 1 minus that from step 2.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals""
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: 3. Do I need to take into consideration sugars from ingredients that are used in formulating my product when determining the added sugars declaration for a serving of my product?\n\nIngredients containing free mono- and disaccharides that meet our definition of added sugars need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (e.g. sugars from cane sugar and concentrated fruit juice added to sweeten an apple sauce). Manufacturers may need to work with ingredient suppliers to determine the amount of added sugars provided by ingredients used in formulating food products.\n\n4. Do the sugars in dried fruits meet the definition of added sugars?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we responded to comments on dried fruits (see response to comment 212, 81 FR 33742 at 33837). We said that dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them should not be considered to contain added sugars because they are essentially a dehydrated whole fruit and still retain the nutrients and other components of a whole fruit (e.g. diced dried apples). However, if additional sugar is added to a dried fruit, the sugar added to the dried fruit must be declared on the label as added sugars (81 FR 33742 at 33837).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5. Are the sugars used in the production of vinegar added sugars?\n\nIn the production of vinegar, naturally occurring sugars are first fermented into alcohol and then a secondary fermentation occurs in which alcohol is converted to vinegar. For most vinegar products, no sugars remain in the final product. Vinegars that do not contain any sugars in the finished food would not need an added sugars declaration. However, we are aware of some vinegars (e.g., balsamic vinegar) that are made using ingredients that are often used as sweeteners in foods, and that are similar to concentrated fruit juices (e.g., grape must). According to the definition of added sugars, sugars found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type are added sugars. Therefore, fruit juices that are concentrated before or during processing of some vinegars contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars. To the extent that sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are present in the finished product, the added sugars must be declared on the label and in labeling, as required in our Nutrition Facts label final rule. We understand that the manufacturing of vinegar involves several steps, and manufacturers need to consider the impact of these steps (e.g. potential concentration due to water loss when aged in wooden barrels) on the final added sugars declaration.\n\n6. The definition of added sugars excludes the ""fruit component of fruit spreads."" What constitutes the ""fruit component"" of a non-standardized fruit spread?\n\nPlease see our response to question 1 above. The fruit component of a non-standardized fruit spread would include whole fruits, pieces of fruit, dried fruit, fruit or vegetable pures (single strength or concentrated), fruit pulps, single strength juices, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders that are not made from fruit or vegetable juices.\n\n7. Do sugars found in fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the form of the fruit or vegetable (e.g., concentrated fruit and vegetable pures, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders) need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833), we explained that we excluded from the definition of ""added sugars"" whole fruit, fruit pieces, dried fruit, pulps, and pures because they are nutrient rich and maintain the basic properties of a fruit when added to foods and are not considered to contain added sugars (see response to comment 208, 81 FR 33742 at33835). We also explained that sugars from 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, and sugars from certain fruit and vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under certain regulations, fruit juice concentrates used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, and preserves under our standards of identity, and 100 percent juice concentrate sold directly to consumers (e.g. frozen orange juice concentrate) are excluded from the definition of ""added sugars.""\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833 through 33834), we explained that, while foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices can be a part of a healthful diet, the sugars added to the foods by the concentrated fruit or vegetable juice provide additional calories. Over the course of the day, small amounts of calories in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages can add up and make it difficult to balance the amount of calories expended (81 FR 33742 at 33834). For these reasons, we consider foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices to be sugar-sweetened foods (id).\n\nWe also explained that in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report (Ref. 1) (81 FR 33742 at 33835).\n\nWe are applying these same guiding principles when determining when the sugars in an ingredient are added sugars. Concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes, and some fruit and vegetable powders are essentially whole fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the physical form of the fruit or vegetable and to remove moisture. They maintain the basic properties of a whole fruit or vegetable, even if the peel and seeds may be removed. Their composition and use is more consistent with that of whole fruits or vegetables, dried fruits or vegetables, pulps and pureses than that of concentrated fruit juices, which are commonly used by industry in place of sugars. Therefore, the sugars in concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes and some fruit and vegetable powders contribute to the diet the same way that sugars found in whole fruits or vegetables do, and do not have to be declared as added sugars on the label. However, we consider sugars in powders made from fruit and vegetable juices to be the same as those found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices because such powders are essentially concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that have all moisture removed. Therefore, some or all sugars contributed by a powder made from fruit or vegetable juices must be declared as added sugars on the label as required by the Nutrition Facts label final rule, depending on the degree of reconstitution in the finished food.\n\nThe definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals'
 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: A food that already contains some endogenous sugar and additional added sugars, either directly or as a component in an ingredient, such as sweetened fruit added to yogurt, would be misbranded if the actual ""Total Sugars"" amount is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label, or the records requirements for ""Added Sugars"" are not met (see SS 101.9(g)(11)).\n\nDo sugars present in a sweet fermented beverage after fermentation need to be declared as total or added sugars on the label?\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains only sugars that meet our definition of added sugars (e.g. table sugar), then the amount of sugars present in a serving of the product after fermentation must be declared as both total and added sugars (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains both sugars that do and do not meet our definition of added sugars, you may determine the amount of total sugars in the finished food analytically. You have the following options related to the added sugars declaration:\n\nDetermine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in the finished product and make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information you relied upon that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation; or\n\nDeclare the amount of added sugars added prior to fermentation and make and keep records to verify the amount (21 CFR 101.9(g)). The amount of added sugars declared should not exceed the amount of total sugars on the label; or\n\nIf you have no way to determine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in the finished food, but have reason to believe that a significant reduction of added sugars took place during fermentation, you may submit a petition, under 21 CFR 10.30, to request an alternative means of compliance. The petition should provide scientific data or other information for why the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product is likely to be significantly reduced compared to the amount added prior to fermentation. A significant reduction would be where reduction in added sugars after fermentation may be significant enough to impact the label declaration for added sugars by an amount that exceeds the reasonable deficiency acceptable within good manufacturing practice under SS 101.9(g)(6). In addition, the scientific data or other information should include the reason why you are unable to determine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in a serving of the finished product and a description of the process that you used to come to that conclusion.\n\nIngredients made primarily from sugar and created through non-enzymatic browning are added to some products for coloring and flavoring purposes (e.g. caramel color). After non-enzymatic browning occurs, the sugar is reduced in the ingredient. In such a case, how much sugar must be declared as added sugars on the label? If the remaining amount of the sugar contributed by an ingredient that undergoes non-enzymatic browning is detectable by testing in the finished product, you may declare that amount of sugar that is detectible by analytical testing in the finished product as the added sugars declaration. When such an ingredient is added to a product that contains other sugars that do not meet the definition of added sugars, you must make and keep records, which should include records of the results of the analytical testing that is used to demonstrate the amount of added sugars contributed by the ingredient in the finished product after non-enzymatic browning occurs, and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(v)(A)).\n\n20. If sugar is added for fermentation during the leavening process of a baked good and some of the sugars are consumed by yeast, should the reduction in the amount of sugars be accounted for the declaration of added sugars?\n\nAs described in our response to question 19, you may declare the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation. If you do so, you must make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information relied upon by the manufacturer that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(v)(A)).\n21. There is a chance that added sugars content prior to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation may be higher than the total sugars content of the finished food determined through chemical analysis. How do I approximate the added sugars value in this case?\n\nThe added sugars declaration should not exceed the total sugars declaration. In a case where sugars added prior to or during processing are reduced through non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation, and the manufacturer chooses to declare the amount of sugars added prior to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation, the added sugars declaration could conceivably exceed the amount of total sugars determined through chemical analysis. In such a case, you should declare the same amount for added sugars as the amount of total sugars obtained through analytical testing for a serving of the food.\n\nV Question and Answer on Format Issues\n\n1. What are the specifications for thickness of lines and leading (i.e., space between lines) on the Nutrition Facts label?\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(ii)(C) and (d)(1)(v) establish certain format requirements with respect to leading and the use of hairline rules.\n\nAdditionally, Appendix B to Part 101 in Title 21 provides examples of graphic enhancements (i.e., illustrations) that FDA uses. For more examples of graphic enhancements that FDA uses, please see our webpage at: https://www.fda.gov/media/99151/download.\n\nQuestion and Answer on the Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals\n\n1. What are the requirements (e.g. for rounding) for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals declared on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels? What does ""levels of significance"" mean in this context?\n\nWe require, under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii), that the quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals, excluding sodium, be the amount of the vitamin or mineral included in a serving of the product using the units of measurement and the levels of significance given in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) (which refers to the Reference Daily Intakes (RDI) table). However, zeros following decimal points may be dropped, and additional levels of significance may be used when the number of decimal places indicated is not sufficient to express lower amounts (e.g., the RDI for zinc is given in whole milligrams, but the quantitative amount may be declared in tenths of a milligram). This is consistent with the requirements for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the Supplement Facts label (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B)).\n\nIn addition, regarding conventional foods, quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals present at less than 2 percent of the RDI are not required to be declared on the Nutrition Facts label. However, they may be declared by a zero or by the use of an asterisk (or other symbol) that refers to another asterisk (or symbol) that is placed at the bottom of the table that is followed by the statement ""Contains less than 2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients)"" or ""Contains (<)2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients)."" Alternatively, if vitamin D, calcium, iron or potassium is present in amounts less than 2 percent of the RDI, label declaration of the nutrient(s) is not required if the statement ""Not a significant source of _(listing the vitamins or minerals omitted)"" is placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii)).\n\nRegarding dietary supplements, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium must be declared when they are present in a dietary supplement in quantitative amounts by weight that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling of foods in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c). (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAs for the phrase ""levels of significance,"" as used in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii) and 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and whether the phrase refers to statistical testing of hypotheses or mathematical concepts related to the degree of accuracy starting with the first nonzero digit, the phrase ""levels of significance"" refers to the degree of accuracy when rounding nutrients for purposes of declaring quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the label.\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c), provide specific rounding requirements for nutrients such as sodium. Before we issued the Nutrition Facts label final rule, sodium and potassium content was to be expressed as zero when the serving contained less than 5 milligrams (mg), to the nearest 5 mg increment when the serving contained less than or equal to 140 mg, and to the nearest 10 mg increment when the serving contained more than 140 mg.

 '--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA\'s Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: The amount of added sugars declared on the label should never exceed the amount of total sugars on the label.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(i) Do Honey, Maple Syrup, and Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n\nIn the Federal Register of June 20, 2019 (84 FR 28726), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled ""The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products,"" which provides clarity on the labeling of added sugars for such products (Ref. 1). In that guidance, we discuss section 12516 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (""the Farm Bill""), which states that the food labeling requirements cannot require the declaration ""Includes Xg Added Sugars"" in a serving of these single-ingredient products. While these products are not required to have this declaration of the gram amount of added sugars, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet, so the percent DV for added sugars must still be included consistent with 21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii). We stated that we intend to exercise enforcement discretion by permitting the use of the ""+"" symbol immediately following the percent DV declaration for added sugars on packages and containers of single-ingredient sugars and syrups. This symbol would lead to a footnote inside the Nutrition Facts label, explaining the amount of added sugars that one serving of the product contributes to the diet, as well as the contribution of a serving of the product toward the percent DV for added sugars. This symbol and footnote are not required; however, we encourage you to use them.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(ii) Do Added Sugars in Dried Cranberry Products and Cranberry Beverage Products Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n\nYou must still declare added sugars in grams and the corresponding percent DV on labels for all dried cranberry products and cranberry beverage products (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). In the Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products guidance, we said that we intend to exercise enforcement discretion for these cranberry products to allow the use of a symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV declaration which would lead to a truthful and not misleading statement outside the Nutrition Facts label explaining that sugars are added to improve the palatability of naturally tart cranberries (see Ref. 1). This symbol can be used for cranberry products that are sweetened with added sugars and that contain total sugars per serving at levels no greater than comparable products with no added sugars (i.e. unsweetened grape juice) (Ref. 1).\n\nV.A.1.(a).(iii) Does Allulose Count as an Added Sugar?\n\nThe final rule does not reach a decision as to whether allulose should be excluded from the labeling of carbohydrate, sugars, and/or added sugars. We stated that, as a monosaccharide, itmust be included in the declaration of each, pending any future rulemaking that would otherwise exclude it from the declaration (81 FR 33742 at 33796; 21 CFR 101.9(c)(i) through (iii)).\n\nIn the Federal Register of April 18, 2019 (84 FR 16272), we announced the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled ""The Declaration of Allulose and Calories from Allulose on Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels."" This guidance, when finalized, would advise manufacturers of our intent to exercise enforcement discretion for the exclusion of allulose from the amount of ""Total Sugars"" and ""Added Sugars"" declared on the label and the use of a general factor of 0.4 calories per gram for allulose when determining ""Calories"" on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels, pending review of the issues in a rulemaking (Ref. 2).\n\nv.a.1.(b) How Do I Calculate Added Sugars?\n\nIn the Federal Register of November 5, 2018 (83 FR 55266), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled ""Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels: Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals."" This guidance provides questions and answers (Q&A) on topics related to compliance with the labeling of added sugars. The Q&A discusses how you should determine the amount of added sugars in a serving of a product, as well as which ingredients need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (Ref. 3).\n\nThis guidance also provides a detailed discussion on the calculation of added sugars for ingredients and products such as concentrated fruit and vegetable purees, fruit and vegetable pastes, fruit and vegetable powders, juice cocktails, or juice blends, which often contain juice concentrates (Q&A IV. 7-12), products for which manufacturers employ a hydrolysis step (Q&A IV. 14-16), and products that undergo non-enzymatic browning or fermentation (Q&A IV. 18-21) (Ref. 3). Please refer to this guidance for questions you may have regarding the calculation and declaration of added sugars for a serving of your product.\n\nv.a.2 Vitamin D\n\nVitamin D is now considered a nutrient of ""public health significance"" for the general population, and its declaration is now mandatory (81 FR 33742 at 33884). Both the gram amount and the percent DV for Vitamin D must be declared at the bottom of the label, directly preceding the calcium declaration (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(ii)). While only the term ""vitamin D"" can be used on the food labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv)), the specific form that is added to a food must be listed in the ingredient list statement (21 CFR 101.4). For Supplement Facts labels, the source ingredient may be identified within the nutrition label in parentheses immediately following or indented beneath the name of a dietary ingredient and preceded by the word ""as"" or ""from"" (21 CFR 101.36(d)). When you do not identify a source ingredient within the nutrition label, you must list it in an ingredient statement (21 CFR 101.4(g)). You should not list it in both places (81 FR 33742 at 33891).\n\nv.a.3 Potassium\n\nPotassium is also now considered a nutrient of ""public health significance"" for the general population (81 FR 33742 at 33884). It has been assigned an RDI, instead of a DRV (21 CFR 101.9(8)(iv)). We now require the declaration of both the gram amount and the percent DV for potassium at the bottom of the label, directly following the iron declaration. Potassium is now covered under the term ""mineral"" that appears in each section of 21 CFR 101.9. Any listing of potassium on the Nutrition Facts label must meet the specific nutrient declaration requirements for minerals under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4), 101.9(g)(4)(i), 101.9(g)(4)(ii), and 101.9(g)(6). These requirements are discussed further in section VII.E ""Has Nutrient Compliance or the Level of Variance Allowed Changed?"" below.\n\nHave There Ben Any Changes to the Definition or Presentation of Nutrients That Were Already Required to Be Declared?\n\nv.b.1 Dietary Fiber\n\nAny dietary fiber declared on the label must meet the new definition of dietary fiber (21 CFR 101.9(c) and (c)(6)(i)), which is discussed in the following section. This definition includes a listing of dietary fiber that FDA has determined should be in the calculation of dietary fiber for declaration on Nutrition Facts labels. The new definition and process to amend the listing of dietary fiber is discussed in this section.\n\nv.b.1.(a) How Is Dietary Fiber Defined?\n\nDietary fiber is now defined as ""non-digestible soluble and insoluble carbohydrates (with 3 or more monomeric units), and lignin that are intrinsic and intact in plants; isolated or synthetic non-digestible carbohydrates (with 3 or more monomeric units) determined by FDA to have physiological effects that are beneficial to human health"" (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)). Soluble fiber and insoluble fiber both must meet this new definition of dietary fiber (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)(A) and (B)).\n\nv.b.1.(a).(i) Which Isolated or Synthetic Non-Digestible Carbohydrate(s) Qualify as Dietary Fiber?\n\nThe following isolated or synthetic non-digestible carbohydrate(s) should be included in the calculation of the amount of dietary fiber, as FDA has determined that they have physiological effects that are beneficial to human health:\n\nBeta-glucan soluble fiber (as described in 21 CFR 101.81(c)(2)(ii)(A));\n\nPsyllium husk (as described in 21 CFR 101.81(c)(2)(ii)(A)(6));\n\nCellulose;\n\nGuar gum;\n\nPectin;\n\nLocust bean gum; and\n\nHydroxypropylmethylcellulose. (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)).\n\nIn the Federal Register of June 15, 2018 (83 FR 27894), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled ""The Declaration of Certain Isolated or Synthetic Non-Digestible Carbohydrates as Dietary Fiber on Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels,"" where we stated that we intend to propose that the following eight non-digestible carbohydrates be added to the definition of dietary fiber, as well:\n\nMixed plant cell wall fibers (a broad category that includes fibers like sugar cane fiber and apple fiber, among many others);\n\nArabinoxylan;\n\nAlginate;\n\nInulin and inulin-type fructans;\n\nHigh amylose starch (resistant starch 2);\n\nGalactooligosaccharide;\n\nPolydextrose; and\n\nResistant maltodextrin/dextrin (see Ref. [4]).\n\nUntil we complete rulemaking to add any additional non-digestible carbohydrates to the regulatory definition of dietary fiber, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion to allow manufacturers to include the eight recognized fibers when calculating the amount of dietary fiber to declare on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels.\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels']","['The amount of added sugars declared on the label must be in grams (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The added sugars definition includes sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. For juice, the serving size is based on volume (e.g., 8 oz. or 240 ml) while the amount of added sugars per serving is based on weight. Therefore, when calculating the weight of added sugars per serving, you may need to consider the densities of both the finished juice product and the single strength juice of the same type. You may choose to arrive at the gram amount of added sugars in different ways. Please see our responses to questions 11 and 12 for examples of how to calculate the amount of added sugars in products containing concentrated fruit juices on both a volume and weight basis.']",0.999999999975,0.3333333333333333
