Applicants should submit the letter of authorization provided to the applicant by the DMF holder which gives authorization to rely on the information in the DMF.34\n\nFootnote 34: 21 CFR 314.420(d). More information on DMFs, as well as the list of DMFs that FDA has received, is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/DrugMasterFilesDMFs/default.htm.\n\n1.12.4: Contains a statement, if applicable, that a request for a proprietary name has been made. An ANDA applicant requesting a proprietary name should submit that request when the ANDA is submitted to help ensure that an acceptable name is available at the time of approval. When requesting a proprietary name, a separate electronic submission should be made and identified as a \"REQUEST FOR PROPRIETARY NAME REVIEW.\"35\n\nFootnote 35: See the guidance for industry Contents of a Complete Submission for the Evaluation of Proprietary Names (Rev.1).\n\nFootnote 36: Section 314.94(a)(3). See also the draft guidance for industry Referencing Approved Drug Products in ANDA Submissions. When final, this guidance will represent the FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\n1.12.11: Contains the basis for submission.37 The applicant should provide: (1) the name of the RLD, (2) the application number of the RLD, and (3) the holder of the application for the RLD.\n\nIf the generic drug differs from the RLD in strength, route of administration, dosage form, or in that one active ingredient is substituted for one of the active ingredients in a listed combination drug product, applicants must first submit a suitability petition to FDA's Division of Dockets Management to obtain permission to file their ANDA.38 FDA will review the suitability petition to determine whether the requested change from the listed drug will impact the safety and effectiveness of the generic product and if any applicable requirements of the Pediatric Research Equity Act may be waived. The suitability petition must be approved by FDA before the ANDA is submitted.39 For an ANDA based on an approved petition under 21 CFR 10.30 or 314.93, the name of the RLD in section 1.12.11 must be the same as the listed drug in the petition, and section 1.12.11 must contain the FDA docket number for the petition and a copy of FDA's correspondence approving the suitability petition.40 When an applicant submits a petitioned ANDA, the basis for submission is the RLD and the approved suitability petition. Section 1.12.11 should contain (1) the name of the RLD, which must be the same as the listed drug identified in the approved suitability petition, (2) a reference to the suitability petition's FDA-assigned document number, and (3) a copy of FDA's correspondence approving the suitability petition.41({}^{,})42 When an ANDA applicant seeks approval of a generic drug that is a duplicate of adrug product in an approved petitioned ANDA (and for which the same drug has not been approved under section 505(c) of the FD&C Act), the basis for submission is the RLD and the approved suitability petition. Section 1.12.11 should contain: (1) the RLD, which must be the same as the listed drug identified in the approved suitability petition, and RLD application number; (2) a reference to the suitability petition's FDA-assigned docket number; and (3) a copy of FDA's correspondence approving the suitability petition. The first petitioned ANDA approved should be used for and identified in the appropriate sections of a subsequent ANDA as the reference standard. However, the RLD for that subsequent ANDA remains the listed drug referenced in the approved suitability petition.43\n\nFootnote 43: See the draft guidance for industry Referencing Approved Drug Products in ANDA Submissions.\n\n1.12.12 Contains information demonstrating that the generic product is the same as the RLD.44_Same as_ means that the generic product is identical to the RLD in \"active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use, except that conditions of use for which approval cannot be granted because of exclusivity or an existing patent may be omitted.\"45 To demonstrate that the proposed generic drug product meets this standard, applicants should provide:\n\nFootnote 44: See section 505(j)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act and \u00a7 314.94.\n\nFootnote 45: 21 CFR 314.92(a)(1).\n\nFootnote 46: Section 314.94(a)(4).\n\nFootnote 47: Section 314.94(a)(5).\n\nFootnote 48: Section 314.94(a)(6).\n\nFootnote 49: See the guidance for industry Variations in Drug Products That May Be Included in a Single ANDA for exceptions.\n\nA statement that the conditions of use for the generic product have been previously approved for the RLD46\n\nFootnote 47: See the draft guidance for industry Referencing Approved Drug Products in ANDA Submissions.\n\nInformation to show that the active ingredient(s) in the generic drug product is/are the same as the active ingredient(s) in the RLD47\n\nFootnote 48: See section 505(j)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act and \u00a7 314.94.\n\nFootnote 49: 21 CFR 314.92(a)(1).\n\nFootnote 46: Section 314.94(a)(4).\n\nFootnote 47: Section 314.94(a)(5).\n\nFootnote 48: Section 314.94(a)(6).\n\nFootnote 49: See the guidance for industry Variations in Drug Products That May Be Included in a Single ANDA for exceptions.\n\nInformation to show that the route of administration, dosage form, and strength of the generic drug product are the same as those of the RLD48\n\nFootnote 49: See the guidance for industry Variations in Drug Products That May Be Included in a Single ANDA for exceptions.\n\nAs applicable, information to indicate the strength of the generic drug product used in the in vivo bioequivalence (BE) studies (fasting and fed) to demonstrate BE of the generic drug product to the RLD\n\nFDA recommends that applicants submit, within their original application, all strengths that they intend to market.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended for holders of Type II active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) drug master files (DMFs) that are or will be referenced in an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), an amendment to an ANDA, a prior approval supplement (PAS) to an ANDA, or an amendment to a PAS (generic drug submissions). The guidance explains that, as of October 1, 2012, under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012, commonly referred to as GDUFA:2\n\nFootnote 2: Public Law 112-144, Title III.\n\nDMF holders are required to pay a DMF fee when first authorizing the reference of their DMF in a generic application3 Footnote 3: For these purposes, such authorization is deemed to have occurred when the DMF \u201cis referenced on or after October 1, 2012, in a generic drug submission by an initial letter of authorization,\u201d Section 744B(a)(2)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 379j-42(a)(2)(A).\n\nType II API DMFs must undergo an FDA completeness assessment (CA)\n\nThe guidance makes recommendations about the information that should be included in the DMF to facilitate a GDUFA CA. The guidance does not apply to Type II API DMFs used to support new drug applications (NDAs), biologics license applications (BLAs),4 other submissions that are not generic drug submissions, or any other types of DMFs.5\n\nFootnote 4: Type II API, API intermediate, and drug product DMFs are not used to support BLAs submitted pursuant to sections 351(a) and 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262).\n\nFootnote 5: See section 744A(7) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 379j-41(7)).\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nUnder GDUFA, beginning October 1, 2012, the holder of a Type II API DMF must pay a one-time DMF fee when the DMF is first referenced in a generic drug submission submitted to FDA on the basis of a letter of authorization (LOA) from the DMF holder.6 Also under GDUFA, holders of Type II API DMFs that were evaluated before October 1, 2012, must pay a one-time fee for the DMF when their DMF is first referenced in a new ANDA, an ANDA or PAS amendment, or an ANDA PAS on or after October 1, 2012.7 Only Type II API DMFs for use in generic drug submissions incur this one-time fee.\n\nFootnote 6: Section 744B(a)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 379j-42(a)(2)). For discussion of LOAs, see 21 CFR 314.420(b) and 314.50(g)(1).\n\nFootnote 7: The fee amount will be announced in the Federal Register not later than 60 days before the start of the fiscal year (generally on or about August 1 of the previous fiscal year).\n\nUnder GDUFA, Type II API DMFs intended for reference in a generic drug submission for which the fee is paid will undergo a CA. Section 744B(a)(2)(D)(iii) of the FD&C Act requires FDA to make publicly available on its Web site a list of DMF numbers that correspond to DMFs that, having successfully undergone a CA in accordance with criteria to be published by FDA, are available for reference.\n\nAlthough the requirement for a CA for Type II API DMFs is new, FDA has previously evaluated DMFs in accordance with the criteria set out in the GDUFA Completeness Assessment Checklist for Type II API DMFs (CA Checklist), attached to this guidance as Appendix 1. In order to ensure adequate time for the CA, FDA strongly encourages the DMF holder to submit a complete DMF and pay the DMF fee at least 6 months prior to the submission of an ANDA or PAS that will rely on the DMF. When submitting a DMF, the DMF holder should also submit Form FDA 3794, the Generic Drug User Fee Cover Sheet, which includes the minimum information necessary for FDA to determine whether a DMF holder has satisfied all relevant user fee obligations.8\n\nFootnote 8: See http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/UCM322676.pdf.\n\nDMF holders are encouraged to submit their DMFs using the Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) format.9 More information is available on the eCTD format on FDA's Web site.10\n\nFootnote 9: Note that 24 months after the guidance for industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format \u2013 Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specification is finalized (i.e., May 5, 2017), DMFs will be required to be submitted using the eCTD format pursuant to the implementation timeline identified in the final guidance.\n\nFootnote 10: See information about electronic submissions at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/ucm153574.htm.\nFDA will perform a CA once a DMF holder files a Type II API DMF11 with the Form FDA 3794 and there is an initial verification of the fee payment. The CA does not replace the full scientific review, which determines whether the information contained in the DMF is adequate to support an ANDA regulatory action.\n\nFootnote 11: See FDA\u2019s Web site on Drug Master Files at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/DrugMasterFilesDMFs/default.htm.\n\nIn brief, FDA will undertake a CA to determine the following:\n\nIs the DMF active?\n\nHas the fee been paid?\n\nHas the DMF been previously reviewed?\n\nDoes the DMF pertain to a single API?\n\nDoes the DMF contain certain administrative information?\n\nDoes the DMF contain all the information necessary to enable a scientific review?12\n\nFootnote 12: Id.\n\nIs the DMF written in English?13\n\nFootnote 13: If any part of the application is in a foreign language, an accurate and complete English translation shall be appended to such part. See 21 CFR 314.101(d)(5).\n\nFDA will conduct the CA by determining the answers to a series of questions listed in the CA Checklist, which is included in Appendix 1. DMFs for which the fee has been paid and which have been found complete in accordance with the criteria for a CA set out in the CA Checklist will be identified on FDA's public Web site as available for reference in support of a generic drug submission.\n\nFor complex APIs, in addition to the recommendations in the CA Checklist, DMF holders should ensure the DMF provides the data necessary for the Agency to review the DMF with respect to active ingredient sameness. Information on active ingredient sameness is discussed in the product's specific bioequivalence (BE) guidance when it becomes available on FDA's Web site.14\n\nFootnote 14: For example, for enoxaparin sodium: listed sameness equivalence criteria in the draft guidance include mode of depolymerization, source material, physicochemical properties, disaccharide building blocks, fragment mapping, sequence of oligosaccharide species, and biological and biochemical assays. If the appropriate product-specific data is not in the DMF, the DMF will be deemed incomplete.\n\nIn accordance with the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments Reauthorization Performance Goals and Program Enhancements (GDUFA II Commitment Letter),15 FDA committed to complete the initial CA review for 90% of Type II API DMFs within 60 days of the later of the date of DMF submission or DMF fee payment.\n\nFootnote 15: Available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM370352.pdf.\nFDA will use the CA Checklist to perform the CA. At the top of the cover page of the CA Checklist, FDA will fill in basic information about the DMF, including its name, number, receipt date, and whether the DMF was submitted in electronic or paper format.\n\nThe FDA will also note whether the primary DMF the ANDA references refers to any other DMFs (subject DMFs). A primary DMF can reference subject DMFs, which provide additional information needed to completely describe the manufacture of an API.16 Before submitting its DMF, the primary DMF holder should check with the holders of any referenced subject DMFs to make sure the subject DMFs are filed with FDA and FDA still considers them active.\n\nFootnote 16: For example, a subject DMF may describe the manufacture of a material used in producing the active ingredient. If a subject DMF does not meet the definition of a Type II API DMF, it will not incur a DMF fee.\n\nIs the DMF Active?\n\nBefore assigning a DMF to a reviewer for a CA, FDA will confirm that the DMF is active.17 If the primary DMF or any referenced subject DMFs on file at FDA are inactive, FDA will consider the primary DMF incomplete and send a letter notifying the DMF holder.\n\nFootnote 17: \u201cActive\u201d is defined in the Definitions section of this guidance.\n\n2 Has the DMF fee been paid?\n--------------------\nContext title: Completeness Assessments for Type II API DMFs Under GDUFA Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.561610221862793", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 , Do DMF holders need to wait for a new ANDA applicant to request a letter of authorization before the DMF is assessed to be available for reference?\n--------------------\nContext: If the DMF holder addresses all the deficiencies and amends the DMF or completely updates the DMF per the CA request, the FDA will complete its CA. If the DMF is then found complete, the DMF number will be made publicly available on FDA's Web site.\n\nIf a generic drug submission contains all the necessary API information and does not reference a DMF, the generic drug submission applicant will be required to pay the (a)(3)(F) fee.

FDA will not receive - within the meaning of section 505(j)(5)(A) of the FD&C Act70 - a new ANDA or supplement submitted by that person, or any affiliate of that person, until the outstanding fee is paid.71\n\nFootnote 70: This provision references the \u201creceipt\u201d of ANDAs by FDA. The Agency evaluates an ANDA after it is submitted to determine whether it may be received. Receipt of an ANDA means that FDA has made a threshold determination that the ANDA is substantially complete; 21 CFR 314.101(b)(1).\n\nFootnote 71: Section 744B(g)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\n1 DMF Fees\n\nA DMF will be deemed available for reference if both the DMF fee is paid in full and the DMF has not failed an initial completeness assessment. No generic drug submission referencing the DMF will be received unless the fee is paid and the DMF is deemed available for reference.\n\nANDA applicants that reference a DMF for which a fee is due but has not been paid will be provided notification of the DMF holder's failure to satisfy the user fee obligation. If the DMFfee is not paid within 20 calendar days after notification, the generic drug submission referencing the DMF will not be received.72\n\nFootnote 72: Section 744B(g)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 73: Section 744B(g)(3) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 74: Section 744B(a)(3)(F) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 75: Section 744B(g)(3) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 76: Section 744B(g)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAppendix C ANDA Filing Fees\n\nIf an applicant does not submit payment of the ANDA filing fee within 20 calendar days of the due date, its application will be deemed incomplete on the date of submission and will not be received.73 So long as FDA finds that none of the disqualifications outlined in 21 CFR 314.101(d) and (e) apply (i.e., the ANDA is otherwise substantially complete), the application will be considered submitted as of the date all user fee obligations are satisfied in full.\n\nFootnote 73: Id.\n\nAppendix D Fee for API Information Not Included by Reference to DMF - (a)(3)(F) Fee\n\nIf a generic drug applicant submission contains information concerning the manufacture of an API at a facility by means other than reference by a letter of authorization to a Type II API DMF, and a fee equal to the DMF fee has not been previously paid with respect to such submission, then the applicant shall pay a fee in the amount described in section VII.D, in addition to the applicable ANDA filing fee.74 If these fees are not submitted within 20 calendar days of the due date then the submission will not be received.75 So long as FDA finds that none of the disqualifications outlined in 21 CFR 314.101(d) and (e) apply (i.e., the ANDA is otherwise substantially complete), the application will be considered submitted as of the date all user fee obligations are satisfied in full.\n\nFootnote 75: Id.\n\nAppendix E Facility Fees\n\nFailure to pay the facility fee within 20 calendar days of the due date will result in the following penalties:76\n\nFootnote 76: Id.\n\nNo new ANDA or supplement submitted by the person responsible for paying the fee or that person's affiliates will be received.\n\nNo new generic drug submission referencing the facility will be received until the fee is paid.\n\nThe facility will be placed on a publicly available arrears list.\n\nFDA will notify the referencing ANDA applicant of the facility's failure to satisfy its user fee obligations.\n\nFurther, all FDFs or APIs manufactured in the non-paying facility and all FDFs containing APIs manufactured in such a facility will be deemed misbranded.77 This means that it will be a violation of federal law to ship these products in interstate commerce or to import them into the United States. Such violations can result in prosecution of those responsible, injunctions, or seizures of misbranded products. Products deemed misbranded are subject to being denied entry into the United States.\n\nGDUFA Program Fees\n\nFailure to pay the GDUFA program fee within 20 calendar days of the GDUFA program fee due date will result in the following penalties:78\n\nFootnote 78: Section 744B(g)(5) of the FD&C Act.\n\nApplicants will be placed on a publicly available arrears list.\n\nAny ANDAs submitted by the applicant or an affiliate of that applicant will not be received.\n\nFurther, all drugs marketed pursuant to ANDAs held by such applicant or an affiliate of that applicant will be deemed misbranded.79 This means that it will be a violation of federal law to ship these products in interstate commerce or to import them into the United States. Such violations can result in prosecution of those responsible, injunctions, or seizures of misbranded products. Products deemed misbranded are subject to being denied entry into the United States.\n\nFootnote 79: Id.\n\nHowever, if an application or supplement was already received by FDA prior to the applicant being placed in arrears, FDA will continue the review of and accept amendments to those applications.\n\nXII Payment Information and Procedures\n\nThe payment process for GDUFA III is similar to the previous iterations of the program and other FDA user fees. The FDA website80 contains instructions for paying the fees.\n\nFootnote 80: https://www.fda.gov/industry/fda-user-fee-programs/generic-drug-user-fee-amendments.\n\nPayment Procedures for GDUFA Fees\n\nThose responsible for payment of fees enter required information on FDA's User Fee System to generate a GDUFA cover sheet.\n\nThe cover sheet is designed to provide the minimum necessary information to determine if a person has satisfied all relevant user fee obligations.\n\nThe cover sheet is submitted to FDA electronically generating a user fee payment identification number (PIN) to assist in tracking payment.\n\nCover sheets for ANDA filing fees should be submitted with ANDA submissions. The Generic Drug User Fee Cover Sheet and additional payment information is available on the GDUFA website (www.fda.gov/GDUFA).\n\nAcceptable Forms of Payment\n\nPayment must be made in U.S. currency drawn on a U.S. bank.81 Fee payers may pay online by credit card or Automated Clearing House (ACH) electronic check or send payment by check, bank draft, U.S. postal money order, or wire transfer.\n\nFootnote 81: See 87 FR 61601 (October 12, 2022), available at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2022-10-12/pdf/2022-22099.pdf.\n\nTimely Payment of Fees\n\nFDA's expectation is for full and timely payment of all GDUFA fees. Penalties associated with non-payment, including, but not limited to, refusal to receive a generic drug submission, drug product deemed misbranded, and failure of a DMF to be placed on a publicly available reference list, will apply until such obligations are satisfied in full.\n\nOne entity may pay GDUFA fees on behalf of another entity. Those paying fees are responsible for determining all financial institution transaction fees that may be deducted from an entity's authorized amount for payment to FDA. These include wire transfer and foreign exchange fees.\n\nRefund and \"Transfer\" Requests\n\nOther than as described in section VII.A, FDA will only fully refund payments of fees made in error. If a fee was properly incurred, there will be no refund of the payment.\n\nTo qualify for the return of a fee claimed to have been paid in error, a person shall submit to the Secretary a written request justifying such return within 180 calendar days after such fee was paid.82 The format for submitting refund requests is Form FDA 3913, attached as Appendix 1 and available at\n\nFootnote 82: Section 744B(m) of the FD&C Act.\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/UCM492188.pdf.\n\nA Form FDA 3913 written refund request should be submitted to the Division of User Fee Management at CDERCollections@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nFDA no longer permits the administrative action of applying a previously paid GDUFA fee (also referred to as a \"transfer\") from a closed-out fiscal year cover sheet to a different fiscal year cover sheet.83 Instead, payments from closed-out fiscal year cover sheets will only be processed as refunds to the original payors, provided that the request is made within 180 calendar days from when the original payment was made.\n\nRequests for the \"transfer\" of payments within the same fiscal year or open fiscal year may be permitted for the same fee type and for a fee obligation of the same payor, provided that the request is made within 180 calendar days from the original payment date. For example, a request to \"transfer\" a fee payment from a FY 2023 cover sheet to another FY 2023 cover sheetwithin the same fee type (perhaps due to an incorrect FEI) by the same payor will be processed, provided the request is made within 180 calendar days of the original payment date.\n\nAs another example, during September 2023 (FY 2023), an applicant may request a \"transfer\" of a fee to a FY 2024 cover sheet of the same fee type because FY 2023 has not yet been closed-out. However, if an applicant requests a \"transfer\" of a fee from a FY 2023 cover sheet during FY 2024 (beginning October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024), this transaction will not be permitted as FY 2023 has already been closed-out.\n\nTo request a \"transfer,\" applicants should complete Form FDA 3914 and email the form to\n\nCDERCollections@fda.hhs.gov. Form FDA 3914 is attached as Appendix 2 and is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/UCM492195.pdf\n--------------------\nContext title: Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.222951650619507", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 , Do DMF holders need to wait for a new ANDA applicant to request a letter of authorization before the DMF is assessed to be available for reference?\n--------------------\nContext: In accordance with the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments Reauthorization Performance Goals and Program Enhancements (GDUFA II Commitment Letter),15 FDA committed to complete the initial CA review for 90% of Type II API DMFs within 60 days of the later of the date of DMF submission or DMF fee payment.\n\nFootnote 15: Available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM370352.pdf.\nFDA will use the CA Checklist to perform the CA. At the top of the cover page of the CA Checklist, FDA will fill in basic information about the DMF, including its name, number, receipt date, and whether the DMF was submitted in electronic or paper format.\n\nThe FDA will also note whether the primary DMF the ANDA references refers to any other DMFs (subject DMFs). A primary DMF can reference subject DMFs, which provide additional information needed to completely describe the manufacture of an API.16 Before submitting its DMF, the primary DMF holder should check with the holders of any referenced subject DMFs to make sure the subject DMFs are filed with FDA and FDA still considers them active.\n\nFootnote 16: For example, a subject DMF may describe the manufacture of a material used in producing the active ingredient. If a subject DMF does not meet the definition of a Type II API DMF, it will not incur a DMF fee.\n\nIs the DMF Active?\n\nBefore assigning a DMF to a reviewer for a CA, FDA will confirm that the DMF is active.17 If the primary DMF or any referenced subject DMFs on file at FDA are inactive, FDA will consider the primary DMF incomplete and send a letter notifying the DMF holder.\n\nFootnote 17: \u201cActive\u201d is defined in the Definitions section of this guidance.\n\n2 Has the DMF fee been paid?\n\nBefore assigning a DMF to a reviewer for a CA, FDA will confirm that the DMF fee has been paid. If it has not, FDA will not assign the DMF for CA. ANDA applicants that reference a DMF for which a fee is due will be notified that the DMF holder has not paid the fee. If the DMF fee is not paid within 20 days after notification, FDA will refuse to receive the ANDA referencing the DMF.\n\nHas the DMF been previously reviewed for chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) by FDA in the context of a review of a prior application?\n\nIf FDA has reviewed the DMF for CMC after November 30, 2007, the DMF will be considered to have passed the CA without further analysis. If the DMF was reviewed for CMC prior to November 30, 2007, a CA assessment will need to be performed. For all DMFs that have not previously received a full CMC review, a CA assessment will need to be performed. If the DMF has not previously received this full review, it will be assigned to a reviewer for a CA.\n\n3 Check of Completeness Assessment Elements\n\nFDA will complete the administrative part of the CA Checklist (i.e., \"General Information\") during the CA. If the DMF is incomplete, FDA will send the DMF holder a GDUFA DMF Incomplete Letter. With certain exceptions specified in this guidance document, this letter will provide comments about each element that resulted in an incomplete designation for the CA.\n\nIf an item is marked \"n/a\" and does not apply to the DMF, the element is treated the same as if it were marked \"yes.\"1. Is the subject of the DMF a single API produced by one manufacturing process?\n\nThe subject of a DMF should be limited to one API and one manufacturing process. If a DMF includes information on more than one API or more than one manufacturing process for an API, the DMF will be deemed incomplete. If the DMF describes multiple APIs, the DMF holder should file separate DMFs for each API. Similarly, if there are multiple manufacturing processes for an API, the DMF holder should file separate DMFs for each manufacturing process.\n\n2 Does the DMF holder need to submit a complete update?\n\nIf the DMF is in paper format and it has been five years or more since the DMF received a complete update,18 or if there have been more than five amendments to the DMF, the DMF holder should provide a complete and comprehensive update to it. If such a DMF has not received an update, FDA will consider the DMF incomplete. The DMF holder must submit a complete update for FDA to determine whether it passes the CA.19\n\nFDA believes that the remainder of the CA Checklist is self-explanatory.\n\nFootnote 18: All changes must be reported as amendments. Annual reports are NOT to be used to report changes in the DMF.\n\nFootnote 19: The requirement for a complete update does not apply to the DMF if the entire DMF is in eCTD format, which always presents the DMF in its current state. The Agency highly encourages DMF holders to convert the entire DMF into an eCTD submission, which does not require reference to any previous paper submission.\n\n4 Completeness Assessment Outcomes\n\nFollowing the CA, FDA will find the DMF either complete or incomplete.\n\nIf the DMF is found complete, FDA will post the DMF number on a publicly available list on FDA's Web site to indicate the DMF is available for reference by generic drug submission applicants.20 Footnote 20: For the public list of DMFs available for reference, see http://www.fda.gov/gdufa.\n\nIf the DMF is found incomplete, the CA findings and comments will be compiled in a GDUFA DMF Incomplete Letter to the DMF holder that explains why the DMF was deemed incomplete. Information about the CA status of a DMF, other than the lack of a public listing on the FDA's Web site, will not be provided to anyone except the DMF holder and, as necessary, any generic drug submission applicant that the DMF holder has authorized to rely on the DMF.\n\nTo remedy a GDUFA DMF Incomplete Letter and pass the CA, the DMF holder should submit an amendment to its DMF to correct the deficiencies identified in the Incomplete Letter, or, if FDA has determined that the DMF should undergo a complete update, the DMF holder should resubmit the DMF with that update. FDA will then assess the revised DMF's completeness. If there are no deficiencies at this time, FDA will declare the DMF to be complete and to have passed the CA.\n\nAlthough a DMF may be deemed incomplete upon its first CA, FDA will work with DMF holders to provide guidance on how to revise the DMF so it may be found complete after resubmission. Once the DMF passes the CA, FDA will make the DMF number publicly available on its Web site.21 Footnote 21: Under GDUFA, a condition for a Type II API DMF to be considered available for reference is that it \u201chas not failed an initial completeness assessment\u201d (Section 744B(a)(2)(D)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act). FDA does not interpret that provision as disqualifying a DMF if it has ever failed a CA. Instead, FDA considers this condition to be satisfied when, after submission of an amendment or resubmission of the DMF to address deficiencies identified by FDA, FDA finds that the DMF has passed the CA.\n\nV API information included in a generic drug submission\n\nIf a generic drug submission contains all the necessary API information and does not rely on information contained in a DMF, no CA will be performed. Instead, this information will be evaluated during the ANDA filing review.22 However, because GDUFA requires collection of a one-time fee for API information included in a generic drug submission (i.e., an (a)(3)(F) fee),23 the applicant submitting the generic drug submission containing the API information must pay this fee.\n\nFootnote 22: See guidance for industry ANDA Submissions \u2013 Refuse-to-Receive Standards.\n\nFootnote 23: Section 744B(a)(3)(F) of the FD&C Act.\n\nVI Summary\n\nOnce the DMF fee is received, FDA will evaluate the DMF to make sure it meets the CA criteria.\n\nIf the DMF passes the CA, it will be found complete and the DMF number will be made publicly available on FDA's Web site.\n\nIf the DMF fails the CA, FDA will send a GDUFA DMF Incomplete Letter describing to the DMF holder the missing elements in its DMF.\n\nIf the DMF holder addresses all the deficiencies and amends the DMF or completely updates the DMF per the CA request, the FDA will complete its CA. If the DMF is then found complete, the DMF number will be made publicly available on FDA's Web site.\n\nIf a generic drug submission contains all the necessary API information and does not reference a DMF, the generic drug submission applicant will be required to pay the (a)(3)(F) fee. No CA will be conducted.\n\nDefinitions\n\nActive pharmaceutical ingredient24 (as defined by GDUFA):**\n\nFootnote 24: Section 744A(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\n(A) A substance, or a mixture when the substance is unstable or cannot be transported on its own, intended\n\n(i) to be used as a component of a drug; and\n\n(ii) to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure,\n\nmitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any\n\nfunction of the human body; or\n\n(B) a substance intended for final crystallization, purification, or salt formation, or any\n\ncombination of those activities, to become a substance or mixture described in\n\nsubparagraph (A).\n\nActive DMF: A drug master file (DMF) for which the FDA has made a determination that the\n\nDMF was acceptable for filing administratively and is up to date.\n\nDMF holder:25 Designated owner of the DMF, which may be different from the U.S. agent\n\nlisted as the contact.\n\nFootnote 25: See 21 CFR 314.420(a).\n\nGeneric drug submission:26 An abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), an amendment to\n\nan ANDA, a prior approval supplement (PAS) to an ANDA, or an amendment to a PAS.\n\nLetter of authorization (LOA):27 A written statement by the holder or designated U.S. agent or\n\nrepresentative permitting FDA to refer to information in the DMF in support of another\n\nperson's28 generic drug submission.\n\nFootnote 28: Section 744A(12) of the FD&C Act; also see 21 CFR 314.420(a)(2).\n\nType II Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Drug Master Files:29 The submission of API\n--------------------\nContext title: Completeness Assessments for Type II API DMFs Under GDUFA Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.6688386797904968", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 , Do DMF holders need to wait for a new ANDA applicant to request a letter of authorization before the DMF is assessed to be available for reference?\n--------------------\nContext: A statement that the facility is not involved in manufacturing activities52 for any approved ANDA that would incur a fee;\n\nCopies of the facility's communications to the ANDA holder(s) or DMF holder(s); and\n\nA list of all known, approved generic drug submissions and DMFs that reference the facility which has communicated with the ANDA holder(s) and DMF holder(s) (as applicable), but for which there is reason to believe the facility will remain named in the application on the first business day of October.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the facility owner submits this letter after the facility fee due date, and if FDA agrees that a good faith effort has been made by the facility to work with the ANDA holder to withdraw itself without response by the ANDA holder, the facility will be considered withdrawn for user fee purposes for the next fiscal year.53 For purposes of this section and in addition to the actions outlined above, FDA considers a good faith effort by a facility requesting to be withdrawn from an ANDA to include the facility's submission of this letter to FDA no earlier than 30 calendar days following the facility's initial withdrawal request to the ANDA holder, but before the first business day of October, the facility fee due date. Facility owners who fail to submit this letter to the FDA prior to the facility fee due date will be assessed a facility fee for that fiscal year.\n\nFootnote 53: The applicant is still expected to report the change to the approved application in a manner consistent with 21 CFR 314.70.\n\nLetters should be submitted by July 1 or as far in advance of the first business day of October as possible. Letters received after July 1 may not be processed before the first business day of October, in which case facilities will incur the fee if the ANDA holder still has not submitted a post-approval supplement before the first business day of October. The letter should be sent to the following address with a copy to CDERCollections@fda.hhs.gov:\n\nOffice of Generic Drugs (HFD-600)\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCentral Document Room\n\n5901B Ammendale Road\n\nBeltsville, MD 20705\n\nIf a facility is identified in an approved generic drug submission on the first business day of October and the facility is subsequently withdrawn, the fee will not be waived or refunded. Accordingly, withdrawal of a facility from generic drug submissions will not remove the requirement of the facility to pay previously incurred facility fees.\n\nPackagers and Repackagers\n\nPackagers of drug products are considered manufacturers, regardless of whether that packaging is done pursuant to a contract or by the applicant itself. Such facility operations are fee-incurring, and the facility would incur annual FDF facility fees if the conditions in Section VIII are met. A packaging facility may incur only 24 percent of the FDF facility fee if it qualifies as a CMO (see definitions section and Section VIII.D above).54\n\nFootnote 54: Section 744B(b)(2)(C) of the FD&C Act.\n\nA facility is considered a packager for the purposes of GDUFA if it receives product prior to the point in the manufacturing process in which the drug is first packaged in a container/closure system specified in the \"HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING\" section of labeling for an approved ANDA and packages that product into such a container/closure system for the first time. Every ANDA specifies the forms or configuration in which the approved drug product may be packaged and distributed in the \"HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING\"section of approved labeling. For example, if a facility receives bulk drugs and packages them into the containers in which they are marketed, it is a packager.\n\nA facility is also considered a manufacturer if it receives product in a container/closure specified in the \"HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING\" section of labeling for an approved ANDA and applies the FDA-approved prescription package labeling to that product for the first time.\n\nRepackagers are not required to pay facility fees under GDUFA.55 Repackagers include facilities that remove a drug from a primary container/closure system and subdivide the contents into a different primary container/closure system. For example, a facility that takes tablets out of a plastic bottle and packages the tablets into blister packaging is considered a repackager.56\n\nFootnote 55: Section 744A(6)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act, relating to the definition of \u201cfacility.\u201d\n\nFootnote 56: See SPL Industry Technical Specification Information: Electronic Self-Identification of Generic Drug Facilities or Sites (August 2017) at 7.\n\n.2 API-Excipient Mixtures\n\nGenerally, manufacturers of API-excipient mixtures are required to pay the annual FDF facility fee.57 However, GDUFA provides one exception, for fee-paying purposes only, to the definition of FDF as inclusive of in-process materials. GDUFA defines an API-excipient mixture as an API when the mixture is produced because the API is unstable or cannot be transported on its own.58 In such cases, mixing the API with one or more excipients may prevent the loss of one or more critical quality attributes that allow the API to be made into a finished dosage form. Examples include an API mixed with an antioxidant for chemical stability when the API is prone to oxidative degradation or a highly potent API mixed with a polymer to facilitate safe handling. Additional examples include an API-excipient mixture for physical stability to maintain the API's amorphous form or an API mixed with a lubricant to prevent agglomeration or solidification of a powder. When claiming this exception, the rationale should be clearly stated and accompanied by supporting information in the DMF or application, as appropriate, for each excipient added for stability purposes. APIs mixed with one or more excipients for commercial convenience only are not considered to fall under this exception to characterization as FDF.\n\nFootnote 57: Sections 744A(7)(C) and 744B(a)(4)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 58: Section 744A(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\n.3 Atypical APIs\n\nSome ingredients are used as APIs in certain generic drug submissions but are more commonly used as inactive pharmaceutical ingredients (excipients) or as ingredients in non-drug products such as foods. Facilities that manufacture these atypical APIs are subject to API facility fees when the ingredient is intended for use as a component of a drug and furnishes pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and the ingredient is referenced in an approved ANDA.59\n\nFacilities That Cease Manufacturing\n\nA facility incurs annual facility fees as long as it is identified in an approved ANDA and manufacturers or processes any FDF or API, even if the facility has not started commercial-scale production of the API or FDF covered by that submission or if the facility has stopped, temporarily or permanently, the production of that covered API or FDF. See Section VIII.F for a description of how a facility can ensure that it is no longer identified in an ANDA.\n\nThe facility will cease to incur facility fees if (1) it is no longer identified in any approved generic drug submission or (2) it has stopped manufacturing or processing all human APIs and FDFs (including both generic and non-generic FDFs) and the facility or applicant has documented its ceasing of such operations to FDA by following the procedures outlined in Section VIII.F above by the date that the fee is due. If an entity has ceased manufacturing or processing all human APIs and FDFs, the entity no longer qualifies as a facility under GDUFA (see the definition of facility in Section III above).60 Any outstanding fee obligations will, however, remain due.\n\nFootnote 60: Section 744A(6)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act.\n\nA facility that ceases such manufacturing or processing should follow the steps outlined in Section VIII.F so it will be removed from all ANDA references. If a facility goes out of business, it should contact the applicants, DMF holder (if applicable), and FDA to notify the Agency of its status.\n\nFees for Multiple Locations of the Same Entity\n\nIf an entity has multiple sites manufacturing a product approved under a human generic drug submission and those sites are in different geographic locations, each facility is generally assessed an annual facility fee. However, separate buildings within close proximity are considered to be at one geographic location or address if the activities in them are:\n\nClosely related to the same business enterprise;\n\nUnder the supervision of the same local management; and\n\nCapable of being inspected by FDA during a single inspection.61\n\nFootnote 61: Section 744A(6) of the FD&C Act. The statute further states that if a business or other entity would meet the definition of a facility but for being under multiple management, the business or entity is deemed to constitute multiple facilities, one per management entity, for purposes of this paragraph.\n\nThese are the same criteria used by FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs to evaluate whether separate FDA Facility Establishment Identifiers (FEIs) are necessary for multiple facilities.62\n\nFootnote 62: See FDA\u2019s guidance for industry Self-Identification of Generic Drug Facilities, Sites, and Organizations(September 2016).\n\nIf an entity believes that multiple FEIs have been assigned in error or that its separate facilities qualify for a single FEI, the entity may request consolidation of the FEIs. Domestic entities should submit the request to the appropriate FDA district office. Contact information is availableat http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ICECI/Inspections/IOM/UCM123522.pdf. Foreign entities should contact FDAGDUFAFEIRequest@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nOnce a facility fee has been incurred, the fee is not waived, reduced, or refunded if FDA subsequently agrees to consolidate FEI numbers.\n--------------------\nContext title: Assessing User Fees Under the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.5204566121101379"], "According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n--------------------\nContext: Consumer Antiseptic\n\nWash Final Rule\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\n(Small Entity Compliance Guide)\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nJuly 2017\n\nOTC\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nConsumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Regulatory Policy and Division of Nonprescription Drug Products in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n(Small Entity Compliance Guide)\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public.

To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to help small businesses better understand and comply with the final rule establishing that certain active ingredients used in over-the-counter (OTC) consumer antiseptic wash products are not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE), and thus, are ineligible for inclusion in the OTC topical antiseptic monograph. On September 6, 2016, FDA published a final rule that finalizes the nonmonograph status of 19 active ingredients, including triclosan and triclocarban, which are intended for use in OTC consumer antiseptic wash products (81 FR 61106) (Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule). Three active ingredients-- benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and chloroxylenol -- were deferred from the final rule to allow more time for sponsors who proposed to complete the studies necessary to fill the safety and effectiveness data gaps identified for these ingredients. These deferrals are for one year, subject to renewal if adequate progress is made in filling the data gaps.\n\nThe final rule applies to consumer antiseptic wash products that are intended for use with water and are rinsed off after use, including consumer hand washes and consumer body washes. No additional safety or effectiveness data were submitted to support monograph conditions for the 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients. Therefore, with the exception of the three deferred active ingredients, this rule finalizes the nonmonograph status of the remaining 19 active ingredients which are found to be not GRASE for use in consumer antiseptic wash products. Consumer antiseptic wash drug products containing one or more of these non-GRASE active ingredients will be considered new drugs for which approved new drug applications (NDAs) are required for marketing (21 USC 355(a)). The Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule is effective September 6, 2017.\n\nFDA has prepared this guidance in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28)2 to assist small businesses in complying with the Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule.\n\nFootnote 2: 5 U.S.C. 601 (note).\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.\n\nInstead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nThe final rule finalizes the Consumer Antiseptic Wash Proposed Rule published in the Federal Register of December 17, 2013 (78 FR 76444) (2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR) and amends the 1994 tentative final monograph (TFM) for OTC antiseptic drug products that published in the Federal Register of June 17, 1994 (59 FR 31402) (the 1994 TFM). The final rule is part of FDA's ongoing rulemaking to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of OTC drug products marketed in the United States on or before May 1972 (OTC Drug Review). The Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule is one of three OTC topical antiseptic rules involving triclosan required to be published pursuant to a Consent Decree entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on November 21, 2013, in Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. V. United States Food and Drug Administration, et al., 10 Civ. 569 (S.D.N.Y.).\n\nAs explained in the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR, new information on potential risks posed by the use of certain consumer antiseptic washes prompted us to reevaluate the data needed for classifying consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients as generally recognized as effective (GRAE). As a result, we proposed that the risk from the use of a consumer antiseptic wash drug product must be balanced by a demonstration -- through studies that demonstrate a direct clinical benefit (i.e., a reduction of infection) -- that the product is superior to washing with nonantibacterial soap and water in reducing infection. In the final rule, we determined that the data and information submitted for 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients were insufficient to demonstrate that there is any additional benefit from the use of these active ingredients in consumer antiseptic wash products compared to nonantibacterial soap and water. Consequently, we found that the available data do not support a GRAE determination for the 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients.\n\nAs also explained in the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR, several important scientific developments that affect the safety evaluation of consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients have occurred since FDA's 1994 evaluation of the safety of consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients under the OTC Drug Review. New data suggest that the systemic exposure to some of these active ingredients is higher than previously thought, and new information about the potential risks from systemic absorption and long-term exposure is now available. New safety information also suggests that widespread antiseptic use could have an impact on the development of bacterial resistance. Accordingly, to support a classification of generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients, we proposed that additional safety data are needed to demonstrate that these ingredients meet current safety standards. We determined in the final rule that the available information and published data for 19 active ingredients were insufficient to establish the safety of long-term, daily repeated exposure to these active ingredients for use in consumer antiseptic wash products.\n\nConsequently, we found that the available data do not support a GRAS determination for the 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients.\n\nThe final rule finalizes the nonmonograph status of 19 active ingredients, including triclosan and triclocarbon, which are intended for use in consumer antiseptic wash products. As explained, either no additional data were submitted or the data and information that were submitted were not sufficient to support monograph conditions for these 19 consumer antiseptic wash ingredients. Therefore, in the final rule, we found that these 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients are not GRASE. Accordingly, consumer antiseptic wash drug products that contain one or more of these 19 active ingredients are misbranded under section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 352) and are considered new drugs under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(p)) for which approved applications under section 505 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 355) and part 314 (21 CFR part 314) of the Code of Federal Regulations are required for marketing.\n\nIn response to several comments submitted to the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR, FDA has deferred further rulemaking on three specific active ingredients used in OTC consumer antiseptic wash products to allow for the development and submission of new safety and effectiveness data to the record for these ingredients. The deferred active ingredients are benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and chloroxylenol. Accordingly, FDA does not make a GRASE determination for these three active ingredients in the Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule. The monograph or new drug status of these three ingredients will be addressed either after completion and analysis of ongoing studies to address the safety and effectiveness data gaps of these ingredients or at a future date if these studies are not completed.\n\n3 Questions and Answers\n\nWhat active ingredients are subject to this final rule?\n\nIn the final rule, we found that there are 22 active ingredients eligible for the OTC Drug Review for use as a consumer antiseptic wash. An OTC drug is covered by the OTC Drug Review if its conditions of use existed in the OTC drug marketplace on or before May 11, 1972 (37 FR 9464).3 As noted above, three of these active ingredients have been deferred from this rulemaking. The 19 remaining ingredients found eligible for the OTC Drug Review for use in consumer antiseptic wash products and subject to this final rule are:\n\nClofilucarban\n\nFluorosalan\n\nHexachlorophene\n\nHexylresorcinol\n\nIodophors (Iodine-containing ingredients)\n\nIodine complex (ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate)\n\nIodine complex (phosphate ester of alkylaryloxy polyethylene glycol)\n\nNonylphenoxypoly (ethyleneoxy) ethanoliodine\n\nPoloxamer-iodine complex\n\nUndecoylium chloride iodine complex\n\nMethylbenzetmonium chloride\n--------------------\nContext title: Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.043999195098877", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n--------------------\nContext: In response to several comments submitted to the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR, FDA has deferred further rulemaking on three specific active ingredients used in OTC consumer antiseptic wash products to allow for the development and submission of new safety and effectiveness data to the record for these ingredients. The deferred active ingredients are benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and chloroxylenol. Accordingly, FDA does not make a GRASE determination for these three active ingredients in the Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule. The monograph or new drug status of these three ingredients will be addressed either after completion and analysis of ongoing studies to address the safety and effectiveness data gaps of these ingredients or at a future date if these studies are not completed.\n\n3 Questions and Answers\n\nWhat active ingredients are subject to this final rule?\n\nIn the final rule, we found that there are 22 active ingredients eligible for the OTC Drug Review for use as a consumer antiseptic wash. An OTC drug is covered by the OTC Drug Review if its conditions of use existed in the OTC drug marketplace on or before May 11, 1972 (37 FR 9464).3 As noted above, three of these active ingredients have been deferred from this rulemaking. The 19 remaining ingredients found eligible for the OTC Drug Review for use in consumer antiseptic wash products and subject to this final rule are:\n\nClofilucarban\n\nFluorosalan\n\nHexachlorophene\n\nHexylresorcinol\n\nIodophors (Iodine-containing ingredients)\n\nIodine complex (ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate)\n\nIodine complex (phosphate ester of alkylaryloxy polyethylene glycol)\n\nNonylphenoxypoly (ethyleneoxy) ethanoliodine\n\nPoloxamer-iodine complex\n\nUndecoylium chloride iodine complex\n\nMethylbenzetmonium chloride\n\nPhenol4 Footnote 4: Although phenol is listed twice in the final rule as \u201cgreater than 1.5 percent\u201d and \u201cless than 1.5 percent\u201d, phenol\u2014regardless of concentration\u2014is eligible for the OTC Drug Review but was found to be not GRASE for use in consumer antiseptic wash products.\n\nSecondary amyltricresols\n\nSodium oxychlororesene\n\nTribromsalan\n\nTriclocarban\n\nTricosan\n\nTriple dye Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn the final rule, we also found certain other active ingredients ineligible for evaluation under the OTC Drug Review as a consumer antiseptic wash because insufficient information was submitted to show that their conditions of use existed in the OTC drug marketplace on or before May 11, 1972. FDA considers a drug that is ineligible for inclusion in the OTC monograph system to be a new drug that will require FDA approval through the NDA process (21 CFR Part 314). The ineligible active ingredients are:\n\nAlcohol (ethyl alcohol)\n\nBenzalkonium cetyl phosphate\n\nCetylpyridinium chloride\n\nChlorhexidine gluconate\n\nIsopropyl alcohol\n\nPolyhexamethylene biguanide\n\nSalicylic acid\n\nSodium hypochlorite\n\nTea tree oil\n\nCombination of potassium vegetable oil solution, phosphate sequestering agent, and triethanolamine\n\n1 Q2. What antiseptic products are covered by the final rule?\n\nThe Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule covers the group of products referred to as \"consumer antiseptic washes.\" Consumer antiseptic washes include a variety of personal care products that are intended for use with water and are rinsed off after use, such as antibacterial soaps, antibacterial hand washes, and antibacterial body washes. These products may be used by the general population for personal use in the home and public settings on a frequent, daily basis.\n\nThis final rule does not cover or have an impact on the monograph status of other OTC antiseptic products, including: (1) consumer antiseptic rubs, which are products that are not rinsed off after use such as hand rubs (i.e., \"hand sanitizers\") and antibacterial wipes; (2) health care antiseptic, which are antiseptic products that are intended for use by health care professionals in a hospital setting or other health care situations outside the hospital; (3) first aid antisetics; and (4) antisetics used by the food industry. The monograph status of the active ingredients intended for use in these other OTC antiseptic products will be addressed separately.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nQ3. What is the significance of triclosan and triclocarban under this final rule?\n\nBased on available data, triclosan and triclocarban have been two of the most widely used OTC consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients on the market -- with triclosan being used primarily in liquid antiseptic soaps and triclocarban being used primarily in bar antiseptic soaps. Emerging research shows that some antibacterial ingredients could pose health risks. For example, some data suggest that triclosan and triclocarban can cause alterations in thyroid, reproductive growth, and developmental systems of neonatal and adolescent animals. Because consumer antiseptic washes are chronic use products, evaluation of the potential for chronic toxicity and the effects on reproduction and development are essential to the safety assessment of these active ingredients.\n\nAs explained in the final rule, insufficient data were submitted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of triclosan and triclocarban for use as a consumer antiseptic wash product, and thus, we found that triclosan and triclocarban are not GRASE for use in consumer antiseptic wash products. Accordingly, to continue marketing as of the effective date of the final rule, OTC consumer antiseptic wash products containing triclosan or triclocarban will require (1) reformulation to remove triclosan or triclocarban and relabeling of the reformulated products; or (2) approval of a new drug application.\n\nWhen and how do manufacturers have to comply with this final rule?\n\nThe Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule is effective September 6, 2017. In the final rule we found active ingredients to be either ineligible for inclusion in the OTC monograph system or not to be GRASE. On or after September 6, 2017, any OTC consumer antiseptic wash drug products containing such ingredients are misbranded and cannot be initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless it is the subject of an approved NDA. This means that manufacturers will need to obtain an NDA to market consumer antiseptic wash drug products containing any of these 19 active ingredients. Alternatively, manufacturers of consumer antiseptic washes containing nonmonograph antiseptic active ingredients can comply with this final rule by removing the products from the market or reformulating those products to remove the nonmonograph antiseptic active ingredient and marketing the products as soaps or washes without antibacterial claims.\n\nWhat are the effectiveness criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n\nFDA's OTC regulations (21 CFR 330.10(a)(4)(ii)) define the standards for establishing an OTC active ingredient as GRAE. These regulations require the effectiveness of active ingredients for OTC drug products be demonstrated by controlled clinical trials (SSSS 330.10(a)(4)(ii) and 314.126(b)), unless this requirement is waived as provided in SS 330.10(a)(4)(ii). These studies must be well controlled and able to distinguish the effect of a drug from other influences, such as a spontaneous change in the course of the disease, placebo effect, or biased observation (SS 314.126(a)).\n\nThe controlled clinical trials required by FDA's regulations are intended to demonstrate that the pharmacological effect of the drug when used under adequate directions for use will provide clinically significant relief of the type claimed, i.e., efficacy for the stated indication.\n\nAccordingly, to demonstrate the GRAE status of consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients, the effectiveness criteria include conducting adequate clinical outcome studies that identify the conditions of use on which an antiseptic active ingredient can demonstrate a reduction in the number of infections. Specifically, the risk from the use of a consumer antiseptic wash drug product must be balanced by a demonstration -- through studies that demonstrate a direct clinical benefit (i.e., a reduction of infection) -- that the product is superior to washing with nonantibacterial soap and water in reducing infection. To determine that the active ingredient is GRAE, the clinical outcome studies should include at least two arms: the final formulation of the product and the vehicle. The effectiveness of the active ingredient, and hence its contribution in the reduction of infection, is determined by comparing the infection rate in a consumer population washing with the antiseptic product that contains the active ingredient in question to the infection rate in a consumer population washing with the vehicle alone.\n\nThe requirement for clinical outcome studies is based on the fact that there are insufficient data to demonstrate a direct benefit from the use of consumer antiseptic washes compared to nonantibacterial soap and water. The log reduction standard (a clinical simulation standard) proposed in the 1994 TFM, which was based on a non-validated surrogate endpoint (i.e., number of bacteria removed from the skin), is insufficient for establishing the effectiveness of consumer antiseptic washes. In addition, existing data cannot demonstrate a correlation between log reductions of bacteria achieved by antiseptic hand washing in surrogate testing and the reduction of infection. Thus, in consumer settings where soap and water are readily available, the benefit of using an antiseptic wash product must be supported by these clinical outcome studies.\n--------------------\nContext title: Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.760577201843262", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n--------------------\nContext: Accordingly, to demonstrate the GRAE status of consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients, the effectiveness criteria include conducting adequate clinical outcome studies that identify the conditions of use on which an antiseptic active ingredient can demonstrate a reduction in the number of infections.

Thus, in consumer settings where soap and water are readily available, the benefit of using an antiseptic wash product must be supported by these clinical outcome studies.\n\nIn addition to the clinical outcome studies, the effectiveness criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients include an in vitro study consisting of a modified time-kill assay that must be conducted with selected reference organisms and their respective clinical isolates, which are representative of bacterial strains most commonly encountered in general consumer settings. The purpose of the in vitro study is to characterize the antimicrobial activity of the active ingredients used in consumer antiseptic wash products.\n\nWhat are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n\nAs explained in the rulemaking, the safety data needed to make a GRAS determination for active ingredients used in consumer antiseptic washes are based on several important scientific developments that affect the safety evaluation of these active ingredients. New data suggest that the systemic exposure to these active ingredients is higher than previously thought, and new information about the potential risks from systemic absorption and long-term exposure has become available. Moreover, new safety information also suggests that widespread antiseptic use can have an impact on the development of bacterial resistance. Accordingly, the safety data needed to demonstrate safety for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients fall into three broad categories: (1) safety data studies in current FDA guidance (e.g., preclinical and human pharmacokinetic studies (including maximal use trials, developmental and reproductive toxicity studies, and carcinogenicity studies); (2) data to characterize potential hormonal effects; and (3) data to evaluate the development of resistance. These data requirements are the minimum data necessary to establish the safety of long-term, daily, repeated exposure to antiseptic active ingredients used in consumer wash products (81 FR 61106 at 61107).\n\nWhy did FDA find the 19 active ingredients to be not GRASE?\n\nWith respect to effectiveness, in the final rule we found that the data and information submitted for the 19 active ingredients were insufficient to demonstrate that there was any additional benefit from the use of these active ingredients in consumer antiseptic wash products compared to nonantibacterial soap and water in reducing infection. Consequently, we found that the available data did not support a GRAE determination for these 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients.\n\nWith respect to safety, in the final rule we found that the available information and published data for the 19 active ingredients were insufficient to establish the safety of long-term, daily repeated exposure to these active ingredients used in consumer antiseptic wash products. Consequently, we found that the available data did not support a GRAS determination for these 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients.\n\nWhat information did FDA rely on to make its GRASE Determinations?\n\nFDA issued this final rule based on its evaluation of the available information, including the published literature, the received comments, and all the data that were submitted to the rulemaking on the safety and effectiveness of the 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients. The decisions in the final rule are also based on the recommendations of the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee,5 as well as recommendations from other public meetings held by the Agency on antiseptics.\n\nFootnote 5: See transcript of the January 22, 1997, Meeting of the Joint Nonprescription Drugs and Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committees, OTC. Available at https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/05/transcripts/2005-4098T1.htm; also, see transcript of the October 20, 2005, Meeting of the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee, 2005. Available at https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/05/transcripts/2005-4184T1.pdf.\n\nWhy did FDA not address final formulation testing or labeling in this final rule\n\nWe did not address final product formulation testing or labeling requirements in this final rule because none of the 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients that are the subject of this final rule were found to be GRASE for use in consumer antiseptic wash products. Final formulation testing and labeling for the deferred ingredients may be addressed in the future once their GRASE determination is concluded.\n\nWhy were three consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients deferred from this final rule?\n\nAs explained in the final rule, we understood that, in certain circumstances, planning, implementing, and analyzing the data generated from the safety and effectiveness studies can be a time-consuming process that may not be completed within the period granted for submission of additional data in response to the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR (78 FR 76444).\n\nAccordingly, in the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Wash PR, we provided a process for seeking an extension of time to submit the required safety and effectiveness data if needed. We stated that we would consider all the data and information submitted to the record in conjunction with all timely and completed requests to extend the timeline to finalize the monograph status for a given ingredient. Consideration for deferral for an ingredient was given to requests with clear statements of intent to conduct the necessary studies required to fill all the data gaps identified in the proposed rule for that ingredient.\n\nAfter analyzing the data and information submitted related to the requests for extensions, we determined that deferral was warranted for three consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients -- benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and chloroxylenol -- to allow more time for interested parties to complete the studies necessary to fill the safety and effectiveness data gaps identified for these ingredients. Thus, these three active ingredients are not included in the final rule and will be addressed either after completion and analysis of ongoing studies to address the safety and effectiveness data gaps of these ingredients or at a later date if these studies are not completed.\n\nWhat is the deferral time period for these three ingredients?\n\nFDA deferred rulemaking on benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and chloroxylenol for 1 year. These deferrals are subject to renewal to permit sponsors to conduct the necessary studies to address the data gaps. On March 24, 2017, we renewed these deferrals for another 1-year period, subject to renewal. If the studies in progress do not appear, in FDA's judgment, to be productive, the Agency expects that it will proceed to rulemaking for these ingredients after this deferral stage.\n\nTo facilitate this process, as laid out in the deferral letters, sponsors submitted clear statements of intent to conduct all necessary studies and submitted full study outcomes reports to the public docket. Further detail on the necessary studies, including FDA's guidance on study objectives and design for certain studies, can be found on the Agency's Antiseptic FDA Letters website available at https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/InformationbyDrugClass/ucm538131.htm.\n\nWhere can I get more information, if needed?\n\nQuestions regarding compliance with the Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule should be directed to CDERCompliance@fda.hhs.gov. Questions regarding other OTC issues should be directed to OTCDrugs@fda.hhs.gov.\n--------------------\nContext title: Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.5624139308929443", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n--------------------\nContext: In response to several requests submitted to the 2016 Consumer Antiseptic - Rub PR, FDA temporarily - deferred a GRAS/GRAE - determination - for three active ingredients--benzalkonium chloride, - ethyl alcohol, and isopropyl alcohol-to allow time for interested parties to complete the studies necessary to fill - the safety and effectiveness data gaps identified - for these ingredients.\n\nAs a result of the deferrals, the Consumer - Antiseptic - Rub FR does not include - a determination - on the GRAS/GRAE status of benzalkonium - chloride, ethyl alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol for use in consumer antiseptic - rubs.

Under 505G(a)(3) of the FD&C Act, drugs that were classified as category III in a tentative final monograph (TFM), including the 1994 TFM for over-the-counter topical antiseptic (59 FR 31402) - as further amended by the 2016 Consumer Antiseptic - Rub proposed rule (81 FR 42912) - are not required to have an approved application under section 505 in order to be marketed, as long as they are in conformity with the relevant conditions of use outlined in the applicable TFM and comply with all other applicable requirements for nonprescription drugs.\n\nThe Consumer Antiseptic - Rub FR covers OTC consumer antiseptic - rub products - that are sometimes - referred to as rubs, leave-on products, or hand sanitizers. The Consumer AntisepticRub FR also covers OTC consumer antiseptic - wipes.

FDA specifically requests that sponsors provide the following information:\n\nA summary of all potentially associated serious adverse drug experiences.\n\nA summary of all available potentially associated nonserious adverse drug experiences.\n\nA summary of expected or frequently reported side effects, whether serious or nonserious.\n\nCopies of all available reports of potentially associated serious adverse drug experiences. Each report submitted should be in the form of an individual case safety report as described in 21 CFR 314.80 and refer only to an individual consumer or to a single attached publication.\n\nAny available safety information from studies of safety and effectiveness in humans.\n\nRelevant medical literature describing associated adverse events.\n\nEnglish translations should be provided for all foreign language materials.\n\nFor products marketed outside the United States, submissions should also state whether each country's system allows for adverse event reporting and, if so, how each country's system identifies and collects the adverse event information.30 If adverse event information is not available from all countries where the active ingredient has been marketed in OTC sunscreen products, the sponsor should provide an explanation for the missing data. It is important to note, however, that even when countries have an adverse event reporting system that includes sunscreen products, underreporting is a significant limitation of any system that depends on spontaneous reports.\n\nFootnote 30: See, e.g., 21 CFR 330.14(c)(2)(v).\n\nMany factors can influence whether an adverse event is reported, including whether a possible relationship between the event and an ingredient or product is recognized by consumers or health care providers. For example, adverse events that occur many years after a causal drug exposure may not be recognized as being related to that exposure, especially if the background rate of those adverse events is high (e.g., a common cancer or a developmental problem). Thus, an absence of reports does not necessarily equate to an absence of adverse events. Despite the limitations of adverse event reporting, FDA considers postmarketing data to be relevant both tothe overall GRASE assessment of OTC sunscreen active ingredients and to labeling considerations because these data may reveal safety signals not otherwise observed in clinical or nonclinical testing.\n\nIV Effectiveness Data\n\nFDA's OTC drug regulations generally identify both the types of effectiveness information that sponsors should submit as evidence that a drug product containing an active ingredient or other OTC drug condition could be GRASE for use as labeled (SS 330.10(a)(2)) and the standard by which effectiveness is to be judged, which requires controlled clinical investigations to support effectiveness (SS 330.10(a)(4)(ii)).\n\nWhen applying these regulations to each potential sunscreen active ingredient, FDA requests that sponsors provide evidence from at least two adequate and well-controlled SPF studies showing that the active ingredient effectively prevents sunburn, because sunburn prevention is the minimum indication for an OTC sunscreen product. Two adequate and well-controlled SPF studies of the active ingredient at a lower concentration than the maximum requested should be conducted according to established standards.31 These SPF studies should demonstrate that the selected concentration provides an SPF value of 2 or higher.\n\nFootnote 31: FDA expects that the upper bound of any concentration of the active ingredient ultimately established would be governed by the safety data, as well as by efficacy.\n\nThe current standard procedure for SPF testing is described in SS 201.327(i) (21 CFR 201.327(i)).32 Any new SPF tests for a particular ingredient should be performed as described in these regulations, using a test formulation containing the ingredient as the only active ingredient to identify its contribution to the overall SPF test results. These tests should also include a vehicle control arm to rule out any contribution the vehicle may have had on the SPF test results. Finally, as described in SS 201.327(i), an SPF standard formulation comparator arm should be another component of the study design.\n\nFootnote 32: Although this SPF testing procedure is used primarily for final formulation testing of finished products marketed without approved NDAs, it is equally applicable for determining whether or not a sunscreen active ingredient is generally recognized as effective as part of the overall GRASE determination.\n\nCurrent sunscreen testing and labeling regulations in SS 201.327(j) also specify a broad spectrum testing procedure, which provides an in vitro measurement of a sunscreen product's ability to protect against both ultraviolet A and ultraviolet B radiation. Broad spectrum protection is often the result of the combined contribution of multiple active ingredients in a final sunscreen formulation; thus, FDA does not expect that a sunscreen active ingredient would undergo broad spectrum effectiveness testing to establish its effectiveness for a GRASE determination for use in OTC sunscreen products.\n\nUnder SS 201.327, the determination of whether an individual sunscreen product subject to that regulation may be labeled as broad spectrum (and therefore bear the additional claims related to that labeling) is made on a product-specific basis, applying the standard testing methods set forth in those regulations.33 If a sunscreen active ingredient evaluated under the SIA is established to be GRASE for use in nonprescription sunscreens, the final sunscreen order can address broad spectrum testing and related labeling conditions for final sunscreen formulations containing that ingredient.\n\nFootnote 33: These standard testing methods are also described in the guidance for industry Labeling and Effectiveness Testing: Sunscreen Drug Products for Over-The-Counter Human Use\u2014Small Entity Compliance Guide.\n\nV Anticipated final formulation testing\n\nThe preceding sections of this guidance have concentrated on recommendations for safety and effectiveness data needed to support FDA's determination that a sunscreen active ingredient is GRASE for use in sunscreens. FDA's determination that an active ingredient is GRASE will be made in the form of a final sunscreen order that will set out the conditions under which any future product incorporating that sunscreen active ingredient will be GRASE and not misbranded (see section I).34 As noted in section III.1.2, variations among individual sunscreen products--and in particular, aspects of the lotion or other vehicle in which active ingredients are delivered -- can affect their absorption and thus their safety and effectiveness.\n\nFootnote 34: See section 586D(e) of the FD&C Act.\n\nTo address the variability among sunscreen formulations, FDA currently requires final formulation testing of nonprescription sunscreen products to ensure their effectiveness--namely, testing for SPF value as well as broad spectrum protection and water resistance where those attributes are claimed in product labels.35 FDA anticipates that final sunscreen orders issued for sunscreen active ingredients determined to be GRASE under the SIA will also include conditions requiring final formulation testing to ensure the safety of all sunscreen formulations permitted by the order.\n\nFootnote 35: See \u00a7 201.327 for the current requirements for OTC sunscreens containing the active ingredients already evaluated under the monograph system. OTC sunscreens marketed under NDAs provide similar information in their product-specific applications to substantiate their labeling.\n\nThe discussion that follows provides FDA's current thinking about such final formulation safety testing, to be conducted in the future. Note that FDA has not yet determined what particular final formulation testing, if any, will be specified in future final sunscreen orders for any given sunscreen active ingredient. Such requirements will be established on an ingredient-specific basis, taking into consideration the data recommended to be supplied under other parts of this guidance to support a GRASE determination (e.g., whether any safety signals are detected in well-conducted nonclinical carcinogenicity and DART studies). Interested parties can provide relevant information and comments regarding final formulation testing for an individual sunscreen active ingredient as part of the GRASE determination process for that ingredient.\n\nFDA's current thinking is that final formulation safety testing of nonprescription sunscreens would not generally call for an in vivo study. Instead, FDA expects that the conditions of marketing specified for sunscreen active ingredients in final sunscreen orders would require manufacturers to perform in vitro permeation testing before marketing each new formulation.36 Consistent with the approach for final formulation efficacy testing required by SS 201.327, FDA anticipates that it would not review the results of the in vitro final formulation safety testing before product marketing. Rather, FDA expects that final sunscreen orders would require manufacturers to maintain records of this testing; these records would be available to FDA.\n\nFootnote 36: FDA recommends this approach as an alternative to final in vivo (MUsT) testing of final product formulations, which was recommended by the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee (see the response to Discussion Question 2 in the 2014 NDAC Minutes, supra note 15, at 7).\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonprescription Sunscreen Drug Products \u2013 Safety and Effectiveness Data \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.141345024108887", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Direct Final Rule Procedures Guidance for FDA and Industry What are the safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA's specific recommendations on the data and information needed to support a positive GRASE determination under the SIA are detailed in sections II (pharmaceutical quality/manufacturing information), III (safety data), and IV (effectiveness data). Section V presents FDA's current thinking on an approach to safety testing of final sunscreen formulations that it anticipates adopting in the future.\n\nAlthough sunscreen products are typically formulated with two or more active ingredients, the recommendations in sections II through IV generally contemplate that testing will be performed using formulations including one active ingredient FDA anticipates that these data would also generally be sufficient to assess whether, and under what conditions, that active ingredient is GRASE for use as part of a combination of sunscreen active ingredients. In some situations, additional data and testing beyond what is recommended in this guidance may be needed to support a positive GRASE determination and to establish the associated conditions for a particular active ingredient. The following are examples in which additional data may be needed:\n\nData suggest that there may be a safety or efficacy concern with a particular combination of active ingredients or active and inactive ingredients\n\nInformation indicates that an active ingredient is unstable when exposed to sunlight and suggests that the active ingredient may need to be combined with a photostabilizer to be safe or effective\n\nOther situations may occur in which additional data are needed (see, e.g., section III for some additional examples). Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA any questions about whether additional data may be needed for a particular active ingredient.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Pharmaceutical Quality/Manufacturing Information\n\nFDA needs information that sufficiently characterizes the identity of each sunscreen active ingredient for FDA reviewers to determine how, if at all, the safety and efficacy studies submitted for review are relevant to the ingredient for which GRASE determination is sought.10 This information would also be needed to appropriately characterize the active ingredient in the final sunscreen order. Sponsors should provide the compendial status of the ingredient, including reference to a United States Pharmacopeia National Formulary monograph. Sponsors should also provide any known chemical and/or manufacturing characteristics of the active ingredient that may be relevant to FDA's GRASE evaluation and to the establishment of the conditions of any resulting final sunscreen order.11 Such information should include known interactions with other sunscreen active ingredient(s) or commonly used sunscreen vehicle component(s) and particle size information for micronized or nanoscale active ingredients. In addition, sponsors should describe any aspects of formulation that are needed to ensure stability, or other characteristics of the active ingredient that are needed to establish conditions under which it is GRASE for use in sunscreens.\n\nFootnote 11: The determination of whether a sunscreen active ingredient is GRASE and not misbranded also requires the Agency to describe the conditions under which any future product incorporating that sunscreen active ingredient will be GRASE and not misbranded (see, e.g., section 586C(e) of the FD&C Act; see also section V of this document).\n\n3 Safety Data\n\nFDA's OTC drug regulations identify both the general types of safety information that sponsors should submit as evidence that an OTC drug is GRASE for use as labeled (SS 330.10(a)(2) (21 CFR 330.10(a)(2))) and the standard by which such safety information is to be judged (SS 330.10(a)(4)(i)). When applying these regulations to a given active ingredient, FDA uses its scientific expertise to determine what constitutes \"adequate tests by methods reasonably applicable to show the drug is safe under the prescribed, recommended, or suggested conditions of use.\"12\n\nFootnote 12: \u00a7 330.10(a)(4)(i).\n\nFDA recognizes the contribution that broad spectrum sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) value of 15 or higher can make to decrease the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging caused by the sun if used as directed with other sun protection measures. To protect the public health, it is also important for FDA to balance the potential benefits of these sunscreen products to consumers against their potential risks. Providing an adequate safety margin13 for OTC sunscreen active ingredients and finished sunscreen products is a key element of FDA's risk assessment. When determining the specific testing and other data needed to adequately demonstrate that an OTC sunscreen active ingredient is safe, FDA considers both the circumstances under which OTC sunscreen products are intended to be used by consumers and current scientific knowledge and assessment technology.\n\nFootnote 13: For drugs with a known potential for adverse effects based on animal data, the anticipated level of risk for humans may be quantified using a safety margin calculation. A safety margin calculation takes the highest animal no observed adverse effect level and estimates a maximum safe level of exposure for humans. One caveat to the safety margin calculation is that animal studies do not always predict effects in humans, and the actual threshold for an effect in humans may be different (higher or lower) than in the species tested. The human sensitivity to a drug is often unknown. To account for this, the predicted safe exposure level in humans that is reflected in the safety margin is well below where toxicities were seen in animals.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nHuman dermal safety studies for topical products in which exposure to light after application is anticipated generally consist of two sets of studies--those conducted without specific exposure to light and those conducted to assess reactions after ultraviolet exposure (photosafety studies).17 These study sets usually consist of dermal irritation patch testing, dermal sensitization patch testing, dermal phototoxicity testing, and dermal photoallergenicity testing.\n\nFootnote 17: See the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidance for industry S10 Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance Web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidancCompilanceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nBecause marketed sunscreen products typically contain a combination of active ingredients and because brand name product formulations frequently change, it is difficult for FDA to determine causal links between individual active ingredients and reported irritation and hypersensitivity adverse events associated with a particular product. Therefore, FDA generally expects to use data from human irritation studies, human skin sensitization studies, and human photosafety studies, in conjunction with postmarketing adverse event data, to inform GRASE determinations and labeling. Nonetheless, in some cases, depending on the rigor of available postmarketing safety information, it may be reasonable for sponsors to omit human irritation studies, human skin sensitization studies, and/or human photosafety studies. For example, if FDA concludes that there is a positive risk-benefit for a sunscreen active ingredient but that it is known to be a sensitizer, it may be possible to develop safety labeling to address this risk without data generated in the human dermal safety studies described below. Sponsors who believe there is a scientific rationale that may preclude the need for some or all of the described studies are urged to contact FDA before initiating studies.\n\na. Human irritation and sensitization studies\n\nStudies of skin irritation and sensitization that use the repeat insult patch test or other relevant tests are recommended elements in FDA's safety evaluation of topical drug products that, like sunscreens, are applied to the skin repeatedly over long periods of time. These tests, which are designed to detect the potential of topical drug products for local dermatologic events with fewer subjects than might be observed in larger clinical trials, often involve applying product more frequently and/or for longer durations than the proposed clinical dosing of those drug products. In dermal irritation studies, a test substance is applied to a small pad (patch) and affixed to the test subject's skin, usually on the back, to determine whether the ingredient causes direct skin toxicity. Dermal sensitization studies are conducted similarly but are designed to detect immunologically mediated reactions, which require prior exposure to the allergen.\n\nNonprescription sunscreen active ingredients, when found to be GRASE, may be used in numerous, as yet unknown, product formulations. Therefore, FDA recommends that cumulative irritation studies evaluate (1) the proposed sunscreen active ingredient at the highest concentration for which a GRASE determination is sought, in an appropriate vehicle; (2) the vehicle alone; (3) a negative control; and (4) a positive control. The evaluation should include scoring of erythema, edema, and a popular response or skin erosion.\n\nSkin sensitization studies, conducted to detect immunologically mediated reactions, should be conducted in the following three phases:\n\nThe induction phase (three weekly applications for 3 weeks)\n\nThe rest phase (no product application for 10 to 14 days)\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonprescription Sunscreen Drug Products \u2013 Safety and Effectiveness Data \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.643611431121826"], "With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?\n--------------------\nContext: 2718 C.2.4 The sponsor and investigator/institution should maintain a record of where essential records are located, including source records.

Because FDA is generally less likely to be familiar with the research facilities in which OUS investigations are conducted, greater detail is usually needed. It would generally be adequate to identify and describe the academic medical center, hospital, physician's office, clinical research unit or other type of facility at which the investigation was conducted. The description should include enough information to enable FDA to determine the adequacy of the facilities to execute the investigation and meet its requirements (e.g., whether the site is appropriately staffed and equipped to conduct the investigation and is able to provide the appropriate emergent or specialized care, if required).37\n\nFootnote 37: 83 FR 7366, see comment 30.\n\nAdditionally, the GCP standard the sponsor or applicant follows may address information to maintain on investigator and research facility selection.

For example, if a sponsor or applicant chooses, FDA would accept the clinical investigation report as described in Annex D of ISO 14155:2011 as a detailed summary of the protocol and results of the investigation.38\n\nFootnote 38: 83 FR 7366, see comment 31.\n\nA detailed clinical investigation report is commonly submitted for clinical investigations that contribute to the evaluation of the safety or effectiveness of the device for the proposed indication or that otherwise support information included in proposed labeling for the product.

As defined in 21 CFR 860.7, valid scientific evidence is evidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience with a marketed device, from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device under its conditions of use. The evidence required may vary according to the characteristics of the device, its conditions of use, the existence and adequacy of warnings and other restrictions, and the extent of experience with its use. Isolated case reports, random experience, reports lacking sufficient details to permit scientific evaluation, and unsubstantiated opinions are not regarded as valid scientific evidence to show safety or effectiveness.49 Note: the sponsor or applicant should also explain how the OUS data are applicable to the US population and US medical practice.50\n\nFootnote 49: 21 CFR 860.7(c)(2).\n\nFootnote 50: Under 21 CFR 814.15, if a PMA application is based solely on OUS clinical data, the application may be approved if, among other criteria, the OUS clinical data are applicable to the US population and US medical practice.\n\n(7) The name and address of the IEC that reviewed the investigation and a statement that the IEC meets the definition in section 812.3(t) (Section 812.28(b)(7))\n\nWhat does FDA consider an \"adequately constituted\" IEC?\n\nAnswer: FDA regulations at 21 CFR 812.3(t) define an IEC as \"an independent review panel that is responsible for ensuring the protection of the rights, safety, and well-being of subjects involved in a clinical investigation and is adequately constituted to ensure that protection.\" FDA believes an \"adequately constituted\" IEC is one that consists of a reasonable number of members who collectively have the qualifications and experience to review and evaluate the science, medical aspects and ethics of the proposed clinical investigation.\n\nFDA recommends that every nondiscriminatory effort be made to ensure that the IEC composition is not limited to only one gender and that it reflects the social and cultural diversity of the community(ies) from which research participants are most likely to be drawn.51 It is further advised that only those members who are independent of the investigator and the sponsor of the investigation vote on investigation-related matters.52 FDA recognizes that the organization and membership of IECs may differ among countries because of the local needs ofthe host country. Such variation is acceptable as long as the IEC can ensure the protection of the rights, safety, and well-being of human subjects involved in the clinical investigation.\n\nHow may the sponsor or applicant meet the requirement to provide a statement that the IEC meets the definition in section 812.3(t)?\n\nAnswer: The sponsor or applicant is required by 21 CFR 812.28(b)(7) to provide the name and address of the IEC that reviewed the investigation and a statement that the IEC meets the definition in 21 CFR 812.3(t). As stated in the preamble, in addition to the sponsor or applicant, it would be acceptable for the IEC to submit a statement that the IEC that reviewed the investigation meets the definition of an IEC in the rule.53\n\nSponsors and applicants may also consider a waiver request, as described in Section III.C, if they are unable to provide a statement that the IEC meets the definition in section 812.3(t). A waiver request could identify, as an alternative to the statement that the IEC meets the definition in section 812.3(t), a statement that the IEC is organized and operates according to the applicable laws and regulations of the country where it operates and provide a description of the laws and regulations under which the IEC is organized and operates.54 FDA will decide whether to grant or deny a waiver on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all appropriate circumstances.\n\nHow may the sponsor or applicant meet the requirement to maintain information to support the statement required by section 812.28(b)(7) that the IEC meets the definition in section 812.3(t)?\n--------------------\nContext title: Acceptance of Clinical Data to Support Medical Device Applications and Submissions- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.349390029907227", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?\n--------------------\nContext: * 2.10.4 The investigational product(s) should be stored as specified by the sponsor and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirement(s).\n* 2.10.5 The investigator should ensure that the investigational product(s) are used only in accordance with the approved protocol.\n* 2.10.6 Where applicable, the investigator or a person designated by the investigator/institution should explain the correct use of the investigational product(s) to each participant and should check, at intervals appropriate for the trial, that each participant is following the instructions properly.\n* 2.11 Randomisation Procedures and Unblinding\n* 2.11 The investigator should follow the trial's randomisation procedures, if any, and, in the case of an investigator-blinded trial, should ensure that the identification code is broken only in accordance with the protocol. In the case of an emergency, to protect patient safety, the investigator should be prepared and capable from the start of the trial to perform unblinding without undue delay and hinderance.

Source records should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate and complete. Changes to source records should be traceable, should not obscure the original entry and should be explained if necessary (via an audit trail). The investigator should define what is considered to be a source record(s), the methods of data capture and their location prior to starting the trial and should update this definition when needed. Unnecessary transcription steps in between the source record and the data acquisition tool should be avoided.\n* 845 2.12.3 The investigator should have timely access to and be responsible for the timely review of data, including relevant data from external sources (e.g., central laboratory data, centrally read imaging data, other institution's records and, if appropriate, electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) data) which can have an impact on, for example, participant eligibility, treatment or safety.

The Agency does not expect heroic measures to be used, but conditions should be reasonable in light of the nature of the specimen. Storage conditions, which foster accelerated deterioration, should be avoided.\n\nIn section 58.185, it is stated that test and control article identification and characterization must appear in the final report signed by the study director. However, if the study director is affiliated with a contract laboratory, he/she has no need to know such details of a proprietary test article. Do you agree that such information can be appended to the final report by the sponsor rather than be provided by the study director?\n\nYes.\n\nIs the storage of archival material (tissues, slides, raw data) the responsibility of the testing laboratory or can this responsibility be assigned to the sponsor of the study?\n\nThe GLPs permit these materials to be stored in the archives of either the testing laboratory or the sponsor. If they are stored in the sponsor's archives, the archives of the testing laboratory must identify the storage location.\n\nIf a sponsor agrees to characterize and store test articles submitted for study to a contractor, must the contractor also verify the characterization and provide storage for the test articles? No, but the contractor must identify the storage location.\n\nWhat is the \"completion date\" of a nonclinical laboratory study? The completion date is the date that the study director signs the final report. Some discretion must be used however, since the protocol calls for a proposed \"completion date.\" In this case, it would be adequate for the protocol to list a completion date for the in vivo phase and qualify it as such.\n\nWith respect to archival material, what is required to be listed as the date of the study? The study date would be the same as the completion date of the study.\n\nDo all studies on a test article need to be submitted in support of an application for a research or marketing permit? All studies need be submitted, however, not all studies need be conducted in accord with the GLPs. The conforming amendments provide that a statement be included in the submission which identifies which studies have not been conducted in compliance with the GLPs and the extent of the non-compliance.\n\nWhat should be included in the signed and dated reports of the individual scientists participating in the study? The final report prepared by the study director should have appended to it all reports written by other participating scientists. These reports should contain sufficient detail to enable the study director to write a final report, which reflects the results of the study.\n\nSubpart K Disqualification of Testing Facilities\n\n58.200 Purposes\n\n58.202 Grounds for Disqualification\n\n58.204 Notice of And Opportunity for Hearing on Proposed Disqualification\n\n58.210 actions UPON DISQUALIFICATION\n\n58.213 PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION REGARDING\n\nDISQUALIFICATION\n\n58.215 alternative OR ADDtional actions TO DISQUALIFICATION\n\n58.217 suspension OR TERMINATION OF A TESTING FACILITY BY A SPONSOR\n\n58.219 reinstatement OF A DISQUALIFI TESTING FACILITY\n\nENFORCEMENT STRategy\n\nWhat can FDA do to force a laboratory to take corrective actions to achieve compliance with the GLPs? Are warnings given to the laboratory?\n\nFDA has a number of regulatory sanctions, which can be brought to bear on a violative firm in order to, bring about compliance with the law. These include rejection of studies, withdrawal of approval of marketed products if such products are supported by defective studies, prosecution and, after June 20, 1979, disqualification of the laboratory. FDA's present GLP enforcement policy is to provide adequate warning and to afford a reasonable opportunity to take corrective action.\n\nDisqualifying a laboratory on the basis of failing to comply with one or more provisions of the GLPs raises the question of whether all violations are considered-equally, are weighted, or are evaluated scientifically to consider the impact on the outcome of the study.\n\nA laboratory will not be considered for disqualification unless all of the following criteria are met:\n\nThe violations of the various provisions of the GLPs are evaluated to assess their impact on the validity of the studies. It is impossible to assign weights to the various provisions of the GLPs. Noncompliance with the various provisions must be evaluated in the context of the entire laboratory operation and the kinds of studies being performed. Thus, a violation of a specific provision may be critical for one laboratory doing long-term studies and not for another laboratory engaged in short term studies.\n\na. failure to comply with one or more provisions of the GLPs;\n\nb. the noncompliance adversely affected the validity of the studies;\n\nc. other lesser regulatory actions (warnings, rejection of individual studies) have not or will not be adequate to achieve compliance with the GLPs.\n\nIf a laboratory is disqualified, how long does the disqualification last? Under what conditions does reinstatement occur?The disqualification will last until the laboratory submits in writing to the Commissioner, reasons for reinstatement including a detailed description of the corrective actions it has taken to assure that the violations which led to disqualification will not recur. Reinstatement will depend upon one or more inspections which show that the laboratory is in compliance with GLPs.\n\nParagraph 231 of the preamble to the GLPs states: \"The order of disqualification creates a rebuttable presumption that all studies previously conducted by the facility are unacceptable. Paragraph 226 states: \"Studies conducted at facilities that are in substantial compliance will be presumed to be valid.\" Can we presume that studies conducted during a period when a lab is found to be substantially in compliance will be accepted by FDA as valid even if the laboratory is disqualified at a later date?\n\nYes, unless FDA develops information to the contrary.\n4. If a contract laboratory is disqualified because of a study performed for one sponsor, what effect does this have on other studies performed for other sponsors? What about studies underway at the time of disqualification?\n\nFDA will not disqualify a laboratory on the basis of one invalid study. Disqualification is viewed as a most serious regulatory sanction by FDA and will only be imposed when the facts demonstrate that the laboratory is incapable of producing valid scientific data and will not take adequate corrective measures. In the event a laboratory is disqualified, all studies performed by the laboratory, including those in progress are presumed to be unacceptable unless the sponsors of those studies can establish, to the satisfaction of FDA, that the studies were not affected by the circumstances that led to the disqualification.\n5. What steps must be taken by FDA prior to removal of a product from the market because of a rejected study which was pivotal to the assessment of safety?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.575559139251709", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where should the QAU records be retained?\n--------------------\nContext: whether informed consent documents were signed by the subject or the subjects' legally-authorized representative prior to entry in the study (i.e., performance of any study-related procedures);\n\nwhether authority to conduct aspects of the study was delegated, and if so, how the conduct of the study was supervised by the clinical investigator2;\n\nwhere specific aspects of the investigation were performed;\n\nhow the study data were obtained and where the study data were recorded;\n\naccountability for the investigational product, including shipping records and disposition of unused investigational product;\n\nwhether the clinical investigator disclosed information regarding his financial interests to the sponsor and/or interests of any subinvestigator(s), spouse(s) and dependent children3;\n\nthe monitor's communications with the clinical investigator;\n\nthe monitor's evaluations of the progress of the investigation; and\n\ncorrective actions in response to previous FDA inspections, if any, and regulatory correspondence or sponsor and/or monitor correspondence.\n\nFootnote 2: Clinical investigators either conduct a clinical trial or are the responsible party of a team of investigators. See 21 CFR 312.3 and 812.3(i). The clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects under the investigator\u2019s care. See 21 CFR 312.60 and 812.100. For further information, refer to \u201cGuidance for Industry: Investigator Responsibilities \u2014 Protecting the Rights, Safety, and Welfare of Study Subjects\u201d: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM187772.pdf.\n\nFootnote 3: See generally 21 CFR part 54 for requirements related to financial disclosures by clinical investigators and \u201cGuidance for Industry - Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators\u201d: http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126832.htm.\n\nThe FDA investigator also may audit the study data by comparing the data filed with the agency or the sponsor, if available, with records related to the clinical investigation. Such records may include the case report forms and supporting source documentation including signed and dated consent forms and medical records including, for example, progress notes of the physician, the subject's hospital chart(s), and the nurses' notes. These records may be in hard copy and/or an electronic format. For electronic records and/or electronic signatures, the FDA investigator may gather information to determine whether 21 CFR part 11 requirements have been met.4FDA may also examine subjects' medical records that are part of the clinical investigation and predate the study to verify whether the condition under study was in fact diagnosed, the study eligibility criteria were met, and whether the subject received any potentially interfering medication prohibited by the protocol. The FDA investigator may also review subjects' records covering a period after completion of study-related activities to determine if there was proper follow-up as outlined in the protocol, and if the clinical investigator submitted all reportable adverse events (including all clinical signs and symptoms). See 21 CFR 312.64(b) and 812.150(a). For more information about the procedures FDA uses during inspections of clinical investigator sites, see FDA's Compliance Program Guidance Manual (CPGM), Bioresearch Monitoring, Clinical Investigators and Sponsor-Investigators, Program 7348.811.5\n\nFootnote 5: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ICECI/EnforcementActions/BioresearchMonitoring/ucm133773.pdf.\n\nV International Inspections\n\nFDA's inspection of clinical investigators is not limited to the United States (U.S.). International inspections are generally conducted when the studies are part of a marketing application submitted to FDA and provide data critical to decision-making on product approval. See FDA's CPGM, Program 7348.811, \"Clinical Investigators and Sponsor-Investigators.\"6 Such assignments include studies that are conducted under an FDA investigational new drug application (IND), as well as studies at non-U.S. sites that are not conducted under an IND or under an investigational device exemption (IDE).\n\nFootnote 6: Ibid.\n\nStudies Involving Investigational Drugs and Biologies\n\nFDA inspects clinical investigators conducting foreign trials, either under an IND or in support of an IND, a new drug application (NDA) or a biologics license application (BLA). Although sponsors of clinical trials conducted outside the U.S. are not required to file an IND, sponsors submitting foreign clinical studies not conducted under an IND to FDA must comply with requirements in 21 CFR 312.120. If a clinical investigator conducts a study under an IND outside of the U.S., the clinical investigator is subject to FDA regulations, including applicable provisions in 21 CFR parts 50, 56, and 312. FDA validates the authenticity and accuracy of data and confirms compliance during an inspection, which is performed under the circumstances listed above in section III.\n\nWhen FDA considers whether to accept non-U.S., non-IND clinical studies in support of an IND, NDA, or BLA, an FDA inspection may help in determining whether the study was conducted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120. Specifically, the inspection will evaluate whether the following criteria are met:\n\nThe study is well-designed and well-conducted.\n\nThe study is conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), which is defined as a standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials in a way that provides assurance that the data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects are protected.\n\nThe study has been reviewed and approved (or provision of a favorable opinion) by an independent ethics committee (IEC) prior to study initiation, continuing review of an ongoing study by an IEC, and the freely given and documented informed consent of the subject (or the subject's legally authorized representative if the subject is unable to provide consent) prior to any study-specific procedures.\n\nStudies Involving Investigational Devices\n\nFDA's inspection of clinical investigators conducting foreign trials includes device trials in support of a premarket approval application (PMA) or a premarket notification (510(k)) submission.\n\nFor device studies conducted outside the U.S., FDA will accept research in support of a PMA, but which has not been conducted under an IDE, if certain conditions are met. An FDA inspection may help in determining whether the study was conducted in accordance with 21 CFR 814.15. Specifically, the inspection will evaluate whether the following criteria are met:\n\nthe data are valid; and\n\nthe studies are conducted in conformance with the \"Declaration of Helsinki,\"7 or the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords greater protection to the human subjects. FDA validates the authenticity and accuracy of data and confirms compliance during an inspection, which is performed under the circumstances listed above in section III. The FDA investigator may request documentation as to whether the study was conducted under the laws and regulations of the non-U.S. country and/or the Declaration of Helsinki, whichever accords greater protection to human subjects.\n\nFootnote 7: 21 CFR part 814 refers to the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 1983. There have been subsequent revisions of the Declaration, but FDA has not officially adopted subsequent versions.\n\nVI What happens after an inspection?\n\nAt the end of an inspection, the FDA investigator conducts an exit interview with the clinical investigator or his/her representative. At this interview, the FDA investigator who conducted the inspection reviews and discusses the findings from the inspection and, if deficiencies were found, issues a written Form FDA 483 (Inspectional Observations; 483) to the clinical investigator or his/her representative. The 483 describes any inspectional observations that, in the opinion of the FDA investigator conducting the inspection, represent deviations from applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nSome common deficiencies that have been observed by FDA investigators during a clinical investigator inspection include:* failure to follow the investigational plan and signed investigator statement/agreement (e.g., failure to conduct or supervise the study in accordance with the relevant, current protocol(s)). See 21 CFR 312.60 and 812.110(b).\n* protocol deviations (e.g., failure to appropriately document and report any medically necessary protocol deviations). See 21 CFR 312.66 and 812.150(a)(4).\n* inadequate recordkeeping. See 21 CFR 312.62 and 812.140(a).\n* inadequate accountability for the investigational product. See 21 CFR 312.62(a) and 812.140(a)(2).\n* inadequate subject protection, including informed consent issues. See 21 CFR part 50, 312.60, and 812.100.\n\nThe clinical investigator may respond to the 483 observations orally during the exit interview and/or respond in writing after the inspection. If the clinical investigator chooses to respond in writing to the deficiencies listed on the 483, the response should be directed to the FDA District Office listed in the upper left corner of the 483.8 (A list of FDA District Offices is also posted on FDA's website (http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/Inspections/IOM/ucm124008.htm)).\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Inspections of Clinical Investigators Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.910040378570557"], "This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 22: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/assay-migration-studies-vitro-diagnostic-devices.\n\nOption 3: As an alternative to comparison study designs, for certain test systems, flex and human factors engineering studies may provide sufficient assurance that the change in user populations and environment of use between non-waived and waived settings will not adversely impact the results provided by the candidate test; i.e., that the likelihood of erroneous results by the users is negligible. Possible study design approaches that may be suitable include flex study designs described in section IV above and human factor study designs described in FDA's guidance \"Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineeringto Medical Devices.\"23 FDA believes this approach is generally appropriate for test systems for which:\n\nFootnote 23: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/applying-human-factors-and-usability-engineering-medical-devices.\n\ncollection of a specimen is either always performed by a professional (for example, an endocervical swab collected by a doctor) or always by a patient (for example, a urine specimen collected by the patient), and\n\nother pre-analytical steps are very simple (for example, placement of the entire specimen in the analyzer), and\n\nintended use patient populations are sufficiently similar.\n\nAdditionally, another scenario where this option may be appropriate is a CLIA waiver application for a modification of a previously waived test system where the Quick Reference Guide was not modified (or minimally modified). FDA encourages manufacturers considering modification of a test system previously waived by application to contact FDA through a Pre-Submission to discuss planned modifications, as well as study designs and analyses to validate that the modified test system meets the statutory criteria for CLIA waiver.24\n\nFootnote 24: A Pre-Submission is a type of Q-Submission. For information regarding the process for obtaining feedback from the FDA, see the guidance \u201cRequests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.\n\nOption 4: Comparison study designs in which the results of the candidate test in the hands of untrained operators are directly compared to the results of an appropriate comparative method in the hands of trained operators. This option is also useful for Dual Submissions where a 510(k) and CLIA waiver are being sought concurrently.\n\nFor general recommendations on comparison study design and analysis for Options 1 and 4, we recommend you follow appropriate FDA-recognized consensus standards, such as:\n\nFor quantitative tests: CLSI EP21,25 CLSI EP27.26 Footnote 25: CLSI EP21 Evaluation of Total Analytical Error for Quantitative Medical Laboratory Measurement Procedures.\n\nFor qualitative tests: CLSI EP12.27 Footnote 26: CLSI EP27 How to Construct and Interpret an Error Grid for Quantitative Diagnostic Assays.\n\nFor Options 1, 2, and 4, if sufficient valid scientific evidence on the imprecision of the test and the performance of the test at low levels (limit of detection and limit of quantitation) when performed by untrained operators is not available from the studies described above, additional studies should be performed to allow comparison of the imprecision and limit of detection/limit of quantitation of the test when performed by untrained and trained operators. We recommend following appropriate FDA-recognized consensus standards (e.g., CLSI EP05,28 CLSI EP12, CLSI EP1729) for these studies.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApplicants are strongly encouraged to submit a Pre-Submission to obtain feedback from FDA on planned study designs prior to conducting the study. FDA welcomes discussion of additional study design approaches besides the four options presented in this guidance.30\n\nFootnote 30: For information regarding the process for obtaining feedback from the FDA, see the guidance \u201cRequests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The O-Submission Program,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.\n\nAppendix B Considerations in Satisfying CLIA Waiver Requirements\n\nOne statutory criteria that a test can meet to obtain a CLIA waiver centers on the simplicity of the test and whether the user can conduct the test with a negligible likelihood of erroneous results.31 All tests have some likelihood of erroneous results, but whether the likelihood of erroneous results in the hands of waived test users is negligible will vary from test to test depending on a number of factors. These factors include intended use, context of use (e.g., patient population, use environment), and the probable benefit(s) and probable risk(s)/harm(s) associated with waived use of the test. FDA intends for its approach to benefit-risk considerations to be consistent with the principles expressed, to the extent applicable, in FDA's other guidances.32 Accordingly, the appropriate acceptance criteria for the studies performed using the design options described above will vary from test to test. For example, for a qualitative test performed following study Options 1 or 2, the minimum level of agreement between results of the test in the hands of untrained and trained users for demonstrating comparable performance should generally be higher for a test for which erroneous results in waived settings are associated with a higher extent of probable patient risk/harm than for tests with lower probable risk/harm in waived settings.\n\nFootnote 31: 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 263a(d)(3)(A).\n\nFootnote 32: See, for example, \u201c_Benefit-Risk Factors to Consider When Determining Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications (510(k)) with Different Technological Characteristics,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/benefit-risk-factors-consider-when-determining-substantial-equivalence-premarket-notifications-510k, and \u201c_Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/factors-consider-when-making-benefit-risk-determinations-medical-device-premarket-approval-and-de.\n\nAppendix C General Study Design Considerations\n\nFor all study design options, FDA recommends that applicants evaluate test performance in settings designed to replicate, as closely as possible, actual CLIA-waived settings, patients, samples, and test operators. Therefore, study designs should include the following:\n\nTesting sites that are representative of the intended use of the waived test.\n\nSubject populations that are representative of the intended patient population(s).\n\nIntended sample type and matrix.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nUntrained operators representative of those at intended waived settings. We encourage you to enroll operators with the least amount of training that might be encountered at the types of sites for which this device is intended.\n\nTesting should be integrated into the daily workflow of the facility where the operators are often multitasking between patient care, testing, and other duties.\n\nTesting sites\n\nYou should conduct the study to support CLIA waiver at a minimum of three sites that are representative of both the intended use patient population and the intended operators in CLIA-waived settings. Generally, the sites should include different demographic and geographic locations (e.g., outpatient clinic, physician's office), since patient populations and intended operators typically vary among different demographic locations. In your CLIA waiver application, you should present a brief description of each site, including its name, address, and the date the study was performed. If there were sites that were included at the beginning, but then did not complete the study, you should provide a brief explanation for why those sites did not complete the study.\n\nFor study Options 1 and 2, trained operators may perform testing at the same sites as the untrained operators, or at a different laboratory site. For study Option 4, trained operators should perform testing with the comparative method at an appropriate laboratory site.\n\nOperators\n\nUntrained operators\n\nThe study should include 1-3 untrained operators at each site and at least nine (9) untrained operators across all sites. You should ensure that the untrained operator study participants enrolled represent anticipated operators of the device you propose for CLIA waiver. Untrained operators should have limited or no training or hands-on experience in conducting laboratory testing and should not have previous training or experience with the candidate test, but may have limited experience with other waived or home use tests. Untrained operators should be personnel currently employed in the selected intended use sites and testing should be integrated into the daily workflow of the facility where the operators are often multitasking between patient care, testing, and other duties. We recommend that you record and tabulate the education (including experience and training) and the occupation of each untrained operator to demonstrate that these participants meet the definition of intended operators and include this in your CLIA waiver application. In addition, for each study site, we recommend you report the same information on other personnel that were available at the testing site but that were not chosen to participate.\n\nTrained operators\n--------------------\nContext title: Recommendations for Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) Waiver Applications for Manufacturers of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.061655044555664", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: Investigational plan - sponsor's overall plan regarding the conduct of an investigational study. It includes, but is not limited to, the purpose of the study, a written protocol, a risk analysis, device description, labeling, written monitoring procedures, informed consent materials, and Institutional Review Board (IRB) information. (21 CFR 812.25.) For IVD studies, protocols should describe the study objectives, design, methodology, subject populations, types of specimens, data to be collected and planned data analysis.\n\nInvestigational Use in vitro diagnostic (IVD) product - an IVD product being used for product testing prior to full commercial marketing (e.g., for use on specimens derived from humans to compare the usefulness of the product with other products or procedures in current use or recognized as useful). These products must be labeled according to 21 CFR 812.5 for non-significant risk or significant risk devices and according to 21 CFR 809.10(c)(2)(ii) for devices that are exempt under 21 CFR 812.2(c).\n\nInvestigator - an individual who actually conducts a clinical investigation, i.e., a person under whose immediate direction the investigational product is administered, dispensed, or used, provided that the investigation involves a subject. In the event of an investigation conducted by a team of individuals, the investigator is the responsible leader of that team (21 CFR 812.3(i)).\n\nIn vitro diagnostic (IVD) products - those reagents, instruments, and systems intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, including a determination of the state of health, in order to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease or its sequelae. Such products are intended for use in the collection, preparation, and examination of specimens taken from the human body. IVD products are devices as defined in section 201(h) of the Act and may also be biological products subject to section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. The regulatory definition of in vitro diagnostic products is found in 21 CFR 809.3(a).\n\nLeftover specimens -- remnants of specimens collected for routine clinical care or analysis that would otherwise have been discarded, or remnants of specimens previously collected for other unrelated research. These specimens may be obtained from a specimen repository -- a common site for storage of collections of human biological specimens available for study. See also Excess samples.\n\nNon-significant risk (NSR) device - a device that does not meet the definition of significant risk (SR) device (see definition below). An IDE is considered approved for a NSR investigational device study once sponsors meet the abbreviated requirements found in the \"Investigational Device Exemptions\" regulation at 21 CFR 812.2(b). The risk determination for an investigational device study should be based on the proposed use of the device in the investigation in addition to the characteristics of the device.\n\nOutlier - a data observation whose value appears to be out of line with the main body of data that has been collected.\n\nPre-amendment in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests - IVD tests that were in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976.\n\nPrecision - the closeness of agreement between independent diagnostic test results obtained under stipulated conditions. For additional information refer to the Harmonized Technology Database, Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, available at\n\nhttp://www.clsi.org.\n\nPremarket Approval Application (PMA) - the application for approval required prior to the marketing of most Class III medical devices (section 515 of the Act, 21 U.S.C.\n\n360e). (See definitions of Class I, II, and III devices above.) PMA approval is based on a determination by FDA that the applicant's submission provides sufficient valid scientific evidence to provide reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The PMA regulation is 21 CFR Part 814. PMA information is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYour\n\nDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketApprovalPMA/default.htm.\n\nPremarket Notification - also referred to as a 510(k), is a submission to FDA that contains information to demonstrate that a device is substantially equivalent (SE) to a legally marketed (predicate) device. Governing regulations regarding premarket notification procedures are found in Subpart E of the \"Establishment Registration and Device Listing for Manufacturers and Initial Importers of Devices\" regulation (21 CFR Part 807). The 510(k) device advice page is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYour\n\nDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketNotification510k/default.htm.\n\nProduct Development Protocol (PDP) - FDA process of approval for marketing of medical devices, usually reserved for Class III devices (see definitions of device classesabove), by which the sponsor and FDA agree on the product design and testing early in the concept and planning stages of a product (section 515(f) of the Act).\n\nProtocol - a document that contains a description of the objectives and design of an investigational study, methodology(s) to be used, and data to be collected. It may also contain information regarding the planned data analysis and study monitoring. For most studies in the development of an IVD product, it also contains information regarding types of specimens and subject populations.\n\nReserved samples - see excess samples.\n\nSensitivity - the probability that a diagnostic test will yield a positive result when the disease or the target analyte is present.\n\nSignificant risk (SR) device - an investigational device that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject and:\n\nis intended as an implant;\n\nis purported or represented to be for use in supporting or sustaining human life;\n\nis for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health; or\n\notherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n\nThe risk determination for an investigational device study should be based on the proposed use of the device in the investigation in addition to the device characteristics. Sponsors of significant risk device studies must apply to FDA for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) (see definition above). (21 CFR 812.3(a), 812.3(m); 812.20.)\n\nSimulated specimens - specimens made in the laboratory by adding the analyte of interest in known concentrations to a medium that simulates the natural matrix.\n\nSpecificity - the probability that a diagnostic test will yield a negative result when the disease or target analyte is absent.\n\nSponsor - a person who initiates, but who does not actually conduct, the investigation, i.e., the investigational device is administered, dispensed, or used under the immediate direction of another individual. A person other than an individual that uses one or more of its own employees to conduct an investigation that it has initiated is a sponsor, not a sponsor-investigator (see next definition), and the employees are investigators (see definition above) (21 CFR 812.3(n)).\n\nSponsor-investigator - an individual who both initiates and actually conducts, alone or with others, an investigation, i.e., under whose immediate direction the investigational device is administered, dispensed, or used. The term does not include any person other than an individual. The obligations of a sponsor-investigator include both those of an investigator and those of a sponsor (21 CFR 812.3(o)).\n\nStatistical hypothesis - a statement about some state of nature that a proposed study or set of studies will either accept or reject on the basis of the experimental data. The hypothesis is usually broken down into a null hypothesis (a statement of what the testing results will hopefully reject) and an alternative hypothesis (a statement of what the testing results will hopefully accept).\n\nStudy - as used in this document, covers the systematic evaluations conducted in the development of an IVD product, including the feasibility, analytical assessments, method comparison, and evaluations to determine clinical utility of a product.\n\nSubject - a human who participates in an investigation, either as an individual on whom or on whose specimen an investigational device is used or as a control. A subject may be in normal health or may have a medical condition or disease (21 CFR 812.3(p)).\n\nSurplus samples - see excess samples.\n\nTransitional device - a product defined as a device as of May 28, 1976, but previously considered by FDA to be a new drug or an antibiotic drug (21 CFR 812.3(r)).\n\nTreatment IDE - use of an unapproved investigational device for the treatment or diagnosis of patients during the clinical trial or prior to final FDA action on the marketing application, if during the course of the clinical trial the data suggest that the device is effective. A treatment IDE may cover a large number of patients that exceeds the number of clinical sites and patients stipulated in the original IDE. The device must be for treatment or diagnosis of a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition; there must be no comparable or satisfactory alternative device or therapy available; the device must be under investigation in a controlled clinical study for the same use under an approved IDE, or such clinical studies have been completed; and the sponsor must be actively pursuing marketing approval or clearance of the device. Requirements for an application for a treatment IDE are found in the Investigational Device Exemptions regulation at 21 CFR 812.36.\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.782291889190674", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: Submission of Published Literature or Other Reports in Conjunction with Other Important Information that Enhances the Reliability of the DataIf a sponsor wishes to rely on a study conducted by another party and cannot obtain the primary data from the study, for most well-conducted studies it is possible to obtain other important information, such as a protocol documenting the prospective plans for the trial, records of trial conduct and procedures, patient data listings for important variables, and documentation of the statistical analysis. FDA has considerable experience evaluating large multicenter outcome studies sponsored by U.S. and European government agencies (NIH, British Medical Research Council) and private organizations (the ISIS studies, the SAVE study) for which there was limited access to primary study data, but for which other critical information was available. Providing as many as possible of the following important pieces of information about a study, in conjunction with the published report, can increase the likelihood that the study can be relied on to support an effectiveness claim:\n\na. The protocol used for the study, as well as any important protocol amendments that were implemented during the study and their relation to study accrual or randomization. b. The prospective statistical analysis plan and any changes from the original plan that occurred during or after the study, with particular note of which analyses were performed pre- and post-unblinding. c. Randomization codes and documented study entry dates for the subjects. d. Full accounting of all study subjects, including identification of any subjects with on-treatment data who have been omitted from analysis and the reasons for omissions, and an analysis of results using all subjects with on-study data. e. Electronic or paper record of each subject's data for critical variables and pertinent baseline characteristics. Where individual subject responses are a critical variable (e.g., objective responses in cancer patients, clinical cures and microbial eradications in infectious disease patients, death from a particular cause), detailed bases for the assessment, such as the case report, hospital records, and narratives, should be provided when possible. f. Where safety is a major issue, complete information for all deaths and drop-outs due to toxicity. For postapproval supplemental uses, however, there is generally less need for the results of lab tests or for details of adverse event reports and, consequently, much more limited documentation may be sufficient (e.g., only for unexpected deaths and previously undescribed serious adverse effects). Exceptions to this approach would include situations in which the population for the supplemental use is so different that existing safety information has limited application (e.g., thrombolysis in stroke patients versus myocardial infarction patients) or where the new population presents serious safety concerns (e.g., extension of a preventive vaccine indication from young children to infants).\n2. Submission of Published Literature Reports Alone\n\nThe following factors increase the possibility of reliance on published reports alone to support approval of a new product or new use:\n\na. Multiple studies conducted by different investigators where each of the studies clearly has an adequate design and where the findings across studies are consistent.\n\nb. A high level of detail in the published reports, including clear and adequate descriptions of statistical plans, analytic methods (prospectively determined), and study endpoints, and a full accounting of all enrolled patients.\n\nc. Clearly appropriate endpoints that can be objectively assessed and are not dependent on investigator judgment (e.g., overall mortality, blood pressure, or microbial eradication). Such endpoints are more readily interpreted than more subjective endpoints such as cause-specific mortality or relief of symptoms.\n\nd. Robust results achieved by protocol-specified analyses that yield a consistent conclusion of efficacy and do not require selected post hoc analyses such as covariate adjustment, subsetting, or reduced data sets (e.g., analysis of only responders or compliant patients, or of an \"eligible\" or \"evaluable\" subset).\n\ne. Conduct of studies by groups with properly documented operating procedures and a history of implementing such procedures effectively.\n\nThere have been approvals based primarily or exclusively on published reports. Examples include the initial approval of secretin for evaluation of pancreatic function and recent approvals of bleomycin and talc for malignant pleural effusion and doxycycline for malaria.\n\nReliance on Studies with Alternative, Less Intensive Quality Control/On-Site Monitoring\n\nIndustry-sponsored studies typically use extensive on-site and central monitoring and auditing procedures to assure data quality. Studies supported by other sponsors may employ less stringent procedures and may use no on-site monitoring at all. An International Conference on Harmonisation guideline on good clinical practices,7 recently accepted internationally, emphasizes that the extent of monitoring in a trial should be based on trial-specific factors (e.g., design, complexity, size, and type of study outcome measures) and that different degrees of on-site monitoring can be appropriate. In recent years, many credible and valuable studies conducted by government or independent study groups, often with important mortality outcomes, had very little on-site monitoring. These studies have addressed quality control in other ways, such as by close control and review of documentation and extensive guidance and planning efforts with investigators. There is a long history of reliance on such studies for initial approval of drugs as well as for additional indications. Factors that influence whether studies with limited or no monitoring may be relied on include the following:\n\nFootnote 7: International Conference on Harmonisation Guidance for Industry E6, Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline, April 1996.\n\nThe existence of a prospective plan to assure data quality.\n\nStudies that have features that make them inherently less susceptible to bias, such as those with relatively simple procedures, noncritical entry criteria, and readily assessed outcomes.\n\nThe ability to sample critical data and make comparisons to supporting records (e.g., hospital records).\n\nConduct of the study by a group with established operating procedures and a history of implementing such procedures effectively.\n--------------------\nContext title: Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products. \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.796812534332275", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: Actual-use testing can also be conducted as part of a clinical study. However, in a clinical study, the participants are generally trained differently and are more closely supervised than users would be in real-world use, so the resulting data (e.g., observations and interviews) should be viewed in that context. Another way in which a clinical trial differs from a simulated-use human factors validation test is that the sample sizes are generally much larger in order for the outcome data to be statistically significant. For studies in which the test participants use the device at home, opportunities for direct observation can be limited; regardless, it is inadequate to depend solely on self-reports of device use to understand the users' interactions with the device because these data can be incomplete or inaccurate. To the extent practicable, such data should be supplemented with observational data.\n\nYou should consult with your internal institutional review board for the protection of human subjects (IRB) to determine the need to implement specific safeguards of test participant safety and personal privacy, including informed consent forms.\n\nFor more information about Investigational Device Exemptions, see FDA's guidance, FDA Decisions for Device Exemption (IDE) Clinical Investigations. For more information about pivotal clinical studies, see FDA's guidance, Design Considerations for Pivotal Clinical Investigations for Medical Devices.\n\n9 Documentation\n\nDocumenting your risk management, HFE/UE testing, and design optimization processes (e.g., in your design history file as part of your design controls) provides evidence that you considered the needs of the intended users in the design of your new device and determined that the device is safe and effective for the intended users, uses and use environments.\n\nWhen it is required, providing information about these processes as part of a premarket submission for a new device will reduce the need for requests for additional information and facilitate FDA's review of all HFE/UE information contained in your submission.\n\nA sample outline of a HFE/UE report that could be submitted to FDA is shown in Appendix A. The report should provide a summary of the evaluations performed and enough detail to enable the FDA reviewer to understand your methods and results, but the submission would not need to include, for example, all the raw data from a human factors validation test. All documentation related to HFE/UE processes, whether required to be submitted to FDA or not, should be kept in manufacturers' files.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe advantages of optimizing device design through application of HFE/UE extend beyond improved safety. Many device manufacturers have found that the application of HFE/UE during the development of their products reduces the need for design modifications and costly updates after market introduction and offers competitive advantages. With increased safety, the likelihood of your incurring expenses associated with product recalls or liability is reduced; and when HFE/UE approaches are used during the design development process, particularly if the perspective of users is taken into account, the overall ease of use and appeal of a device can simultaneously be enhanced.\n\nAppendix A HFE/UE Report\n\nA HFE/UE report included in a premarket submission should provide information pertaining to device use safety and effectiveness in summary form. The report should discuss the safety-related HFE/UE considerations, issues, processes, resolutions, and conclusions. The level of detail of documentation submitted should be sufficient to describe your identification, evaluation, and final assessment of all serious use-related hazards for the device. To facilitate FDA review, materials used directly in the HF/UE process, including portions of risk analyses focusing on user interactions with the device and specific risk analysis processes, results and conclusions should be included in the HFE/UE report. If necessary, the report may refer to materials relevant to the HFE/UE process located in other parts of a submission.\n\nA recommended structure for the HFE/UE report, which will support efficient FDA review of these materials, is listed in Table A-1 and described in the text that follows.\n\nTable A-1. Outline of HFE/UE Report\n\nSection 1: Conclusion\n\nThe report should begin with a conclusion stating that the new medical device has been found to be safe and effective for the intended users, uses, and use environments. The conclusion should be supported by a summary of the HFE/UE processes conducted (e.g., HFE/UE analyses and evaluations, design modifications, and validation testing) and analysis of the results.\n\nThis section should discuss any residual use-related risk that remained after the human factors validation testing. If applicable, this section should provide a sound rationale that modifications to the user interface (including the device and the labeling) would not further reduce risk, are not possible or not practicable, and the remaining residual use-related risks are outweighed by the benefits derived from use of the device.\n\nSection 2: Descriptions of intended device users, uses, use environments, and training\n\nThis section should include:\n\nA description of the intended user population or, if there is more than one distinct user population, each population; the description should include meaningful differences in capabilities or use responsibilities between user populations that could affect their interactions with the device (such as lay and professional users who might use the same device to perform different tasks or different types of professionals who might perform different tasks on the device);\n\nA summary of the device's intended use;\n\nA summary of the device's operational context of use (such as the requirement that a user be trained by a nurse prior to using the device, or it is used in an operating room, or it is used differently for different applications) and critical aspects of device operation, such as set up, maintenance, cleaning, reprocessing;\n\nA summary of the intended use environments (e.g., hospital, medevac vehicle, non-clinical environment) and the characteristics of those environments (e.g., glare, vibration, ambient noise, high levels of activity) that could affect user interactions with the device; and\n\nA description of any training users would receive; a sample of the training materials (such as a DVD, computer slides, or a pamphlet) may be appended to the report.\n\nSection 3: Description of device user interface\n\nThis section should include (as applicable):\n\nA graphical representation (e.g., photographs, illustrations or line drawings) of the device and its user interface, including a depiction of the overall device and all components of the user interface with which the user will interact (e.g., display and function screens, alarm speakers, controls, keypads, dedicated buttons, doors, components to be connected, retaining clips);\n\nA written description of the device user interface;\n\nA copy of the labeling materials that will be provided to the user with the device (e.g., instructions for use, user manual, quick-start guides, packaging); andAn overview of the operational sequence of the device and the users' expected interactions with the user interface, consisting of the sequence of user actions performed to use the device (and resulting device responses, as appropriate).\n\nSection 4: Summary of known use problems\n\nThis section should include all use problems known to exist in previous models of the same device (as applicable) or with similar types of medical devices (e.g., predicate devices). In some cases, no use problems are known to exist and if so, this may be stated. If the submission is for a device that has been modified specifically in response to use problems that occurred in the field, this section should highlight those problems and the new modifications.\n\nSection 5: Analysis of hazards and risks associated with use of the device\n\nThis section should provide an excerpt from the comprehensive risk analysis that contains all the use-related hazards and risks, including those associated with potential use errors. The section should include at least one hazardous scenario associated with each use error, the potential harm that could result, the potential severity of the harm, all risk control measures implemented to eliminate or reduce the risk, and the source of evidence that each risk control measure was effective.\n\nSection 6: Summary of preliminary analyses and evaluations\n\nThis section should identify the preliminary analysis and evaluation methods used (e.g., specific analysis techniques, formative evaluations), summarize the key results of those analyses and evaluations, describe any modifications that were implemented to the user interface design in response to the results, and discuss the key findings that informed development of the protocol for the human factors validation test.\n\nSection 7: Description and categorization of critical tasks\n\nThis section should explain the process that was followed to identify the critical tasks during the preliminary analyses and evaluations; it should also provide a list and descriptions of the critical tasks. The section should identify the severity of the potential harm that could result from use errors on the critical tasks. The section should also describe the use scenarios to be included in the human factors validation test and list the critical tasks and other tasks that constitute each use scenario.\n\nSection 8: Details of the human factors validation testing\n--------------------\nContext title: Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineering to Medical Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.6306304931640625", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:1]\n\nTable of Contents\n\nI INTRODUCTION**\n\nII BACKGROUND**\n\nIII DISCUSSION**\n\nIII.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the appropriate FDA staff. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThis guidance provides to you, medical device manufacturers of communicable disease tests, information about performing studies to support modifying the indication for use to include testing of cadaveric blood specimens to screen donors of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps). This guidance makes recommendations about:\n\nSensitivity and specificity studies\n\nReproducibility studies\n\nNumber of test kit lots to include in studies\n\nPlasma dilution issues\n\nInformation about specimen collection times to be included\n\nThis document contains information which has been provided in Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research's (CBER's) letters to manufacturers of communicable disease tests. We, FDA, continue to encourage manufacturers of communicable disease tests to evaluate these tests for cadaveric HCT/P donor use and seek such labeling.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the FDA's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA's guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nRecognizing the need for appropriately evaluated and labeled test kits, we issued letters in 1995 to manufacturers of donor screening tests introducing the subject of expanding the indication for use of blood donor screening tests to include testing of cadaveric blood specimens and suggesting a minimum protocol. In the Federal Register of July 29, 1997 (62 FR 40429), we issued a final rule, \"Human Tissue Intended for Transplantation,\" (the tissue final rule) which requires \"certain infectious disease testing, donor screening, and recordkeeping to help prevent the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis viruses through human tissue used in transplantation\" (62 FR 40429 at 40429) (Ref. 1). Additionally, the tissue final rule requires that \"FDA licensed screening tests labeled for cadaveric specimens must be used when available\" (21 Code of Federal Regulations 1270.21(d)). Also, in the Federal Register of July 29, 1997 (62 FR 40536), we announced the availability of a \"Guidance for Screening and Testing of Donors of Human Tissue Intended for Transplantation,\" dated July 1997, which further discussed the use of donor screening tests (Ref. 2).\n\nWe approved two biologic license supplements with the modified indication for use to include testing of cadaveric blood specimens. On December 28, 1999, FDA approved the Genetic Systems Corporation's Supplement to its Product License Application for Antibody to Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (Mouse Monoclonal) Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay to modify the intended use of the Genetic Systems HBsAg EIA 2.0 and the Genetic Systems HBsAg Cap Confirmatory Assay 2.0 to include the testing of cadaveric serum samples. On February 9, 2000, FDA approved the Genetic Systems Corporation's Supplement to their Product License Application for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Types 1 and 2 (Synthetic Peptide) to modify the intended use of the Genetic Systems HIV-1/HIV-2 Peptide EIA to include the testing of cadaveric serum samples. These approved tests detect antibodies to Hepatitis B Surface Antigen and antibodies to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2, respectively, in a cadaveric donor's serum.\n\nIn June 2000, we issued a \"Guidance for Industry: Availability of Licensed Donor Screening Tests Labeled for Use with Cadaveric Blood Specimens\" (the June 2000 guidance), which informed establishments of the availability of these two licensed donor screening tests labeled for use with cadaveric blood specimens (Ref. 3). In the Federal Register of May 25, 2004 (69 FR 29786), we issued a final rule \"Eligibility Determination for Donors of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products\" (Ref. 4) which requires that donors of cells and tissue be tested for evidence of infection due to relevant communicable disease agents or diseases. Those relevant communicable disease agents include HIV, types 1 and 2; hepatitis B virus; and hepatitis C virus, and, for certain donors, Human T-Lymphotrophic Virus, types I and II. Manufacturers of tests used to screen blood donors for communicable diseases have requested information on studies to support modifying the indication for use to include testing of cadaveric blood specimens from donors of HCT/Ps.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nWe recommend you address the following areas when preparing a protocol to modify the indication for use to include testing of cadaveric blood specimens.\n\nA. What data about specificity and sensitivity are recommended when matched pairs of pre- and post-mortem serum/plasma specimens are available?\n\nSpecificity We recommend that you test at least 50 paired specimens (1 pre- and 1 post-mortem specimen from the same donor). 1. Clinical Specificity Clinical specificity is a measure of how often the test is negative in non-diseased donors. We recommend that you determine if a statistically significant difference exists between pre- and post-mortem specimens based on frequency of false positive results. 2. Analytical Specificity Analytical specificity measures a test's ability to exclusively identify a target substance rather than different substances. We recommend that you determine if a statistically significant difference exists between pre- and post-mortem specimens based on signal strength.\n\nSensitivity We recommend that you test at least 50 paired reactive specimens (1 pre- and 1 post-mortem specimen from the same donor). 1. Clinical Sensitivity is a measure of how often the test is positive in diseased donors. We recommend that you determine if a statistically significant difference exists between pre- and post-mortem specimens based on frequency of false negative results.\n\nAnalytical Sensitivity Analytical sensitivity measures a test's ability to detect a low concentration of a given substance. We recommend that you determine if a statistically significant difference exists between pre- and post-mortem specimens based on signal strength and endpoint dilutions of positive specimens.\n\nWhat data about specificity and sensitivity are recommended when matched pairs of pre- and post-mortem serum/plasma specimens are not available?\n\nSpecificity We recommend that you concurrently test at least 50 cadaveric (post-mortem) specimens from 50 different cadaveric donors and an equal number of random living donor specimens (unmatched pre-mortem specimen) with the same test kit lots.\n\nClinical Specificity We recommend that you determine if a statistically significant difference exists between the cadaveric specimens and the random living donor specimens based on the frequency of false positive results, i.e., the number of pre-mortem nonreactives/post mortem reactives.\n\nAnalytical Specificity We recommend that you determine if a statistically significant difference exists between the cadaveric specimens and the random living donor specimens based on signal strength.\n\nAnalytical Sensitivity We recommend that you concurrently test at least 50 nonreactive cadaveric specimens from 50 different cadaveric donors with an equal number of random living donor specimens with the same kit lots, with both types of specimens spiked with the infectious disease marker at a potency near the assay's cutoff. You should use a minimum of 5 individual positive sources for the spiking experiment.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Recommendations for Obtaining a Labeling Claim for Communicable Disease Donor Screening Tests Using Cadaveric Blood Specimens from Donors of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT:Ps) Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.639468193054199", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?\n--------------------\nContext: If reformatting of data is done as part of the transfer described in question 4 above, is the new file not raw data even if all data is transferred intact although in a different organization? The Agency can not precisely answer this question without further details of the new data format.\n\nAre initials and dates on data printouts (e.g., scintillation counters, gas chromatographs), when these printouts include standards, sufficient documentation for standardization? Yes.\n\nIs there a time limit for submission of the final report of a nonclinical laboratory study after its conclusion? Generally no. On occasion, for marketed products, the Agency may establish time frames for study conduct. Of course alarming findings on marketed products should be reported as soon as possible.\n\nIs it permissible to list changes in a final report on a page, which is appended, to the original final report? Yes.\n\nDoes \"studies in progress on June 20, 1979\" refer to the phase of dosing of the test system or the phase post-dosing but not yet reported? The quotation pertains to all studies for which the final report has not yet been completed. Included are all post-dosing phases.\n\nThe final report requires a list of participants. Should this include technicians as well as people who perform support functions?The final report should include the name of the study director, the names of other scientists or professionals, and the names of all supervisory personnel involved in the study.\n\nWhen an analysis protocol is developed for the first time by using standard scientific technique, who shall validate the protocol?\n\nThe Agency does not per se validate protocols. Persons developing new protocols may submit them to the responsible bureau for review and comment prior to initiating a nonclinical laboratory study.\n* One of the testing deficiencies found in the early Agency investigations of nonclinical studies was protocol changes that were made without informing the sponsor. The changes prejudiced the validity of the studies. Accordingly, the GLPs require that each study have a specific protocol, which is attested to by the sponsor.\n* The identity of the individual collecting data entered into a computer can be recorded via the use of a code known only to the individual but directly identifying the individual; similarly the identity of the individuals witnessing or reviewing the data can be recorded. Is this acceptable?\n\nYes, this procedure is acceptable. The key to the code must be made available to Agency investigators. Do note, however, the final GLPs do not require that data entries need be witnessed by a second person.\n* Does the following proposal on data entry to computer files satisfy the GLP intent?\n\nData is entered through keyboard commands and stored in a \"temporary\" computer file with accompanying date, time, and analyst codes. The analyst may be technician level personnel. At the conclusion of a set of observations, no more than one day's worth, the data in the \"temporary file\" is reviewed by a scientist (this person may or may not be the same person who entered the original data) and \"corrected\" for any typing or entry errors. When it is determined that the data are correct, the data are transferred to a \"permanent\" computer file. Only authorized personnel may make changes to the \"permanent\" file.\n\nNo audit trail is kept for changes to \"temporary\" file. All changes to permanent file are recorded in a change file with appropriate data, personnel code, and comments regarding reason for change and original entry.\n\nNo. This method would permit unauthorized tampering with the temporary file before the raw data are transferred to the permanent file.\n* When should a protocol amendment issue? Should it be as soon as possible or could a list of all deviations from a protocol be prepared at the end of the study?If the deviation from the protocol is intended to be permanent, the protocol should be amended as soon as possible. If the deviation is an error, it should be promptly corrected and noted in the raw data.\n* 16. Section 58.120 describes a sixteen-part protocol and section 58.185 describes a fourteen part final report. Must all of these be included in protocols and reports for LD 50's and other short-term tests?\n\nYes.\n* 17. Is a protocol required for routine research and experimentation?\n\nProtocols are required for all studies covered by the GLPs.\n* 18. If all raw data are not required in a final report, does this mean, for example, that weekly body weight or food intake averages can be in a report without the individual animal data?\n\nThe data appearing in a final report depends on the type of study and the kind of regulated product. Specific advice can be obtained by contacting the Agency bureau, which has responsibility for the regulated product.\n* 19. If a compound or formula is proprietary, must the final report describe its detailed composition or chemical structure?\n\nIf the proprietary material is a commercially available article to be used as a control, the final report need only describe the trade or chemical name, the source and the manufacturer's batch number.\n* 20. How does the requirement for \"approval\" of protocols apply to \"in house\" studies which are' conducted in the laboratories of the actual \"sponsor?\" Who approves? What is an \"approved\" protocol?\n\nThe word \"approved\" was retained in the final order to emphasize that a sponsor should have a mechanism for evaluation and approval of initial protocols and all amendments. The specifics of the mechanism can vary but a formal mechanism should be in place.\n* 21. Must the protocol contain both the name and the code number of the test article?\n\nNo, either designation is acceptable.\n* 22. Section 58.120 states that the protocol shall contain the records to be maintained. Is this intended as a detailed list of each data form to be generated?No, in this case generalized statements would be satisfactory.\n23. How much raw data must be entered into notebooks when performing well-documented routine tests? Basically, the GLPs define raw data as the immediate results of original observations. All such immediate results must be entered.\n24. What is meant by the statement in section 58.120(a)(12), which pertains to the method by which the degree of absorption of the test and control articles by the test system will be determined? The GLPs do not mandate that absorption studies need be done, or which kind of study is satisfactory. The GLPs do require, however, that the protocol describe the method used if one is necessary to achieve the study objectives.\n25. Please clarify the issue of having to provide reasons for all corrections to data entries. It seems unreasonable to require reasons for \"obvious\" error corrections such as misspellings, transposed numbers, and wrong year early in a calendar year. It must be remembered that \"raw data\" is basically the results of original observations. Thus, the wrong year is not raw data and can be easily corrected. Misspellings may or may not be raw data whereas in all probability numbers are raw data. The Agency believes that it is sometimes difficult for a second party, such as the personnel in your quality assurance unit, to distinguish \"obvious\" errors. Consequently, the Agency insists that all corrections to raw data entries be justified.\n26. How and to what extent is the selection of the test system to be justified in the protocol? Usually, the test system is selected after consideration of the state-of-the-art of toxicology testing in the area of interest. The protocol need not contain extensive justification.\n27. Are we expected to label all specimens (e.g. serum, blood, urine, tissue slides) with their exact nature?\n\nYes. Such information is useful in preventing mix-ups.\n28. Why does \"test system, study, nature and date of collection\" have to be located on a specimen container? Can such information be coded?Specimen refers to any material derived from a test system for examination or analysis. Consequently, blood, tissues, urine, feces, etc. are considered to be specimens whose containers must carry the required label information. Such information will help preclude mix-ups in the subsequent handling of the specimens. Accession numbers or code numbers can be used for samples of specimens, which are subjected to further analysis. For example, in histopathology the excised fixed tissue is a specimen, which must carry all the label information. However, the blocks and slides prepared from that tissue could be identified by accession numbers. Similarly, in tissue residue analysis, the excised tissue is a specimen; whereas, tissue samples, which are homogenized and otherwise prepared for further analysis, are not specimens and need not carry full labeling.\n\n58.185 Reporting of Nonclinical Laboratory Study Results\n\n58.190 Storage and Retrieval of Records and Data\n\n58.195 Retention of Records\n\nWhat types of storage conditions are required for the storage of retained specimens?\n\nThe Agency has not developed guidelines for storage conditions. The Agency does not expect heroic measures to be used, but conditions should be reasonable in light of the nature of the specimen. Storage conditions, which foster accelerated deterioration, should be avoided.\n\nIn section 58.185, it is stated that test and control article identification and characterization must appear in the final report signed by the study director. However, if the study director is affiliated with a contract laboratory, he/she has no need to know such details of a proprietary test article. Do you agree that such information can be appended to the final report by the sponsor rather than be provided by the study director?\n\nYes.\n\nIs the storage of archival material (tissues, slides, raw data) the responsibility of the testing laboratory or can this responsibility be assigned to the sponsor of the study?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.7290358543396"], "As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: What evidence supports the plan to scale up the process to commercial scale? What operating parameters will be adjusted to ensure the product meets all in-process and final product specifications?\n\nThe plan to scale up the process to commercial scale may be supported by understanding of formulation, manufacturing process, and equipment or by information generated during the drug development phase.\n\nDo you have prior experience with other products using the same unit operations, literature references/scale-up factors, or modeling and dimensional analysis to support scale up? Describe your prior experience.\n\nIf this or similar information is available, it may provide valuable information to support your process knowledge.\n\nAre the process description and the in-process and release specifications fixed or likely to change prior to scale-up? How will scale-up affect these steps or specifications?\n\nThe sponsor has the flexibility to adjust the operating parameters (e.g., time, flow rate, temperature) to meet these constraints during scale-up. For commercial scale-up, a sponsor may either propose fixed ranges for these operating parameters in a proposed master batch record or indicate that an operating parameter will be adjusted to reach a desired end-point. An illustrative example is included in the following table below:\n\nExample\n\nWhat additional rationale supports scale-up?\n\nAll rationale should be provided and should focus on critical steps in the manufacturing process. This rationale should build on the experience (including problems that were identified and resolved) obtained during development and/or the production of the pilot batch(es).\n\n2.3.p.4 Control of Excipients\n\nWhat are the specifications for the excipient ingredients and are they suitable for their intended function?\n\nProvide COAs from supplier/vendor, and your qualification of results, for all excipients in Module 3.\n\nUSP Excipients\n\nAre USP/NF excipients being utilized?\n\nWhat are the USP/NF excipients utilized and their specifications?\n\nAre there any differences between the provided specifications and USP/NF specifications?\n\nWhat are the differences and justification for these differences?\n\nWhat format should be used for presenting the excipient specifications?\n\nFor USP excipients a table indicating the grade is requested.

These additional specifications should be justified. Reference to 2.3.P.2.2 (Pharmaceutical Development Report) is acceptable.\n\nExample\n\nNon-USP Excipients\n\nAre non-USP/NF excipients being utilized?\n\nWhat are the non-USP/NF excipients utilized and their specifications?\n\nWhat is the justification for the specifications utilized for non-USP/NF excipients?\n\nWhat information is requested for non-USP excipients?\n\nThe specifications for the non-USP excipient should be included in the QOS in a tabular form. Provide justification for specifications (may be provided in Pharmaceutical Development Report). The grade used should also be indicated.\n\nExcipients from Animal Origin\n\nAre there excipients from animal origin?\n\nWhat excipients are from animal origin and what information will allow CVM to assess the suitability of the supplier as it relates to TSE and other adventitious agents?\n\nReference the location of BSE/TSE certification, country of origin shall be provided, as applicable.__Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNovel Excipients\n\nAre any novel excipients being utilized?\n\nNovel excipients are those that have not been previously used in veterinary drug products. Novel excipients are generally not used in an ANADA product as safety and effectiveness information is not available.\n\nWhat novel excipients are being utilized and what additional details are available to support their use?\n\nThese excipients may require additional details including manufacture, characterization, controls, or a DMF/VMF reference.\n\nWhat information supports the suitability of the excipients for their intended functions?\n\nHow do I show that an excipient is suitable for its intended function?\n\nThe known functions of common excipients are sufficient to determine suitability. For example, magnesium stearate is used as a lubricant in the manufacture of immediate-release tablets. For novel excipients or novel uses of common excipients, describe studies that identified the critical attributes of that excipient (reference can be made to the pharmaceutical development report).\n\nWhat is your vendor qualification program?\n\nA description of your vendor qualification program should be provided. Initial qualification should include analysis of the first three lots received from a vendor to confirm their COA results, and the manufacturer should perform re-qualification testing for these excipients at least once per year.\n\nWho manufactures the excipients?\n\nProvide the name and address of each excipient manufacturer. Identify the U.S. Agent (if applicable).\n\n2.3.p.5 Control of Drug Product\n\nWhat is the drug product specification and does it include all the critical drug product attributes?\n\nThe drug product manufacturer should include the full release specifications. Acceptance criteria should be provided as numerical values with proper units where applicable. Dosage form specific tests should be included as appropriate (e.g., dissolution, uniformity of dosage units, water content, microbial limits, etc.) and their inclusion justified.__See CVM GFI #176/VICH GL39: Specifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Veterinary Drug Substances and New Medicinal Products: Chemical Substances.x It provides guidance on the setting and justification of acceptance criteria and the selection of test procedures for new medicinal products.\n\nDoes the drug product conform to a USP monograph?\n\nHow do the specifications compare to the USP? If the specifications do not conform to current USP, justify the differences.\n\nIf the drug product has a USP monograph, is there a difference between the USP monograph and the limits proposed?\n\nWhat is the justification?\n\nAre the analytical methods suitable for their intended uses and validated or qualified? What is the justification of the validation acceptance criteria?\n\nProvide a summary of each method and its validation/qualification.\n\nThe method summary should include the critical operational parameters. The validation summary should include results and acceptance criteria for each parameter. For each analytical procedure, provide a page number to the location of the validation information in Module 3. Validation is required if the USP method is modified or if there is no USP method (see CVM GFI #64: Validation of Analytical Procedures: Methodology.x1). If a USP method exists and is not used, then the proposed method should be demonstrated to be equivalent to or better than the USP method.\n\nFor each analytical test method for assay used in the stability program, what information demonstrates it is a stability indicating method?\n\nAre impurities quantified using impurity reference standards? What are the relative response factors for impurities?\n\nWhat is the batch control numbering system for the finished product?\n\nIs the batch analysis data included?\n\nWhat are the batch analysis results for all pilot and clinical batches, including those used for stability studies?\n\nBatch analyses should at least include release testing results.

The description can focus on the unit operation (e.g., blending) rather than the individual manufacturing steps of the unit operation. Information, such as the following, need not be provided in either the flow diagram or description: (1) equipment used (e.g., V-blender); (2) the packaging and labeling process; (3) controls, except for sterile products (e.g., injectables, implants, ophthalmics) or atypical dosage forms (e.g., metered dose inhalation (MDI), liposomal encapsulation, implants, injectable microspheres); and (4) information on reprocessing procedures and controls, unless it is safety related. Where the qualitative formulation does not change, a single description of the manufacture of different strength unit doses can be provided.\n\nFor sterile products, updates on the manufacturing process from that provided for phase 1 studies should be submitted. The phase 2 information should include changes in the drug product sterilization process (e.g., terminal sterilization to aseptic processing). Information related to the validation of the sterilization process need not be submitted at this time.\n\nControl of Excipients\n\nFor compendial excipients, references to quality standards (e.g., USP, NF) should be provided if changed from phase 1.\n\nFor noncompendial excipients, a specification sheet should be provided that identifies the tests and acceptance criteria and indicates the types of analytical procedure (e.g., HPLC) used. A complete description of the analytical procedures should be submitted upon request. A brief description of the manufacture and control of these components or an appropriate reference should be provided (e.g., DMF, NDA). Information for excipients not used in previously approved drug products in the United States (e.g., novel excipients) should be equivalent to that submitted for drug substances.\n\nControl of Drug Product\n\nPhysicochemical tests (e.g., identity, assay, content uniformity, degradants, impurities, dissolution, viscosity, particle size), biological (e.g., potency), and microbiological tests (e.g., sterility and pyrogens or bacterial endotoxins for sterile products, antimicrobial preservative for multiple-dose sterile and nonsterile dosage forms, and microbial limits for nonsterile dosage forms) that have been added or deleted from the specification should be reported. Data on the particle size distribution and/or polymorphic form of the drug substance used in clinical trial materials should be included, when appropriate (e.g., inhalation, suspension, modified release solid dosage forms) so that relevant correlations can be established between data generated during early and late drug development and in vivo product performance. Relaxation of acceptance criteria or any change that affects safety should be reported. Test results and analytical data (e.g., chromatograms) from batch release of representative clinical trial materials should be provided initially and when any changes are made in the specification.\n\nThe analytical procedure (e.g., HPLC) used to perform a test should be briefly described and changes reported when the change is such that an update of the brief description is warranted. A complete description of analytical procedures and appropriate validation data should be available for analytical procedures that are not from an FDA-recognized standard reference (e.g., official compendium, AOAC International Book of Methods), and this information should be submitted upon request.\n\nData updates on the degradation profile should be provided so safety assessments can be made.\n\n5.1.5 Container Closure System\n\nThe container closure system is defined as the sum of packaging components that together contain and protect the drug product. A brief description of the container closure system (also referred to as packaging system) should be provided in an information amendment. When changes are made in the container closure system, information should be submitted in an information amendment if there can be an effect on product quality. Otherwise, the changes can be reported in an annual report. Additional information may be requested for atypical delivery systems (e.g., MDIs, disposable injection devices).\n\n5.1.6 Stability\n\nA description of the stability program to support phase 2 clinical studies should be submitted that includes a list of the tests, analytical procedures, acceptance criteria, test time points for each of the tests, storage conditions, and the duration of the study, which should be long enough to cover the expected duration of the clinical studies.\n\nAny stability data for the clinical material used in the phase 1 study that were not reported during phase 1 should be provided in an information amendment. The stability of reconstituted products should be studied and data submitted if not already provided or when there are formulation or diluent changes. Stability data from representative clinical trial materials used in phase 2 should be provided in annual reports as the data become available.\n\nIf degradation of the drug product occurs during manufacture or storage, this change should be considered when establishing acceptance criteria and monitoring quality.\n\nBecause of the inherent complexity of many dosage forms, there may be no single stability-indicating assay or parameter that profiles all the stability characteristics of the drug product. Consequently, the manufacturer should consider the development of stability-indicating analytical procedures that will detect significant changes in the quality of the drug product. The nature of the particular drug product will determine which tests should be included in the stability program.\n\nIV Phase 3 studies\n\nCMC development continues in parallel with the clinical development during phase 3 studies. The CMC safety information provided to support phase 3 studies should focus on the information that is warranted in maintaining the continued safety of the patients enrolled in these studies. For information amendments submitted to the IND during ongoing development, the emphasis should be on reporting significant changes that can have a safety-related impact. During or before phase 3, CMC safety information that has previously been submitted to the IND may have changed and, consequently, should be updated as required under SS 312.31.7 These changes include, but are not limited to, those specified in section II.B.1. The corroborating information should be provided in the annual report to ensure that the clinical investigations will yield reliable and interpretable data.\n\nFootnote 7: Throughout section IV, the guidance indicates that updates of or changes in CMC safety information from that provided for phase 1 or phase 2 should be submitted. This statement refers to updates that would be warranted because changes are being made for materials intended for phase 3 studies. If changes relate to materials used during phase 1 or phase 2 studies, the changes should have been reported, as warranted, during those studies.\n\nSponsors can reference an official compendium or other FDA-recognized standard reference (e.g., AOAC International Book of Methods) to provide certain recommended CMC information (e.g., general methods, monograph standard) for an investigational drug substance or drug product, when applicable. Reference to DMFs or other existing INDs or NDAs, with an authorization letter from the holder, sponsor or applicant, can also be used to provide CMC information in support of the IND submission (21 CFR 312.23(b)).\n\nBefore the phase 3 studies, the sponsor can have an end-of-phase-2 meeting, or during the phase 3 studies, a CMC specific end-of-phase-2 meeting, with the Agency. As part of the preparation for that meeting, a background document is often provided that can be a valuable information amendment to the IND. The document would include updates to describe the materials already used and/or to be used in phase 3 studies, as well as put the studies performed to date in context with the prospective strategy for the ultimate NDA.\n\nDrug Substance\n\na.1.1 General Information\n--------------------\nContext title: INDs for Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.264688014984131", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: 1 Introduction and Example System Overview\n\nThis annex exemplifies one approach to implement CM for a tablet drug product based on the scientific principles described in the main guideline. The examples and approaches in this annex are illustrative, and alternative approaches can be used. Specific considerations relating to the implementation of a continuous direct compression process for a chemical entity are presented.\n\nFigure 2 illustrates a continuous direct compression process that consists of continuous feeding, blending, and tablet compression unit operations, with batch mode film coating. It is not intended to represent a regulatory flow diagram.\n\nA PAT tool using an NIR method monitors blend uniformity and triggers tablet diversion. Run time at a predefined mass flow rate is used to define the batch size range; in this case, the overall marketing demand requires batch sizes between 360 and 1080 kg of the drug product.\n\n2 Control Strategy and Other Technical Considerations\n\nThe CM system and its control strategy were designed to mitigate the impact of disturbances to ensure output material quality. The overall control strategy was developed in accordance with the main guideline and ICH Q8-Q10.\n\nMaterial Characterisation and Control\n\nFigure 2: Example of a tablet drug product CM systemDuring process design and development, a quality-by-design approach was adopted that identified equipment and process parameters critical to control of the process. Furthermore, the relationships between material quality attributes and their impact on unit operations (particularly the loss-in-weight feeders (LIWFs) and blender) and product critical quality attributes (CQAs) were evaluated. Bulk density of the primary excipient and particle size distribution (PSD) of the drug substance were identified as critical to blend and content uniformity. A defined bulk density range and three-tier (d10, d50, d90) PSD specification were implemented for the excipient and drug substance, respectively.\n\nEquipment Design and Integration\n\nUnit operations and system components (e.g., NIR probe) were designed or selected to mitigate the impact of disturbances on final product quality. The overall design principle is, where possible, to use gravity to move material. During system integration, the material flow was coordinated across all unit operations to avoid material accumulation or emptying. System mass balance was obtained through understanding of material flow (i.e., RTD) at the intended operating conditions of each unit operation. The impact of equipment design and operation on process dynamics was characterised by the RTD of individual unit operations, as well as the RTD of process segments between individual unit operations and the diversion point. The RTDs were determined by replacing the drug substance in the formulation with a tracer that has highly similar flow properties to those of the drug substance.\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_Q13_Step4_Guideline_2022_1116\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.086898326873779", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the rationale for differences in equipment, critical or quality related steps and controls?\n--------------------\nContext: The choice of excipients listed in 3.2.P.1, their concentration, their characteristics that can influence the drug product performance should be discussed relative to their respective functions.\n\n3.2.P.2.2 Drug Product (name, dosage form)\n\n3.2.P.2.2.1 Formulation Development (name, dosage form)\n\nA brief summary describing the development of the drug product should be provided, taking into consideration the proposed route of administration and usage. The differences between clinical formulations and the formulation (i.e. composition) described in 3.2.P.1 should be discussed. Results from comparative in vitro studies (e.g., dissolution) or comparative in vivo studies (e.g., bioequivalence) should be discussed when appropriate.\n\n3.2.P.2.2 Overages (name, dosage form)\n\nAny overages in the formulation(s) described in 3.2.P.1 should be justified.\n\n3.2.P.2.2.3 Physicochemical and Biological Properties (name, dosage form)\n\nParameters relevant to the performance of the drug product, such as pH, ionic strength, dissolution, redispersion, reconstitution, particle size distribution, aggregation, polymorphism, rheological properties, biological activity or potency, and/or immunological activity, should be addressed.\n\n3.2.P.2.3 Manufacturing Process Development (name, dosage form)\n\nThe selection and optimisation of the manufacturing process described in 3.2.P.3.3, in particular its critical aspects, should be explained.

The new data should be marked (e.g., with an asterisk, highlighted, underlined, etc.). Any attachments submitted in the initial report (e.g., journal articles, discharge summaries) should not be resubmitted.\n\nItem 24b - The same unique manufacturer control number used on the initial report; this is essential to prevent duplicate counting of reports.\n\nItem 24c - The date the followup information was received by the applicant.\n\nItem 25a - Clearly marked \"followup.\"\n\nTo summarize, the followup report (and attachments, if any) must contain the applicant's same unique internal recordkeeping number (control number, Item 24b on Form FDA 1639) as the initial report.\n\nIf the initial report was submitted as a 15-day report, the followup report should be submitted as a 15-day followup report even if the followup information shows that the event was labeled or not serious. Conversely, a 15-day followup report should be submitted if the event is found to be serious and unlabeled, even if the original report was not submitted as a 15-day report.\n\nDO NOT submit a followup report if additional relevant information is not obtained. However, the documentation of the procedure followed in seeking to obtain the additional information should be maintained. FDA may request this documentation.\n\nFifteen-day followup reports should not be submitted in the same envelope with periodic reports. \"15-Day Alert Report\" should be marked on the outside envelope of the 15-day followup reports.\n\nDO NOT submit a followup report when reporting a different experience in a patient for whom a previous experience was reported and submitted. Submit an initial report with a new control number (Item 24b) on a Form FDA-1639 for a new, subsequent experience. Thus, a followup report follows an experience, not a patient.\n\nV. How and Where to Report\n\nWhat and Where to Report\n\nFor prescription drugs without approved NDA's, ANDA's, or antibiotic applications, adverse experience reports should be sent as single copies to:\n\nDivision of Epidemiology and Surveillance (HFD-730)\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nFor drugs with approved NDA's, ANDA's, or antibiotic\n\napplications, all 15-day Form FDA 1639 reports of serious, unlabeled\n\nevents; 15-day narrative increased frequency reports of serious,\n\nlabeled events; periodic reports; followup reports, and letters\n\nstating no reports were received during the reporting period should\n\nbe sent in duplicate to:\n\nCentral Document Room\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nPark Building, Room 214\n\n12420 Parklawn Drive\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nAll submissions must be legible, preferably typewritten.\n\nLegible photostatic copies are acceptable. However, visual contrast\n\nmust be adequate to assure clear readable microfilm copies.\n\nIf the applicant becomes aware of a reportable adverse event, the applicant is responsible for transferring the information to a Form FDA 1639 (and narrative increased frequency report if indicated) and submitting it to FDA. If it is a serious, unlabeled event, the Form FDA 1639 should be submitted within 15 days. The applicant should not assume the reporting requirements are fulfilled by asking the initial reporter to return a Form FDA 1639 to the applicant or FDA. The applicant should not wait for the reporter to complete a Form FDA 1639 before submitting a report of a serious, unlabeled event to FDA. A 15-day report can and should be submitted based only on verbal information.\n\nAll ADE reports, except 15-day narrative increased frequency reports, should be reported on a Form FDA 1639. (Detailed guidelines for narrative increased frequency reports are in Appendix C.)\n\nHow To Obtain Copies of Form FDA 1639\n\nTo obtain up to 10 copies of Form FDA 1639 write to:\n\nDivision of Epidemiology and Surveillance (HFD-730)\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n5600 Fishers Lane, Room 15B-31\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nAdditional copies can be obtained from:\n\nPHS Forms and Publications Distribution Center (HFA-268)\n\n12100 Parklawn Drive\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nCopies of blank Form FDA 1639 can also be duplicated by the applicant.\n\nComputerized Forms\n\nIn lieu of using the preprinted Form FDA 1639, a computer-generated report may be submitted if it contains all of the elements of information in the identical enumerated sequence of Form FDA 1639, is completed in accordance with this guideline, and is forwarded with the appropriate number of copies. The typeset must be large and clear enough to assure readable microfilm copies.\n\nEach applicant's use of a modified form must be preapproved by FDA in writing.\n\nElectronic Submissions\n\nElectronically produced adverse drug experience reports may be submitted; however, each applicant must obtain prior written approval.\n\nAt this time, only periodic reports may be submitted electronically. Fifteen-day reports (serious, unlabeled events and an increase in frequency of serious, labeled events) may not be submitted electronically. Also, followup reports (to both 15-day and non-15-day reports) may not be submitted electronically.\n\nCIOMS Forms for Foreign Reports\n\nThe Council for International Organizations for Medical Sciences (CIOMS), working with several member nations and industry, has developed a format (resembling Form FDA 1639) for international ADE reporting. With prior written approval, this format can be used for reporting foreign adverse experiences to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nQuestions or Comments about Reporting Formats\n\nRequests for approval of reporting formats (computerized forms, electronic submissions, CIOMS formats, etc.) should be addressed to:\n\nSurveillance and Data Processing Branch (HFD-737)\n\nDivision of Epidemiology and Surveillance\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nPhone: 301-443-6414\n\nQuestions about Determining and Reporting Increased Frequencies\n\nQuestions about determining increased frequencies should be addressed to:\n\nEpidemiology Branch (HFD-733)\n\nDivision of Epidemiology and Surveillance\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nPhone: 301-443-2306Other Questions and Comments\n\nGeneral questions or comments about this guideline or ADE reporting should be addressed to:\n\nReports Evaluation Branch\n\nDivision of Epidemiology and Surveillance (HFD-735)\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nPhone: 301-443-4580\n\nVI. Special Situations\n\nA number of special situations occur that may seemingly complicate reporting requirements. Following are several:\n\na. Scientific Literature Reports\n\nSerious, unlabeled adverse events that are reported in the literature (or as an unpublished manuscript) must be submitted as 15-day reports on Form FDA 1639.\n\nA copy of the article or manuscript must be attached to the completed Form FDA 1639.\n\nA separate Form FDA 1639 must be completed for each identifiable patient (with an identifiable adverse event). Thus, if an article describes six patients with a given adverse experience, six Form FDA 1639's should be completed.\n\nWhen an ADE is based on a foreign language article or manuscript, the applicant is expected to translate the publication into English promptly. The original article or manuscript and translation should be attached to the submitted Form FDA 1639.\n\nAll literature reports and manuscript reports should be marked \"Literature\" in Item 24d.\n\nIf multiple drug products are mentioned in the article, Form FDA 1639 should be submitted only by the manufacturer whose drug is the suspect drug.\n\nThe suspect drug is that identified by the article's author, and is usually mentioned in the article's title.\n\nb. Postmarketing, Clinical Trial, or Surveillance Study of Drugs Involving ADE Monitoring\n\nFor the purposes of this section, a study refers to a formal research effort including a protocol with specific objectives and a scientific methodology for collecting and analyzing ADE data. Anything less rigorous should be treated as a spontaneous report.\n\nThe only experiences from studies that should be considered for submission to FDA under 21 CFR 310.305 or 314.80 are those that would be reported as (1) 15-day reports of serious, unlabeled events and (2) 15-day narrative increased frequency reports of serious, labeled events. These should be reported only if there is a \"reasonable possibility\" that the event is causally related to the drug exposure.\n\nEvents reportable from investigational new drug (IND) trials (with marketed drugs) also must be submitted to the IND as described in 21 CFR 312.32.\n\nFor each ADE, a suspect drug must be identified. Thus, for blinded studies, reports shall be completed only after the code is broken.\n\nPostmarketing, clinical trial, and surveillance studies as described in this section and under 21 CFR 310.305 or 314.80(e) refer to studies specifically monitoring adverse effects of the drug. Adverse events incidental to other types of studies should be treated as spontaneous reports.\n\nc. Foreign Reports\n\nOnly 15-day reports of serious, unlabeled events and 15-day narrative increased frequency reports of serious, labeled events are required to be submitted with respect to foreign reports. Other foreign reports, including serious, labeled events and all nonserious events, are not required to be submitted. However, reports of serious, labeled events should be available and submitted to FDA if requested.\n\nReports are also to be submitted if the foreign ADE is for a product that has the same active moiety as the product marketed in the United States. This is true even if the excipients, dosage forms, strengths, routes of administration, and indications vary.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guideline for Postmarketing Reporting of Adverse Drug Experiences \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.6359949111938477", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, How long does FDA estimate it will take firms to compile and provide communications of follow-up information regarding previously communicated information to payors about their unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved/cleared products?\n--------------------\nContext: This guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).\n\nThe time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average 100 hours per response, including the time to review instructions, search existing data sources, gather the data needed, and complete and review the information collection.

Firms should follow their plan for the submission of the stored reports not submitted in the regulatory timeframes. Firms are generally expected to submit stored reports to FDA within 6 months of restoration of the adverse event reporting process to the pre-pandemic state, or after notification by the Agency, any time frame established by FDA. Firms should prioritize the order of submission for stored reports. For example, reports with regulatory timeframes of 30 days or less (e.g., 15-day reports, 30-day reports) should be submitted before periodic safety reports.\n\nFirms that cannot meet adverse event reporting requirements at the minimum levels identified in this guidance should consult the appropriate FDA organizational unit responsible for adverse event reporting compliance.\n\nIV.

This contact information should be included in out-of-office messages, whenever appropriate. This is particularly important during the 30-day period after submission of an original IND.\n\nFaxes Between FDA and Sponsors\n\nFaxes can be used when secure email has not been established between FDA and sponsors although they are not substitutes for formal submissions (e.g., new INDs and amendments); formal submissions should be submitted to the respective center's document room (paper submissions) or via the electronic gateway, as applicable. Before transmitting faxes, sponsors and FDA RPMs should contact their respective counterparts to arrange for confirmation of receipt. Given the volume of communications received by FDA and sponsors, this reduces the possibility that faxes will be overlooked. To facilitate accurate and timely routing, coversheets should be included with faxes.\n\nUse of Out-of-Office Messages by FDA and Sponsors\n\nSponsors and FDA staff should alert others to their unavailability by using email or voicemail out-of-office messages, or by communicating a planned absence in advance by email or telephone. The messages should include an expected return time and contact information for other staff that may be able to assist in the interim, particularly for time-sensitive communications (e.g., notification of clinical hold). FDA RPMs should also include contact information for their divisions' CPMS in CDER or the alternative project management staff in CBER.\n\nResources for Sponsors\n\nTo disseminate a broad range of information in a manner that can be easily and rapidly accessed by interested parties, FDA develops and maintains web pages, portals, and databases, and participates in interactive media as a means of providing self-service tools for its stakeholders, including sponsors. Sponsor use of these tools allows FDA to focus its limited resources on providing advice regarding scientific and regulatory issues that fall outside of established guidance, policy, and procedures.\n\n1.1 FDA Guidances\n\nFDA uses guidance documents to explain its current thinking on policy, scientific, and/or regulatory issues.34 FDA guidances are useful for industry, FDA staff, and other stakeholders who may refer to them to address such matters as the design, manufacturing, and testing of regulated products; scientific issues; format and content of marketing applications; and inspection and enforcement policies. In general, FDA guidances do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe FDA's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. Stakeholders can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. For available guidances, see the FDA Drugs guidance web page at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\n4.2.2 FDA Policy and Procedures\n\nCDER's MAPPs document CDER internal policies and procedures, while CBER's SOPPs document CBER internal policies and procedures.

It is intended to improve communication between FDA and industry. The FDA Basics for Industry web page can be found at https://www.fda.gov/forindustry/fdabasicsforindustry/default.htm.\n\nThe Investigator-Initiated Investigational New Drug (IND) Applications web page includes links to information for investigators about submitting INDs to FDA and can be found at https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApprove d/ApprovalApplications/InvestigationalNewDrugINDApplication/ucm343349.htm.\n\n4.2.4 FDA Interactive Media\n\nFDA uses interactive media to communicate information about emerging science, new policies, procedures, guidances, MAPPs, SOPPs, and public advisory committee meetings or workshops that affect or can inform drug development. To stay informed, sponsors and review staff should subscribe to interactive media. A listing of interactive media resources can be found at https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/InteractiveMedia/default.htm.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\niv.1.5 FDA Presentations\n\nCDER's Presentation Library provides access to information about FDA policies and procedures presented to external audiences at meetings, conferences, and workshops sponsored or co-sponsored by FDA. The information covers a range of topics, including, for example, user fees, drug advertising and marketing, genomics, drug quality, and nonprescription drugs. Materials and overviews from some of these meetings are listed in the Presentations Library at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDER/uc m074833.htm.\n\nCBER's web-based outreach program provides presentations about the work performed by the CBER offices. A listing of available presentations can be found at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/InternationalActivities/ucm273267.htm.\n\n6. FDA Labeling and Approvals\n\nCDER's Drugs(r)FDA database contains information about FDA-approved brand name and generic prescription and nonprescription human drugs and the biological therapeutic products regulated by CDER. It includes most of the approvals since 1939 and the majority of patient information, labels, approval letters, reviews, and other information for drug products approved since 1998. The database can be used to view approval history and find all drugs with a specific active ingredient, consumer information, therapeutically equivalent drugs for an innovator or generic, generic drugs for an innovator, and labels for approved drugs. The database can be found at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf.\n\nCBER's Biologics Products & Establishments web page contains searchable information and supporting documents for approved NDAs regulated by CBER, licensed biological products (except for therapeutic biological products regulated by CDER), premarket approvals, humanitarian device exemptions, and cleared 510(k) submissions. The web page also contains information regarding 510(k) blood establishment computer software, donor screening assays for infectious agents and HIV diagnostic assays, a complete list of vaccines licensed for immunization and distribution in the United States, and reports including the User Fee Billable Biologic Products and Potencies Approved Under Section 351 of the PHS Act report. This web page can be found at https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/ucm121134.htm.\n\nThe FDA Online Label Repository is a searchable list of licensed products and establishments; it contains the most recent drug listing information companies have submitted to FDA. The repository can be found at https://labels.fda.gov/.\n\nThe FDA New Pediatric Labeling Information Database is a searchable list that highlights key pediatric information from the studies submitted in response to pediatric legislative initiatives. For information on new pediatric information that has been added to product labeling since September 9, 2007, see\n\nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/sda/sdNavigation.cfm?sd=labelingdatabase.\n\n7.7.7 FDA Rules and Regulations\n\nFDA publishes regulations and other notices in the Federal Register, the Federal Government's official publication for notifying the public of many kinds of agency actions. The FDA Rules and Regulations web page contains information about the notice and comment rulemaking process, the review of proposed and final rules, and related resources. See https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/RulesRegulations/default.htm.\n\n7.7.8 FDA-Funded Scientific Research Results\n\nFDA publishes the results of FDA-funded scientific research. The broad availability of scientific information and underlying data allow for the critical review, replication, and verification of findings that are central to the scientific method. Making research findings and the digital data supporting those findings accessible and analyzable promotes robust and open communication with the scientific community thereby bolstering the credibility of scientific findings and the regulatory decision-making based upon those findings. See https://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/AboutScienceResearchFDA/ucm433459.htm.\n\n7.7.9 Code of Federal Regulations\n\nThe Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is the codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the departments and agencies of the Federal government. Final rules are integrated into the CFR by the Office of the Federal Register and Government Publishing Office staff. Regulations under 21 CFR part 312 contain the procedures and requirements governing the use of investigational new drugs, including procedures and requirements for the submission to, and review by, FDA of INDs.35 These are done on a yearly basis. See https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collectionCfr.action?collectionCode=CFR.\n\nFootnote 35: 21 CFR 312.1\n--------------------\nContext title: Best Practices for Communication Between IND Sponsors and FDA During Drug Development \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.060245990753174", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, How long does FDA estimate it will take firms to compile and provide communications of follow-up information regarding previously communicated information to payors about their unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved/cleared products?\n--------------------\nContext: During the course of these collaborative interactions, sponsors sometimes pose questions to FDA that they perceive as simple or clarifying questions with the expectation that only minimal time will be needed for an FDA response. However, what may appear to the sponsor to be simple or clarifying questions may be more complex and necessitate significant review and communication among review team members, including internal meeting(s), before an answer can be provided. For example, questions that involve interpretation of regulations and statutes, or application of existing FDA policy to novel circumstances, are often complex (not simple) and therefore demand significant vetting and response time. Similarly, questions involving combination products usually demand additional time to solicit and consider feedback from multiple FDA centers and offices. In all cases, FDA needs to take a thoughtful approach to answering sponsor questions both efficiently and comprehensively, particularly when the questions could have an important effect on critical decisions in development programs or that represent FDA views related to the evidence that will be used to support marketing.\n\nComplex scientific/technical, policy, or regulatory questions are best posed to FDA in either requests for formal meetings or in formal submissions. Traditionally, FDA has taken a collaborative approach to responding to questions included in meeting packages and in submissions, according to their respective prespecified timelines as follows:\n\nMeetings. Communications that involve sharing results and information at critical milestones during drug development or at the appropriate stage of development for a biosimilar product, or are necessary for a stalled development program to proceed, are best addressed in formal meetings between FDA and sponsors (e.g., face-to-face meeting, teleconference, or written response only (WRO)). Timelines for FDA feedback to sponsors via the formal meeting process are described in the PDUFA and BSUFA agreements16 and in FDA's formal meetings guidances.17 This FDA feedback includes: preliminary comments, final meeting minutes, and responses to questions posed in WRO requests. Footnote 16: See https://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/UserFees/PrescriptionDrugUserFee/default.htm or https://www.fda.gov/forindustry/userfees/biosimilarseefeactsufa/default.htm.\n\nSubmissions. Hundreds of supporting documents might be submitted to an IND during its life cycle that require varying degrees of review and for which communication with the sponsor may be needed. Some submissions have regulatory-mandated timelines for reviewing and providing feedback to the sponsor that are described by statute or regulation (e.g., some safety-related submissions, complete response to clinical hold18) while other submissions have FDA-established goals for review and feedback (e.g., in a MAPP). These latter submission types include some safety-related submissions, drug development submissions without regulatory timelines where communication to the sponsor is often critical and recommended (e.g., a new protocol or protocol amendment), and other submissions where communication with the sponsor may be needed. Footnote 17: See the guidances for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products and Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants.\n\nFor all other sponsor inquiries that are received via telephone, email, or in a submission without a prespecified review timeline described in a MAPP and include specific questions for FDA's consideration, the FDA RPM will strive to acknowledge such communications via telephone or email within 3 business days of receipt by the FDA RPM. FDA's acknowledgment will:\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nInclude the response itself, if available within the acknowledgment time frame;\n\nInclude an estimated time frame for division response to question(s);\n\nInform the sponsor that its question(s) involve consultation with other FDA parties (e.g., policy questions where legal input is necessary, questions about combination products where other centers or offices are involved) and therefore an estimated response time frame will be forthcoming;\n\nRecommend that the sponsor submit a formal meeting request (e.g., face to face, teleconference, or WRO); or\n\nRecommend that the sponsor contact another specialized functional area in FDA (e.g., import/export, orphan products or rare diseases, pediatric therapeutics)\n\nSimilarly, sponsors should:\n\nAcknowledge receipt of FDA's information requests (written or otherwise)\n\nProvide the appropriate FDA RPM with an estimated response time\n\nBecause sponsor delays in responding, or lack of response, to FDA information requests can negatively affect later development, it is equally important for sponsors to respond completely and promptly to FDA requests.\n\nNote that although FDA will attempt to adhere to all established or estimated response timelines, FDA may not always be able to meet these timelines. If unexpected complex issues arise during the review of a submission, FDA will provide an answer when it is fully developed, rather than adhering to a timeline when doing so may provide incomplete information to a sponsor. The timing of FDA response may also be negatively affected if the review team experiences an unexpected shift in work priorities or team staffing. In these cases, the FDA RPMs fully intend to keep sponsors apprised of changes to the estimated response timeline. When sponsors encounter delays in obtaining an FDA response to questions for which they have solicited feedback, the following stepwise approach should be taken:\n\nContact the appropriate FDA RPM, typically the review division RPM, for a status update after the expected amount of time for FDA response has passed (e.g., the timelines described in a MAPP);\n\nContact the appropriate FDA RPM, typically the review division RPM, for a status update after the estimated response time has passed (i.e., the estimated FDA-response date communicated to the sponsor previously)\n\nContact the appropriate FDA RPM's next level supervisor for assistance in eliciting a response from the FDA RPM* Contact the appropriate division or office management officials for assistance in eliciting a response from the FDA RPM's next level supervisor\n\nContact CDER's Enhanced Communication Team (ECT) or CBER's Ombudsman for assistance should the division or office management officials fail to respond\n\nVII Best Practices and Communication Methods\n\nEffective and timely communication between FDA and sponsors promotes understanding of mutual goals and is invaluable to the drug development process. Central to this is the ability to communicate clearly, both verbally and in writing, inside and outside the formal meeting format. It is also important that FDA and sponsors have a common understanding of terms and phrasing used in communications with each other, and that they are used consistently by both parties. In FDA communications related to INDs, as a best practice FDA staff will:\n\nUse words such as shall, must, required, or requirement to convey a statutory or regulatory requirement.\n\nUse the following words to communicate advice (e.g., on trial design), comments, or current thinking: advisable, critical, important, may be appropriate, should, consider, discourage, encourage, prefer, recommend, suggest, or urge. Because FDA has the advantage of viewing the spectrum of drug development data and information across sponsors, indications, and drug classes, FDA is able to communicate advice to sponsors with that expertise in mind, while upholding commercial confidentiality.\n\nThe IND phase of drug development is typically a multiyear process, and FDA recognizes that new data will become available and that scientific and regulatory advances and changes in clinical practice may occur during this time. Because sponsors are ultimately responsible for managing the overall development program for their proposed drugs, sponsors should monitor for advances in the field and/or changes in FDA guidance, and inquire if those changes may necessitate changes in prior FDA recommendations for their development programs. Although FDA reviewers consider new information and revise recommendations as needed, they try to support and adhere to their prior critical recommendations when appropriate. Changes in recommendations are expected to be based on new scientific or safety information or advances in clinical practice that make earlier FDA recommendations outdated, inappropriate, or unethical. In such cases, review staff via the FDA RPMs should inform sponsors in writing of these changes and the rationale behind the changes.\n\nBoth FDA and sponsors use various communication methods to focus discussions to effectively exchange information and resolve issues. Because there are different business cultures, communication styles, preferences, and documentation needs, there is no single best communication method. Rather, there are best practices that enhance each method. For example, telephone communication between a sponsor and the FDA RPM may be more effective than email for time-sensitive matters. A best practice would be to follow up after the telephone call with a written communication (e.g., email, submission, correspondence) so that there is documentation of decisions, agreements, or action items that arose during the interaction.\n--------------------\nContext title: Best Practices for Communication Between IND Sponsors and FDA During Drug Development \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.542423248291016"], "Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 35: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 36: Dispenser is defined in section 581(3) of the FD&C Act.\n\nTherefore, manufacturers and repackagers must determine the smallest individual saleable unit product configuration that they intend to be sold to the dispenser, and affix or imprint a product identifier (included in a 2-dimensional data matrix barcode) to that package.\n\nTo determine what constitutes a package, manufacturers and repackagers should consider how their packages of product may be opened and separated by wholesale distributors, who may sell smaller individual units of product that were inside the larger package to a dispenser for ultimate dispensing or administration to a patient. For example, although a carton of 10 individual product units may be sold to a dispenser, manufacturers and repackagers may want to apply a product identifier to each of the 10 product units in the carton if it is reasonably foreseeable that a wholesale distributor might sell individual product units to a dispenser. See Section IX.E of this guidance for examples of potential individual saleable units and a discussion of the applicable barcode requirements. Also, see Section IX.C for additional regulatory requirements that may apply when determining whether to affix or imprint a product identifier to a product unit.\n\nDo manufacturer and repackager activities related to affixing or imprinting the product identifier need to comply with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP)?\n\nYes, the CGMP requirements under 21 CFR parts 210 and 211 apply to the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of a drug product, including packaging and labeling operations, testing, and quality control of drugs.\n\nCan manufacturers and repackagers request a waiver, exemption, or exception from the DSCSA requirement to include a product identifier?\n\nYes. FDA has authority under section 582(a)(3) of the FD&C Act to grant a waiver, exception, or exemption for products and transactions from certain requirements in section 582. Manufacturers and repackagers should use the processes set forth in FDA's draft guidance for industry Waivers, Exceptions, and Exemptions from the Requirements of Section 582 of the _Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to make a request.37 This guidance also describes what information should be included with the request.\n\nFootnote 37: Draft guidance for industry Waivers, Exceptions, and Exemptions from the Requirements of Section 582 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (May 2018). When finalized, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nDo the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA apply to prescription drugs marketed without FDA approval?\n\nYes. The DSCSA establishes requirements for \"products,\" which as defined under section 581(13) of the FD&C Act are generally prescription drugs in a finished dosage form for administration to patients without substantial further manufacturing. \"Prescription drugs\" in the DSCSA refer to drugs for human use,38 which meet the requirements of section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)), independent of approval status.\n\nFootnote 38: See section 581(12) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFor prescription drugs that are marketed without FDA approval, is the manufacturer required to submit the product identifier as part of its product labeling during registration and listing?\n\nYes. FDA interprets the definition of \"labeling\" in section 201(m) of the FD&C Act to include the product identifier. Accordingly, as part of registration and listing under 21 CFR part 207, a manufacturer of any prescription drug for commercial distribution39 must submit a copy of all current labeling as specified under SS 207.49(a)(15)(i), independent of approval status.\n\nFootnote 39: Commercial distribution is defined in 21 CFR 207.1.\n\nSubmission of Label Changes Under the DSCSA\n\nHow should manufacturers or repackagers submit a package label change to FDA that is solely for incorporating the product identifier of an already approved prescription drug?40\n\nFootnote 40: For purposes of this guidance, the term drug includes biological drug products that are licensed by CDER and CBER.\n\nApplicants who submit annual reports should be aware of product identifier changes made by manufacturers and repackagers in the supply chain. Under section 582(a)(8) of the FD&C Act, a change made to the drug package label solely to incorporate the product identifier may be submitted in an applicant's annual report41 in accordance with 21 CFR 314.70(d). Under SS 314.70(d), the applicant must document certain changes in the next annual report in accordance with SS 314.81(b)(2).42 Under SS 314.81(b)(2)(i), the annual report must contain a brief summary of significant new information from the previous year that might affect the safety, effectiveness, or labeling of the drug product.\n\nFootnote 41: For purposes of this guidance, the term establishment, as used in section 582(a)(8) of the FD&C Act, refers to the applicant.\n\nA table of contents may be included in the annual report which indicates the inclusion of the labeling change for incorporating the product identifier on products.\n\nIn certain instances, it may be appropriate to submit a labeling change in a Prior Approval Supplement (PAS) or in a Changes Being Effected supplement instead of in an annual report.43\n\nFootnote 43: For further information, consult the guidance for industry Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA (April 2004).\n\nIs a manufacturer or repackager required to submit to FDA information encoded in the product identifier for each package and homogenous case of product?\n\nIn general, the information encoded in each product identifier for packages and homogenous cases is not required to be submitted to FDA. However, FDA may request information from a manufacturer or repackager in the event of a recall or to investigate a suspect or illegitimate product. In this circumstance, the manufacturer or repackager must provide the applicable transaction information,44 which includes the NDC number and lot number, as well as the transaction history and transaction statement for the product.45\n\nFootnote 44: See section 582(b)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act for manufacturer requirement; section 582(e)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act for repackager requirement.\n\nAlso, FDA may request information from a manufacturer or repackager to verify a product identifier if FDA has made the determination that a suspect product is in the possession or control of such manufacturer or repackager. In this circumstance, the manufacturer or repackager must provide relevant information46 in response that FDA can use to determine whether the product identifier affixed to or imprinted on a package or homogenous case corresponds to the standardized numerical identifier47 or lot number and expiration date assigned to the product by the manufacturer or repackager.\n\nFootnote 45: Transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statement are defined in section 581(26), (25), and (27) of the FD&C Act, respectively.\n\nFootnote 46: See section 582(b)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act for manufacturer requirement; section 582(e)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act for repackager requirement.\n\nCan a manufacturer submit a placeholder when submitting initial or updated product labeling as part of an application or supplemental application (i.e., New Drug Application [NDA], Abbreviated New Drug Application [ANDA], or Biologics License Application [BLA]) to reflect its commitment to affix or imprint the product identifier on its product?\n\nYes. CDER and CBER will accept the submission of a drug product label that contains a placeholder when submitting initial or updated product labeling as part of an application or supplemental application (i.e., NDA, ANDA, or BLA) in lieu of an image of the final product identifier that the manufacturer intends to use at the time of drug manufacturing. The placeholder should be represented on the initial or updated product labeling submission as a blank space with labels to sufficiently describe what information will be placed in that space at the time the product is manufactured (e.g., \"lot number\" and \"expiration date\") (see Question and Answer #4 above for examples of how to label each element of information).\n\nThe Product Identifier Requirement of the DSCSA and the Linear Barcode Requirement Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nIs my product package required to have both a linear barcode and a 2D data matrix barcode?\n\nIt depends. There will be instances when a product package is required to have both a linear barcode, pursuant to SS 201.25, and a 2D data matrix barcode, pursuant to the DSCSA. For a product for which a manufacturer, under the DSCSA, has identified the smallest individual saleable unit intended for ultimate sale to a dispenser--which is a \"package\" under FD&C Act section 581(11)--the package would generally require a 2D data matrix barcode to comply with the DSCSA48 in addition to the requisite linear barcode under SS 201.25. See Section E of this guidance for examples of when a 2D data matrix barcode may not be required.\n\nFootnote 48: See FD&C Act sections 582(b)(2)(A) and 582(a)(9).\n\nWith the enactment of the DSCSA, is the guidance for industry \"Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers\" (August 2011) still applicable for the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25?\n\nYes. The guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers remains applicable to the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25 unless or until such time the guidance is revised, replaced, or withdrawn. This guidance should be consulted for questions specific to the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.49\n\nFootnote 49: See guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers (August 2011), available at https://www.fda.gov/files/vaccines%2C%20blood%20%26%20biologies/published/Guidance-for-Industry\u2013Bar-Code-Label-Requirements.pdf).\n--------------------\nContext title: Product Identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.7124173641204834", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 10: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(d)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 12: For this guidance, (tradangpartner) is defined as described in section 581(23)(A) of the FD&C Act. Although third-party logistics providers are also considered trading partners under section 581(23)(B) of the FD&C Act, they are not subject to the same product tracing requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nThe Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public Law 113-54) was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier, authorized trading partner, and verification requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers, and dispensersto facilitate the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act is prohibited under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nOne requirement of the verification scheme outlined in the DSCSA is the verification of saleable returned product. Under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act, wholesale distributors must have systems in place that will enable them to verify the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, on each sealed homogeneous case of saleable returned product, or, if such product is not in a sealed homogeneous case, on each package of saleable returned product. A saleable returned product may not be further distributed until the product identifier is verified.13 The product should be handled as suspect product if the product identifier is not successfully verified (i.e., it should be quarantined and investigated).14. 15 FDA published the 2019 Compliance Policy on September 24, 2019, announcing a 1-year delay in enforcement against wholesale distributors who do not verify the product identifier of saleable returned product prior to further distributing such product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 14: See Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs (October 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIn addition, section 582 of the FD&C Act requires certain trading partners (manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers) to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and a transaction statement when engaging in transactions involving certain prescription drugs.16({}^{,})17 A transaction statement must include a statement that the entity transferring ownership in a transaction had systems and processes in place to comply with verification requirements under section 582 of the FD&C Act.18 In the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA acknowledged that wholesale distributors may not have systems in place by November 27, 2019, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, the 2019 Compliance Policy indicated FDA's intent to take no enforcement action prior to November 27, 2020, against a wholesale distributor that provided a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor did not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(c)(4)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act details how wholesale distributors must handle suspect product.\n\nFootnote 17: Transaction, transaction history, transaction information, and transaction statement are defined under sections 581(24), (25), (26), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582 also includes requirements for dispensers to verify product identifiers when investigating suspect or illegitimate product. Specifically, section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act provides that, effective November 27, 2020, dispensers must verify \"the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, of at least 3 packages or 10 percent of such suspect product, whichever is greater, or all packages, if there are fewer than 3, corresponds with the product identifier for such product [in the dispenser's possession or control]\".19 Section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act requires dispensers to verify product as described in 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act when they have received a notification of illegitimate product from FDA or a trading partner.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIII Compliance Policy for Wholesale Distributor Verification of Saleable Returned Product\n\nAfter publishing the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA has received comments and feedback from wholesale distributors, as well as other trading partners and stakeholders, expressing additional concern with industry-wide readiness for implementation of the verification of saleable returned product requirement for wholesale distributors. Stakeholders have explained that the primary factors FDA considered when issuing the 2019 Compliance Policy still exist: (1) the very large volume of saleable returned products requiring verification; (2) the need to refine and test verification systems during actual production using real-time volumes of saleable returned product rather than simply in pilots; and (3) the complexities of building an interoperable, electronic system with the capabilities to timely and efficiently verify the large volume of saleable returned products amid immature technologies.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some wholesale distributors may still need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, when the delay in enforcement set forth in the 2019 Compliance Policy expires, before they can begin verifying returned products prior to resale or other further distribution as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act in an efficient, secure, and timely manner. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against wholesale distributors who do not verify a product identifier prior to resale or other further distribution of a package or sealed homogenous case of product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAdditionally, FDA recognizes that wholesale distributors may still not have systems in place by November 27, 2020, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, prior to November 27, 2023, FDA does not intend to take action against a wholesale distributor for providing a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor does not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.20\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPolicy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (September 2018), addresses such returns.28_\n\nFootnote 28: For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page.\n\nIV Compliance Policy for the Dispenser Verification Requirements\n\nIn the years since the passage of the DSCSA, FDA has received comments and feedback from dispensers expressing concern with readiness for implementation of certain requirements under section 582(d) of the FD&C Act, including the verification requirements addressed in this compliance policy. Specifically, dispensers have described challenges with implementation of these provisions in the DSCSA due to the time necessary to develop technologies and processes that would support a robust verification system.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some dispensers may need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, before they can begin to verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect and illegitimate products as described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect product as required by section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act. In addition, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify, as required by section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act, the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of product that is the subject of an illegitimate product notification by FDA or a trading partner.\n--------------------\nContext title: Wholesale Distributor Verification Requirement for Saleable Returned Drug Product and Dispenser Verification Requirements When Investigating a Suspect or Illegitimate Product\u2014Compliance Policies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.163464903831482", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 16: Depending on the circumstances, submission of a PAS may be required to make the BLA-specific labeling revisions for certain deemed BLAs (see 21 CFR 601.12(f)(1)). However, to facilitate efficient and appropriate revisions to container labels, carton labeling, and prescribing information, FDA recommends submitting a PAS even when doing so would not berequired.\n\nMost labeling requirements for container labels, carton labeling, and prescribing information are the same for biological products currently regulated under the FD&C Act as they are for biological products regulated under the PHS Act. However, there are certain labeling requirements under the PHS Act and regulations for BLAs that differ from requirements under the FD&C Act and regulations for NDAs.\n\nThe PHS Act requires that each \"package\" of a biological product is plainly marked with, among other things, \"the proper name of the biological product contained in the package\" and \"the name, address, and applicable license number of the manufacturer of the biological product\" in order for the biological product to be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce (see section 351(a)(1)(B) of the PHS Act; 21 CFR 610.61, 610.63, 610.64 and 201.1(m)). The \"package\" means the \"immediate carton, receptacle, or wrapper, including all labeling matter therein and thereon, and the contents of the one or more enclosed containers. If no package, as defined in the preceding sentence, is used, the container shall be deemed to be the package\" (21 CFR 600.3(cc)). The \"manufacturer\" of a biological product regulated under the PHS Act that needs to be identified on each package is the BLA holder (see 21 CFR 600.3(t)(definition of (manufacturer)); see also 21 CFR 610.63 (labeling requirements for divided manufacturing responsibility)).17\n\nFootnote 17: This definition differs in certain respects from the use of the term manufacturer in the context of a drug product regulated under the FD&C Act (see, e.g., 21 CFR 201.1(b)). The name and address of the distributor of a biological product may appear on the labeling provided that the name, address, and lic sense number of the manufacturer also appears on the label and the name of the distributor is qualified by one of the phrases listed in 21 CFR 610.64 (e.g., \u201cManufactured by [BLA holder] for [Distributor]\u201d). FDA notes that a BLA holder is not required to list a contract manufacturer on the labeling because contract facilities are considered to be under the control of the BLA holder.\n\nThe holder of the deemed BLA will need to revise product labeling to ensure that the biological products are labeled with the proper name of the biological product, the name and address of the manufacturer (if the required information on the manufacturer is not already provided), and the license number, and that the labeling otherwise conforms to the labeling requirements for biological products regulated under section 351 of the PHS Act (see section IV below for information about the Agency's compliance policy). The FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date will provide the U.S.\n\nlicense number assigned to the application holder. The license authorizes the application holder to manufacture the biological product within the meaning of section 351 of the PHS Act and to introduce the biological product or deliver the biological product for introduction into interstate commerce. FDA will designate the (proper\\ name) of the biological product in the license (see 21 CFR 600.3(k) and Q21 below).\n\nThere are additional requirements for the container labels and carton labeling for a biological product regulated under section 351 of the PHS Act (see 21 CFR 610.60 and 21 CFR 610.61; see also 21 CFR 610.62 for requirements applicable to biological products that do not fall within the specified categories of biological products described in 21 CFR 601.2 (\"non-specified biological products\")). In the table below, we provide an overview of key changes18 from NDA labeling requirements for container labels and carton labeling that will apply to biological products in deemed BLAs.\n\nFootnote 18: Additional labeling requirements not summarized in this chart are described in the text that follows.\n\nTable. Selected Requirements for Container Labels and Carton Labeling for Biological Products\n\nFactor in Safe Acministration & Carton labeling must include the source of the product when a factor in safe \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\nThere also are certain differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act. The key differences for the prescribing information for a biological product regulated under the PHS Act are that the labeling must include the proper name of the biological product, including any appropriate descriptors (see 21 CFR 201.57(a)(2)), and the manufacturer name, address, and license number (see 21 CFR 610.60(a)(2) and 610.61(b)). Conforming revisions also would need to be made to FDA-approved patientlabeling. In addition, for biological products that are required to meet the content and format requirements of the Physician Labeling Rule (PLR) as described in 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57, the year used for the Initial U.S. Approval included in the Highlights of Prescribing Information (Highlights) differs for a biological product under the FD&C Act (i.e., the year of initial U.S. approval of the new molecular entity) and the PHS Act (i.e., the year of initial U.S. approval of the new biological product). Accordingly, the Initial U.S. Approval in the Highlights may need to be revised to reflect the year in which the first NDA for the biological product(s) described in the labeling was initially approved.\n\nThe date of initial approval of the NDA (and not the date on which the NDA is deemed to be a BLA) and the date(s) of approval of efficacy supplement(s) will continue to govern the applicability of the labeling content and format requirements described by 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57. For NDAs that are not required to have labeling in PLR format, application holders may consider voluntarily converting the labeling to PLR format because the PLR format represents a more useful and modern approach for communicating information on the safe and effective use of products and makes prescribing information more accessible for use with electronic prescribing tools and other electronic information resources.\n\nThe holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product should submit all proposed revisions to product labeling necessary to conform to labeling requirements for biological products regulated under section 351 of the PHS Act (i.e., container labels, carton labeling, prescribing information, and patient labeling) together in the same PAS. To facilitate identification of the type of submission for the Agency, the applicant should mark clearly on the cover letter, \"Deemed BLA Labeling Revisions.\"\n\nA the re different requirements related to CMC that will apply to a biological product in a deemed 351(a) BLA?\n\nCertain CMC requirements and recommendations applicable to biological products regulated under the PHS Act may differ in some respects from CMC requirements and recommendations applicable to biological products regulated under the FD&C Act. However, FDA expects that in many instances the practical implications of such differences on holders of deemed BLAs will be minimal because the CMC requirements under both the PHS Act and the FD&C Act address many of the same types of CMC considerations for ensuring quality biological products. For example, FDA anticipates that most biological products subject to the transition provision, upon being deemed BLAs, will meet the related general BLA requirements (e.g., potency, sterility, purity, and identity) under the PHS Act based on the products having been previously approved under the FD&C Act.\n\nThe holders of deemed BLAs may be required to report or provide different information than is required for biological products under the FD&C Act. In the sections below, we highlight such requirements, namely lot release, biological product distribution reports, notification of manufacturing problems involving distributed products, and establishment standards for \"non-specified biological products.\"Additionally, as with all biological products, FDA may recommend changes to the control strategy throughout the product life cycle to modernize control strategies, to address product-specific issues, and to help ensure that biological products remain safe, pure, and potent for their approved conditions of use. Furthermore, as with all biological products, these changes may be recommended as a result of postapproval or surveillance inspections, which are independent of a submission and generally expected to be similar for a biological product whether approved in an NDA prior to the transition date or licensed in a BLA. For inspections related to CMC supplements see Q16 below.\n\nFDA is committed to working with application holders to minimize any potential burden, and encourages application holders with any CMC-related questions to contact OPQ/Office of Program and Regulatory Operations (OPRO) at CDER-OPQ-Inquiries@fda.hhs.gov.\n\niv.1.1 Lot Release\n\nFDA may require that a BLA holder submit samples and CMC data for each lot of product for FDA review and release (see 21 CFR 610.2). However, FDA generally does not anticipate that lot release requirements will apply for biological products approved in NDAs that are deemed to be BLAs.\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.80996036529541", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , Can a manufacturer or repackager put the 2D data matrix barcode, as required under the DSCSA, on all levels of packaging, including the immediate container?\n--------------------\nContext: Assess the Effects of the Change: To evaluate the effects of a manufacturing change on the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of a drug product as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug product (21 CFR 314.3(b)).\n\nContainer Closure System: The sum of packaging components that together contain and protect the dosage form. This includes primary packaging components and secondary packaging components if the latter are intended to provide additional protection to the drug product.\n\nComponent: Any ingredient intended for use in the manufacture of a drug product, including those that may not appear in such drug product (21 CFR 210.3(b)(3)).\n\nDrug Product: A finished dosage form, for example, tablet, capsule, or solution, that contains an active ingredient generally, but not necessarily, in association with inactive ingredients (21 CFR 210.3(b)(4)).\n\nFinal Intermediate: The last compound synthesized before the reaction that produces the drug substance. The final step forming the drug substance involves covalent bond formation or breakage; ionic bond formation (i.e., making the salt of a compound) does not qualify. Consequently, when the drug substance is a salt, the precursors to the organic acid or base, rather than the acid or base itself, should be considered the final intermediate.\n\nInactive Ingredient: Any intended component of the drug product other than an active ingredient.\n\nIn-process Material: Any material fabricated, compounded, blended, or derived by chemical reaction that is produced for, and used in, the preparation of the drug product (21 CFR 210.3(b)(9)). For drug substance, in-process materials are considered those materials that are undergoing change (e.g., molecular, physical).\n\nIntermediate: A material that is produced during steps of the synthesis of a drug substance and undergoes further molecular change before it becomes a drug substance.\n\nPackage: The container closure system and labeling, associated components (e.g., dosing cups, droppers, spoons), and external packaging (e.g., cartons, shrink wrap).\n\nPackaging Component: Any single part of a container closure system.\n\nPrimary Packaging Component: A packaging component that is or may be in direct contact with the dosage form.\n\nReference Listed Drug: The listed drug identified by FDA as the drug product on which an applicant relies in seeking approval of its abbreviated application (21 CFR 314.3(b)).\n\nSatisfactory Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) Inspection: A satisfactory CGMP inspection is an FDA inspection during which (1) no objectionable conditions or practices were found (No Action Indicated (NAI)) or (2) objectionable conditions were found, but voluntary corrective action is left to the firm and the objectionable conditions will not be the subject of further administrative or regulatory actions (Voluntary Action Indicated (VAI)).\n\nInformation about the CGMP status of a firm may be obtained by requesting a copy of the Quality Assurance Profile (QAP) from the FDA's Freedom of Information (FOI) Office. The QAP contains information on the CGMP compliance status of firms that manufacture, package, assemble, repack, relabel, or test human drugs, devices, biologics, and veterinary drugs.

The product code is often used by health care providers to confirm the correct product and strength. The assignment of sequential numbers for the product code (e.g., 6666, 6667, and 6668) has not been an effective differentiating feature and, therefore, is not recommended.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:27]\n\n4.2.2 Product Strength on Carton Labeling\n\nThe product strength on the PDP and other panels of the blister carton labeling should describe the milligram amount of drug per single unit (e.g., tablet, capsule) so that there is no confusion as to how much product is contained in a single unit compared to the total contents of the entire blister pack. We recommend the following:\n\nXX mg per tablet or XX mg per capsule\n\nFor products where a blister pack or carton contains 1 dose, if the total dose requires more than 1 unit (e.g., 1 tablet), then the PDP should display both the milligram amount of drug per single unit (e.g., tablet, capsule) and the total dose contained in the blister pack or carton (e.g., contains 40 mg total dose (2 x 20 mg tablets)). In some cases, the total dose should appear more prominently than the strength per unit on the PDP if there is a risk that users will only administer one unit believing it is the full dose.\n\n4.2.3 Blister Cell Label Material and Readability\n\nColor, type size, and font style should be carefully chosen based on the material used for the blister cell backing. Because the legibility of text printed on foil might be impaired due to the reflective nature of the material, it is important to ensure that information printed on foil is readily legible. Additionally, the ability to scan barcodes may also be impaired when they are printed on foil. When possible, a nonreflective material should be used to enhance the readability of product information.\n\n4.2.4 Blister Pack Label Design\n\nThoughtful usage of blister packs or calendar packs that can be dispensed intact to patients may help to reduce medication errors. Blister packs may improve patient adherence and minimize the risk of accidental exposure to the drug. Additionally, blister packs can be designed so that critical information stays with the medication throughout the intended use of the product by the end user. However, careful consideration should be given to the overall design of a blister pack label so that it does not lead to confusion and error. Sponsors should ensure that the packaging configuration makes sense for the dosage and administration of the drug product and the intended patient population. If multiple configurations of blister packs will be introduced, sponsors should ensure there is adequate differentiation between them and adequate mechanisms to ensure they can be easily distinguished and correctly selected throughout the medication use process (e.g., prescribing, dispensing). Blister pack label design factors that have been associated with reported medication errors include the following:\n\nPresenting and sequencing doses in ways that do not match the product's approved recommended dosage, leading to administration of the wrong dose. For example, the blister pack label presents the product in a manner that provides for a fixed-dose regimen (e.g., twice-a-day dose), but the approved recommended dosing regimen is variable (e.g., once or twice daily).\n\nLabeling doses in the package with fixed days of the week when the dosage and administration do not require such sequencing. For example, a packaging configuration labeled with the days of the week (e.g., Mon., Tues., Wed.) can lead to delays in starting therapy because patients may wait to start their medication on the first specified day.\n\nNumbering each blister cell in sequence, such as controlled substances packaged in a 30-tablet blister pack and numbered from 1 to 30. Although this may be convenient for keeping records of controlled substances in facilities, the number has been confused for the tablet strength and day of the month.\n\nProviding more doses than needed for a single course of treatment, leading to an excessive duration of therapy (e.g., a 20-tablet pack for a product that should be administered once daily for a total of 5 days).\n\nLabeling of Ferrules and Cap Overseals\n\nVials for injectable drug products often include elastomeric closures (stoppers), which are connected to the vials by bands, or ferrules. A cap overseal is a disc over a ferrule that protects the stopper. The ferrule and cap should be prominently visible on the vial immediately before administering the drug product. Given the location of ferrules and caps of medication vials, the information provided on them has a critical role in providing crucial information to the health care provider and should be limited to important safety messages critical for the prevention of imminent, life-threatening situations. For some products, a cautionary statement is required to be included on ferrules or caps; if no cautionary statement is required, the top surface of the vial, including the ferrule and cap overseal, should remain blank.62 Other statements (e.g., lot numbers) can appear on the side of the ferrule but should not detract from any cautionary statement appearing on the top surface.\n\nFootnote 62: See USP General Chapter (<)7(>), Labeling, Ferrules and Cap Overseals\n\nUSP General Chapter (<)7(>), Labeling, contains a section entitled Ferrules and Cap Overseals. Sponsors should conform with the additional recommendations set forth in USP General Chapter (<)7(>).\n\nColor Closure System for Concentrated Potassium Chloride\n\nA black closure system on a vial (e.g., a black cap overseal and a black ferrule to hold the elastomeric closure) or a black band or series of bands above the constriction on an ampule are used only for Potassium Chloride for Injection Concentrate.63 This unique color closure system differentiates this concentrated strength of potassium chloride and alerts the end user that the product is more concentrated.64 As such, black cap overseals/ferrules/lines should not be used on any other drug product.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nLabels and Labeling for Large-Volume Injections\n\nFDA receives many reports of confusion and errors involving large-volume injections. These reports cite look-alike container labels, lack of prominence of important information on a label, and label clutter. The container labels and carton labeling for large-volume injections must align with applicable USP standards and FDA regulations.65\n\nFootnote 65: See USP General Chapter <7>, Labeling, for USP standards. See FDA regulations in 21 CFR part 201 for drugs; and FDA regulations in 21 CFR part 610, Subpart G, Labeling Standards, for biological products.\n\n1.1.1 Information for Container Labels of Large-Volume Injections\n\nBased on information and recommendations from a joint public meeting held by FDA, ISMP, and USP in 200766 as well as postmarketing experience, the following information includes required elements as well as recommendations for information that should be on container labels of large-volume injections:\n\nFootnote 66: See the Federal Register notice Improving Patient Safety by Enhancing the Container Labeling for Parenteral Infusion Drug Products; Public Meeting, published on November 28, 2006 (71 FR 68819).\n\nProduct name(s) (see section III.C)\n\nPackage type term\n\nPrimary expression of strength is total quantity per total volume, followed by quantity per milliliter (see sections III.C and IV.C.3)67 Footnote 67: Use when a large-volume parenteral contains a drug (e.g., Dopamine, Esmol) in addition to the infusion solution (e.g., Dextrose Injection 5%).

Unless otherwise required (e.g., by USP) or unless space permits, in order to avoid detracting from important information for the safe use of the product, we recommend against including the following information on the container label for large-volume injections:\n\n(1) All secondary trademark information (e.g., proprietary names for containers/packaging material)\n\n(2) Symbols\n\n(3) Statements such as Caution--Check for minute leaks by squeezing container firmly (\\ldots)\n\nand If leaks are found (\\ldots)\n\n(4) The statement Use only if solution is clear and container is undamaged\n\n(5) Statements about series connection\n\n(6) An osmolarity statement (except as required under USP monographs for specific products)Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n(7) A lactic acidosis statement (except as required by USP on lactated Ringer's bags)\n\n(8) Statements such as Printed in USA\n\n(9) Statements such as Dose intravenously as directed by the prescriber\n--------------------\nContext title: Safety Considerations for Container Labels and Carton Labeling Design to Minimize Medication Errors \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.107730865478516"], "Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n\nA general comparison appears in the FDA's Good Clinical Practice program website, Comparison of FDA and HHS Human Subject Protection Regulations found at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/EducaionalMaterials/ucm112910.htm.

The categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure are described in the Federal Register notice on expedited review, found at http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/Guida ncesInformationSheetsandNotices/ucm118099.htm. As stated in a Federal Register notice, however, sponsors and investigators may not use the expedited review procedure where identification of the subjects and/or their responses would reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, insurability, reputation, or be stigmatizing, unless reasonable and appropriate protections will be implemented so that risks related to invasion of privacy and breach of confidentiality are no greater than minimal. (63 FR 60353, November 9, 1998).\n\n6. Can leftover specimens be used in IVD studies without informed consent?\n\nThe document entitled, \"Guidance for Industry, Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Food and Drug Administration: Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies using Leftover Human Specimens that are not Individually Identifiable,\" http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo currents/ucm078384.htm, describes the limited circumstances in which FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion regarding requirements for informed consent. (See Glossary for definition of \"leftover specimens\".)\n\n7. Can those who routinely conduct studies with IVDs (e.g., research hospitals) use a general informed consent to address future studies using samples collected in their own facility?\n\nTo fulfill FDA informed consent requirements for studies of IVDs, a site may develop an informed consent process to address the use of samples collected at the facility (see the Glossary for definition) in a specific study or for a broader category of future studies. This general informed consent process may be used for subjects seen at and/or admitted to a specific facility. The informed consent document must contain all of the required elements found in 21 CFR 50.25.\n\n8. Can a human specimen that was initially collected in a study with the informed consent of the subject be used in a later study without a new consent process?\n\nIf the original informed consent document contains a statement that excess specimen(s) will be stored for future use in specified types of studies and the new study meets the criteria stated in that consent document, it is possible that no further consent is necessary. This assumes that the original informed consent document contains all of the other essential elements, including notice to the subject that FDA may review their files and an explanation of the purposes and benefits of the research. (See 21 CFR 50.25.) We recommend sponsors and investigators consult with the IRB regarding the need for a new informed consent process in such a case. The IRB decision should include consideration of any state and/or local requirements regarding informed consent and patient rights. If new testing could expose the subject to previously unanticipated risks (e.g., privacy concerns for the subject and/or his family related to testing for a genetic marker), a new consent may be needed. In addition, if the original informed consent did not address future research use at all, or did not cover the type of study now under consideration, it is likely a new consent will be needed.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, for human specimens leftover from specimens originally collected for a previous study, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion regarding informed consent requirements. See \"Guidance for Industry, Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Food and Drug Administration: Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies using Leftover Human Specimens that are not Individually Identifiable,\" http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo\n\ncuments/ucm078384.htm.\n\nVI. Data Considerations\n\n1. What information should the protocol include to ensure that the investigational IVD study will be scientifically sound?\n\nWe recommend that the protocol include a clear description of study design; objectives, estimation of performance goals (e.g., desired confidence interval widths) that are directly related to the intended claims for the IVD device, or hypotheses; and a statistical plan to be applied to the data. (See the Glossary for definitions of protocol, statistical hypothesis, and confidence interval.)\n\n2. Is it acceptable to develop new or to revise existing study hypotheses as the study progresses?\n\nWe generally believe it would be inappropriate to draw conclusions from after-the-fact hypotheses. We recommend that changes in study protocols be carefully documented and explained. FDA encourages sponsors to contact the appropriate review division to discuss studies before they are initiated and to consult FDA before changes in protocols are made mid-study. (For the FDA divisions responsible for review of IVD products, see Introduction, Section II, of this guidance.)\n\n3. How should I determine appropriate sample size for a study?\n\nThe sponsor should formulate sample size based on standard statistical techniques and the sample size should account for any unique issues related to intended use(s), device technologies, and/or the biology of the condition being studied.\n\nWhat guidance is available for sponsors to determine how to estimate IVD performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity, how to handle discrepant results, and what to do when a study is performed without a truth standard (\"gold standard\") (see the Glossary for definitions)?\n\nFDA has recognized a number of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [(CLSI), formerly National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS)] standards related to these issues. A list of these standards, but not the standards themselves, can be found through the database on the CDRH web page http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scrlpts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards\n\nThe agency's guidance entitled \"Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests\" can be viewed at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo currents/ucm071148.htm\n\nHow much leeway is there in deciding on the populations from which human specimens are collected and under what conditions are data on simulated specimens (see the Glossary for definition) acceptable?\n\nStudies should be performed in a representative sample of the intended use population (i.e., representation of both diseased and non-diseased cases, and controlling for subject demographics and morbidity factors that may affect the level of device performance). When a disease is rare or samples are needed specifically to challenge cut-off points, sponsors may use enriched samples, panels of credentialed samples (e.g., Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) panels), and/or spiked or contrived samples. The acceptance of simulated specimens depends on how well they represent specimens from the intended-use population and whether their performance accurately reflects what the IVD device user can expect.\n\nIs it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n\nAn outlier, an observation that lies an unexpected distance from other values, does not in itself prove that an error or violation has occurred. Therefore, the primary data analysis should include all such observations, including \"outliers\". A sponsor may perform some specific supplemental analyses on subsets of the data, if clinically and scientifically justified, that may exclude outlying data points. Excluding large amounts of data, regardless of the reasons for exclusion, will seriously bias the results.\n\nCan I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?In most studies the sponsor should avoid multiple testings of the same subject because it may skew performance statistics and under-estimate standard deviations. When multiple testing is done, the sponsor should explain why it is necessary and choose methods of statistical analysis that allow adjustment for within-subject correlation. It is appropriate to conduct repeated testing of the same sample to evaluate test reproducibility - i.e., the ability of the test to yield the same or similar readings when expected.\n\n8. How much precision (see the Glossary for definition) is needed for measurement data, e.g., in terms of decimal places?\n\nStudy data should contain no more decimal places than the precision of the instrument allows, i.e., if the instrument is only precise to the second decimal place the sponsor should not analyze the data using three decimal places.\n\n9. What records should help to ensure scientific soundness of an IVD investigational study?\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 8.622868537902832", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: The requirement in section 505(i) of the FD&C Act for informed consent for investigational use of drugs (including biologics) provided that FDA regulations must ensure informed consent is obtained \"except where it is not feasible or it is contrary to the best interest of such human beings.\" In order to promote consistency across medical products, FDA adopted regulations reflecting the device standard for all medical product research.\n\nIn general, FDA's regulations governing the protection of human subjects conform to the requirements in the \"Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects\" (the Common Rule), with a few exceptions because of differences in FDA's mission or statutory authority. The Common Rule, originally promulgated in 19913, sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (see 45 CFR 46, Subpart A) and 15 other Federal departments and agencies. The purpose of the Common Rule is to promote uniformity, understanding, and compliance with human subject protections as well as to create a uniform body of regulations across the Federal departments and agencies.4 FDA regulations and the Common Rule share the same definition for \"minimal risk,\" but the Common Rule allows a waiver of informed consent for minimal risk research if specific criteria are met. As stated above, FDA's regulations currently do not include an exception from informed consent for minimal risk clinical investigations.5\n\nFootnote 4: 80 FR 53931 at 53935, September 8, 2015.\n\nFootnote 5: Note that this exception from the requirement to obtain informed consent differs from the waiver from the requirement for documentation of informed consent permitted under both the Common Rule and FDA regulations (45 CFR 46.117(c); 21 CFR 56.109(c)).\n\nIII Discussion\n\nThe Common Rule standard has been adopted and successfully employed for decades by numerous other Federal agencies. The Common Rule permits an IRB to waive the requirements to obtain informed consent, or to allow changes to, or omission of, some or all elements of informed consent if the IRB finds and documents that: (1) the research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects; (2) the waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; (3) the research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration; and (4) whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation. (45 CFR 46.116(d)).6\n\nFootnote 6: The final rule that recently revised the Common Rule (82 FR 7149, January 19, 2017) adds a fifth criterion (i.e., \u201cif the research involves using identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, the research could not practicably be carried out without using such information or biospecimens in an identifiable format\u201d (new 2018 requirement at 45 CFR 46.116(f)(3)(iii)). As FDA revises its regulations to harmonize to the extent appropriate and permissible with the Common Rule, we will consider including this new criterion in any waiver provision.\n\nThe Secretary's Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections (SACHRP) provided input on the issue of whether waiver of informed consent provisions for certain minimal risk clinical investigations would be appropriate and helpful to FDA-regulated research. On March 13, 2014, SACHRP considered this issue. Recognizing that harmonization with the Common Rule would promote consistency and help to reduce confusion in the research community about when a waiver of informed consent may be permitted, while also facilitating certain FDA-regulated research, SACHRP recommended to the Secretary of HHS that FDA adopt the provisions for waiver of informed consent that exist under the Common Rule at 45 CRF 46.116(d). On October 26, 2016, SACHRP reiterated that recommendation to the Secretary.7_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nIV IRB waiver or Alteration of Informed Consent\n\nWaiver of informed consent for certain FDA-regulated minimal risk clinical investigations will facilitate investigators' ability to conduct studies that may contribute substantially to the development of products to diagnose or treat diseases or conditions, or address unmet medical needs. In light of the Cures Act amendment to the FD&C Act described above, FDA intends to revise its informed consent regulations to add this waiver or alteration under appropriate human subject protection safeguards to the two existing exceptions from informed consent (i.e., in life-threatening situations and for emergency research). However, until FDA promulgates these regulations, we do not intend to object to an IRB8 approving a consent procedure that does not include, or that alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set forth in 21 CFR 50.25, or waiving the requirements to obtain informed consent when the IRB finds and documents9 that:\n\nFootnote 8: An institutional review board (IRB) is defined in 21 CFR 56.102(g) and is subject to the requirements of 21 CFR part 56.\n\nFootnote 9: An IRB is required to prepare and maintain adequate documentation of its activities, including actions taken by the IRB, under 21 CFR 56.115.\n\nThe clinical investigation involves no more than minimal risk (as defined in 21 CFR 50.3(k) or 56.102(i)) to the subjects;\n\nThe waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects;\n\nThe clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration; and\n\nWhenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation.\n\nFDA does not intend to object to a sponsor initiating, or an investigator conducting, a minimal risk clinical investigation for which an IRB waives or alters the informed consent requirements as described above. FDA intends to withdraw this guidance after we promulgate regulations to permit a waiver or alteration of informed consent under appropriate human subject protection safeguards consistent with section 3024 of the Cures Act.\n\nV Inquiries about Specific Clinical Investigations\n\nSponsors, investigators and IRBs may contact FDA for questions about implementing the recommendations in this guidance for a specific clinical investigation.

In order to protect these vulnerable subjects, 21 CFR 50.24 places additional responsibilities on parties involved with such research, including sponsors, clinical investigators, and IRBs.\n\nWhat are the additional responsibilities imposed on parties involved with studies conducted under 21 CFR 50.24?\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]\n\n1.8 Can an emergency research study be subject to both FDA's regulations at 21 CFR 50.24 and HHS regulations at 45 CFR Part 46?\n\nYes. If the study involves an FDA-regulated product, and is conducted or supported by HHS, both the FDA regulations and HHS human subject protection regulations apply. In order for an exception from the informed consent requirements to be granted for a study that is subject to both FDA and HHS regulations, the study may not involve pregnant women or prisoners as subjects [7], and the provisions of 21 CFR 50.24 must be satisfied. When an exception from the informed consent requirements for such a study is granted, all other applicable requirements of 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, and 45 CFR 46 must be satisfied.\n\n3.1.9 Does 21 CFR 50.24 pre-empt state law?\n\nNo. Section 50.24 is not intended to preempt any applicable Federal, State, or local laws.[8] Those conducting emergency research should understand their obligations under the laws of the States in which the research will be conducted.\n\n2.10 Do studies conducted under 21 CFR 50.24 need a separate Investigational New Drug Application (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE)?\n\nYes. If an IND or IDE already exists, protocols involving an exception to the informed consent requirement must be performed under a separate IND or IDE that clearly identifies such protocols as protocols that may include subjects who are unable to consent (21 CFR 50.24(d)). Studies involving an exception from the informed consent requirements may proceed only after a sponsor has submitted an IND or IDE[9] and received prior written authorization from FDA[10] and IRB approval (i.e., the IRB must find and document that specific conditions in the regulations have been met[11]). (See Appendix A for the text of 21 CFR 50.24.)\n\n3.2.11 What information must be submitted to FDA for a study conducted under 21 CFR 50.24?\n\nFor an emergency research study involving an exception from informed consent, the separate IND or IDE submission should be completed as described in the applicable regulation. Information previously submitted to FDA may be incorporated by reference. The location of information incorporated by reference should be specifically identified, for example, by application number, date of submission,volume, page and section. If the information was submitted by someone other than the current applicant, a letter from the person who holds the files authorizing reference to the information must be provided. In addition, the submission should address the specific requirements for studies conducted under 21 CFR 50.24 (e.g., plans for community consultation, plans for public disclosure). Sponsors should contact FDA directly if they have questions about the submission process.\n\nHow are emergency research studies involving investigational drugs processed?\n\nIf the protocol involves an investigational drug, the sponsor is required to submit a separate Investigational New Drug Application (IND)12 that clearly identifies the study as including subjects who are unable to consent (21 CFR 50.24(d)). After the IND is submitted, FDA will review the study protocol under the applicable IND regulations and 21 CFR 50.24. Such a study is not permitted to proceed without the prior written authorization of FDA13 and IRB approval (i.e., the IRB must find and document that specific conditions have been met14). A copy of the prior authorization from FDA may be submitted to the IRB(s) reviewing the study. (See Appendix A for the text of 21 CFR 50.24.)\n\nFootnote 12: 21 CFR 312.20(c)\n\nFootnote 13: 21 CFR 312.20(c)\n\nFootnote 14: 21 CFR 56.103(a); 21 CFR 50.24\n\nFootnote 15: http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm081405.htm\n\nCan Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 safety and efficacy studies proceed under 21 CFR 50.24?\n\nThe \"phase\" of a trial is not the focus of this regulation and there is no requirement that a study be a Phase 1, Phase 2, or Phase 3 study in order to proceed. Rather, the intervention that is being studied must hold out the prospect of direct benefit for the individual subjects. FDA expects that Phase 1 studies, including pharmacokinetic studies, would be conducted in consenting subjects and not in a trial conducted under 21 CFR 50.24, because such studies would generally not meet the criteria for the prospect of direct benefit required by 21 CFR 50.24(a)(3). To establish potential benefits, Phase 2 controlled trials in consenting subjects may be needed to explore dose response for safety or biomarkers before an investigation proceeds under 21 CFR 50.24. Sponsors should consult with FDA if there are questions as to whether a particular study meets the requirements of this regulation. (See Question 22 for discussion of appropriate endpoints of trials conducted under 21 CFR 50.24.)\n\nCan feasibility/pilot trials for devices be conducted under 21 CFR 50.24?\n\nYes. FDA believes that feasibility/pilot studies involving devices15 may be performed in individuals having the emergency condition provided that the study holds out the prospect of direct benefit. Sponsors should consult with FDA if there are questions as to whether a particular study meets the requirements of this regulation. (See Question 22 for discussion of endpoints of trials conducted under 21 CFR 50.24.)\n\nFootnote 15: http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm081405.htm\n\nCan emergency research studies involving investigational drugs be placed on clinical hold?\n\nYes. When appropriate, FDA will place a proposed or ongoing emergency research investigation IND (or study site) on clinical hold if (1) any of the conditions in 21 CFR 312.42(b)(1) or (b)(2) apply, or (2)the pertinent criteria in 21 CFR 50.24 for such an investigation to begin or continue are not submitted or satisfied (See 21 CFR 312.42(b)(5)).\n\nHow are emergency research studies involving devices processed?\n\nA sponsor is usually required to complete and submit an IDE application describing the proposed study (See 21 CFR 812.20(a)(1)). However, if the device would otherwise meet the criteria of the abbreviated requirements under 21 CFR 812.2(b), or the proposed protocol involves a device that has already been cleared or approved for marketing and is being used in accordance with its cleared/approved labeling, the sponsor or investigator should contact FDA for clarification regarding requirements for the submission of an IDE application. FDA recommends that this contact occur prior to IRB submission, particularly for multi-site studies, as this will facilitate IRB review.\n\nIf an IDE is required, FDA will review the study protocol under the IDE regulations and 21 CFR 50.24. The study is not permitted to proceed without the prior written authorization of FDA and IRB approval (i.e., the IRB must find and document that specific conditions have been met)16. FDA may disapprove the IDE or may withdraw approval if there is a failure to comply with any requirement of the IDE regulation, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, any other applicable regulation or statute, or any condition of approval imposed by an IRB or FDA, including requirements related to the conduct of 50.24 studies (See 21 CFR 812.30). (See Appendix A for the text of 21 CFR 50.24.)\n\nFootnote 16: 21 CFR 812.20(a)(4)(i); 21 CFR 56.103(a); 21 CFR 50.24\n\n(See also Question 10.)\n\nMay studies involving in vitro diagnostic devices be conducted under 21 CFR 50.24?\n\nYes. An in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) study may be conducted provided that it meets the requirements of 21 CFR 50.24. IVD studies falling within the scope of section 50.24 would include, for example, studies in which diagnosis of a life-threatening condition cannot be confirmed by an approved product or well-established procedure (e.g., research involving an investigational test for a neurotoxin that when inhaled or in contact with skin, can cause patients to become sick within minutes, and at high doses, to lose consciousness, develop seizures and die). The regulation's use of language usually associated with therapeutic products does not exclude IVDs because the administration of therapy in a life-threatening situation can depend upon a diagnostic intervention. Sponsors should contact FDA if they have questions as to whether a particular IVD study may be conducted under 21 CFR 50.24.\n\nWill FDA accept data from emergency research studies conducted at non-US sites?\n\nYes, provided appropriate regulatory requirements are satisfied. For drug/biological drug studies, if the non-U.S. sites are under an IND, all 21 CFR 50.24 requirements must be met, as well as other provisions of 21 CFR Part 312.\n--------------------\nContext title: Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.391047239303589", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.2 Are IDE exempt studies subject to the requirements for informed consent and IRB review and approval under Parts 50 and 56?\n\nIf an exempt study is being conducted to collect data to support either a clinical investigation or a marketing application, then the study must comply with 21 CFR Part 50 and should comply with 21 CFR Part 56. 21 CFR 50.1(a), 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 56.101(a), 21 CFR 56.103.\n\n3.3.3 Does FDA require IRB review and approval of off-label use of a legally marketed device?\n\nNo, when a physician uses a legally marketed device outside its labeling to treat a patient and no research is being done, IRB review is not required. Note: Although not required by FDA, an IRB may still decide on its own initiative to review such use. Yes, when the off-label use of a legally marketed device is part of a research study collecting safety and effectiveness data involving human subjects, IRB review and approval is required (21 CFR 812.2(a)).\n\nFor additional information on the off-label use of devices, see the FDA Information Sheet guidance, \" 'Off-label' and Investigational Use of Marketed Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices.\"6\n\nFootnote 6: This guidance can be found at: www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/offlabel.html\n\nMust an IRB review a study conducted after submission of a (510(k)) to FDA but prior to FDA's decision on that submission?\n\nYes. During FDA's review of the premarket notification submission, the device remains an investigational product. Therefore, the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations apply. The device may not be distributed, except for investigational use, unless FDA clears the device for marketing.\n\n16 Can a physician use an unapproved device in an emergency?\n\nIn general, an unapproved medical device may be used only on human subjects when the device is under clinical investigation and when used by investigators participating in a clinical trial. Section 561 of the Act, however, recognizes that there may be circumstances under which a health care provider may wish to use an unapproved device to save the life of a patient or to prevent irreversible morbidity when there exists no other alternative therapy. For investigational devices under an IDE, the IDE regulation permits deviations from the investigational plan without prior approval when necessary to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency. (See 21 CFR 812.35(a)). A physician may treat a patient with an unapproved medical device in an emergency situation if he/she concludes that:\n\nThe patient has a life-threatening condition that needs immediate treatment;7 Footnote 7: FDA considers \u201clife-threatening condition\u201d to include serious diseases or conditions such as sight-threatening and limb-threatening conditions as well as other situations involving risk of irreversible morbidity.\n\nNo generally acceptable alternative treatment for the condition exists; and\n\nBecause of the immediate need to use the device, there is no time to use existing procedures to get FDA approval for the use.\n\nFDA expects the physician to make the determination that the patient's circumstances meet the above criteria, to assess the potential for benefit from the use of the unapproved device, and to have substantial reason to believe that benefits will exist. In the event that a device is used in circumstances meeting the criteria listed above, the physician should follow as many of the patient protection procedures listed below as possible:\n\nInformed consent from the patient or a legal representative;\n\nClearance from the institution as specified by their policies;Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nConcurrence of the IRB chairperson;\n\nAn assessment from a physician who is not participating in the study; and\n\nAuthorization from the IDE sponsor, if an IDE exists for the device.\n\nWhile prior approval for shipment or emergency use of the investigational device is not required, the use must be reported to FDA by the IDE sponsor within 5 working days from the time the sponsor learns of the use. 21 CFR 812.35(a)(2) and 812.150(a)(4). The report should contain a summary of the conditions constituting the emergency, patient outcome information, and the patient protection measures that were followed. If no IDE exists, the physician should follow the above procedures and report the emergency use to CDRH or CBER.\n\nFor additional information on the procedures physicians and IRBs should follow in an emergency use situation, please see Chapter III Expanded Access to Unapproved Devices of the guidance entitled, \"IDE Policies and Procedures.\"8\n\nFootnote 8: This guidance may be found at: www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/idepolcy.html\n\nWhat if the situation is not an emergency? Can a patient with a serious illness or condition have access to an investigational device outside a study?\n\nYes, FDA recognizes that there are circumstances in which an investigational device is the only option available for a patient faced with a serious or life-threatening condition (hereinafter referred to as \"compassionate use\"). Unlike emergency use of an unapproved device discussed above, prior FDA approval is needed before compassionate use occurs. Section 561(b) of the act and 21 CFR 812.35. In order to obtain agency approval, the sponsor should submit an IDE supplement requesting approval for a protocol deviation under section 812.35(a) in order to treat the patient. The IDE supplement should include:\n\nA description of the patient's condition and the circumstances necessitating treatment;\n\nA discussion of why alternatives therapies are unsatisfactory and why the probable risk of using the investigational device is no greater than the probable risk from the disease or condition;\n\nAn identification of any deviations in the approved clinical protocol that may be needed in order to treat the patient; and\n\nThe patient protection measures listed above that will be followed.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe patient identified in the supplement should not be treated with the device until FDA approves its use under the proposed circumstances. In reviewing this type of request, FDA will consider the above information as well as whether the preliminary evidence of safety and effectiveness justifies such use and whether such use would interfere with the conduct of a clinical trial to support marketing approval.\n\nIf the request is approved, the attending physician should devise an appropriate schedule for monitoring the patient, taking into consideration the investigational nature of the device and the specific needs of the patient. The patient should be monitored to detect any possible problems arising from the use of the device. Following the compassionate use of the device, a follow-up report should be submitted to FDA in which summary information regarding patient outcome is presented. If any problems occurred as a result of device use, they should be discussed in the supplement and reported to the reviewing IRB as soon as possible.\n\nAdditional information on the procedures physicians and IRBs should follow in compassionate use situations may be found in Chapter III Expanded Access to Unapproved Devices of the guidance entitled, \"IDE Policies and Procedures.\"9\n\nFootnote 9: This guidance may be found at: www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/idepolcy.html\n\n18 What is the definition of a custom device?\n\nTo be considered a custom device, the device must meet all of the following criteria, which are described in section 520(b) of the act and at 21 CFR 812.3(b):\n\n(1) It necessarily deviates from devices generally available or from an applicable performance standard or premarket approval requirement in order to comply with the order of an individual physician or dentist;\n\n(2) The device is not generally available to, or generally used by, other physicians or dentists;\n\n(3) It is not generally available in finished form for purchase or for dispensing upon prescription;\n\n(4) It is not offered for commercial distribution through labeling or advertising; and\n\n(5) It is intended for use by an individual patient named in the order form of a physician or dentist, and is to be made in a specific form for that patient, or is intended to meet the special needs of the physician or dentist in the course of professional practice (such as a particular operating tool).\n\n19 Does an IRB need to review custom use?\n\nFDA regulations do not require review and approval for custom device use. However, FDA recommends that as many of the patient protection measures listed in paragraph 16 be followed as possible. IRBs should be familiar with the regulatory requirements for custom devicesbecause physicians or institutions may seek information from the IRB about the use of a custom device in patients at their healthcare facility. IRBs may develop procedures for the use of custom devices to ensure that patient protection measures are thoughtfully carried out.\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Devices Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.7065678834915161", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: In accordance with section 520(g) and the regulations, clinical studies of medical devices must comply with FDA's human subject protection requirements (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research) (21 CFR Part 50), Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements (21 CFR Part 56), Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) requirements (21 CFR Part 812), Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators requirements (21 CFR Part 54) regulations, as well as any other applicable regulations, including pertinent regulations at 21 CFR Part 809 (In Vitro Diagnostic Devices For Human Use).\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThere are three types of studies described in the regulations at 21 CFR Part 812: significant risk (SR) device studies, non-significant risk (NSR) device studies, and exempt studies. A brief description of these types of studies follows. Please refer to the FDA Information Sheet Guidance \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies\" for more detailed information about SR and NSR device studies, the importance of the IRB's review, the regulatory requirements for these studies, and examples of devices in each category.\n\nA. Significant t Risk Device Studies\n\nA significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. (21 CFR 812.3(m))\n\nSponsors of investigational SR device studies are required to get an approved IDE from FDA before starting their study. 21 CFR 812.20 (FDA gives each IDE a number - for example #GXX0000, where XX denotes the year of the submission). Sponsors and clinical investigators of these studies must comply with the regulations at 21 CFR Part 812, \"Investigational Device Exemptions.\"\n\nIf FDA disapproves an IDE, FDA's letter will describe the reasons for the disapproval. If the sponsor submits an IDE amendment satisfactorily addressing the issues in FDA's letter, the agency sends an IDE approval letter to the sponsor. In accordance with the regulations at Part 812, the study may not start until both FDA and the IRB have given their approval.\n\nNote: A conditional approval letter from FDA allows the study to begin if the study is approved by the IRB, but requires the sponsor to provide additional clarifying information in order to obtain full approval for the study.\n\nIRBs do not have to make the SR or NSR determination if FDA has already made the risk determination. Most often, clinical investigators submit SR device investigations for IRB review after the study has already received IDE approval from FDA. IRBs may ensure that SR device investigations have an FDA-approved IDE by asking the clinical investigator to request from the sponsor a copy of FDA's IDE approval letter.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAn IRB may be asked to review an SR device study before the sponsor receives FDA approval of an IDE submission. Under this circumstance, IRBs should be aware that because it is possible that FDA may not approve the IDE or may request significant changes to the research protocol, the IRB may need to re-evaluate the study after FDA reviews the application. If an IRB approves the significant risk device study before FDA approves the IDE, there may be more of a risk that clinical investigators will mistakenly enroll subjects before the study should be started (i.e, before FDA approves the IDE.)\n\nNon-Significant Risk Device Studies\n\nAn NSR device is an investigational device that does not meet the definition of a significant risk device. If an IRB finds that an investigational medical device study poses a NSR, the sponsor does not need to submit an IDE to FDA before starting the study. If the IRB determines that the proposed study is an NSR study, the IRB may proceed to review the study under 21 CFR 56.109 and 21 CFR 56.111. FDA considers an NSR device study to have an approved IDE after IRB approval and when sponsors meet the abbreviated requirements at 21 CFR 812.2(b). Consequently, in most cases, FDA is not aware of non-significant risk device studies.\n\nAs stated above, if FDA has already made the risk determination, the IRB does not need to duplicate this effort. If, however, FDA has not made the risk determination or the IRB disagrees with the NSR determination made by a sponsor, then the IRB must notify the investigator and, where appropriate, the sponsor, that the study involves a significant risk device (21 CFR 812.66). If a sponsor or an IRB needs help in making the SR/NSR determination, it may ask for a written determination from FDA.3\n\nFootnote 3: See the guidance memorandum entitled, \u201cProcedures for Handling Inquiries Regarding the Need for an Investigational Device Exemptions Application for Research Involving Medical Devices\u201d at www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/blue-ide-d01-1.html\n\nThe IRB should consider the following in determining whether a device study poses a SR or NSR:\n\nthe sponsor's description of why the study is not SR\n\nwhether the proposed NSR research study meets the definition of \"significant risk\" (see above)\n\nthe proposed use of the device as well as any protocol related procedures and tests, not just the device (test article) alone.

Exempt Studies\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 812.2(b), sponsors and investigators of certain studies are exempt from the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812, with the exception of SS812.119 (disqualification of a clinical investigator). Examples of exempt studies are consumer preference testing, testing of a device modification, or testing of two or more devices in commercial distribution if the testing does not collect safety or effectiveness data, or put subjects at risk.4\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 CFR 812.2(c)(4).\n\nStudies of an already cleared medical device in which the device is used or investigated in accordance with the indications in the cleared labeling are exempt from Part 812.5 Note: Studies of a cleared device for a new use must comply with the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations. Similarly, studies of a PMA approved device are exempt from the IDE requirements if the device is being studied for the indications in the approved labeling.\n\nFootnote 5: See 21 CFR 812.2(c)(1) and (2).\n\nIn addition, diagnostic device studies (e.g., in vitro diagnostic studies) are exempt from the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812 under certain circumstances. The study is exempt as long as the sponsor complies with the requirements at 21 CFR 809.10(c) for labeling, and if the testing: (i) is noninvasive; (ii) does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents significant risk; (iii) does not by design or intention introduce energy into a subject; and (iv) is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure. 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3).\n\n3.2 Are IDE exempt studies subject to the requirements for informed consent and IRB review and approval under Parts 50 and 56?\n\nIf an exempt study is being conducted to collect data to support either a clinical investigation or a marketing application, then the study must comply with 21 CFR Part 50 and should comply with 21 CFR Part 56. 21 CFR 50.1(a), 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 56.101(a), 21 CFR 56.103.\n\n3.3.3 Does FDA require IRB review and approval of off-label use of a legally marketed device?\n\nNo, when a physician uses a legally marketed device outside its labeling to treat a patient and no research is being done, IRB review is not required. Note: Although not required by FDA, an IRB may still decide on its own initiative to review such use. Yes, when the off-label use of a legally marketed device is part of a research study collecting safety and effectiveness data involving human subjects, IRB review and approval is required (21 CFR 812.2(a)).\n\nFor additional information on the off-label use of devices, see the FDA Information Sheet guidance, \" 'Off-label' and Investigational Use of Marketed Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices.\"6\n\nFootnote 6: This guidance can be found at: www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/offlabel.html\n\nMust an IRB review a study conducted after submission of a (510(k)) to FDA but prior to FDA's decision on that submission?\n\nYes. During FDA's review of the premarket notification submission, the device remains an investigational product. Therefore, the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations apply. The device may not be distributed, except for investigational use, unless FDA clears the device for marketing.\n\n16 Can a physician use an unapproved device in an emergency?\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Devices Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.20669306814670563", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA needs to hear about all important effects of the investigational product, so that the agency can (1) ensure that the results of the investigation are not biased, and (2) make a determination as to the product's safety and effectiveness.\n\nCan information about a subject's death be collected even if the subject has discontinued participation in the study?\n\nYes. Although a subject may have discontinued participation in a study, data about a subject's death is contained in public vital statistics records. Access to public records is not subject to restriction under 21 CFR 50.24 or other FDA regulations.\n\n114. Do FDA's regulations require that informed consent be obtained from a deceased subject's family members before public records can be accessed?\n\nNo. Access to public records is not subject to restriction under 21 CFR 50.24 or other FDA regulations. The information included in death records may be accessed and collected without triggering FDA's informed consent requirements.\n\nUnder FDA's regulations, \"human subject\" means \"an individual who is or becomes a participant in research, either as a recipient of the test article or as a control. A subject may be either a healthy human or a patient.\" (See 21 CFR 50.3(g); similar language is found at 21 CFR 312.3 and 812.3(p).) FDA has interpreted its regulations as applicable only to research involving living human subjects. Since the individuals referenced are deceased, such review does not meet FDA's definition of research involving human subjects. FDA has also concluded that a limited look at public death records would, in any event, be encompassed by the exception from informed consent for emergency research.52\n\nFootnote 52: See Preamble to the October 2, 1996 Final Rule, Comment #94, 61 Fed. Reg. 51519.\n\nPublic access to autopsy records would be determined by applicable State or local laws and regulations.\n\n115. For emergency research under 21 CFR 50.24, involving an exception from informed consent, may an IRB or Privacy Board waive the authorization requirement that would otherwise apply under 45 CFR 164.508 of the HIPAA Privacy Rule?\n\nYes. Under the Privacy Rule issued to implement the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), an individual must generally sign a permission, known as an Authorization, before a covered entity may use or disclose the individual's protected health information (PHI) for research purposes, unless the covered entity receives documentation that an IRB or Privacy Board has waived or altered the Authorization requirement. 45 CFR 164.512(i). In the context of emergency research involving an exception from informed consent under 21 CFR 50.24, there may well be considerations present, such as the inability of the subjects to provide Authorization as a result of their medical condition, that could support an IRB or Privacy Board decision to waive the HIPAA Privacy Rule's Authorization requirement.\n\nThe Privacy Rule at 45 CFR 164.512(i) contains criteria for waiver or alteration of the Authorization requirement by an IRB or Privacy Board. In particular, the documentation of waiver approval obtained by the covered entity must, among other things, include a statement that the IRB or Privacy Board has determined that the alteration or waiver, in whole or in part, of Authorization satisfies the following criteria:\n\nThe PHI use or disclosure involves no more than minimal risk to the privacy of individuals based on at least the presence of (1) an adequate plan to protect PHI identifiers from improper use and disclosure; (2) an adequate plan to destroy those identifiers at the earliest opportunity, consistent with the research, absent a health or research justification for retaining the identifiers or if retention is otherwise required by law; and (3) adequate written assurances that the PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity except (a) as required by law, (b) for authorized oversight of the research study, or (c) for other research for which the use or disclosure of the PHI is permitted by the Privacy Rule.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe research could not practicably be conducted without the requested waiver or alteration.\n\nThe research could not practicably be conducted without access to and use of the PHI.\n\nThus, to the extent an IRB or Privacy Board has determined that the circumstances of the emergency research subject to an exception from informed consent under 21 CFR 50.24 satisfy the HIPAA Privacy Rule's waiver criteria, and has documented the waiver approval in accordance with 45 CFR 164.512(i)(2), a covered entity may use or disclose PHI for the research based on such documentation.\n\nXI Data Monitoring Committee (Dmc)\n\nBefore a study may be initiated, the IRB must find and document that an independent DMC has been established to exercise oversight of the clinical investigation (21 CFR 50.24(a)(7)(iv)).\n\nFDA interprets this regulatory provision to permit a sponsor to either establish an independent DMC or to secure the services of an already established DMC to exercise oversight of the clinical investigation. FDA is making this clarification to provide flexibility to sponsors in meeting the regulatory requirements.\n\nFor more information on the roles, responsibilities and operating procedures of Data Monitoring Committees, please see FDA's Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors, Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees, March 2006.53 The DMC guidance represents FDA's current thinking on DMCs and their operations.\n\nFootnote 53: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126578.pdf\n\nXII For Further Information\n\nA Contacts\n\nSponsors, clinical investigators, and IRBs with questions regarding policy or applications pertaining to an exception from informed consent requirements for emergency research under 21 CFR 50.24 may contact the appropriate office(s) identified on FDA's website:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/default.htm.\n\nB FDA's Websites\n\nGood Clinical Practice:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/default.htm\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER):\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/default.htm\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER):\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/default.htm\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH):\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/default.htm\n\n21 CFR 50.24\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nThe text of 21 CFR 50.24 appears below:\n\nSubpart B-Informed Consent of Human Subjects Sec. 50.24, Exception from informed consent requirements for emergency research.\n\n(a) The IRB responsible for the review, approval, and continuing review of the clinical investigation described in this section may approve that investigation without requiring that informed consent of all research subjects be obtained if the IRB (with the concurrence of a licensed physician who is a member of or consultant to the IRB and who is not otherwise participating in the clinical investigation) finds and documents each of the following:\n\n(1) The human subjects are in a life-threatening situation, available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory, and the collection of valid scientific evidence, which may include evidence obtained through randomized placebo-controlled investigations, is necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of particular interventions.\n\n(2) Obtaining informed consent is not feasible because:\n\n(i) The subjects will not be able to give their informed consent as a result of their medical condition;\n\n(ii) The intervention under investigation must be administered before consent from the subjects' legally authorized representatives is feasible; and\n\n(iii) There is no reasonable way to identify prospectively the individuals likely to become eligible for participation in the clinical investigation.\n\n(3) Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct benefit to the subjects because:\n\n(i) Subjects are facing a life-threatening situation that necessitates intervention;\n\n(ii) Appropriate animal and other preclinical studies have been conducted, and the information derived from those studies and related evidence support the potential for the intervention to provide a direct benefit to the individual subjects; and\n\n(iii) Risks associated with the investigation are reasonable in relation to what is known about the medical condition of the potential class of subjects, the risks and benefits of standard therapy, if any, and what is known about the risks and benefits of the proposed intervention or activity.\n\n(4) The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out without the waiver.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n(5) The proposed investigational plan defines the length of the potential therapeutic window based on scientific evidence, and the investigator has committed to attempting to contact a legally authorized representative for each subject within that window of time and, if feasible, to asking the legally authorized representative contacted for consent within that window rather than proceeding without consent. The investigator will summarize efforts made to contact legally authorized representatives and make this information available to the IRB at the time of continuing review.\n\n(6) The IRB has reviewed and approved informed consent procedures and an informed consent document consistent with 50.25. These procedures and the informed consent document are to be used with subjects or their legally authorized representatives in situations where use of such procedures and documents is feasible. The IRB has reviewed and approved procedures and information to be used when providing an opportunity for a family member to object to a subject's participation in the clinical investigation consistent with paragraph (a)(7)(v) of this section.\n--------------------\nContext title: Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.962913155555725"], "After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: The definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n\nThe determination of the amount of added sugars contributed by a powdered fruit or vegetable juice that is added as an ingredient to a product and that is not reconstituted to single strength juice during processing (e.g., that is added to a pureed fruit or to a yogurt) would be the same as the determination of the sugars contributed by a liquid or frozen fruit or vegetable juice concentrate. In our response to question 11, we have suggested that when calculating the added sugars declaration for a product containing concentrated fruit or vegetable juice, the total moisture content of the finished product can be considered to go towards reconstitution of the fruit juice concentrate in the formulation. Thus, the total moisture content of a finished product formulated with powdered fruit or vegetable juice concentrates can be considered to contribute towards the dilution of the powdered fruit or vegetable juice. Further, the sugars contributed by the powdered fruit or vegetable juice that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type must be declared as added sugars on the label, as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule.\n8. Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates? We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12). We require that, when a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)). If you use Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 to calculate the amount of added sugars in a product containing juice concentrate, you must document this information in the records regarding the amount of added sugars added to the food during processing (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). If you use the amount of sugars present in a single strength juice and/or a juice concentrate, that is determined through chemical analysis or other available information, when calculating the amount of added sugars in a product containing fruit juice concentrate, you must document the source of the information and/or the amount of sugars determined through chemical analysis in the records that you make and keep (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). If a diluted juice concentrate slightly exceeds the amount of sugar that would be found in the same volume of the same type of 100 percent fruit juice, manufacturers should document the average and consistency with cGMPs in the records that they make and keep.\n9. Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis? The amount of added sugars declared on the label must be in grams (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The added sugars definition includes sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. For juice, the serving size is based on volume (e.g., 8 oz. or 240 ml) while the amount of added sugars per serving is based on weight. Therefore, when calculating the weight of added sugars per serving, you may need to consider the densities of both the finished juice product and the single strength juice of the same type. You may choose to arrive at the gram amount of added sugars in different ways. Please see our responses to questions 11 and 12 for examples of how to calculate the amount of added sugars in products containing concentrated fruit juices on both a volume and weight basis.\n10. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit or vegetable juice (juice made from a single type of fruit or vegetable) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength juice where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)? In the hypothetical example below, we provide three general steps to calculate the amount of added sugars (in grams) for an apple juice product (240 ml serving size) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength apple juice. The product in this hypothetical example is reconstituted to have juice soluble solids above the minimum Brixrequirement in 21 CFR 101.30 where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9). Therefore, all sugars in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice must be declared as added sugars. The apple juice example here uses the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration. This example is provided solely to demonstrate one method of calculating the added sugars content of the product. You can use alternate methods.\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.2071855068206787", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines includes a recommendation for healthy eating patterns that limit added sugars (including honey, syrups, and other caloric sweeteners) to less than 10 percent of calories per day (Ref. 3).\n\nNutrition Facts Label Final Rule\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016, we issued a final rule updating the Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods to reflect new scientific information (see 81 FR 33742). The Nutrition Facts label final rule includes changes in the individual nutrients that must be declared and also changes some of the DVs. The science underlying the Nutrition Facts label final rule, referenced above, is also reflected in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires that added sugars be included in the Nutrition Facts label and established a DV for added sugars. The Nutrition Facts label final rule defines \"added sugars,\" in part, to include sugars that are either added during the processing of foods or are packaged as such (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The term includes free sugars (free mono- and disaccharides), sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The Nutrition Facts label final rule requires added sugars to be declared on the food label by stating \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" indented directly below \"Total Sugars\" (see 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(ii)).\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires a declaration for added sugars, in part, because excess consumption of added sugars makes it difficult to meet nutrient needs within the calorie limits generally needed to maintain a healthy weight and can lead to an increase in overall caloric intake. Further, healthy dietary patterns characterized, in part, by lower amounts of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, as compared to less healthy dietary patterns, are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary_Guidelines demonstrates that meeting nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits is difficult with more than 10 percent of total daily calories from added sugars (50 grams of added sugars based on a 2,000 calorie diet). Based on this science, the Nutrition Facts label final rule establishes a DV for added sugars, 50 grams based on a 2,000 calorie diet for adults and children 4 years of age and older and 25 grams based on a 1,000 calorie diet for children 1 through 3 years of age (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(vii)).\n\nPure (100%) honey, pure (100%) maple syrup, other single-ingredient sugars and syrups, and certain cranberry products sweetened with added sugars contribute to the DV of added sugars, regardless of whether they are added by consumers to foods (e.g., maple syrup poured over pancakes; sugar added to dried cranberries to increase palatability) or consumed in isolation (e.g., a spoonful of honey). FDA's definition encompasses the types of added sugars that were evaluated in the science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommendation that no more than 10 percent of calories be from added sugars. These sugars were considered \"empty calories\" or \"calories for other uses\" in the USDA Food Patterns.\n\nDraft Guidance\n\nIn the Federal Register of March 2, 2018 (83 FR 8953), we made available a draft guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, and Certain Cranberry Products; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availability\" (hereafter referred to as \"the draft guidance\") and asked interested parties to submit comments by May 1, 2018. In the Federal Register of April 25, 2018 (83 FR 17961), we extended the comment period to June 15, 2018. We have considered comments to the draft guidance, and we have made modifications, where appropriate, that are now reflected in this final guidance.\n\nFarm Bill\n\nAfter we published the Nutrition Facts label final rule and the Serving Size final rule, and draft guidance, the President signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (\"the Farm Bill\"). Section 12516 of the Farm Bill states that the food labeling requirements under section 403(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)) shall not require that the Nutrition Facts label of any single-ingredient sugar, honey, agave, or syrup, including maple syrup, that is packaged and offered for sale as a single-ingredient food bear the declaration \"Includes Xg Added Sugars.\" Therefore, single-ingredient sugars, honey, agave, and syrups, including maple syrup, do not need to have this statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving of their product on their label. At the same time, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nAlthough the gram amount of added sugars in a serving of pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups does not need to be declared on the label, these single-ingredient sugars and syrups are required under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV that they contribute to added sugars in the diet. The percent DV on pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups provides important information to consumers about how the addition of sugar from these products contributes to their total daily diet. In the absence of the declaration of the amount of added sugars in a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product, a statement that includes information about the amount of sugars in a serving, as well as how that amount contributes to the consumer's diet and the percent DV for added sugars, provides information that can assist consumers in constructing a diet that is consistent with recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nTherefore, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the use of a \"(\\dagger)\" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV and, per the Farm Bill, the term \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" would not need to appear on the line on the Nutrition Facts label disclosing the added sugars percent DV. The \"(\\dagger)\" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading within a footnote in the Nutrition Facts label box that includes a description of the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent DV for added sugars in the diet. The footnote containing this factual statement should be placed beneath the required footnote that states, \"The % Daily Value (DV) tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice\" (see illustration below).5 Our intent to exercise enforcement discretion is limited to any pure, single-ingredient honey and maple syrup, and other pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups.\n\nFootnote 5: Note that the illustration provides an example of a truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet. FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for the use of any truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet.\n\nWe also intend to exercise our enforcement discretion for certain cranberry products described here (dried cranberries without added flavorings and cranberry beverages made up of cranberry juice that is sweetened with added sugars that provide an amount of total sugars in a serving that does not exceed the level of total sugars in a serving of a comparable product with no added sugars) to allow for the use of a \"(\\dagger)\" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV. The \"(\\dagger)\" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nManufacturers could explain, through the use of such statements, that the sugars added to dried cranberries or the cranberry beverage product are meant to increase the palatability of the naturally tart fruit and that the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. We have provided illustrations of such statements that we consider to be truthful and not misleading below.\n\nAt this time, we are not aware of products, other than the dried cranberry and cranberry beverage products previously discussed, for which the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. Therefore, at this time we only intend to exercise enforcement discretion for cranberry products previously discussed with respect to the use of the \"(\\uparrow)\" that would direct consumers to truthful and not misleading statements on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label, and do not intend to exercise enforcement discretion on other products (e.g., a granola bar or trail mix containing dried sugar-sweetened cranberries). We note that we would consider whether the same type of enforcement discretion discussed with respect to the cranberry products previously described might be warranted for other products where the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, such as naturally tart fruits, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.7397443056106567", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: 3. Do I need to take into consideration sugars from ingredients that are used in formulating my product when determining the added sugars declaration for a serving of my product?\n\nIngredients containing free mono- and disaccharides that meet our definition of added sugars need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (e.g. sugars from cane sugar and concentrated fruit juice added to sweeten an apple sauce). Manufacturers may need to work with ingredient suppliers to determine the amount of added sugars provided by ingredients used in formulating food products.\n\n4. Do the sugars in dried fruits meet the definition of added sugars?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we responded to comments on dried fruits (see response to comment 212, 81 FR 33742 at 33837). We said that dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them should not be considered to contain added sugars because they are essentially a dehydrated whole fruit and still retain the nutrients and other components of a whole fruit (e.g. diced dried apples). However, if additional sugar is added to a dried fruit, the sugar added to the dried fruit must be declared on the label as added sugars (81 FR 33742 at 33837).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5. Are the sugars used in the production of vinegar added sugars?\n\nIn the production of vinegar, naturally occurring sugars are first fermented into alcohol and then a secondary fermentation occurs in which alcohol is converted to vinegar. For most vinegar products, no sugars remain in the final product. Vinegars that do not contain any sugars in the finished food would not need an added sugars declaration. However, we are aware of some vinegars (e.g., balsamic vinegar) that are made using ingredients that are often used as sweeteners in foods, and that are similar to concentrated fruit juices (e.g., grape must). According to the definition of added sugars, sugars found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type are added sugars. Therefore, fruit juices that are concentrated before or during processing of some vinegars contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars. To the extent that sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are present in the finished product, the added sugars must be declared on the label and in labeling, as required in our Nutrition Facts label final rule. We understand that the manufacturing of vinegar involves several steps, and manufacturers need to consider the impact of these steps (e.g. potential concentration due to water loss when aged in wooden barrels) on the final added sugars declaration.\n\n6. The definition of added sugars excludes the \"fruit component of fruit spreads.\" What constitutes the \"fruit component\" of a non-standardized fruit spread?\n\nPlease see our response to question 1 above. The fruit component of a non-standardized fruit spread would include whole fruits, pieces of fruit, dried fruit, fruit or vegetable pures (single strength or concentrated), fruit pulps, single strength juices, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders that are not made from fruit or vegetable juices.\n\n7. Do sugars found in fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the form of the fruit or vegetable (e.g., concentrated fruit and vegetable pures, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders) need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833), we explained that we excluded from the definition of \"added sugars\" whole fruit, fruit pieces, dried fruit, pulps, and pures because they are nutrient rich and maintain the basic properties of a fruit when added to foods and are not considered to contain added sugars (see response to comment 208, 81 FR 33742 at33835). We also explained that sugars from 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, and sugars from certain fruit and vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under certain regulations, fruit juice concentrates used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, and preserves under our standards of identity, and 100 percent juice concentrate sold directly to consumers (e.g. frozen orange juice concentrate) are excluded from the definition of \"added sugars.\"\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833 through 33834), we explained that, while foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices can be a part of a healthful diet, the sugars added to the foods by the concentrated fruit or vegetable juice provide additional calories. Over the course of the day, small amounts of calories in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages can add up and make it difficult to balance the amount of calories expended (81 FR 33742 at 33834). For these reasons, we consider foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices to be sugar-sweetened foods (id).\n\nWe also explained that in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report (Ref. 1) (81 FR 33742 at 33835).\n\nWe are applying these same guiding principles when determining when the sugars in an ingredient are added sugars. Concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes, and some fruit and vegetable powders are essentially whole fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the physical form of the fruit or vegetable and to remove moisture. They maintain the basic properties of a whole fruit or vegetable, even if the peel and seeds may be removed. Their composition and use is more consistent with that of whole fruits or vegetables, dried fruits or vegetables, pulps and pureses than that of concentrated fruit juices, which are commonly used by industry in place of sugars. Therefore, the sugars in concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes and some fruit and vegetable powders contribute to the diet the same way that sugars found in whole fruits or vegetables do, and do not have to be declared as added sugars on the label. However, we consider sugars in powders made from fruit and vegetable juices to be the same as those found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices because such powders are essentially concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that have all moisture removed. Therefore, some or all sugars contributed by a powder made from fruit or vegetable juices must be declared as added sugars on the label as required by the Nutrition Facts label final rule, depending on the degree of reconstitution in the finished food.\n\nThe definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.5527578592300415", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: A food that already contains some endogenous sugar and additional added sugars, either directly or as a component in an ingredient, such as sweetened fruit added to yogurt, would be misbranded if the actual \"Total Sugars\" amount is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label, or the records requirements for \"Added Sugars\" are not met (see SS 101.9(g)(11)).\n\nDo sugars present in a sweet fermented beverage after fermentation need to be declared as total or added sugars on the label?\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains only sugars that meet our definition of added sugars (e.g. table sugar), then the amount of sugars present in a serving of the product after fermentation must be declared as both total and added sugars (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains both sugars that do and do not meet our definition of added sugars, you may determine the amount of total sugars in the finished food analytically. You have the following options related to the added sugars declaration:\n\nDetermine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in the finished product and make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information you relied upon that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation; or\n\nDeclare the amount of added sugars added prior to fermentation and make and keep records to verify the amount (21 CFR 101.9(g)). The amount of added sugars declared should not exceed the amount of total sugars on the label; or\n\nIf you have no way to determine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in the finished food, but have reason to believe that a significant reduction of added sugars took place during fermentation, you may submit a petition, under 21 CFR 10.30, to request an alternative means of compliance. The petition should provide scientific data or other information for why the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product is likely to be significantly reduced compared to the amount added prior to fermentation. A significant reduction would be where reduction in added sugars after fermentation may be significant enough to impact the label declaration for added sugars by an amount that exceeds the reasonable deficiency acceptable within good manufacturing practice under SS 101.9(g)(6). In addition, the scientific data or other information should include the reason why you are unable to determine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in a serving of the finished product and a description of the process that you used to come to that conclusion.\n\nIngredients made primarily from sugar and created through non-enzymatic browning are added to some products for coloring and flavoring purposes (e.g. caramel color). After non-enzymatic browning occurs, the sugar is reduced in the ingredient. In such a case, how much sugar must be declared as added sugars on the label? If the remaining amount of the sugar contributed by an ingredient that undergoes non-enzymatic browning is detectable by testing in the finished product, you may declare that amount of sugar that is detectible by analytical testing in the finished product as the added sugars declaration. When such an ingredient is added to a product that contains other sugars that do not meet the definition of added sugars, you must make and keep records, which should include records of the results of the analytical testing that is used to demonstrate the amount of added sugars contributed by the ingredient in the finished product after non-enzymatic browning occurs, and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(v)(A)).\n\n20. If sugar is added for fermentation during the leavening process of a baked good and some of the sugars are consumed by yeast, should the reduction in the amount of sugars be accounted for the declaration of added sugars?\n\nAs described in our response to question 19, you may declare the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation. If you do so, you must make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information relied upon by the manufacturer that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(v)(A)).\n21. There is a chance that added sugars content prior to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation may be higher than the total sugars content of the finished food determined through chemical analysis. How do I approximate the added sugars value in this case?\n\nThe added sugars declaration should not exceed the total sugars declaration. In a case where sugars added prior to or during processing are reduced through non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation, and the manufacturer chooses to declare the amount of sugars added prior to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation, the added sugars declaration could conceivably exceed the amount of total sugars determined through chemical analysis. In such a case, you should declare the same amount for added sugars as the amount of total sugars obtained through analytical testing for a serving of the food.\n\nV Question and Answer on Format Issues\n\n1. What are the specifications for thickness of lines and leading (i.e., space between lines) on the Nutrition Facts label?\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(ii)(C) and (d)(1)(v) establish certain format requirements with respect to leading and the use of hairline rules.\n\nAdditionally, Appendix B to Part 101 in Title 21 provides examples of graphic enhancements (i.e., illustrations) that FDA uses. For more examples of graphic enhancements that FDA uses, please see our webpage at: https://www.fda.gov/media/99151/download.\n\nQuestion and Answer on the Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals\n\n1. What are the requirements (e.g. for rounding) for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals declared on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels? What does \"levels of significance\" mean in this context?\n\nWe require, under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii), that the quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals, excluding sodium, be the amount of the vitamin or mineral included in a serving of the product using the units of measurement and the levels of significance given in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) (which refers to the Reference Daily Intakes (RDI) table). However, zeros following decimal points may be dropped, and additional levels of significance may be used when the number of decimal places indicated is not sufficient to express lower amounts (e.g., the RDI for zinc is given in whole milligrams, but the quantitative amount may be declared in tenths of a milligram). This is consistent with the requirements for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the Supplement Facts label (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B)).\n\nIn addition, regarding conventional foods, quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals present at less than 2 percent of the RDI are not required to be declared on the Nutrition Facts label. However, they may be declared by a zero or by the use of an asterisk (or other symbol) that refers to another asterisk (or symbol) that is placed at the bottom of the table that is followed by the statement \"Contains less than 2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients)\" or \"Contains (<)2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients).\" Alternatively, if vitamin D, calcium, iron or potassium is present in amounts less than 2 percent of the RDI, label declaration of the nutrient(s) is not required if the statement \"Not a significant source of _(listing the vitamins or minerals omitted)\" is placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii)).\n\nRegarding dietary supplements, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium must be declared when they are present in a dietary supplement in quantitative amounts by weight that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling of foods in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c). (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAs for the phrase \"levels of significance,\" as used in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii) and 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and whether the phrase refers to statistical testing of hypotheses or mathematical concepts related to the degree of accuracy starting with the first nonzero digit, the phrase \"levels of significance\" refers to the degree of accuracy when rounding nutrients for purposes of declaring quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the label.\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c), provide specific rounding requirements for nutrients such as sodium. Before we issued the Nutrition Facts label final rule, sodium and potassium content was to be expressed as zero when the serving contained less than 5 milligrams (mg), to the nearest 5 mg increment when the serving contained less than or equal to 140 mg, and to the nearest 10 mg increment when the serving contained more than 140 mg. The Nutrition\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.8968891501426697", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: Should sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch and other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g., beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label?\n\nYes. Sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch or other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g. beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods need to be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label because the sugars created through controlled hydrolysis add empty calories to the diet (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii); 81 FR 33742 at 33831 through 33832 (comment 201 and response), 33835 (comment 207 and response)).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, because the manufacturer purposely used hydrolysis to increase the product's sugar content (81 FR 33742 at 33832).\n\nWe understand that manufacturers may use hydrolysis of starches and other complex carbohydrates in the production of some plant-based beverages for purposes other than to increase the sugar content and sweetness of the final product. For example, a manufacturer might use hydrolysis to reduce a product's viscosity (thickness). When we issued our proposed rule to amend the Nutrition Facts label requirements, some comments to the proposed rule said that we should exclude certain ingredients from the definition of added sugars because the ingredients are not added to the product for the intended purpose of sweetening. We responded that, in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we consider the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Report (81 FR 33742 at 33835). The sugars created in the production of plant-based beverages, as well as other ingredients and foods that undergo controlled hydrolysis, contribute empty calories to the diet.\n\nAdditionally, we said in our answer to question 14 above that when an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis (e.g. maltodextrin or corn syrup) is added to a food during processing, those mono- and disaccharides contributed by the ingredient need to be declared as Added Sugars on the label.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor the Added Sugars declaration, we consider sugars created through the hydrolysis of starch or other complex carbohydrates inherent to grains, such as oats or rice, to be the same as sugars created through the hydrolysis of starch in the production of ingredients, such as maltodext, because in both cases, sugars are created through controlled hydrolysis. Because the hydrolysis process is controlled, manufacturers can determine the amount of sugars created and present in the final product.\n\n16. Does the sugar created through enzymatic hydrolysis of lactose in low-lactose dairy products need to be declared as added sugars?\n\nWe received several comments to the Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels proposed rule related to lactose in dairy ingredients, which are summarized in Comment 209 of the Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels final rule (the final rule) (81 FR 33742 at 33835). The sugars in dairy ingredients, except lactose as defined in 21 CFR 168.122, are not included in the definition of added sugars. Moreover, lactose that meets our standard of identity is an added sugar.\n\nLactose, as a sugar in a dairy product, is a disaccharide that is captured on the Nutrition Facts label under the Total Sugars declaration. However, lactose that meets the definition in 21 CFR 168.122 is captured on the Nutrition Facts label under both the Added Sugars and Total Sugars declarations. We are aware that the enzyme lactase is used by industry to hydrolyze lactose present in dairy products for the purposes of reducing the lactose content in low-lactose dairy products. The hydrolysis of lactose results in the monosaccharides glucose and galactose. Regardless of whether hydrolysis of lactose, present in dairy products or in dairy ingredients by lactase is being utilized to reduce lactose or to increase the sweetness of the product, hydrolysis of lactose under such circumstances does not result in an increase in sugars that would affect the Total Sugars declaration. Moreover, to the extent lactose that meets our standard of identity in 21 CFR 168.122 is subject to hydrolysis, the Added Sugars declaration would be the same before and after the hydrolysis of such a lactose ingredient using lactase. Since the hydrolysis of lactose found in dairy products (e.g. milk) and dairy ingredients (e.g. stabilizers and texturizers), and the hydrolysis of lactose that meets our standard of identity, do not result in an increase in the Total Sugars declaration, the hydrolysis process also does not result in an increase in the caloric content of the food. Thus, the sugars created through enzymatic hydrolysis of lactose, whether present as a component of a dairy product, a dairy ingredient, or contributed by the addition of lactose that meets the definition in 21 CFR 168.122, do not change the declarations for Total Sugars or Added Sugars for the product.\n\nIf sugars are added to a food that already contains inherent sugars (e.g. yogurt), does that make \"added sugars\" a Class I nutrient for purposes of compliance under 21 CFR 101.9(g)? If so, does that mean that the composite must be formulated to be at least equal to the value for the added nutrient (added sugars) declared on the label per 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(i), or is 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) allowing up to 20% in excess of the value declared applicable?\n\nAdded sugars would be a nutrient in a fortified or fabricated food (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(i)). Added sugars is not a nutrient listed in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(i). The nutrients listed in this regulation include: vitamins, minerals, protein, and dietary fiber.\n\nWhen a food contains sugars that are endogenous and not exogenous sugars, the nutrient content of the composite for \"Total Sugars\" and \"Added Sugars\" would be subject to 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Section 101.9(g)(5) requires that the nutrient content of the composite be no greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label and states that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved.\n\nHowever, because there are no generally recognized analytical methods available to quantify added sugars in a food when the food contains sugars that do and do not meet our definition of added sugars, the parenthetical after \"added sugars\" in SS 101.9(g)(5) states that, \"when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars.\" The parenthetical is intended to clarify that the requirement in SS 101.9(g)(5) for the added sugars declaration would only apply when there is an analytical method available to quantify the added sugars. When a food contains a combination of sugars that do and do not meet our definition of added sugars, we would verify the declaration of added sugars in a food using the records required by SS 101.9(g)(10) and (11).\n\nWith respect to the total sugars declaration, SS 101.9(g)(5) would apply whether the food contains only added sugars, only sugars that do not meet our definition of added sugars, or a combination of these sugars in a food because there would be an analytical method to quantify \"Total Sugars\" under any of these circumstances.\n\nA food that already contains some endogenous sugar and additional added sugars, either directly or as a component in an ingredient, such as sweetened fruit added to yogurt, would be misbranded if the actual \"Total Sugars\" amount is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label, or the records requirements for \"Added Sugars\" are not met (see SS 101.9(g)(11)).\n\nDo sugars present in a sweet fermented beverage after fermentation need to be declared as total or added sugars on the label?\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains only sugars that meet our definition of added sugars (e.g. table sugar), then the amount of sugars present in a serving of the product after fermentation must be declared as both total and added sugars (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains both sugars that do and do not meet our definition of added sugars, you may determine the amount of total sugars in the finished food analytically. You have the following options related to the added sugars declaration:\n\nDetermine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in the finished product and make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information you relied upon that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation; or\n\nDeclare the amount of added sugars added prior to fermentation and make and keep records to verify the amount (21 CFR 101.9(g)). The amount of added sugars declared should not exceed the amount of total sugars on the label; or\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.3754816055297852", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What types of fruit and vegetable products are considered to have added sugars?\n--------------------\nContext: The amount of added sugars declared on the label should never exceed the amount of total sugars on the label.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(i) Do Honey, Maple Syrup, and Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n\nIn the Federal Register of June 20, 2019 (84 FR 28726), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products,\" which provides clarity on the labeling of added sugars for such products (Ref. 1). In that guidance, we discuss section 12516 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (\"the Farm Bill\"), which states that the food labeling requirements cannot require the declaration \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" in a serving of these single-ingredient products. While these products are not required to have this declaration of the gram amount of added sugars, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet, so the percent DV for added sugars must still be included consistent with 21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii). We stated that we intend to exercise enforcement discretion by permitting the use of the \"+\" symbol immediately following the percent DV declaration for added sugars on packages and containers of single-ingredient sugars and syrups. This symbol would lead to a footnote inside the Nutrition Facts label, explaining the amount of added sugars that one serving of the product contributes to the diet, as well as the contribution of a serving of the product toward the percent DV for added sugars. This symbol and footnote are not required; however, we encourage you to use them.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(ii) Do Added Sugars in Dried Cranberry Products and Cranberry Beverage Products Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n\nYou must still declare added sugars in grams and the corresponding percent DV on labels for all dried cranberry products and cranberry beverage products (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). In the Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products guidance, we said that we intend to exercise enforcement discretion for these cranberry products to allow the use of a symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV declaration which would lead to a truthful and not misleading statement outside the Nutrition Facts label explaining that sugars are added to improve the palatability of naturally tart cranberries (see Ref. 1). This symbol can be used for cranberry products that are sweetened with added sugars and that contain total sugars per serving at levels no greater than comparable products with no added sugars (i.e. unsweetened grape juice) (Ref. 1).\n\nV.A.1.(a).(iii) Does Allulose Count as an Added Sugar?\n\nThe final rule does not reach a decision as to whether allulose should be excluded from the labeling of carbohydrate, sugars, and/or added sugars. We stated that, as a monosaccharide, itmust be included in the declaration of each, pending any future rulemaking that would otherwise exclude it from the declaration (81 FR 33742 at 33796; 21 CFR 101.9(c)(i) through (iii)).\n\nIn the Federal Register of April 18, 2019 (84 FR 16272), we announced the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Allulose and Calories from Allulose on Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels.\" This guidance, when finalized, would advise manufacturers of our intent to exercise enforcement discretion for the exclusion of allulose from the amount of \"Total Sugars\" and \"Added Sugars\" declared on the label and the use of a general factor of 0.4 calories per gram for allulose when determining \"Calories\" on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels, pending review of the issues in a rulemaking (Ref. 2).\n\nv.a.1.(b) How Do I Calculate Added Sugars?\n\nIn the Federal Register of November 5, 2018 (83 FR 55266), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels: Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals.\" This guidance provides questions and answers (Q&A) on topics related to compliance with the labeling of added sugars. The Q&A discusses how you should determine the amount of added sugars in a serving of a product, as well as which ingredients need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (Ref. 3).\n\nThis guidance also provides a detailed discussion on the calculation of added sugars for ingredients and products such as concentrated fruit and vegetable purees, fruit and vegetable pastes, fruit and vegetable powders, juice cocktails, or juice blends, which often contain juice concentrates (Q&A IV. 7-12), products for which manufacturers employ a hydrolysis step (Q&A IV. 14-16), and products that undergo non-enzymatic browning or fermentation (Q&A IV. 18-21) (Ref. 3). Please refer to this guidance for questions you may have regarding the calculation and declaration of added sugars for a serving of your product.\n\nv.a.2 Vitamin D\n\nVitamin D is now considered a nutrient of \"public health significance\" for the general population, and its declaration is now mandatory (81 FR 33742 at 33884). Both the gram amount and the percent DV for Vitamin D must be declared at the bottom of the label, directly preceding the calcium declaration (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(ii)). While only the term \"vitamin D\" can be used on the food labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv)), the specific form that is added to a food must be listed in the ingredient list statement (21 CFR 101.4). For Supplement Facts labels, the source ingredient may be identified within the nutrition label in parentheses immediately following or indented beneath the name of a dietary ingredient and preceded by the word \"as\" or \"from\" (21 CFR 101.36(d)). When you do not identify a source ingredient within the nutrition label, you must list it in an ingredient statement (21 CFR 101.4(g)). You should not list it in both places (81 FR 33742 at 33891).\n\nv.a.3 Potassium\n\nPotassium is also now considered a nutrient of \"public health significance\" for the general population (81 FR 33742 at 33884). It has been assigned an RDI, instead of a DRV (21 CFR 101.9(8)(iv)). We now require the declaration of both the gram amount and the percent DV for potassium at the bottom of the label, directly following the iron declaration. Potassium is now covered under the term \"mineral\" that appears in each section of 21 CFR 101.9. Any listing of potassium on the Nutrition Facts label must meet the specific nutrient declaration requirements for minerals under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4), 101.9(g)(4)(i), 101.9(g)(4)(ii), and 101.9(g)(6). These requirements are discussed further in section VII.E \"Has Nutrient Compliance or the Level of Variance Allowed Changed?\" below.\n\nHave There Ben Any Changes to the Definition or Presentation of Nutrients That Were Already Required to Be Declared?\n\nv.b.1 Dietary Fiber\n\nAny dietary fiber declared on the label must meet the new definition of dietary fiber (21 CFR 101.9(c) and (c)(6)(i)), which is discussed in the following section. This definition includes a listing of dietary fiber that FDA has determined should be in the calculation of dietary fiber for declaration on Nutrition Facts labels. The new definition and process to amend the listing of dietary fiber is discussed in this section.\n\nv.b.1.(a) How Is Dietary Fiber Defined?\n\nDietary fiber is now defined as \"non-digestible soluble and insoluble carbohydrates (with 3 or more monomeric units), and lignin that are intrinsic and intact in plants; isolated or synthetic non-digestible carbohydrates (with 3 or more monomeric units) determined by FDA to have physiological effects that are beneficial to human health\" (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)). Soluble fiber and insoluble fiber both must meet this new definition of dietary fiber (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)(A) and (B)).\n\nv.b.1.(a).(i) Which Isolated or Synthetic Non-Digestible Carbohydrate(s) Qualify as Dietary Fiber?\n\nThe following isolated or synthetic non-digestible carbohydrate(s) should be included in the calculation of the amount of dietary fiber, as FDA has determined that they have physiological effects that are beneficial to human health:\n\nBeta-glucan soluble fiber (as described in 21 CFR 101.81(c)(2)(ii)(A));\n\nPsyllium husk (as described in 21 CFR 101.81(c)(2)(ii)(A)(6));\n\nCellulose;\n\nGuar gum;\n\nPectin;\n\nLocust bean gum; and\n\nHydroxypropylmethylcellulose. (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)).\n\nIn the Federal Register of June 15, 2018 (83 FR 27894), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Certain Isolated or Synthetic Non-Digestible Carbohydrates as Dietary Fiber on Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels,\" where we stated that we intend to propose that the following eight non-digestible carbohydrates be added to the definition of dietary fiber, as well:\n\nMixed plant cell wall fibers (a broad category that includes fibers like sugar cane fiber and apple fiber, among many others);\n\nArabinoxylan;\n\nAlginate;\n\nInulin and inulin-type fructans;\n\nHigh amylose starch (resistant starch 2);\n\nGalactooligosaccharide;\n\nPolydextrose; and\n\nResistant maltodextrin/dextrin (see Ref. [4]).\n\nUntil we complete rulemaking to add any additional non-digestible carbohydrates to the regulatory definition of dietary fiber, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion to allow manufacturers to include the eight recognized fibers when calculating the amount of dietary fiber to declare on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels.\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.7028452157974243"], "Delving into E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , What should be done if the thorough QT study results in a negative finding at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , What should be done if the thorough QT study results in a negative finding at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms?\n--------------------\nContext: A single dose of a positive control is generally sufficient, even if it precedes the investigational drug treatment.

A finding of QT prolongation above the regulatory threshold of interest (a positive thorough QT study) might call for further electrocardiographic follow-up in late phase studies. The extent of the follow-up would be affected by the magnitude of the estimated prolongation at doses and concentrations at which this occurs. If prolongation is substantial at concentrations expected to occur in clinical studies, it is important to protect patients in later trials and to obtain further information on the frequency of marked QT prolongation.

If there is reasonable assurance that the higher dose represents drug exposures that are unlikely to be seen in the patient population, only routine ECG monitoring is recommended in late phase trials. This approach provides reassurance for safety because patients are unlikely to experience a clinically significant QTc effect.\n\nThe thorough QT study results in a positive finding, as defined by the E14 criteria,3 at the therapeutic dose, with a mean prolongation (<20) ms. For drugs with this magnitude of effect on the QTc interval, intensive monitoring of phase 3 patients is called for. Footnote 2: A negative study, as defined by the ICH E14 criteria, is an upper one-sided 95% CI of QTc prolongation effect (<10) ms.\n\nIntensive ECG monitoring in clinical trials has two main objectives. One objective is to provide protection to patients who might have large worrisome QT intervals (>500) ms. A second objective is identifying the frequency of marked QT increases (e.g., prolonged QT (>500) ms or increases in QTc (>60) ms).\n\nGiven the limitations of collecting ECGs in late stage trials, the focus of the analysis is on outliers, not on central tendency. Other than descriptive statistics, detailed statistical analysis is not expected. This monitoring is intended to be performed locally, without the involvement of a central core laboratory.\n\nThe timing of ECG collection should be based on the known properties of the drug.

The thorough QT study results in a negative finding, as defined by the E14 criteria,4 at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms. If supratherapeutic exposure is anticipated at the clinical dose only in a well-characterized subgroup, intensive monitoring as described in Example 2 above could becarried out in this subset of the phase 3 population. In this case, there should be reasonable assurance that the higher exposure is unlikely to be seen in the general patient population.

While increases in QT/QTc to >500 ms or of >60 ms over baseline are commonly used as thresholds forpotential discontinuation, the exact criteria chosen for a given trial will depend on the risk-tolerance level considered appropriate for the indication and patient group in question.\n\nThe Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nThe 'thorough QT/QTc study' is intended to determine whether the drug has a threshold pharmacologic effect on cardiac repolarization, as detected by QT/QTc prolongation. The threshold level of regulatory concern, discussed further below, is around 5 ms as evidenced by an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval around the mean effect on QTc of 10 ms. The study is typically carried out in healthy volunteers (as opposed to individuals at increased risk of arrhythmias) and is used to determine whether or not the effect of a drug on the QT/QTc interval in target patient populations should be studied intensively during later stages of drug development. It is not intended to identify drugs as being pro-arrhythmic. Although data are limited, it is not expected that the results of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' would be affected by ethnic factors.\n\nThe 'thorough QT/QTc study' would typically be conducted early in clinical development to provide maximum guidance for later trials, although the precise timing will depend on the specifics of the drug under development. It would usually not be the first study, as it is important to have basic clinical data for its design and conduct, including tolerability and pharmacokinetics. Some drugs might not be suitable for study in healthy volunteers because of issues related to tolerability (e.g., neuroleptic agents, chemotherapeutics).\n\nThe results of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' will influence the amount of information collected in later stages of development:\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.0463277101516724", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , What should be done if the thorough QT study results in a negative finding at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.2.5 Alternative Strategies to Assess QT/QTc Interval Effects\n\nAlternatives to the use of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' are under active investigation. Examples include evaluating the relationship between concentration and QT/QTc effects or more intensively evaluating ECGs, based on data collected during early phase clinical studies.\n\nClinical Trial Evaluation After the 'Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nIf the 'thorough QT/QTc study' is negative (see section 2.2), the collection of baseline and periodic on-therapy ECGs in accordance with the current investigational practices in each therapeutic field is almost always sufficient evaluation during subsequent stages of drug development.\n\nIf the 'thorough QT/QTc study' is positive, additional evaluation in subsequent clinical studies should be performed. One objective of this evaluation should be to fully describe the effect of the drug on the QT/QTc interval in the target patient population with particular attention to dose- and concentration-related effects. It is important to include patients in these analyses exposed to the full range of potential doses and patients with additional risk factors for TdP. These analyses would ordinarily focus on outliers as well as on changes in mean QT/QTc. Depending on the size of the effect seen in the 'thorough QT/QTc study', more intense monitoring of patients with additional risk factors for TdP might be needed.\n\nWhile what constitutes adequate ECG assessment to accomplish this is not fully established, additional ECGs collected appropriately in substantial numbers of patients in late phase clinical trials could provide this information. In this case, it would be important to collect ECGs at the anticipated time of peak drug effects, as determined in the 'thorough QT/QTc study' and pharmacokinetic information about the patient population.\n\nAnother objective of this evaluation should be to collect information on the adverse events that occur in the trials following the positive 'thorough QT/QTc study'. This would include patients who develop marked QT/QTc prolongation (e.g., >500 ms) or experience a serious cardiovascular adverse event that suggests an arrhythmia (e.g., TdP). Such patients should be evaluated closely for risk factors that might have contributed to this event (e.g., genotyping for Long QT Syndromes, see section 4.3).\n\nIf the 'thorough QT/QTc study' is positive, analyses of the ECG and adverse event data from certain patient sub-groups are of particular interest, such as:\n\nPatients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia);\n\nPatients with congestive heart failure;\n\nPatients with impaired drug metabolizing capacity or clearance (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment, drug interactions);\n\nFemale patients;\n\nPatients aged <16 and over 65 years.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.6077156662940979", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , What should be done if the thorough QT study results in a negative finding at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.2.3 Timing of ECGs in the 'Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nThe timing of the collection of ECGs and the study design (e.g., single or multiple dose, duration) of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' should be guided by the available information about the pharmacokinetic profile of the drug. For drugs with short half-lives and no metabolites, a single dose study might be sufficient. Studies should characterize the effect of a drug on the QT/QTc throughout the dosing interval. While the peak serum concentration does not always correspond to the peak effect on QT/QTc interval, care should be taken to perform ECG recordings at time points around the Cmax. As one intent of a positive control is to establish assay sensitivity, in multiple dose studies of new drugs a positive control needs to be used only long enough to have its expected effect.\n\n2.2.4 Interpretation of the 'Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nIt is difficult to determine whether there is an effect on the mean QT/QTc interval that is so small as to be of no consequence. However, drugs that prolong the mean QT/QTc interval by around 5 ms or less do not appear to cause TdP. On that basis, the positive control (whether pharmacological or non-pharmacogical) should be well-characterized and consistently produce an effect on the QT/QTc interval that is around the threshold of regulatory concern (5 ms, section 2.2).\n\nBased on similar considerations, a negative 'thorough QT/QTc study' is one in which the upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval for the largest time-matched mean effect of the drug on the QTc interval excludes 10 ms. This definition is chosen to provide reasonable assurance that the mean effect of the study drug on the QT/QTc interval is not greater than around 5 ms. When the largest time-matched difference exceeds the threshold, the study is termed 'positive'. A positive study influences the evaluations carried out during later stages of drug development, but does not imply that the drug is pro-arrhythmic.\n\nAs with other data, the presence of outliers (see section 3.2.2) should also be explored.\n\n2.2.5 Alternative Strategies to Assess QT/QTc Interval Effects\n\nAlternatives to the use of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' are under active investigation. Examples include evaluating the relationship between concentration and QT/QTc effects or more intensively evaluating ECGs, based on data collected during early phase clinical studies.\n\nClinical Trial Evaluation After the 'Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nIf the 'thorough QT/QTc study' is negative (see section 2.2), the collection of baseline and periodic on-therapy ECGs in accordance with the current investigational practices in each therapeutic field is almost always sufficient evaluation during subsequent stages of drug development.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.3640232980251312", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , What should be done if the thorough QT study results in a negative finding at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapeutic dose shows a mean effect between 10 and 20 ms?\n--------------------\nContext: The integrated nonclinical and clinical QT/QTc risk assessment should include:\n\nThe hERG assay, an in vivo QT assay, and any follow-up nonclinical studies, especially those selected to overcome the challenges encountered in the clinical studies (see ICH S7B Q&As Q17 (1.1) and Q18 (1.2)\n\nAlternative QT clinical study designs incorporating ECG assessments with as many of the usual \"thorough QT/QTc\" design features as possible (see ICH E14 guidance, section II.B (2.2), and E14 Q&A Q12 (5.1))\n\nIn situations where it is not possible to evaluate the QT/QTc effects at high clinical exposure, it is particularly important that the nonclinical in vivo studies are conducted at exposures covering the high clinical exposure (see ICH E14 Q&A Q12 (5.1) for definition of high clinical exposure).\n\n_An integrated QT/QTc risk assessment can also be particularly valuable for drugs with confounding heart rate effects that could impact accurate determination of the QTc. Advanced methodologies for controlling (e.g., pacing) or correcting for heart rate changes in the nonclinical in vivo studies and/or conducting QTc assessments in the intended patient population might be informative in this situation. If tolerance to the chronotropic effect develops with repeat dosing, upward titration regimens can sometimes be employed to avoid or minimize the confounding effects of drug-induced heart rate changes on the QTc assessment.\n\nDecision-Making\n\nA totality of evidence argument based on the results of an integrated nonclinical and clinical QT/QTc assessment could be made at the time of marketing application.\n\nA drug that meets the following criteria would be considered to have a low likelihood of proarrhythmic effects due to delayed repolarization:\n\nThe nonclinical studies, following best practice considerations for in vitro studies (see ICH S7B Q&As, section II (2)) and in vivo studies (see ICH S7B Q&As, section III (3)), show low risk as defined in ICH S7B Q&A Q17 (1.1).\n\nThe high-quality ECG data (see ICH E14 guidance and E14 Q&As, section I (1)) collected in the alternative QT clinical assessment do not suggest QT prolongation, generally defined under this Q&A as an upper bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval around the estimated maximal effect on QTc less than 10 ms, as computed by the concentration-response analysis or the intersection-union test. If applicable, there should be no notable imbalances between treatment/dose arms in the proportion of subjects exceeding outlier thresholds.\n\nA cardiovascular safety database that does not suggest increased rate of adverse events that signal potential for proarrhythmic effects (ICH E14 guidance, section IV (4)).\n\nWhen justified, a totality of evidence argument for a drug to have a low likelihood of proarrhythmic effects due to delayed repolarization could still be made for a drug that has an upper bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval around the estimated maximal effect on QTc of 10 ms or more. The determination will depend on the quality and details of the clinical data (e.g., estimated QTc mean and upper bound values, slope of any concentration-QTc relationship) and nonclinical data (e.g., difference between the hERG safety margin for the investigational drug and the threshold for defining low risk).\n\nIf nonclinical studies do not show low risk (or are not performed), there is reluctance to conclude a lack of an effect in an absence of a positive control; however, if the upper bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval around the estimated maximal effect on QTc is less than 10 ms, the treatment is unlikely to have an actual mean effect as large as 20 ms.\n\nThe ICH E14 guidance does not address the approach to QT measurement during drug development in the case of combination drug products. Is it recommended that measurement of QT prolongation be performed on drug combinations? (6.2)\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn general, combinations of two or more drugs are unlikely to need a thorough QT/QTc study or intensive late-stage monitoring, if the component drugs have been demonstrated to lack relevant effects in thorough QT/QTc studies as described in the ICH E14 guidance.\n\nIf one or more of the component drugs have not been individually characterized for effects on the QT/QTc interval, they may be evaluated in combination or independently.\n\nQ15. Are sponsors expected to conduct thorough QT studies as part of the development of large proteins and monoclonal antibodies? (6.3)*\n\nLarge, targeted proteins and monoclonal antibodies have a low likelihood of direct ion channel interactions and a thorough QT/QTc study is not necessary, unless the potential for proarrhythmic risk is suggested by mechanistic considerations or data from clinical or nonclinical studies.\n\nVi. Electrocardiograms Monitoring in Late-Stage Clinical Trials (7)\n\nQ16. The ICH E14 guidance describes in section II.C (2.3) (Clinical Trial Evaluation After the \"Thorough QT/QTc Study\") that \"adequate ECG assessment to accomplish this [monitoring] is not fully established.\" Is there now a reasonable approach to evaluating QTc in late-stage clinical development in the case of a finding of QT prolongation prior to late phase studies? (7.1)\n\nClarification of approach to evaluating QTc in late-stage clinical development\n\nThe purpose of a thorough QT study is to characterize the effect of the drug on ventricular repolarization (QT interval). It is not the purpose of the thorough QT study to assess the risk of torsade de pointes (TdP) in the target population, but rather to determine whether further data are warranted to assess risk. A finding of QT prolongation above the regulatory threshold of interest (a positive thorough QT study) might call for further electrocardiographic follow-up in late phase studies. The extent of the follow-up would be affected by the magnitude of the estimated prolongation at doses and concentrations at which this occurs. If prolongation is substantial at concentrations expected to occur in clinical studies, it is important to protect patients in later trials and to obtain further information on the frequency of marked QT prolongation. In some cases in which there is a large margin of safety between therapeutic exposures and the exposures that result in significant ECG interval changes, an intensive ECG follow-up strategy might not be warranted.\n\nThe recommended intensity of the monitoring and assessment in late-stage trials will depend on:\n\nThe magnitude of QTc prolongation seen in the thorough QT study or early clinical studies\n\n4.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe circumstances in which substantial QT prolongation might occur (i.e., in ordinary use or only when drug concentrations are markedly increased (e.g., by renal or hepatic impairment, concomitant medications))\n\nPK properties of the drug (e.g., high inter-individual variability in plasma concentrations, metabolites)\n\nCharacteristics of the target patient population that would increase the proarrhythmic risk (e.g., structural heart disease)\n\nThe presence of adverse effects that can increase proarrhythmic risk (e.g., hypokalemia, bradycardia, heart block)\n\nOther characteristics of the drug (e.g., pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology, toxicology, drug class, hysteresis)\n\nThe following examples delineate the scope of recommended ECG investigations based on outcome of the thorough QT study or early clinical studies. These could be modified by other factors such as A through F above.\n\nExamples of ECG monitoring in late stage:\n\nThe thorough QT study results in a negative finding, as defined by the E14 criteria,4 at the therapeutic dose, but the supratherapetic dose (relative to phase 3 dose) shows mean QTc effects between 10 and 20 ms. If there is reasonable assurance that the higher dose represents drug exposures that are unlikely to be seen in the patient population, only routine ECG monitoring is recommended in late phase trials. This approach provides reassurance for safety because patients are unlikely to experience a clinically significant QTc effect. Footnote 4: A negative study, as defined by the ICH E14 guidance criteria, is an upper one-sided 95% CI of QTc prolongation effect (<10) ms.\n\nThe thorough QT study results in a positive finding, as defined by the E14 criteria,5 at the therapeutic dose, with a mean prolongation (<20) ms. For drugs with this magnitude of effect on the QTc interval, intensive monitoring of phase 3 patients is called for. Footnote 5: Ibid.\n\nIntensive ECG monitoring in clinical trials has two main objectives. One objective is to provide protection to patients who might have large, worrisome QT intervals (>500) ms. A second objective is identifying the frequency of marked QT increases (e.g., prolonged QT (>500) ms or increases in QTc (>60) ms).\n\nGiven the limitations of collecting ECGs in late-stage trials, the focus of the analysis is on outliers, not on central tendency. Other than descriptive statistics, detailed statistical analysis is not expected. This monitoring is intended to be performed locally, without the involvement of a central core laboratory.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14 and S7B Clinical and Nonclinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential--Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.5627691149711609"], "Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.1)": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.1)\n--------------------\nContext: In the context of ICH M7(R2), (quantitative) structure-activity relationships ((Q)SARs) are considered an appropriate initial evaluation of mutagenic potential of an impurity at a daily dose of less than or equal to 1 mg. When a structural alert is identified, a follow-up in vitro evaluation (e.g., bacterial reverse mutation assay) could be conducted, or the impurity could be controlled by threshold of toxicological concern (TTC). Negative results in either evaluation would classify the impurity under Class 5. The result of the bacterial reverse mutation assay overrules the (Q)SAR prediction.\n\nAdditionally, impurities should not be assigned to Class 5 based solely on the absence of structural alerts by visual evaluation alone. There is an expectation that structural alert assessment will be conducted using (Q)SAR prediction.\n\nQ3. What are the expectations for evaluation of the genotoxic potential for an impurity where the amount of impurity exceeds 1 mg daily dose? (1.3)\n\nIn the context of Note 1 of ICH M7(R2), 1 mg refers to an absolute amount of an impurity, irrespective of the identification or qualification thresholds outlined in ICH Q3A and Q3B(R2).\n\nIn cases where the amount of impurity is less than 1 mg daily dose for chronic administration, and an impurity generated negative predictions in two appropriate (Q)SAR systems, a minimum screen of genotoxicity studies (point mutation and chromosomal aberration) could be considered.\n\nQ4.: If an impurity generates negative predictions in two appropriate (Q)SAR systems and is present at a level less than or equal to 1 mg daily dose, is further genetic toxicity testing warranted? (1.4)\n\nNo. If an impurity generates negative predictions in two appropriate (Q)SAR systems and is present at a level less than or equal to 1 mg/day, further genetic toxicity testing is not warranted.\n\nII SCOPE OF GUIDANCE (2)\n\nQ5.: Are semisynthetic drug substances and drug products included in the scope of ICH M7(R2)? (2.1)\n\nYes, for certain cases. If a semisynthetic drug substance, as defined in the ICH guidance for industry Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances (November 2012), is manufactured using steps that could introduce mutagenic impurities or degradation products (e.g., postmodification of a fermentation product, late-stage introduction of a linker), a risk assessment is warranted.\n\nThe following compounds used in the manufacturing process of semisynthetic drug substances and drug products should be considered within the scope of the application of ICH M7(R2):\n\nChemically synthesized intermediates and actual impurities therein\n\nReagents\n\nIII GENERAL PRINCIPLES (3)\n\nQ6.: Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.1)\n\nNo. Carcinogens that are negative in the bacterial reverse mutation assay do not have a DNA reactive mechanism of carcinogenicity and, therefore, are not in the scope of ICH M7(R2) (e.g., acetamide, hydroxylamine).\n\nQ7.: Should mutagenic, noncarcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.2)\n\nNo. Mutagens that are demonstrated to be noncarcinogenic in appropriate and well-conducted animal bioassays will be classified as Class 5 impurities.\n\nIV Considerations for Marketed Products (4)\n\nWhat does \"significant increase in clinical dose\" mean in section IV.C., Changes to the Clinical Use of the Marketed Products, (4.3)? (4.1)\n\nAny increase in dose of the active pharmaceutical ingredient that would increase any mutagenic impurity to levels above the acceptable limits is considered significant (see Tables 2 and 3 in ICH M7(R2) and the ICH guidance for industry M7(R2) Addendum: Application of the Principles of the ICH M7 Guidance to Calculation of Compound-Specific Acceptable Intakes (July 2023)).\n\nIn such cases a reevaluation of the mutagenic impurity limits is recommended.\n\nV DRUG SUBSTANCE AND DRUG PRODUT IMPURITY ASSESSMENT (5)\n\nNo Q&A drafted on this section. (5.1)\n\nVI HAZARD ASSESSMENT ELEMENTS (6)\n\nWhat information and/or documentation should be provided to regulatory agencies to sufficiently demonstrate validation of (Q)SAR models that are developed in-house or are not commonly used? (6.1)\n\nSection VI (6) of ICH M7(R2) states that \"(Q)SAR models utilizing these prediction methodologies should follow the general validation principles set forth by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\" (OECD Validation 2007).\n\nIn the context of ICH M7(R2), the OECD principles of (Q)SAR validation are:\n\nA defined endpoint -- The model should be trained using experimental data generated according to the standard OECD protocol for the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay.\n\nAn unambiguous algorithm -- The algorithm used to construct the model should be disclosed. It should be clear whether the model is considered statistical (constructed via machine learning) or expert rule based (created from human expert-derived knowledge).\n\nA defined domain of applicability -- It should be described whether a test chemical falls within the model's applicability domain and how the applicability domain is calculated. The user should be warned when the model does not have enough information to make a reliable prediction on a chemical.\n\nAppropriate measures of goodness-of-fit, robustness, and predictivity -- The model should be evaluated and shown to be sufficiently predictive of bacterial reverse mutagenicity. Standard validation techniques that should be used are recall, crossvalidation, and external validation. Evidence that the model has not been over-fit should also be provided.\n\nA mechanistic interpretation -- Is there adequate information to allow an assessment of mechanistic relevance to be made (e.g., specific descriptors)?\n\nFor any system as a minimum recommendation to demonstrate how each model follows these principles and to understand how a (Q)SAR model was developed and validated, the sponsor is expected to provide the OECD (Q)SAR Model Reporting Format (QMRF) (OECD QMRF 2017) on request by the regulatory agency. This template summarizes and reports key information on (Q)SAR models, including the results of any validation studies as well as provides supplementary information on applicability of the model to a given chemical. Agencies may request this information depending on the experience of the specific agency with the specific models.\n\nQ11. When an out-of-domain or noncoverage result is obtained from one of the two (Q)SAR models as described in ICH M7(R2), can the impurity be classified as a Class 5 impurity? (6.2)\n\nNo, an out-of-domain or noncoverage result from one of the two (Q)SAR models warrants additional assessment to classify the compound as a Class 5 impurity.\n\nGiven that the relationship between chemical structure and DNA reactivity is well understood, it is unlikely that a structure with mutagenic potential would be associated with an out-of-domain result. However, expert review can provide reassurance in assignment of such impurities to Class 5.\n\nExpert review may include one or a combination of the following (Amberg et. al. 2019):\n\nComparison to structurally similar analogs for which bacterial reverse mutation assay data are available (read-across approach).\n\nExpert review of the chemical structure to determine if there is potential for the chemical to react with DNA.\n\n(Q)SAR output from an additional validated model (see Question Q10 (6.1)) of the same methodology (i.e., expert rule based or statistical) that generates a prediction that is within its applicability domain.\n\nIn a case where an impurity is demonstrated to be negative in an Ames test but positive in a clastogenicity study (e.g., chromosomal aberration test), how would the impurity be classified per ICH M7(R2) classification system? (6.3)\n\nIf an impurity tests negative in an Ames assay, it is considered a Class 5 impurity. Addressing positive results in a clastogenicity assay is out of the scope of ICH M7(R2).\n\nPlease clarify the rationale for the tests included under Note 3 as a follow-up to investigate the in vivo relevance of in vitro mutagens. (6.4)\n\nIf an impurity is positive in the Ames test, and levels of the impurity cannot be controlled to an appropriate acceptable limit, an in vivo follow-up test with mutagenic endpoint (mutagenicity) should be used. The other follow-up tests outlined in Note 3 are also acceptable when scientific rationale (as indicated in Note 3) is provided to support their uses.\n\nFor any of the above tests, adequate exposure should be demonstrated in line with the ICH guidance for industry S2(R1) Genotoxicity Testing and Data Interpretation for Pharmaceuticals Intended for Human Use (June 2012).\n\nVII Risk Characterization (7)\n\nIf an Ames positive impurity is subsequently tested in an appropriate in vivo assay and the results are negative, is that sufficient to demonstrate lack of in vivo relevance? (7.1)\n\nYes. A well-conducted and scientifically justified in vivo study (see Question Q13 (6.4) in this document) is sufficient to demonstrate lack of in vivo relevance. If the results of the in vivo study are negative, the impurity can be assigned to ICH M7(R2) Class 5.\n\nIf an Ames positive impurity cannot be controlled to an acceptable limit and is subsequently tested in an appropriate in vivo assay and the results are positive, does that support setting compound-specific impurity limits? (7.2)\n\nWhen a mutagenic impurity cannot be controlled to the TTC (or less than lifetime (LTL) based limit), results from an appropriate in vivo assay could complement the available data for a weight of evidence approach to support a higher limit on a case-by-case basis. However, in vivo gene mutation assays alone are currently not validated to directly assess cancer risk because the endpoint is mutation and not carcinogenicity (i.e., they are used for hazard identification).\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.6767759323120117", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)?

However, ICH M7 does not provide specific guidance on how mutagenic impurity assessment can be used to justify selection of appropriate starting materials. This Q&A addresses the application of the principles in ICH M7 to the selection and justification of starting materials, based on the ICH Q11 concept of impact to the impurity profile of the drug substance.\n\nThis Q&A is not intended for the types of drug substances and indications for which ICH M7 does not apply (e.g., genotoxic drug substances, advanced cancer indications per ICH S9).\n\n[5.10] Do all steps that involve mutagenic reagents, impurities, or establish people- or stereochemical configurations, need to be included in the process description in Section 3.2.S.2.2.

While starting material manufacturing processes typically contain purification operations, addition of purification steps prior to a proposed starting material in order to avoid defining an earlier, upstream compound as the starting material would not be considered appropriate.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11_Q&As_Q&As\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.6391323804855347", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)?

(3.1)\n--------------------\nContext: For mutagenic impurities introduced or generated in the last synthetic step, given the proximity to the final product, Option 1 control approach is preferred. However, Option 2 and Option 3 control approaches may be possible when appropriately justified. The control strategy may be influenced by the presence of a subsequent recrystallization step, a highly effective purification operation (e.g., chromatography, well-defined crystallization), the reactivity (e.g., highly reactive reagents such as thionyl chloride) and physical characteristics of the impurity (e.g., low boiling point such as methyl chloride), and the availability of data (analytical data supporting the purge assessment). In most cases, for mutagenic impurities introduced or generated in the last synthetic step, the justification of an Option 4 control approach solely based on prediction is not sufficient and supporting analytical data should be provided (see Question Q19 (8.1)).\n\nIs periodic verification testing (i.e., skip testing) allowed for Option 2 and Option 3 control approaches? (8.4)\n\nNo. Periodic verification testing is not appropriate for Option 2 and Option 3 control approaches. In ICH M7(R2) section VIII.A (8.1), periodic verification testing is only discussed as a control strategy when using Option 1 control approach.\n\nThe Option 1 periodic verification testing strategy references the ICH guidance for industry Q6A Specifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Chemical Substances (ICH Q6A) (December 2000). The Option 1 periodic verification testing concept (per ICH Q6A) should generally be implemented after approval and applies to testing in the final drug substance.\n\nIf batch analysis data on the drug substance for a mutagenic impurity is consistently less than 30 percent TTC or AI in multiple batches, is that sufficient to justify no specification of that impurity in the control strategy? (8.5)\n\nNo. Batch data alone demonstrating that a mutagenic impurity is consistently less than 30 percent TTC or AI is not sufficient to apply an Option 4 control strategy.\n\nHowever, if there is negligible risk of the impurity to be present in the drug substance, an Option 4 control strategy may be considered with appropriate justification. See Questions Q19 and Q20 (8.1 and 8.2) for recommendations on supporting an Option 4 control strategy.\n\nWhat scale considerations are relevant when generating analytical data in support of control Options 3 and 4? (8.6)\n\nLab scale experiments are typically sufficient when generating measured purge factors or when defining in-process control points. These studies should employ conditions representative of the final process as described in the application and should consider the potential impact of scale and equipment-related differences between the laboratory and production environment (e.g., the effects of mixing on impurity levels in heterogeneous systems, the quality of liquid-liquid phase separations). In the case of observed scale dependencies, confirmatory testing on batches manufactured at pilot or commercial scale may be advisable. There is no expectation to perform spiking studies at pilot or commercial scale.\n\nIX Documentation (9)\n\nIf (Q)SAR predictions are made during drug development, should they be repeated for the marketing application? (9.1)*\n\n(Q)SAR models developed for use under ICH M7(R2) are generally updated regularly with new bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay data and more refined structural alerts. A Sponsor is not expected to update its (Q)SAR assessment during drug development unless there is a safety concern such as when newly available bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay data and/or mechanistic knowledge suggest that the prediction is incorrect. As an example, in cases where there is reason to question the outcome of a negative prediction (e.g., an aromatic amine is present, but the model gave a negative prediction), a reassessment is recommended. It is recommended that the sponsor rerun (Q)SAR predictions before the initial marketing application to ensure predictions reflect the most current data available. If the marketing application is later submitted in other regulatory jurisdictions, reassessment may be considered. Reassessment may also be considered if the predictions made for the initial global marketing application did not use a recent version of the software.\n\nIn general, predictions generated with models developed before ICH M7's publication in 2014 are considered unacceptable.\n\nFor marketing applications, what content and common technical document (CTD) placement recommendations could improve the clarity of an ICH M7(R2) risk assessment and control strategy? (9.2)*\n\nIn Module 2, a brief summary of the ICH M7(R2) risk assessment and control strategy should be included (sections 2.3 and 2.6).\n\nIn Module 3, the ICH M7(R2) risk assessment and control strategy should be provided in detail. This type of information is recommended to be placed in the CTD locations per the ICH guidances for industry M4Q: The CTD -- Quality (August 2001) and related M4: The CTD -- Quality: Questions and Answers/Location Issues (June 2004)(e.g., 3.2.S.3.2 Impurities or 3.2.S.4.5 Justification of Specification for drug substance; 3.2.P.5.5 Characterization of Impurities or 3.2.P.5.6 Justification of Specification for drug product). A table summary of the ICH M7(R2) hazard assessment and ICH M7(R2) impurity control strategy is recommended to improve clarity.\n\nInformation recommended for an ICH M7(R2) hazard assessment table includes impurity chemical structure, individual (Q)SAR results (positive/negative predictions, out of domain), bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay results (positive/negative, if available),ICH M7(R2) impurity class (1 to 5) assignment, and supporting information (e.g., information/links for bacterial reverse mutagenicity assays, literature reports, (Q)SAR expert analysis). The in silico systems used (name, version, endpoint) can also be noted.\n\nInformation recommended for an ICH M7(R2) impurity control strategy table includes impurity origin (e.g., synthetic step introduced, degradant), ICH M7(R2) class, purge factors (e.g., measured or predicted), ICH M7(R2) control option (1 to 4), control strategy (i.e., including in-process or compound testing rationale), and supporting information (e.g., information/links for justifications, calculations). The maximum daily dose, TTC, and proposed duration of treatment can also be noted.\n\nAdditionally, it is recommended that compound code names be cross-referenced, if Module 3 and Module 4 (including toxicity study reports) use different compound naming conventions.\n\nIn Module 4, full safety study-related information on impurities (e.g., bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay reports, (Q)SAR reports, other genotoxicity test reports, additional testing) should be included to support the risk assessment and control strategy. This information is often placed in section 4.2.3.7.6 Impurities (see the ICH guidance for industry M4S: The CTD -- Safety(August 2001) for additional information) and can be cross-referenced to Module 3 by hyperlinks.\n\nX Illustrative Examples (10)\n\nNo Q&A drafted on this section.\n\nXI Glossary (11)\n\nNo Q&A drafted on this section.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]\n\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidance Documents\n\nOECD Validation, 2007, Test No. 69: Guidance Document on the Validation of (Quantitative) Structure-Activity Relationship ((Q)SAR) Models (available at\n\nhttp://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf?cote=env/jm/mono(2007)2&doclang usage=en)\n\nOECD (Q)SAR Model Reporting Format (QMRF), 2017, Joint Research Center QSAR Model Database: User Support and Tutorial (available at\n\nhttps://publications.irc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC107491/kina28713enn.pdf)\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.4061175286769867", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.1)\n--------------------\nContext: Mutagenic substances that are impurities in commercially available chemicals or synthetic intermediates, or that are formed as the result of side reactions during the synthesis, could also be present in the drug substance at levels relevant to safety. However, such mutagenic impurities and by-products are usually present at much lower concentrations than reagents, solvents, and intermediates. Therefore, the risk that such impurities will carry over significantly into the drug substance from early reaction steps is lower than for reagents, solvents, or intermediates from the same steps. The applicant should use risk-based reasoning to determine which steps to include in the hazard assessment for this category of potential impurity, and include a discussion of the risk assessment when identifying the point in the synthesis where these impurities and by-products are included in the assessment.\n\nInformation collected during the evaluation of potential mutagenic impurities can be submitted in an application and could be valuable for multiple purposes. For example, the justification for a proposed starting material should include information demonstrating that none of the steps immediately upstream (i.e., earlier in the synthesis) of the proposed starting material impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. Also, the suitability of the proposed control strategy can be supported with information about any mutagenic impurities formed or purged in the manufacturing steps between the proposed starting material and the drug substance, or that are controlled in the specification of the proposed starting material. The ICH Q11 exception for impurities that \"persist\" is also applicable to mutagenic impurities (see Q&A 5.8). In addition, steps involving mutagenic reagents or impurities may be upstream of the starting material if they do not impact the impurity profile of the drug substance (see Q&A 5.10).\n\nThe approaches outlined in this Q&A are consistent with the principles in ICH M7 concerning hazard assessment, risk characterisation of mutagenic impurities, and their control. However, ICH M7 does not provide specific guidance on how mutagenic impurity assessment can be used to justify selection of appropriate starting materials. This Q&A addresses the application of the principles in ICH M7 to the selection and justification of starting materials, based on the ICH Q11 concept of impact to the impurity profile of the drug substance.\n\nThis Q&A is not intended for the types of drug substances and indications for which ICH M7 does not apply (e.g., genotoxic drug substances, advanced cancer indications per ICH S9).\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11_Q&As_Q&As\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.2097318172454834", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance for Industry | M7(R2) Assessment and Control of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential Carcinogenic Risk, Should nonmutagenic, carcinogenic impurities be controlled according to ICH M7(R2)? (3.1)\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 4: TD({}_{50}) is defined as the chronic dose-rate in milligrams per kilograms of body weight per day, which would cause tumors in half of the animals at the end of a standard life span for the species taking into account the frequency of that tumor type in control animals.\n\nICH M7(R2) states in section VII.B.2 (7.2.2):\n\nThe existence of mechanisms leading to a dose response that is nonlinear or has a practical threshold is increasingly recognized, not only for compounds that interact with non-DNA targets but also for DNA-reactive compounds, whose effects may be modulated by, for example, rapid detoxification before coming into contact with DNA, or by effective repair of induced damage. The regulatory approach to such compounds can be based on the identification of a no-observed effect level (NOEL) and use of uncertainty factors (ICH guidance for industry Q3C(R8) Impurities: Guidance for Residual Solvents [ICH Q3C(R8)] (December 2021)) to calculate a permissible daily exposure (PDE) when data are available.\n\nExamples are included in this addendum to illustrate assessments of mode of action for some Class 1 chemicals that justify derivation of a PDE calculated using uncertainty factors as described in ICH Q3C(R8) (Ref. 1). These chemicals include hydrogen peroxide, which induces oxidative stress, and aniline, which induces tumors secondary to hemosiderosis as a consequence of methemoglobinemia.\n\nIt is emphasized that the AI or PDE values presented in this addendum address carcinogenic risk. Other considerations, such as quality standards, may affect final product specifications. For example, the ICH M7(R2) guidance (section VII.B.2 (7.2.2)) notes that when calculating AIs from compound-specific risk assessments, an upper limit would be 0.5 percent, or, for example, 500 micrograms in a drug with a maximum daily dose of 100 milligrams (mg).\n\nMethods\n\nThe general approach used in this addendum for deriving AIs included a literature review, selection of cancer potency estimate (TD({}_{50})), taken from the CPDB (Carcinogenic Potency Database (Ref. 2), or calculated from published studies using the same method as in the CPDB) and ultimately calculation of an appropriate AI or PDE in cases with sufficient evidence for a threshold mode of action (see section III (3) of this addendum). The literature review focused on data relating to exposure of the general population (i.e., food, water, air), mutagenicity/genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. Based on the description of DNA-reactive mutagens in ICH M7(R2), results from the standard bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) were used as the main criterion for determining that a chemical was mutagenic. Other genotoxicity data, especially in vivo, were considered in assessing a likely mode of action for tumor induction. Any national or international regulatory values for acceptable exposure levels (e.g., U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, European Chemicals Agency, World HealthOrganization (WHO)) are described in the compound-specific assessments. Toxicity information from acute, repeat-dose, reproductive, neurological, and developmental studies was not reviewed in depth except to evaluate observed changes that act as a carcinogenic precursor event (e.g., irritation/inflammation, methemoglobinia).\n\nI Standard Method (1)5\n\nFootnote 5: The numbers in parentheses reflect the organizational breakdown of the document endorsed by the ICH Assembly at Step 4 of the ICH process, April 2023.\n\nLinear Mode of Action and Calculation of AI (1.1)\n\nNote 4 of ICH M7(R2) states:\n\nIt is possible to calculate a compound-specific acceptable intake based on rodent carcinogenicity potency data such as TD({}{50}) values (doses giving a 50 percent tumor incidence equivalent to a cancer risk probability level of 1:2). Linear extrapolation to a probability of 1 in 100,000 (i.e., the accepted lifetime risk level used) is achieved by simply dividing the TD({}{50}) by 50,000. This procedure is similar to that employed for derivation of the TTC.\n\nThus, linear extrapolation from a TD({}{50}) value was considered appropriate to derive an AI for those Class 1 impurities (known mutagenic carcinogens) with no established _threshold mechanism, that is, understanding of a mode of action that results in a nonlinear dose-response curve. In many cases, the carcinogenicity data were available from the CPDB; the conclusions were based either on the opinion of the original authors of the report on the carcinogenicity study (author opinion in CPDB) or on the conclusions of statistical analyses provided in the CPDB. When a precalculated TD({}{50}) value was identified in the CPDB for a selected chemical, this value was used to calculate the AI; the relevant carcinogenicity data were not reanalyzed and the TD({}{50}) value was not recalculated.\n\nIf robust data were available in the literature but not in the CPDB, then a TD({}{50}) was calculated based on methods described in the CPDB (Ref. 3). The assumptions for animal body weight, respiratory volume, and water consumption for calculation of doses were adopted from ICH Q3C(R8) and the ICH guidance for industry _Q3D(R2) Elemental Impurities (ICH Q3D(R2)) (September 2022) (Ref. 1, 4).\n\nSelection of Studies (1.2)\n\nThe quality of studies in the CPDB is variable, although the CPDB does impose criteria for inclusion such as the proportion of the lifetime during which test animals were exposed. For the purposes of this addendum, additional criteria were applied when studies were of lesser quality. Studies of lesser quality are defined here as those where one or more of the following scenarios were encountered:\n\nLess than 50 animals per dose per sex\n\nLess than three dose levels\n\nLack of concurrent controls\n\nIntermittent dosing (less than 5 days per week)\n\nDosing for less than lifetime Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe more robust studies were generally used to derive limits. However, studies that did not fulfill all of the above criteria were in some cases considered adequate for derivation of an AI when other aspects of the study were robust, for example when treatment was for 3 days per week (e.g., benzyl chloride) but there was evidence that higher doses would not have been tolerated (i.e., a maximum tolerated dose as defined by the National Toxicology Program or the ICH guidance for industry SIC(R2) Dose Selection for Carcinogenicity Studies of Pharmaceuticals (September 2008) (Ref. [5]) was attained). Calculations of potency take intermittent or less-than-lifetime dosing such as that for benzyl chloride into account; for example, in the CPDB the dose levels shown have been adjusted to reflect the estimated daily dose levels, such that the daily dose given three times per week is multiplied by 3/7 to give an average daily dose; a comparable adjustment is made if animals are treated for less than 24 months. Use of less robust data can sometimes be considered acceptable when no more complete data exist, given the highly conservative nature of the risk assessment in which TD({}_{50}) was linearly extrapolated to a 1 in 100,000 excess cancer risk. In these cases, the rationale supporting the basis for the recommended approach is provided in the compound-specific assessments.\n\nSelection of Tumor and Site (1.3)\n\nThe lowest TD({}{50}) of a particular organ site for an animal species and sex was selected from the most robust studies. When more than one study exists, the CPDB provides a calculated harmonic mean TD({}{50}), but in this addendum the lowest TD({}{50}) was considered a more conservative estimate. Data compiled as _all tumor-bearing animals were not considered in selecting an appropriate TD({}_{50}) from the CPDB; mixed tumor types (e.g., adenomas and carcinomas) in one tissue (e.g., liver) were used where appropriate because this often gives a more sensitive potency estimate.\n\nRoute of Administration (1.4)\n\nSection VII.E (7.5) of ICH M7(R2) states:\n\nThe above risk approaches described in section VII (7) are applicable to all routes of administration, and no corrections to acceptable intakes are generally warranted. Exceptions to consider may include situations where data justify route-specific concerns that should be evaluated case by case.\n\nIn this addendum, when robust data were available from carcinogenicity studies for more than one route, and the tumor sites did not appear to be route specific, the TD({}{50}) from the route with the lowest TD({}{50}) value was selected for the AI calculation and is thus usually considered suitable for all routes. Exceptions may be necessary case by case; for example, in the case of a potent site-of-contact carcinogen a route-specific AI or PDE might be necessary. Other toxicities such as irritation might also limit the AI for a certain route, but only tumorigen is considered in this addendum similar to ICH M7(R2). Here, if tumors were considered site specific (e.g., inhalation exposure resulting in respiratory tract tumors with no tumors at distal sites) and the TD({}_{50}) was lower than for other routes, then a separate AI was developed for that route (e.g., dimethyl carbamoyl chloride, hydrazine).\n\nCalculation of AI From the TD({}_{50}) (1.5)\n\nCalculating the AI from the TD({}_{50}) is as follows (see Note 4 of ICH M7(R2) for example):\n\n[\\text{AI}=\\text{TD${}_{50}$/50,000 x 50 kilograms (kg)}]\n\nThe weight adjustment assumes an arbitrary adult human body weight for either sex of 50 kg. This relatively low weight provides an additional safety factor against the standard weights of 60 kg or 70 kg that are often used in this type of calculation. It is recognized that some adult patients weigh less than 50 kg; these patients are considered to be accommodated by the inherent conservatism (i.e., linear extrapolation of the most sensitive organ site) used to determine an AI.\n\nII Consideration of alternative methods for calculation of AI (2)\n--------------------\nContext title: M7(R2) ADDENDUM- APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE ICH M7 GUIDELINE TO CALCULATION OF COMPOUND-SPECIFIC ACCEPTABLE INTAKES Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.0854411125183105"], "When considering the information from ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , Are scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , Are scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n--------------------\nContext: In cases where an intermediate bulk material is identical between the various strengths (dose proportional blends, bulk solutions, etc.), is it sufficient to perform stability on one lot of each strength, when each strength is produced from a separate intermediate bulk?\n\nNo. For ANDAs that contain multiple strengths (that are dose proportional), three separate intermediate bulk granulations (or blends) should be manufactured. One batch of bulk granulation (or blend) should be used to manufacture all the strengths proposed. The other two bulk granulations (or blends) can be used to manufacture only the lowest and the highest strengths, in addition to the strength used in BE studies (i.e., the strength(s) tested in the BE studies should have three batches). Stability testing should still use all three batches of drug product.\n\nAre differences in the capsule shell (i.e., imprint, color, size, etc.), allowed in cases where a multi-strength capsule product is dose-proportional across all strengths (based on common bead blend)?\n\nYes differences in the capsule shell are allowed in the described case.\n\nWhat are the criteria for an exception to the recommendations regarding minimum size for pilot scale for ANDA submission batches? What justification would be needed if we wanted to deviate from these guidance recommendations?\n\nThe submission ANDA batches can have a smaller size than the established pilot scale, according to the ICH definition, when any one of the following circumstances prevails:\n\nThe reference listed drug product has an orphan drug designation.\n\nUse of a controlled drug substance is based on a Drug Enforcement Administration allocation.\n\nThe test batch size is the same as the commercial batch size with the commitment that a prior approval supplement (PAS) will be provided when there is a scale-up.\n\nAre scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n\nNo. The three ANDA submission batches should maintain the chosen formula based on product development studies for components and composition.\n\nCan FDA provide specific examples of cases where statistical analysis is required and the type of statistical analysis needed?\n\nThe FDA stability guidance recommends analysis of data in accordance with ICH Q1E, Appendix A. The flowchart in that guidance provides clear situations where analysis is normally recommended or unnecessary. In addition, ICH Q1E B.7 figures provide example diagrams for assay and degradation products that illustrate how plots should be generated for the three batches using regression lines and upper and lower confidence limits.\n\nHow many batches of drug product should be tested for split-portions of scored tablets?\n\nIn general, one batch testing for each scored strength on the split tablets will suffice, as recommended in the guidance for industry, _Tablet Scoring: Nomenclature, Labeling, and Data for Evaluation.19 Footnote 19: See footnote 2.\n\nFor drug products that include placebo tablets, how many batches (of placebo tablets) are required for submission? Is 6 months of stability data on the placebo tablets needed if the ANDA is submitted after the June 2014 deadline?\n\nOne batch of placebo tablets with full CMC information should be included at the time of ANDA submission; however, the final packaging presentation (containing the placebo tablets) should have data from accelerated and long-term stability testing. Six months of accelerated and long-term stability data are recommended for the entire packaging presentation including placebo tablets, where applicable, at the time of submission.\n\nAppendix D Amendments to Pending ANDA Application\n\nWhat are the recommendations for amendments and responses filed to pending ANDAs after issuance of the final FDA stability guidance?__Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA1: All amendments submitted to pending ANDAs after the effective date of the final FDA stability guidance will be held to the standards in place concerning stability data at the time of the original ANDA submission, unless there is a concern with the submitted stability data.\n\nStability Studies\n\nWhat will be the expected testing time points on accelerated conditions?\n\nA1: The applicant should test at 0 (initial release), 3, and 6 months; for additional time points on accelerated conditions, please follow ICH Q1A(R2) recommendations for all ANDAs.20\n\nFootnote 20: This recommendation also applies to nasal spray, inhalation solution, suspension, aerosols, and liposomal drug products.\n\nCan the Agency clarify expectations for the storage positions for products placed into the stability program?\n\nA2: For primary batches of liquids, solutions, semi-solids, and suspensions, the product should be placed into an inverted (or horizontal) position and an upright (or vertical) position. For routine stability studies, the applicant should pick the worst case orientation for the study.\n\nWhen and how are reconstitution/dilution studies performed?\n\nA3: Recommendations listed in ICH Q1A(R2), section II, B, 7, Storage Conditions (2.2.7) should be followed for all three batches. These studies should be performed when the drug product is labeled for reconstitution or dilution.\n\nWhat types of containers are classified as semipermeable containers, and can the Agency clarify the stability expectations for the drug products in semipermeable containers?\n\nA4: Examples of semipermeable containers are provided in the ICH Q1A(R2) glossary. The recommendations for stability expectations for semipermeable containers are detailed in ICH Q1A(R2) section II, B, 7, c. Drug products packaged in semipermeable containers (2.2.7.3).\n\nCan the Agency clarify expectations around the number of batches to support tests such as preservative effectiveness and extractable leachable testing?\n\nA5: One of the primary batches of the drug product should be tested for antimicrobial preservative effectiveness (in addition to preservative content) at the end of the proposed shelf life. The drug product specification should include a test for preservative content, and this attribute should be tested in all stability studies. Extraction/leachable studies are generally one-time studies; however, if multiple types of containers/closures are employed for packaging, then additional studies could be recommended. Q6: When are in-use stability studies needed? A6: Please refer to response A3 under section E, Stability Studies. Q7: Are there changes to postapproval protocols and commitments when ICH stability guidances are implemented because of scale or type of batches submitted? A7: ICH Q1A(R2), section II, B, 8, Stability Commitment (2.2.8) addresses this question. Section 2.1.8 provides information regarding stability commitment for drug substances. Also, ANDAs and DMFs should include a commitment to place one batch of drug product and drug substance, respectively, into the annual long-term stability program, and to provide stability data in the annual reports.\n--------------------\nContext title: ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products, Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.9434428215026855", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , Are scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n--------------------\nContext: Chapter 6 Outdance for Industry SUPAC-MR: Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms\n\n1 Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Dissolution Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation\n\nChapter 5 Outance for Industry SUPAC-MR: Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms\n\nScale-Up and Postapproval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Dissolution Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Training and Communications\n\nDivision of Communications Management\n\nThe Drug Information Branch, HFD-210\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\n(Tel) 301-827-4573\n\n(Internet) http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nSeptember 1997\n\nCMC 8\n\nTable of Contents\n\nI.

This guidance represents the Agency\u2019s current thinking on modified release solid oral dosage forms scale-up and postapproval changes. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirement of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.\n\nSUPAC-MR: Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms\n\nScale-Up and Postapproval Changes:\n\nChemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls;\n\nIn Vitro Dissolution Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to pharmaceutical sponsors of new drug applications (NDAs), abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), and abbreviated antibiotic drug applications (AADAs) who intend to change (1) the components or composition, (2) the site of manufacture, (3) the scale-up/scale-down of manufacture, and/or (4) the manufacturing (process and equipment) of a modified release solid oral dosage form during the postapproval period.\n\nThe guidance defines (1) levels of change, (2) recommended chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) tests for each level of change, (3) recommended in vitro dissolution tests and/or in vivo bioequivalence tests for each level of change; and (4) documentation that should support the change. This guidance specifies application information that should be provided to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) to ensure continuing product quality and performance characteristics of a modified release solid oral dose formulation for specified postapproval changes.\n\nThis guidance does not comment on or otherwise affect compliance/inspection documentation that has been defined by CDER's Office of Compliance or FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs. This guidance does not affect any postapproval changes other than the ones specified. For those changes filed in a Changes Being Effected (CBE) supplement (21 CFR 314.70(c)), the FDA may, after a review of the supplemental information, decide that the changes are not approvable. For changes not addressed in this guidance, or for multiple changes submitted at one time or over a short period of time, sponsors should contact the appropriate CDER review division or consult other CDER guidances to obtain information about tests and application documentation.\n\nFDA regulations at 21 CFR 314.70(a) provide that applicants may make changes to an approved application in accordance with a guidance, notice, or regulation published in the Federal Register that provides for a less burdensome notification of the change (for example, by notification at the time a supplement is submitted or in the next annual report). This guidance permits less burdensome notice of certain postapproval changes within the meaning of SS 314.70(a).\n\nFor postapproval changes for modified release solid oral dosage forms that affect components and composition, scale-up/scale-down, site change, and manufacturing process or equipment changes, this guidance supersedes the recommendations in section 4.G of the Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) Policy and Procedure Guide 22-90 (September 11, 1990). For all other dosage forms and changes, this guidance does not affect the recommendations in Guide 22-90.\n\nII General stability considerations\n\nThe effect SUPAC-type changes have on the stability of the drug product should be evaluated. For general guidance on conducting stability studies, applicants are referred to the FDA Guideline for Submitting Documentation for the Stability of Human Drugs and Biologics (02/87). For SUPAC submissions, the following points also should be considered:\n\nIn most cases (except those involving scale up), stability data from pilot scale batches will be acceptable to support the proposed change.\n\nWhere stability data show a trend toward potency loss or degradant increase under accelerated conditions, it is recommended that historical accelerated stability data from a representative prechange batch be submitted for comparison. It is also recommended that under these circumstances, all available long-term data on test batches from ongoing studies be provided in the supplement. Submission of historical accelerated and available long-term data would facilitate review and approval of the supplement.\n\nA commitment should be included to conduct long-term stability studies through the expiration dating period, according to the approved protocol, on the first or first three (see text for details) production batches and to report the results in the annual reports.\n\nIII Components and composition -- nonrelease controlling excipient\n\nThis section of the guidance focuses on changes in nonrelease controlling excipients in the drug product. For modified release solid oral dosage forms, consideration should be given as to whether the excipient is critical or not critical to drug release. The sponsor should provide appropriate justifications for claiming any excipient(s) as a nonrelease controlling excipient in the formulation of the modified release solid oral dosage form. The functionality of each excipient should be identified. Changes in the amount of the drug substance are not addressed by this guidance. Changes in components or composition that have the effect of adding a new excipient or deleting an excipient are defined at level 3 (defined below), except as described below in Section III.A.1.a. Waiver of bioequivalence testing for a change in composition which involves only a different color, flavor or preservative may be permissible as described in 21 CFR 320.22(d)(4).\n\nA.: Level 1 Change\n\nDefinition of Level\n\nLevel 1 changes are those that are unlikely to have any detectable impact on formulation quality and performance.\n\nExamples:\n\nDeletion or partial deletion of an ingredient intended to affect the color or flavor of the drug product; or change in the ingredient of the printing ink to another approved ingredient.\n\nChanges in nonrelease controlling excipients, expressed as percentage (w/w) of total formulation, less than or equal to the following percent ranges:\n\nFiller (\\pm)5\n\nDisintegrant (\\pm)3\n\nStarch Other (\\pm)1\n\nBinder (\\pm)0.5\n\nLubricant Ca or Mg Stearate (\\pm)0.25\n\nOther (\\pm)1\n\nGlidant\n\nTalc (\\pm)1\n\nOther (\\pm)0.1\n\nFilm Coat (\\pm)1\n\nThese percentages are based on the assumption that the drug substance in the product is formulated to 100% of label/potency. The total additive effect of all nonrelease controlling excipient changes should not be more than 5%.2 The total weight of the dosage form should still be within the original approved application range.\n\nFootnote 2: Example: In a product consisting of active ingredient A, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, and magnesium stearate, the lactose and microcrystalline cellulose should not vary by more than an absolute total of 5% (e.g., lactose increases by 2.5% and microcrystalline cellulose decreases by 2.5%) relative to the target dosage form weight if it is to stay within the level 1 range.\n\nThe components (active and excipients) in the formulation should have numerical targets that represent the nominal composition of the drug product on which any future changes in the composition of the product are to be based. Allowable changes in the composition should be based on the original approved target composition and not on previous level 1 changes in the composition. For products approved with only a range for excipients, the target value may be assumed to be the midpoint of the original approved application range.\n\nTest Documentation\n\na. Chemistry documentation\n\nApplication/compendial product release requirements.\n\nStability: First production batch on long-term stability data reported in annual report.\n\nb. Dissolution documentation\n\nNone beyond application/compendial requirements.\n\nc.

It is unlikely that the parameters will have been previously validated. Therefore, it would appear that any such change will be a level 2 change. Please comment. A: If a scale-down of the production batch to 2 or 1/10 the size is needed, operating parameters that would fall within the range established for manufacture of the test batch and the first three production batches (i.e., validation batches) will be regarded as a level 1 change. If they fall outside the validation ranges the change would be permitted under SUPAC IR as a level 2 change. Regardless, SUPAC IR does not address scale-down below 100,000 units. 2. Q: Is a change in mill screen size (to improve flow during formulation) a level 1 change?A: A screen size change to an alternate screen of the same design (holes) and operating principle (sifting) but different diameters to facilitate flow of powder will be regarded as a level 1 change, provided the alternate screen has not altered the particle size distribution of the screened material. Under such conditions, the information can be filed in the annual report.3. Q: Must the equipment be moved from the old site to the new one when the manufacturing site is changed? A: A company need not move equipment for a SUPAC-IR site change. However, any equipment should be of the same design and operating principle as the old equipment, and the SOPs and formulation should be the same.\n\n3.1. In vitro dissolution\n\nQ: Can the equation for profile dissolution be used for comparing a generic product with the reference listed drug product?A: Yes. The equation can be used in this situation. However, under SUPAC-IR, dissolution testing is generally conducted on the applicant's product before and after a particular change is made.2. Q: For Case C testing, specific media are cited. Can other media or other pH's be used?A: The five media indicated for Case C dissolution testing are presented as examples only. Other media, as appropriate for a particular drug product, if properly justified, may be used. Such a situation could involve using different solution compositions to attain a certain pH, as well as some at different pH conditions.3. Q: For SUPAC-IR changes which require multi-point dissolution in several media, is this required of AA drug products? A: For AA drugs (i.e., those drugs identified in the Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations or the \"Orange Book\" as not presenting bioequivalence problems) when the original application only required multi-point single medium dissolution testing for approval, then a multi-point single medium dissolution will be satisfactory where Case C is specified in the SUPAC-IR guidance.4. Q: The inclusion of \"n\" in the f2 formula implies that the number and time of the pulls is left to the discretion of the FDA investigator. Choosing points late in the curve could insure a high f2. How will this be avoided?A: It is recommended that only one point past the plateau of the profiles be used.5. Q: Are the points for dissolution profiles listed in the document just guides, or do you expect to see those specific points? For a quickly dissolving drug, points at 10, 20, 30, and 40 may be more appropriate.A: The points listed should be considered to be examples. Others points can be used with justification. It is suggested that at least 4 points (other than zero), equally spaced, be utilized.6. Q: What options are available if f2 fails?A: If an applicant believes the profiles are similar even if dissolution profiles fail f2, the firm may present a scientific justification as to why the observed difference is not due to the proposed change, and could not have significant impact beyond what is normally seen for batches prepared without the change.7. Q: For case C testing, if all of the media are not ones typically used, must the dissolution procedure be validated using these media?A: Yes. All of the methods used should be validated.8. Q: What methods, other than Dr. Amidon's are acceptable?A: This is an evolving area or research. \"Extent of absorption\" may be an appropriate alternative, as indicated in the guidance. Full documentation of permeability may require special clinical testing. Physicochemical and in vitro predictors of permeability are being assessed at the FDA. Pending availability of these methods, firms may rely on literature data from pharmacokinetic/mass balance studies that suggest high extent of absorption of a drug across the gastrointestinal mucosa. Absent this information, firms should assume that a drug substance has low permeability and follow the recommendations in the SUPAC-IR guidance accordingly. 9. Q: How exactly is the industry expected to determine or know the permeability of their drug?A: One source of permeability information is the current research being conducted and sponsored by FDA. This information, for other drugs, could be experimentally determined by an applicant. Other alternative methods, related to permeability, may also be useful.10. Q: Are we allowed to monitor the metabolites and sum all the components?A: For determination of extent of absorption related to permeability, it may be appropriate to consider the sum of all components. As described in the guidance, this is \"in the absence of documented instability in the gastro-intestinal tract.\" In general, it is appropriate to sum all of the components if the formation of the metabolite occurs following permeation through the gastrointestinal mucosa.11. Q: What constitutes an acceptable in vivo/in vitro correlation? Does \"verified\" mean validated? A: Verified may be thought of as synonymous with validated. The Biopharmaceutics Coordinating Committee in CDER is developing guidance that addresses the general question. Pending availability of this guidance, firms should refer to published literature for information on establishing in vitro/in vivo correlations.\n\n11 IN Vivo Bio Studies\n\nQ: If the highest strength was the biobatch strength, and waivers were used for the other strengths, does supporting documentation for SUPAC-IR changes refer to all strengths? Does the answer differ depending on whether the strengths are dose/weight proportional?A: For SUPAC-IR bioequivalence recommendations, the recommended tests apply to all strengths. Regarding bio-requirements, the supporting documentation normally is needed for all strengths. If a bioequivalence study is recommended, then the compositional proportionality of the various strengths may determine if all strengths need to be tested for bioequivalence, or if a strength can be waived. However, this is not the standard comparison that is in the SUPAC-IR Guidance.2. Q: Will many small changes prompt the Agency to require a biostudy?A: Generally, a biostudy will not be requested simply because many changes which individually would not normally require a biostudy, are performed.3. Q: For SUPAC-IR changes which require an in-vivo bioequivalence test, is this requirement also intended for AA drugs which were exempt from bioequivalence testing when originally approved?A: The Center did not intend for SUPAC-IR to impose additional bioequivalence requirements for AA drugs beyond those in an original application. (AA drugs are those identified in the Orange Book as not presenting bioequivalence problems.) Therefore, if bioequivalence testing was not required originally, it will not be required under SUPAC-IR for AA drugs.\n\nQ: Would an in vivo bioequivalence study be needed for an AAA@ or non-bioequivalence problem DESI drug even if it one would be needed according to SUPAC?\n\nA: No, since that would conflict with the agency's current bioequivalence policy. 5. Q: When a bio study is required under SUPAC-IR, to what product should a generic product be compared - the Reference Listed Drug or the generic product approved prior to the SUPAC change.\n\nA: An innovator product should be compared to itself. A generic should be compared to the reference listed drug for that drug product.\n\nStability/change in batch size\n\nQ: When the documentation for a change is one batch on long term stability, is there a time limit between implementation of the change and initiation of the stability study?A: No. But the stability study should start as soon as possible after the drug product is prepared in the market container.2. Q: What is the stability requirement for a level 3 change involving a product with multiple strengths packaged in bottles and blisters? SUPAC-IR states one batch. Can we bracket?A: Testing and data collection involving the use of product bracketing are not the subject of SUPAC-IR. Bracketing may be used with prior approval of the Agency. The amount of data required depends on the type of change and whether or not there is a significant body of data available. If an applicant plans to bracket, the proposed protocol should be submitted to the Agency. This plan should include a protocol for each product. It should indicate all of the approved packaging configurations, and what strengths are approved for each of these. It also should include the approved stability test protocol.3. Q: Who determines how many batches are required for stability when the documentation requests 1-3?A: The answer will be dependent on the specific drug product and the amount of data already available. The appropriate review division should be contacted for further guidance.4. Q: When accelerated stability data are required, is that comparative data?\n\nA: Yes. Historical data may be used for comparison.\n\n7 Miscellaneous Issues\n--------------------\nContext title: SUPAC-IR Questions and Answers about SUPAC-IR Guidance \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.0074584484100342", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , Are scale-up and postapproval changes (SUPAC) level one and two variations and changes permitted among the three ANDA submission batches for components and composition?\n--------------------\nContext: A.

All profiles should be conducted on at least 12 individual dosage units.\n\nDissolution profiles may be compared using the following equation that defines a similarity factor (f({}_{2})):\n\nf({}{2}) = 50 LOG {[1+1/n (\\sum)({}{t=1}) (R({}{t})-T({}{J}))({}^{2})]({}^{-0.5}) x 100} where R({}{t}) and T({}{t}) are the percent dissolved at each time point. An f({}_{2}) value between 50 and 100 suggests the two dissolution profiles are similar.\n\nVIII In vivo bioequivalence studies\n\nBelow is a general outline of an in vivo bioequivalence study. It is intended as a guide and the design of the actual study may vary depending on the drug and dosage form.\n\nA. Objective:\n\nTo compare the rate and extent of absorption of the drug product for which the manufacture has been changed, as defined in this guidance, to the drug product manufactured prior to the change.\n\nB. Design:\n\nThe study design should be a single dose, two-treatment, two-period crossover with adequate washout period between the two phases of the study. Equal numbers of subjects should be randomly assigned to each of the two dosing sequences.\n\nSelection of Subjects:\n\nThe number of subjects enrolled in the bioequivalence study should be determined statistically to account for the intrasubject variability and to meet the current bioequivalence interval.\n\nD. Procedure:\n\nEach subject should receive the following two treatments:\n\nTreatment 1: Product manufactured with the proposed change.\n\nTreatment 2: Product manufactured prior to the proposed change.\n\nFollowing an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects should receive either Treatments 1 or 2 above with 240 mL water. Food should not be allowed until 4 hours after dosing. Water may be allowed after the first hour. Subjects should be served standardized meals beginning at 4 hours during the study.\n\nE. Restrictions:\n\nPrior to and during each study phase, water may be allowed ad libitum except for 1 hour before and after drug administration. The subject should be served standardized meals and beverages at specified times. No alcohol or xanthine- or caffeine-containing foods and beverages should be consumed for 48 hours prior to each study period and until after the last blood sample is collected.\n\nF. Blood Sampling:\n\nBlood samples should be collected in sufficient volume for analysis of parent drug and active metabolite(s), if any. The sampling times should be such that it should be able to capture the C({}{\\text{max}}) and T({}{\\text{max}}) during the absorption period. Sampling should be carried out for at least three terminal elimination half-lives for both parent drug and active metabolite(s). Whole blood, plasma or serum, whichever is appropriate for the analytes, should be harvested promptly and samples should be frozen at -20({}^{\\text{o}})C or -70({}^{\\text{o}})C to maintain sample stability.\n\nG. Analytical Method:_The assay methodology selected should ensure specificity, accuracy, interday and intraday precision, linearity of standard curves, and adequate sensitivity, recovery, and stability of the samples under the storage and handling conditions associated with the analytical method. H. _Pharmacokinetic Analysis:\n\nFrom the plasma drug concentration-time data, AUC({}{0\\text{-}t}), AUC({}{0\\text{-}\\text{inf}}), C({}{\\text{max}}), T({}{\\text{max}}), K({}{\\text{el}}) and t({}{\\text{t/2}}) should be estimated. I. Statistical Analysis:\n\nAnalysis of variance appropriate for a crossover design on the pharmacokinetic parameters using the general linear models procedures of SAS or an equivalent program should be performed, with examination of period, sequence and treatment effects. The 90% confidence intervals for the estimates of the difference between the test and reference least squares means for the pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC({}{0\\text{-}\\text{t}}), AUC({}{0\\text{-}\\text{inf}}), Cmax) should be calculated, using the two one-sided t-test procedure.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] A.

The impact of some variations on material quality in an earlier process step may be resolved by downstream process steps. The extent of variations and the ability to resolve them in subsequent steps are impacted by the amplitude, duration, and frequency of the disturbance. Identification of tolerable ranges for these parameters and establishing appropriate acceptance criteria will enable the development of an effective strategy for managing disturbances.\n\nManufacturers may use various methodologies (e.g., DOE, RTD studies, a combination of both) to understand the impact of disturbances. Funnel plot predictions based on an RTD model can be a useful tool to understand the qualitative and quantitative impact of the amplitude and duration of a disturbance on material quality. Figure 5 shows a funnel plot for drug substance feeding in a drug product CM process (similar to the example in Annex II). Funnel plots are specific to the formulation, process conditions, and system configuration used in RTD model development. Information from the funnel plot helps to inform the selection of appropriate acceptance criteria for disturbances. For example, the dotted lines in the following funnel plot show that a disturbance of +/- 20% lasting less than 90 seconds would not cause the drug concentration in the blend to exceed the 90-110% label claim (LC).\n\nFigure 5: Example of a funnel plot for the feeding of a drug substance\n\n3 Management of Disturbances\n\nManufacturers may develop various approaches to manage disturbances considering the specific details of the CM system and the risk to material quality from disturbances. Three examples considering different risks of a disturbance are provided below:\n\nExample 1: The amplitude and duration of the disturbance meet predefined acceptance criteria for the disturbance, and the occurrence of such disturbances is infrequent.\n\nExample 2: The amplitude or duration of the disturbance exceeds the predefined acceptance criteria for the disturbance, and the occurrence of such disturbances is infrequent.\n\nExample 3: The amplitude and duration of each disturbance meet predefined acceptance criteria for the disturbance, but multiple, frequent disturbances are observed.\n\nThese examples focus on the impact of disturbance from a loss-in-weight feeder (LIWF) on the drug concentration in the blend for a CM process similar to that described in Annex II, given that all other parameters being monitored meet the predefined acceptance criteria. These examples use the information in the funnel plot (Figure 5) and, for the purpose of discussion, assume that the acceptance criteria for the magnitude and duration of an LIWF disturbance is +/- 20% lasting for 80 seconds. These examples help illustrate the important considerations in management of disturbances under selected scenarios, which may also be applicable to drug substances and other CM processes.\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_Q13_Step4_Guideline_2022_1116\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.592706203460693"], "As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance\n\nPotassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Energetics\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nDecember 2001\n\nProcedural\n\nOutface\n\nPotassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Training and Communications\n\nDivision of Communications Management\n\nDrug Information Branch, HFD-210\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\n(Tel) 301-827-4573\n\n(Internet) http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nDecember 2001\n\nProcedural\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nGuidance\n\nPotassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking\n\nAgent in Radiation Emergencies\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe objective of this document is to provide guidance to other Federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and to state and local governments regarding the safe and effective use of potassium iodide (KI) as an adjunct to other public health protective measures in the event that radioactive iodine is released into the environment. The adoption and implementation of these recommendations are at the discretion of the state and local governments responsible for developing regional emergency-response plans related to radiation emergencies.\n\nThis guidance updates the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 1982 recommendations for the use of KI to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer in radiation emergencies involving the release of radioactive iodine. The recommendations in this guidance address KI dosage and the projected radiation exposure at which the drug should be used.\n\nThese recommendations were prepared by the Potassium Iodide Working Group, comprising scientists from the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) in collaboration with experts in the field from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although they differ in two respects (as discussed in Section IV.2), these revised recommendations are in general accordance with those of the World Health Organization (WHO), as expressed in its Guidelines for Iodine Prophylaxis Following Nuclear Accidents: Update 1999 (WHO 1999).\n\nII Background\n\nUnder 44 CFR 351, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established roles and responsibilities for Federal agencies in assisting state and local governments in their radiological emergency planning and preparedness activities. The Federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), are to carry out these roles and responsibilities as members of the Federal Radiological Preparedness Coordinating Committee(FRPCC). Under 44 CFR 351.23(f), HHS is directed to provide guidance to state and local governments on the use of radioprotective substances and the prophylactic use of drugs (e.g., KI) to reduce the radiation dose to specific organs. This guidance includes information about dosage and projected radiation exposures at which such drugs should be used.\n\nThe FDA has provided guidance previously on the use of KI as a thyroid blocking agent. In the Federal Register of December 15, 1978, FDA announced its conclusion that KI is a safe and effective means by which to block uptake of radioiodines by the thyroid gland in a radiation emergency under certain specified conditions of use. In the Federal Register of June 29, 1982, FDA announced final recommendations on the administration of KI to the general public in a radiation emergency. Those recommendations were formulated after reviewing studies relating radiation dose to thyroid disease risk that relied on estimates of external thyroid irradiation after the nuclear detonations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki and analogous studies among children who received therapeutic radiation to the head and neck. Those recommendations concluded that at a projected dose to the thyroid gland of 25 cGy or greater from ingested or inhaled radioiodines, the risks of short-term use of small quantities of KI were outweighed by the benefits of suppressing radioiodine-induced thyroid cancer.1 The amount of KI recommended at that time was 130 mg per day for adults and children above 1 year of age and 65 mg per day for children below 1 year of age. The guidance that follows revises our 1982 recommendations on the use of KI for thyroid cancer prophylaxis based on a comprehensive review of the data relating radioioidine exposure to thyroid cancer risk accumulated in the aftermath of the 1986 Chernobyl reactor accident.\n\nFootnote 1: For the radiation emitted by ({}^{131}) I (electrons and photons), the radiation-weighting factor is equal to one, so that the absorbed dose to the thyroid gland expressed in centigrays (cGy) is numerically equal to the thyroid equivalent dose expressed in rem (1 cGy = 1 rem).\n\n3 Data Sources\n\nReliance on Data from Chernobyl\n\nIn epidemiological studies investigating the relationship between thyroidal radioiodine exposure and risk of thyroid cancer, the estimation of thyroid radiation doses is a critical and complex aspect of the analyses. Estimates of exposure, both for individuals and across populations, have been reached in different studies by the variable combination of (1) direct thyroid measurements in a segment of the exposed population; (2) measurements of ({}^{131})I (iodine isotope) concentrations in the milk consumed by different groups (e.g., communities) and of the quantity of milk consumed; (3) inference from ground deposition of long-lived radioisotopes released coincidentally and presumably in fixed ratios with radioiodines; and (4) reconstruction of the nature and extent of the actual radiation release.\n\nAll estimates of individual and population exposure contain some degree of uncertainty. The uncertainty is least for estimates of individual exposure based on direct thyroid measurements.\n\nUncertainty increases with reliance on milk consumption estimates; is still greater with estimates derived from ground deposition of long-lived radioisotopes, and is highest for estimates that rely heavily on release reconstruction.\n\nDirect measurements of thyroid radioactivity are unavailable from the Hanford, Nevada Test Site, and Marshall Islands exposures. Indeed, the estimates of thyroid radiation doses related to these releases rely heavily on release reconstructions and, in the former two cases, on recall of the extent of milk consumption 40 to 50 years after the fact. In the Marshall Islands cohort, urinary radioiodine excretion data were obtained and used in calculating exposure estimates.\n\nBecause of the great uncertainty in the dose estimates from the Hanford and Nevada Test Site exposures and due to the small numbers of thyroid cancers occurring in the populations potentially exposed, the epidemiological studies of the excess thyroid cancer risk related to these radioiodine releases are, at best, inconclusive. As explained below, the dosimetric data derived in the studies of individual and population exposures following the Chernobyl accident, although not perfect, are unquestionably superior to data from previous releases. In addition, the results of the earlier studies are inadequate to refute cogent case control study evidence from Chernobyl of a cause-effect relationship between thyroid radioiodine deposition and thyroid cancer risk.2\n\nFootnote 2: We have included in this guidance an extensive bibliography of the sources used in developing these revised recommendations.\n\nThe Chernobyl reactor accident of April 1986 provides the best-documented example of a massive radionuclide release in which large numbers of people across a broad geographical area were exposed acutely to radioiodines released into the atmosphere. Therefore, the recommendations contained in this guidance are derived from our review of the Chernobyl data as they pertain to the large number of thyroid cancers that occurred. These are the most comprehensive and reliable data available describing the relationship between thyroid radiation dose and risk for thyroid cancer following an environmental release of ({}^{131})I. In contrast, the exposures resulting from radiation releases at the Hanford Site in Washington State in the mid-1940s and in association with the nuclear detonations at the Nevada Test Site in the 1950s were extended over years, rather than days to weeks, contributing to the difficulty in estimating radioactive dose in those potentially exposed (Davis et al., 1999; Gilbert et al., 1998). The exposure of Marshall Islanders to fallout from the nuclear detonation on Bikini in 1954 involved relatively few people, and although the high rate of subsequent thyroid nodules and cancers in the exposed population was likely caused in large part by radioiodines, the Marshall Islands data provide little insight into the dose-response relationship between radioactive iodine exposure and thyroid cancer risk (Robbins and Adams 1989).\n--------------------\nContext title: Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.926231861114502", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n--------------------\nContext: The FDA recommendations for KI intervention encompass different threshold thyroid radioactive exposures for different groups within the population. Several factors were involved in this approach:\n\nDuring the Chernobyl accident, younger people exposed to radioactive iodine (especially children 0 to 4 years old) were most sensitive to its carcinogenic effects.\nIn the years following the accident, most children who subsequently developed thyroid cancer apparently received internal thyroid radioactive exposures of less than 30 cGy, and the best dose-response information supports increased risk in children receiving 5 cGy or more.\n\nAs age increases, the risk of thyroidal side effects following excess (i.e., nonradioactive) iodine ingestion increases. This is due to the increasing prevalence of underlying thyroidal illness with older age (e.g., Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, Hashimoto's thyroiditis).\n\nThyroid irradiation in older adults (e.g., over 40 years of age) is associated with an extremely low incidence of cancer. Therefore, KI is only recommended if a very large internal radioactive dose to the thyroid is projected. In such a situation, KI would be ingested to prevent destruction of the thyroid gland, which, if it occurred, would lead to lifelong dependence on thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\n\nIn short, the recommended stepped intervention approach to KI use during radiation emergencies is based on differences in overall benefit versus risk in different population groups. Specifically, the benefits from thyroid blockade with KI predominate in the young in whom the risks of thyroid cancer from radioiodine are the greatest. The risks of KI take on more prominence in older adults in whom the risks of thyroid cancer are very small.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, it is important to note that among 7 million adults who took stable iodine in Poland following Chernobyl, only two severe adverse reactions were reported, both in persons with known allergy to iodine. Based on these data, we have concluded that even if the risks associated with excess stable iodine are greater in adults than in children, the risk of serious adverse reactions overall is exceedingly small.\n\nIn summary, FDA understands that a KI administration program that sets different projected thyroid radioactive exposure thresholds for treatment of different population groups may be logistically impractical to implement during a radiological emergency. If emergency planners reach this conclusion, FDA recommends that KI be administered to both children and adults at the lowest intervention threshold (i.e., (\\geq 5) cGy projected internal thyroid exposure in children).\n\nAs a rule, however, individuals with known allergy to KI or with pre-existing thyroid disease (e.g., Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, Hashimoto's thyroiditis) that might predispose them to adverse reactions should avoid KI. Most likely these will be adults, who have little or no risk of developing thyroid cancer from radioactive exposure to the thyroid and who may, in these cases, incur substantial risks from taking KI.\n\nQ8: Does the FDA guidance apply to residents outside of the 10-mile emergency planning zone for nuclear poset plants?\n\nYes. KI administered in advance of an exposure will successfully block thyroidal uptake of radioiodine, wherever one may reside.\n--------------------\nContext title: (Potassium Iodide) KI in Radiation Emergencies-Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.541451454162598", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n--------------------\nContext: For optimal protection against inhaled radioiodines, KI should be administered before or immediately coincident with passage of the radioactive cloud, though KI may still have a substantial protective effect even if taken 3 or 4 hours after exposure. Furthermore, if the release of radioiodines into the atmosphere is protracted, then, of course, even delayed administration may reap benefits by reducing, if incompletely, the total radiation dose to the thyroid.\n\nPrevention of thyroid uptake of ingested radioiodines, once the plume has passed and radiation protection measures (including KI) are in place, is best accomplished by food control measures and not by repeated administration of KI. Because of radioactive decay, grain products and canned milk or vegetables from sources affected by radioactive fallout, if stored for weeks to months after production, pose no radiation risk. Thus, late KI prophylaxis at the time of consumption is not required.\n\nAs time is of the essence in optimal prophylaxis with KI, timely administration to the public is a critical consideration in planning the emergency response to a radiation accident and requires a ready supply of KI. State and local governments choosing to incorporate KI into their emergency response plans may consider the option of predistribution of KI to those individuals who do not have a medical condition precluding its use.\n\nVI Summary\n\nFDA maintains that KI is a safe and effective means by which to prevent radioiodine uptake by the thyroid gland, under certain specified conditions of use, and thereby obviate the risk of thyroid cancer in the event of a radiation emergency. Based upon review of the literature, we have proposed lower radioactive exposure thresholds for KI prophylaxis as well as lower doses of KI for neonates, infants, and children than we recommended in 1982. As in our 1982 notice in the Federal Register, FDA continues to recommend that radiation emergency response plans include provisions, in the event of a radiation emergency, for informing the public about the magnitude of the radiation hazard, about the manner of use of KI and its potential benefits and risks, and for medical contact, reporting, and assistance systems. FDA also emphasizes that emergency response plans and any systems for ensuring availability of KI to the public should recognize the critical importance of KI administration in advance of exposure to radioiodine. As in the past, FDA continues to work in an ongoing fashion with manufacturers of KI to ensure that high-quality, safe, and effective KI products are available for purchase by consumers as well as by state and local governments wishing to establish stores for emergency distribution.\n\nKI provides protection only for the thyroid from radioiodines. It has no impact on the uptake by the body of other radioactive materials and provides no protection against external irradiation of any kind. FDA emphasizes that the use of KI should be as an adjunct to evacuation (itself not always feasible), sheltering, and control of foodstuffs.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe KI Taskforce would like to extend special thanks to our members from the NIH: Jacob Robbins, M.D., and Jan Wolff, Ph.D., M.D., of the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases and Andre Bouville, Ph.D., of the National Cancer Institute.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides answers to questions that FDA has received as state and local governments develop emergency response plans involving the use of potassium iodide (KI) to protect against the effects of radioactive iodine accidentally or intentionally released into the atmosphere. KI is recommended for use as an adjunct to other emergency measures, such as evacuation and control of the food supply to avoid ingestion of contaminated foodstuffs. When used correctly, KI can prevent or reduce the uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid gland. KI provides optimal protection when administered immediately prior to or in conjunction with passage of a radioactive cloud. The incorporation of KI into radiation emergency response plans is at the discretion of state and local governments.\n\nThis is a revision of the question and answer guidance published in April 2002. The revision incorporates two additional questions (question 4 and question 7) raised about KI intervention and makes minor editorial changes to the previous questions and answers.\n\nII Background\n\nIn a guidance entitled Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies (December 2001), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated its 1982 recommendations for the safe and effective use of KI to prevent or reduce the uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid gland. The current recommendations are based on conclusions reached after reviewing data on radioiodine exposure and thyroid cancer risk gathered after the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in 1986. The data suggest that the risk of thyroid cancer is inversely related to age. Fetuses, infants, and young children are at greatest risk and may be harmed by small amounts of radioiodine.\n\nAlthough special precautions should be taken when administering KI to pregnant women and newborns within the first month of life (adherence to the recommended dose, avoidance of repeat dosing, and monitoring of thyroid function in neonates), the benefits of short-term administration of KI as a thyroid blocking agent far exceed the risks of administration to any age group. For complete information, please refer to FDA's December 2001 guidance.\n\nIII Questions and Answers\n\nQ1:: Does FDA have specific recommendations about radiation emergency preparedness plans and the use of KI?\n\nNo. Decisions about the details of their preparedness plans are up to state and local authorities. FDA's guidance provides general recommendations about the use of KI prophylaxis in the event of a radiological emergency. These recommendations are discussed in Section V. of the guidance.\n\nQ2:: Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n\nNo. FDA has made recommendations on the lowest effective dose. Higher doses (e.g., up to 130 mg) would be equally effective and, particularly among school-age children, extremely safe (see also question 9).\n\nQ3:: If a graded dosing approach is considered, how does FDA suggest that fractional doses (i.e., 65, 32, 16 mg) be administered?\n\nKI tablets can be dissolved in liquids and the appropriate volume administered. For example, if a 130 mg tablet were dissolved in 8 ounces of liquid, one ounce would contain about 16 mg of KI. FDA has conducted studies of the palatability, solubility, and stability of KI dissolved in a number of different liquids, including juice and formula. (See the Home Preparation Procedure for Emergency Administration of Potassium Iodide Tablets to Infants and Small Children.2) Emergency planners and others should understand that absolute precision in dosing is generally not critical to safety or efficacy (see also question 4).\n\nFootnote 2: This is available at http://www.fda.gov/cder/drugprepare/default.htm.\n\nQ4.: FDA guidance recommends graded dosing by age, with neonates receiving the lowest dose (16 mg daily) and adults receiving the highest (130 mg). FDA approved KI tablets are available in two dosage strengths: 65 and 130 mg. At a minimum, dosing based on FDA guidance would require either splitting tablets or dissolving tablets in liquids. This may be impractical while responding to a radiological emergency. In this context, what is the impact of uniform dosing across all age groups eligible for KI prophylaxis?* The FDA's guidance on dosing KI in radiation emergencies adheres to principles of minimum effective dose and therefore recommends graded dosing according to age (and thus, in effect, body size). There is ample evidence that the recommended doses, as well as higher doses (e.g., up to 130 mg), will effectively block thyroidal uptake of radioactive iodine if taken in advance of exposure. Furthermore, particularly among school-age children, higher milligram doses are extremely safe. We also realize that a scheme of graded dosing may be difficult to implement during a radiological emergency involving large numbers of people. However, we continue to emphasize attention to KI dosing in infants. Excess iodine intake can lead to transient iodine-induced hypothyroidism. As we have said in our guidance, individuals who are intolerant of KI at protective doses, as well as neonates, pregnant, and lactating women, should be given priority with regard to other protective measures (i.e., sheltering, evacuation, and control of the food supply).\n\nIn summary, if local emergency planners conclude that graded dosing is logistically impractical, FDA believes that for populations at risk for radioiodine exposure, the overall benefits of taking up to 130 mg of KI instead of the lower doses recommended for certain age groups far exceed the small risks of overdosing. However, where feasible, adherence to FDA guidance should be attempted when dosing infants.\n\nWill dosage strengths of KI below 130 mg be available in the United States?\n\nYes. An FDA approved 65-mg KI tablet is being marketed now in the United States.\n\nAre there plans to update the labeling for marketed KI products to conform to the revised FDA recommendations on dosing?\n\nYes. FDA is working with manufacturers to amend the \"Drug Facts\" labeling for KI products, which are sold over the counter, to incorporate the new dosing recommendations.\n\nHow critical to public health is adherence to FDA's recommendations with regard to projected thyroid radioactive exposure thresholds for intervention by risk category? Specifically, the existence of different thresholds for neonates, children through age 18, and pregnant or lactating women ((\\geq) 5 cGy) versus adults aged 18 through 40 years ((\\geq) 10 cGy) versus adults over age 40 ((\\geq) 500 cGy) are confusing and logistically complex to follow in responding to a radiological emergency.\n\nThe FDA recommendations for KI intervention encompass different threshold thyroid radioactive exposures for different groups within the population. Several factors were involved in this approach:\n\nDuring the Chernobyl accident, younger people exposed to radioactive iodine (especially children 0 to 4 years old) were most sensitive to its carcinogenic effects.\nIn the years following the accident, most children who subsequently developed thyroid cancer apparently received internal thyroid radioactive exposures of less than 30 cGy, and the best dose-response information supports increased risk in children receiving 5 cGy or more.\n\nAs age increases, the risk of thyroidal side effects following excess (i.e., nonradioactive) iodine ingestion increases. This is due to the increasing prevalence of underlying thyroidal illness with older age (e.g., Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, Hashimoto's thyroiditis).\n\nThyroid irradiation in older adults (e.g., over 40 years of age) is associated with an extremely low incidence of cancer. Therefore, KI is only recommended if a very large internal radioactive dose to the thyroid is projected. In such a situation, KI would be ingested to prevent destruction of the thyroid gland, which, if it occurred, would lead to lifelong dependence on thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\n\nIn short, the recommended stepped intervention approach to KI use during radiation emergencies is based on differences in overall benefit versus risk in different population groups. Specifically, the benefits from thyroid blockade with KI predominate in the young in whom the risks of thyroid cancer from radioiodine are the greatest. The risks of KI take on more prominence in older adults in whom the risks of thyroid cancer are very small.\n--------------------\nContext title: (Potassium Iodide) KI in Radiation Emergencies-Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.21391205489635468", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n--------------------\nContext: Thyroidal side effects of stable iodine include iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis, which is more common in older people and in iodine deficient areas but usually requires repeated doses of stable iodine. In addition, iodide goiter and hypothyroidism are potential side effects more common in iodine sufficient areas, but they require chronic high doses of stable iodine (Rubery 1990). In light of the preceding, individuals with multinodular goiter, Graves' disease, and autoimmune thyroiditis should be treated with caution, especially if dosing extends beyond a few days. The vast majority of such individuals will be adults.\n\nThe transient hypothyroidism observed in 0.37 percent (12 of 3214) of neonates treated with KI in Poland after Chernobyl has been without reported sequelae to date. There is no question that the benefits of KI treatment to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer outweigh the risks of such treatment in neonates. Nevertheless, in light of the potential consequences of even transient hypothyroidism for intellectual development, we recommend that neonates (within the first month of life) treated with KI be monitored for this effect by measurement of TSH (and FT4, if indicated) and that thyroid hormone therapy be instituted in cases in which hypothyroidism develops (Bongers-Schokking 2000; Fisher 2000; Calaciura 1995).\n\nAppendix B KI Use in Radiation Emergencies: Treatment Recommendations\n\nAfter careful review of the data from Chernobyl relating estimated thyroid radiation dose and cancer risk in exposed children, FDA is revising its recommendation for administration of KI based on age, predicted thyroid exposure, and pregnancy and lactation status (see Table).\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|} \\hline \\multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Threshold Thyroid Radioactive Exposures and} \\ \\multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Recommended Doses of KI for Different Risk Groups} \\ \\hline  & Predicted & KI dose (mg) & # of 130 mg & # of 65 \\  & Thyroid & tablets & mg tablets \\  & exposure(cGy) & & & \\ \\hline Adults over 40 yrs & (>)500 & & & \\ \\hline Adults over 18 through 40 yrs & (>)10 & & & \\ \\hline Pregnant or lactating women & & 130 & 1 & 2 \\ \\hline Adoles. over 12 through 18 yrs & (\\geq) 5 & & & \\ \\hline Children over 3 through 12 yrs & & 65 & 1/2 & 1 \\ \\hline Over 1 month through 3 years & & 32 & 1/4 & 1/2 \\ \\hline Birth through 1 month & & 16 & 1/8 & 1/4 \\ \\hline \\multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Adolescents approaching adult size ((\\geq) 70 kg) should receive the full adult dose (130 mg).} \\ \\end{tabular}\n\nThe protective effect of KI lasts approximately 24 hours. For optimal prophylaxis, KI should therefore be dosed daily, until a risk of significant exposure to radioiodines by either inhalation or ingestion no longer exists. Individuals intolerant of KI at protective doses, and neonates, pregnant and lactating women (in whom repeat administration of KI raises particular safety issues, see below) should be given priority with regard to other protective measures (i.e., sheltering, evacuation, and control of the food supply).\n\nNote that adults over 40 need take KI only in the case of a projected large internal radiation dose to the thyroid ((>)500 cGy) to prevent hypothyroidism.\n\nThese recommendations are meant to provide states and local authorities as well as other agencies with the best current guidance on safe and effective use of KI to reduce thyroidal radioiodine exposure and thus the risk of thyroid cancer. FDA recognizes that, in the event of an emergency, some or all of the specific dosing recommendations may be very difficult to carry out given their complexity and the logistics of implementation of a program of KI distribution. The recommendations should therefore be interpreted with flexibility as necessary to allow optimally effective and safe dosing given the exigencies of any particular emergency situation. In this context, we offer the following critical general guidance: across populations at risk for radioiodine exposure, the overall benefits of KI far exceed the risks of overdosing, especially in children, though we continue to emphasize particular attention to dose in infants.\n\nThese FDA recommendations differ from those put forward in the World Health Organization (WHO) 1999 guidelines for iodine prophylaxis in two ways. WHO recommends a 130-mg dose of KI for adults and adolescents (over 12 years). For the sake of logistical simplicity in the dispensing and administration of KI to children, FDA recommends a 65-mg dose as standard for all school-age children while allowing for the adult dose (130 mg, 2 X 65 mg tablets) in adolescents approaching adult size. The other difference lies in the threshold for predicted exposure of those up to 18 years of age and of pregnant or lactating women that should trigger KI prophylaxis. WHO recommends a threshold of 1 cGy for these two groups. As stated earlier, FDA has concluded from the Chernobyl data that the most reliable evidence supports a significant increase in the risk of childhood thyroid cancer at exposures of 5 cGy or greater.\n\nThe downward KI dose adjustment by age group, based on body size considerations, adheres to the principle of minimum effective dose. The recommended standard dose of KI for all school-age children is the same (65 mg). However, adolescents approaching adult size (i.e., (>)70 kg) should receive the full adult dose (130 mg) for maximal block of thyroid radioiodine uptake. Neonates ideally should receive the lowest dose (16 mg) of KI. Repeat dosing of KI should be avoided in the neonate to minimize the risk of hypothyroidism during that critical phase of brain development (Bongers-Schokking 2000; Calcaiuma et al., 1995). KI from tablets (either whole or fractions) or as fresh saturated KI solution may be diluted in milk, formula, or water and the appropriate volume administered to babies. As stated above, we recommend that neonates (within the first month of life) treated with KI be monitored for the potential development of hypothyroidism by measurement of TSH (and FT4, if indicated) and that thyroid hormone therapy be instituted in cases in which hypothyroidism develops (Bongers-Schokking 2000; Fisher 2000; Calcaiuma et al., 1995).\n\nPregnant women should be given KI for their own protection and for that of the fetus, as iodine (whether stable or radioactive) readily crosses the placenta. However, because of the risk of blocking fetal thyroid function with excess stable iodine, repeat dosing with KI of pregnant women should be avoided. Lactating females should be administered KI for their own protection, as for other young adults, and potentially to reduce the radioiodine content of the breast milk, but not as a means to deliver KI to infants, who should get their KI directly. As for direct administration of KI, stable iodine as a component of breast milk may also pose a risk of hypothyroidism in nursing neonates. Therefore, repeat dosing with KI should be avoided in the lactating mother, except during continuing severe contamination. If repeat dosing of the mother is necessary, the nursing neonate should be monitored as recommended above.\n\nAdditional Considerations in Prophylaxis against Thyroid Radioidoline Exposure\n\nCertain principles should guide emergency planning and implementation of KI prophylaxis in the event of a radiation emergency. After the Chernobyl accident, across the affected populations, thyroid radiation exposures occurred largely due to consumption of contaminated fresh cow's milk (this contamination was the result of milk cows grazing on fields affected by radioactive fallout) and to a much lesser extent by consumption of contaminated vegetables. In this or similar accidents, for those residing in the immediate area of the accident or otherwise directly exposed to the radioactive plume, inhalation of radioiodines may be a significant contributor to individual and population exposures. As a practical matter, it may not be possible to assess the risk of thyroid exposure from inhaled radioiodines at the time of the emergency. The risk depends on factors such as the magnitude and rate of the radioiodine release, wind direction and other atmospheric conditions, and thus may affect people both near to and far from the accident site.\n\nFor optimal protection against inhaled radioiodines, KI should be administered before or immediately coincident with passage of the radioactive cloud, though KI may still have a substantial protective effect even if taken 3 or 4 hours after exposure. Furthermore, if the release of radioiodines into the atmosphere is protracted, then, of course, even delayed administration may reap benefits by reducing, if incompletely, the total radiation dose to the thyroid.\n\nPrevention of thyroid uptake of ingested radioiodines, once the plume has passed and radiation protection measures (including KI) are in place, is best accomplished by food control measures and not by repeated administration of KI. Because of radioactive decay, grain products and canned milk or vegetables from sources affected by radioactive fallout, if stored for weeks to months after production, pose no radiation risk. Thus, late KI prophylaxis at the time of consumption is not required.\n\nAs time is of the essence in optimal prophylaxis with KI, timely administration to the public is a critical consideration in planning the emergency response to a radiation accident and requires a ready supply of KI. State and local governments choosing to incorporate KI into their emergency response plans may consider the option of predistribution of KI to those individuals who do not have a medical condition precluding its use.\n\nVI Summary\n--------------------\nContext title: Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.11349464952945709", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , Is the graded dosing scheme recommended by FDA the only safe and effective way to take KI?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 13: When final, this guidance will represent the FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nConsiderations for children\n\nIn situations where there may be a concern regarding differential efficacy between adults and pediatric patients for the same or different indication, sponsors could consider enrolling an expanded population with patients under 12 years of age with the goal of including them in the safety analysis but not in the primary adult efficacy analysis.\n\nPotential ways to include pediatric patients after a sufficient number of adult patients have been evaluated to provide adequate safety and toxicity data include:\n\nEnrolling a cohort of pediatric patients starting one dose level behind the highest dose level studied in adults in which there are no dose-limiting toxicities identified or one dose level below the maximally tolerated dose, if established.\n\nThe pediatric starting dose should be lower than the adult maximally tolerated dose (particularly for monoclonal antibodies) (i.e., the pediatric starting dose may be the adult recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) if the dose is not the adult maximally tolerated dose).\n\nA limited dose escalation may occur in the pediatric cohort depending on the therapeutic product and the clinical indication(s) as well as the specific age eligibility for the pediatric cohort.\n\nIn general, for children (<12) years of age defined adult flat doses would be converted to body surface area or body weight adjusted dosing. Dosing should be supported by the PK characteristics of the drug with consideration of the effect of body size on its PK, the therapeutic index of the drug, and dose- and exposure-response relationships, if known.\n\nEnrolling pediatric patients in a separate cohort that will accrue concurrently with the adult cohort when sufficient information to permit dose modeling based on adult PK and exposure data are available.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPossible strategies for the evaluation of efficacy in the pediatric population or indication(s) include:\n\nEnroll pediatric patients in separate expansion cohorts prespecified to separately evaluate efficacy if the biology/clinical course of the disease differs in adults and children.\n\nUse an expanded cohort design to build knowledge including assessment of safety and efficacy in particular populations. This approach would be particularly useful when the adult and pediatric indications ultimately under evaluation differ and in the setting of histology/tissue agnostic development strategies.\n\nConsiderations for adolescents\n\nGiven similarities in drug exposure between adolescents and adults (based on similar body weight and metabolic processes), adolescents may be enrolled concurrently with adult patients after some initial adult PK and toxicity data are obtained.14\n\nFootnote 14: For more information, see the guidance for industry Considerations for the Inclusion of Adolescent Patients in Adult Oncology Clinical Trials.\n\nii.2.5 Late phase trial considerations\n\nThe minimum age of eligibility specified in late-phase trials should be tailored to the biology of the disease under study, the scientific objectives of the trial, and the existing data regarding the mechanism of action, safety profile, and preliminary efficacy information.\n--------------------\nContext title: Cancer Clinical Trial Eligibility Criteria- Minimum Age Considerations for Inclusion of Pediatric Patients \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.046651363372803"], "With reference to Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n--------------------\nContext: III Questions and Answers\n\nQ1: What is whole slide imaging?\n\nA1: Whole slide imaging includes the software and hardware used to generate a two-dimensional digital image4 of a glass histology slide used for routine assessment in generation of the pathology report. The process includes four sequential parts: image acquisition (scanning), image processing, image file storage, and display of images. The FDA does not consider the resulting digital image to be an exact copy of the glass slide. A whole slide image used in a GLP-compliant study should include all the elements from the glass slide that are needed for histopathological examination or pathology peer review.\n\nFootnote 4: Digital images comprise a sequence of small images (referred to as tiles) taken from distinct locations on the glass slide. Whole slide imaging systems typically determine the optimal focal plane at a limited, discrete set of locations on the glass slide and interpolate the optimal focal plane to generate all of the tiles. The individual tiles are then combined to create the \u201cwhole slide\u201d image.\n\nQ2: Should whole slide images be retained?\n\nA2: For GLP-compliant nonclinical toxicology studies, if whole slide images are assessed in lieu of the original glass slides and result in the generation of pathology raw data, the whole slide image files should be retained as study records and archived. Consideration should be given to ensure that archived digital images remain viewable as software/hardware updates/versions are implemented.\n\nQ3: If the whole slide image files are retained, should the glass slides also be retained?\n\nA3: Yes. The glass slides contain study specimens and must be retained as study specimens after study finalization in accordance with 21 CFR part 58.\n\nQ4: What should be retained with respect to the whole slide image file? Should modified whole slide image files be retained?\n\nA4: The whole slide image files provided to the study pathologist for histopathological examination and/or provided to the peer review pathologist(s) for pathology peer review (i.e., files containing all image data captured by the scanner and documentation of any technical image processing modifications), referred to here as the original whole slide image files, should be retained if they are used to generate raw data. Specifically, any technical image processing modifications made to whole slide image files prior to being provided to the pathologist (e.g., smoothing, color manipulation) should be documented and retained. Technical image processing should not obscure elements captured from the glass slide (e.g., label, artifact).\n\nThe pathologist should not permanently alter the original whole slide image files. Nonpermanent adjustments made by the pathologist using the image viewing software during whole slide image evaluation (e.g., brightness, contrast, annotations) do not need to be documented or retained.\n\nQ5: Should written procedures for whole slide imaging processes be in place?\n\nA5: Yes, written procedures for whole slide imaging processes should be in place because whole slide images may be used to generate raw data. These processes may include, for example, training, slide scanning, software management, and file access and exchange control.\n\nQ6: Should the whole slide imaging system be validated?\n\nA6: If the whole slide images are used to generate raw data, the whole slide imaging system (including software and hardware) should be validated in a manner specific to the intended use of the technology.\n\nQ7: Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n\nA7: If the whole slide images are used to generate raw data, they should be protected to prevent loss or alteration of data, maintain chain of custody, control access, and secure data systems and data transmission. These measures should be performed following written procedures and processes in compliance with electronic record requirements under 21 CFR part 11 to maintain whole slide image file integrity.\n\nQ8: Should the signed pathology report/peer review statement state that whole slide images were evaluated in lieu of glass slides?\n\nA8: Yes, the signed pathology report should state whether glass slides or whole slide images were used for histopathological evaluation by the study pathologist, consistent with 21 CFR 58.\n\nContents\n\n1 Introduction\n\n2 Preliminaries\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_POST]\n\nuidance for Industry Pathology Peer Review in Nonclinical Toxicology Studies: Questions and Answers (December 2021).

Increased availability of these devices may help to facilitate continuity of patient care by preventing disruptions to critical pathology services rendered by clinical laboratories, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities, and by reducing healthcare personnel contact and risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIII Scope\n\nThe enforcement policy described in this guidance applies to the following devices (\"digital pathology devices\"), which may be used during the COVID-19 public health emergency, when they are intended for use in remote reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides:\n\nTable 1\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \\hline\nClassification Regulation & Device Type & Product Code3 & Class \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.1860 & Automated Digital Image Manual Interpretation Microscope & OEO & II \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Whole Slide Imaging System & PSY & II \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Digital Pathology Image Viewing and Management & QKQ & II \\  & Software & & \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Digital Pathology Display & PZZ & II \\ \\hline \\end{tabular} Although the digital pathology devices listed above are typically used in clinical laboratories, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities, as further discussed in Section IV below, many of these devices possess the capability for reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides from remote locations.\n\nIV Policy\n\nOverview\n\nIn the context of the COVID-19 public health emergency, expanding the availability of remote digital pathology devices may help facilitate pathology services while reducing healthcare personnel contact and risk of potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) (42 U.S.C. 263a) require that clinical laboratories, including those within hospitals and other healthcare settings, obtain a certificate before accepting materials derived from the human body for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or the impairment of, or assessment of the health of human beings.4 Digital pathology devices have not been cleared for home use or categorized as waived by FDA and as a result, these devices have been limited to use in clinical laboratories, hospitals, and other healthcare settings that are CLIA-certified to perform nonwaived testing. However, in light of the COVID-19 public health emergency, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a memorandum on March 26, 2020, describing its exercise of enforcement discretion to ensure pathologists may review pathology slides and images remotely. The CMS memorandum states that laboratories that choose to utilize temporary testing sites (e.g., for remote review and reporting of slides/images) may do so if certain criteria outlined in the memorandum are met.5\n\nFootnote 4: For more information, see FDA\u2019s guidance \u201cAdministrative Procedures for CLIA Categorization: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\u201d, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/administrative-procedures-clia-categorization.\n\nFootnote 5: See the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Memorandum, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Laboratory Guidance During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, March 26, 2020, https://www.cms.gov/medicareprovider-enrollment-and-certificationsurveycertificationgeninfopolicy-and-memos-states-and/clinical-laboratory-improvement-amendments-clia-laboratory-guidance-during-covid-19-public-health.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \\hline\nClassification Regulation & Device Type & Product Code3 & Class \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.1860 & Automated Digital Image Manual Interpretation Microscope & OEO & II \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Whole Slide Imaging System & PSY & II \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Digital Pathology Image Viewing and Management & QKQ & II \\  & Software & & \\ \\hline\n21 CFR 864.3700 & Digital Pathology Display & PZZ & II \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1:\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn general, manufacturers of the digital pathology devices listed in Table 1 are required to submit a premarket notification under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act and receive FDA clearance prior to marketing these devices in the United States, as well as comply with post-marketing requirements.\n\nFDA recognizes that greater access to remote digital pathology devices may help facilitate the remote reviewing and reporting of pathology slides during this public health emergency which, in turn, may help facilitate continuity of patient care and reduce healthcare personnel contact and risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. For that reason, for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency, FDA does not intend to object to:\n\nmodifications to the FDA-cleared indications, functionality, hardware and/or software, of digital pathology devices identified in Table 1 above to provide for use in a remote setting, or\n\nthe marketing of new digital pathology devices of the types identified in Table 1 that are intended for use in remote settings and that are not currently 510(k) cleared for any use,\n\nwithout compliance with the following regulatory requirements, where such devices do not create an undue risk in light of the public health emergency: submission of a premarket notification under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 807.81,6 Good Manufacturing Practice requirements in 21 CFR Part 820, and Unique Device Identification (UDI) requirements in 21 CFR Part 830 and 21 CFR 801.20.\n\nFootnote 6: For further guidance on modifications that trigger the requirement that a manufacturer submit a new premarket notification (510(k)) to FDA, refer to \u201cDeciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,\u201d https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/deciding-when-submit-510k-change-existing-device.\n\nAdditionally, for remote digital pathology devices subject to this policy, FDA does not intend to enforce compliance with the special controls identified in 21 CFR 864.1860 (which are described in a special controls document for the submission of immunohistochemistry applications to the FDA7) and 21 CFR 864.3700 (83 FR 22), which includes requirements for the content of a premarket notification submission for a whole slide imaging system, where such devices or modifications do not create an undue risk in light of the public health emergency.\n\nFootnote 7: For more information, see \u201cGuidance for Submission of Immunohistochemistry Applications to the Food and Drug Administration,\u201d https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/guidance-documents-medical-devices-and-radiation-emitting-products/guidance-submission-immunohistochemistry-applications-food-and-drug-administration-final-guidance.\n\nFDA believes such devices will not create such an undue risk where the performance and labeling elements in Section 2.2.2 are met.\n\nAppendix B Labeling and Performance\n\nFDA believes such devices will not create such an undue risk when the following circumstances related to the performance of the device and the product labeling, including instructions specific to remote use, are present. FDA encourages firms to discuss any alternatives to these recommendations with FDA (CDRH-COVID19-DigitalPathology/fda.hhs.gov).\n\nFDA recommends that remote digital pathology devices use labeling that helps users better understand the device or device modifications, including instructions specific for remote use, such as:\n\nInstructions for clinical laboratories, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities to help them determine if remote reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides is feasible and appropriate based on an evaluation of their own information technology (IT) infrastructure and remote use environment for individual pathologists. FDA recommends that laboratories and hospitals consider performing a validation study where they deem necessary before remote reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides at a remote location.\n\nInstructions recommending that pathologists using such devices during the COVID-19 public health emergency use their clinical judgment to determine whether the quality of the images from the remote digital pathology devices are sufficient for interpretation of the pathological images.\n\nFDA recommends that manufacturers consider evaluating the performance of the device in accordance with the following FDA recognized standards, including (as applicable):\n\n_Medical Electrical Equipment\n\nPart 1: General Requirements for Basic Safety and Essential Performance_\n\n_Medical Electrical Equipment Part 1-2: General Requirements for Basic Safety and Essential Performance\n\nCollateral Standard: Electromagnetic Disturbances\n\nRequirements and Tests_\n\nAdditionally, while no device-specific performance recommendations are included in this enforcement policy, CLIA regulations and State law (including those related to performance) apply, although some CLIA regulations may be subject to CMS enforcement policies during this public health emergency.8\n\nFootnote 8: See the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Memorandum, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Laboratory Guidance During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, March 26, 2020, https://www.cms.gov/medicareprovider-enrollment-and-cerificationsurveycertificationgeninfopolicy-and-memos-states-and/clinical-laboratory-improvement-amendments-clia-laboratory-guidance-during-covid-19-public-health.\n--------------------\nContext title: Enforcement Policy for Remote Digital Pathology Devices During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry, Clinical Laboratories, Healthcare Facilities, Pathologists, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.4171202182769775", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n--------------------\nContext: (m) The sponsor should ensure that the investigator receives instructions on how to navigate systems, data and relevant metadata for the trial participants under their responsibility.\n\n(n) The sponsor should seek investigator endorsement of their data at predetermined milestones.\n\n(o) The sponsor should document the data management steps to be undertaken prior to data analysis.

In settings in which a sponsor chooses to permit its representatives or other non-DMC members to attend the closed session despite the risks of such arrangements, we recommend that the DMC have the option of conducting an \"executive\" session with no participants other than DMC members.\n\n4.3.1.3 Initial Meeting\n\nScheduling the initial meeting of a DMC before the study is initiated has many advantages. At this meeting, the DMC can discuss the protocol and analytic plan, model informed consent form, data collection instruments and other important trial documents, and present any suggestions for modifications to the sponsor and/or steering committee. Regulatory considerations may also be discussed. Meeting participants typically discuss and complete plans for monitoring the safety and effectiveness data, including:\n\nScheduling of meetings;\n\nFormat for the interim reports to the DMC;\n\nTiming of the delivery of the report to the DMC members prior to the meeting;\n\nDefinition of a \"quorum\" of DMC members, including representation of essential scientific and other disciplines;\n\nHandling of meeting minutes; and\n\nOther aspects of the process.\n\nIt is particularly important that the sponsor and the DMC agree on the data monitoring plan, including the approach to early termination.\n\n4.3.1.4 Format of Interim Reports to the DMC and Use of Treatment Codes\n\nIt is important that the general format and content of interim reports to the DMC be acceptable to the DMC. This may be accomplished most efficiently if the sponsor proposes a template for these reports at its first meeting, so that changes requested by the DMC may be implemented before interim data are first presented. However, the templates may change during the course of the trial as experience is accrued. Further, the DMC will generally need easy and timely access to any additional data and analyses deemed important, and may request such additional material when needed.\n\nWe recommend that a DMC have access to the actual treatment assignments for each study group. Some have argued that DMCs should be provided only coded assignment information that permits the DMC to compare data between study arms, but does not reveal which group received which intervention, thereby protecting against inadvertent release of unblinded interim data and ensuring a greater objectivity of interim review. This approach, however, could lead to problems in balancing risks against potential benefits in some cases. For example, to maintain blinding of the actual treatment assignments, safety outcomes would have to be coded differently from effectiveness outcomes when adverse effects would reveal the assigned intervention. This would prevent the DMC from evaluating the balance of risks and benefits of the active interventions, its most critical responsibility.\n\nAlso, decisions about a trial are often asymmetric with respect to study arms; that is, a DMC may recommend termination of a study with a trend toward showing harm on the basis of data that, were they in the other direction, would not be considered strong enough to terminate early with a conclusion of benefit. Similarly, a trend suggesting a safety concern with a new intervention could be sufficient to suggest the need for trial modification, while a similar trend in the opposite direction (new intervention looks better than standard) might not.\n\nA common approach is presentation of results in printed copy using codes (for example, Group A and Group B) to protect against inadvertent unblinding should a report be misplaced, with separate access to the actual study arm assignments provided to DMC members by the statistical group responsible for preparing DMC reports. To ensure the DMC's and spons's ability to address an emerging safety concern rapidly, they should establish a process to unblind treatment codes to DMC members in a timely fashion when needed (cf. 21 CFR 312.32(d); 21 CFR 812.46(b)(2)). For example, DMC members might routinely receive the unblinded treatment codes in a mailing separate from that containing the interim reports.\n\n4.3.2 Statistical Methods\n\nStatistical approaches to monitoring trials, and the principles involved in their implementation, are addressed in Guidance for Industry, ICH E9, Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials, available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/ICH_E9-fnl.pdf4. Planners of clinical trials most commonly use group sequential methods, in which interim analyses are performed at regular intervals based either on chronological time or amount of information accrued, but other approaches, such as those based on Bayesian methods, have been used as well. Statistical methods are also available to assess stopping for futility; that is, when the likelihood that the treatment effect being sought, based on the interim data, is very unlikely to be established. Other statistical strategies for monitoring may also be appropriate.\n\nFootnote 4: Although ICH documents are meant to provide guidance for drug and biologics sponsors, the statistical monitoring principles in ICH E9 could be used in the evaluation of medical devices as well.\n\nThe sponsor or trial steering committee usually proposes the particular statistical approach to interim monitoring, but the DMC should generally review it before it is made final, to ensure that the DMC agrees to be guided in its actions by the planned approach. FDA will typically request that the sponsor submit a final monitoring plan once it has been put in place, and before the initiation of interim monitoring, as such a plan would typically be considered a critical component of the study protocol (see 21 CFR 312.23(a)(6)(iii)(g); 21 CFR 312.41(a); 21 CFR 812.150(b)(10)). Because statistical approaches based on classical hypothesis testing methods are by far the most common, the remaining discussion in this section will focus on issues within that framework. As noted earlier, other monitoring strategies may also be appropriate.\n\nOne of the major responsibilities of a DMC is to evaluate the relative treatment effects based on protocol-specified endpoints to determine if the trial is meeting its objectives. A major concern when data on group differences are assessed repeatedly as they accumulate is that the Type I error (false positive) rate may be inflated if adjustment is not made for the multiple looks at the data. Typically, the monitoring plan will specify a statistical approach that permits multiple interim reviews while maintaining the Type I error rate at the desired level. These approaches usually generate boundaries for interim estimates of benefit that indicate the magnitude of benefit needed to support stopping the trial at interim points prior to its planned completion, while maintaining the desired overall probability of Type I error. Such boundaries can serve as useful guidelines to the DMC in making recommendations regarding continued accrual to and conduct of the trial. The DMC will usually recommend termination when these thresholds are crossed, but it is not obligated to do so, since other aspects of the interim data may complicate the issue. For example, the data on effectiveness may be very strong, with a stopping boundary having been crossed, but emerging safety concerns may make the benefit-to-risk assessment non-definitive at that interim review. FDA expects the sponsor to direct the DMC to exercise its own judgment in such circumstances; the DMC can be flexible in assessing the data relative to the stopping boundaries. If the DMC recommends early termination for efficacy before a boundary is crossed, however, and this recommendation is implemented, the Type I error cannot be preserved and the study results may be difficult to interpret.\n\nStatistical assessment may also suggest that early termination of a trial be considered on the basis of futility, as defined previously. In this case, a DMC may recommend early termination on the grounds that the trial is unlikely to meet its objectives and there is therefore no basis for continuing enrollment and/or follow-up. Before recommending that a trial be terminated due to futility, a DMC will typically consider the Type II error, the chance of making a false negative conclusion. Stopping on the basis of futility does not raise concerns about Type I error in that trial, since the conclusions of the trial will not be positive. Nevertheless, protection of Type I error may be important even when there is a stated intention to stop early only for futility reasons since interim review of outcome data always raises the possibility that the DMC may find early results so persuasive that it would recommend early termination of the trial.\n\nPotential DMC Responsibilities\n\n4.4.1 Interim Monitoring\n\nMost experience with DMCs has been in the setting of studies that address major outcomes such as mortality or serious irreversible morbidity. Although many such studies focus on short-term endpoints such as 30-day survival, other studies often use endpoints that require a substantial duration of follow-up after the intervention delivery has been completed. The need for monitoring in such studies often extends beyond the time when individuals are treated, since trends in survival or other serious outcomes may not become evident until some time during the follow-up period. Thus, the DMC's responsibility to monitor the study generally continues until the planned completion of follow-up, regardless of the duration of treatment.\n\n4.4.1.1 Monitoring for Effectiveness\n--------------------\nContext title: Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -8.534890174865723", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n--------------------\nContext: Identification of those sponsor employees with a critical \"need-to-know\" and restriction of such information to those individuals only.\n\nEnsuring that individuals with access to the information avoid any subsequent role in the management of the trial and minimize interactions with others in that role.\n\nEnsuring that individuals who have access to such information make every effort to avoid taking actions that will assist others in inferring what the information is.\n\nEnsuring that reports of study findings describe any access to interim data by individuals involved with study management, and steps taken to prevent such access from potentially biasing the study results.\n\n7 Sponsor Interaction with FDA Regarding Use and Operation of DMCs\n\nThere are many situations, several mentioned earlier, in which sponsor consultation with FDA on matters regarding a DMC is advisable.\n\nPlanning the DMC\n\nIn planning a clinical trial, a sponsor makes several decisions regarding use, types of membership, and operations of a DMC. Many of these can be critical to the success of the trial in meeting regulatory requirements. This guidance document is intended to provide general FDA guidance regarding those decisions, but each set of circumstances can raise unique considerations. Issues regarding use of DMCs are appropriate topics for FDA-sponsor meetings (in person or by telephone) at the sponsor's request.\n\nAccessing Interim Data\n\nAs discussed above, accessing interim data by the sponsor carries many risks, not all of which may be fully appreciated by the sponsor. We recommend that sponsors contact FDA before initiating communication with the DMC regarding access to interim data from a trial likely to be an important part of a regulatory submission. While FDA permission is not required, a discussion regarding the potential risks and implications of that action and of methods to limit the risks may contribute to informed decision making.\n\n7.2.1 DMC Recommendations to Terminate the Study\n\nIn almost all cases, a DMC is advisory to the sponsor; the sponsor decides whether to accept recommendations to discontinue a trial. FDA will rarely, if ever, tell a sponsor which decision to make. For trials that may be terminated early because a substantial benefit has been observed, however, consideration may still need to be given to the adequacy of data with regard to other issues such as safety, duration of benefit, outcomes in important subgroups and important secondary endpoints. We recommend that sponsors of trials that could potentially be terminated early for efficacy reasons discuss these issues with FDA prior to implementing the trial, when the statistical monitoring plan and early stopping boundaries are being developed. In these settings, consultation with FDA may provide the sponsor with important information regarding the regulatory and scientific implications of a decision and may lead to better decisions. Sponsors are encouraged to revisit these issues with FDA when considering DMC recommendations for early termination if new issues have arisen and/or if the regulatory implications of early termination were not adequately clarified at the outset of the trial.\n\nFor trials that may be terminated because of safety concerns, timely communication with FDA is often required (see, e.g., 21 CFR 312.56(d) (drugs); 21 CFR 812.150 (devices)). In such cases, we recommend that the sponsor initiate discussion as soon as possible about the appropriate course of action, for the trial in question as well as any other use of the investigational product.\n\nWe strongly recommend that sponsors initiate discussion with FDA prior to early termination of any trial implemented specifically to investigate a potential safety concern.\n\n7.2.2 FDA Interaction with DMCs\n\nIn rare cases, we may wish to interact with a DMC of an ongoing trial to ensure that specific issues of urgent concern to FDA are fully considered by the DMC or to address questions to the DMC regarding the consistency of the safety data in the ongoing trial to that in the earlier trials, to optimize regulatory decision-making. An example might be a situation in which FDA is considering a marketing application in which a safety issue is of some concern, and the sponsor has a second trial of the investigational agent ongoing. In such a situation, we might wish to be sure that the DMC for the ongoing trial is aware of the existing safety data contained in the application and is taking those data into consideration in evaluating the interim safety data from the ongoing trial. In such a case, we could request that the sponsor arrange for FDA to communicate with, or even meet with, the DMC (see 21 CFR 312.41(a); 21 CFR 812.150(b)(10)), and care should be taken to minimize the possibility of jeopardizing the integrity of the ongoing trial.\n\nDMC Recommendations for Protocol Changes\n\nA DMC may, in some instances, recommend changes to the study protocol, particularly in the context of their responsibilities for monitoring patient safety. Many protocol changes have little impact on the usefulness of a trial to gain regulatory approval. Certain types of changes to the protocol, however, such as changes in the primary endpoints, could have substantial impact on the validity of the trial and/or its ability to support the desired regulatory decision if they potentially could have been motivated by the interim data. We recommend that sponsors discuss proposed changes of the latter type with FDA before implementation.\n\n8 Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n\nThis guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).\n\nThe time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average 11.75 hours per response, including the time to review instructions, search existing data resources, gather the data needed, and complete and review the information collection.

A table is provided as an Annex of this document showing the link between each Q&A and the relevant Sections of ICH Q7 and other ICH Quality guidance.\n\nICH would like to acknowledge the work undertaken by the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S). PIC/S contributed to this document by selecting and reviewing relevant Q&As that had been collected from training sessions since the implementation of Q7 and transferred the output of these reviews to the ICH Q7 IWG for consideration and consolidation, as appropriate. Additional questions were developed based on responses from an ICH survey. PIC/S further contributed to the development of the document as an ICH Interested Party.\n\nPlease note that ICH Q7 should be applied in combination with the principles laid down for development and manufacturing in ICH Q11 (see definition of API starting material; see also ICH Q8(R2) Part II), Quality Risk Management (ICH Q9), and Pharmaceutical Quality Systems (ICH Q10). GMP principles as described in ICH Q7 should be applied regardless which approach is taken in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing.\n\nICH Q7 also describes principles of GMPs to be applied in the manufacture of APIs for use in clinical trials (Section 19) and for APIs manufactured by cell culture/fermentation (Section 18).\n\nDated: 10 June 2015\n\n1 INTRODUCTION - SCOPE\n\n1.2 & June 2015 & Does ICH Q7 apply to manufacturing Steps for the addition of substance(s) to an API (e.g., to stabilise the API)? & When a mixture is classified in the regulatory filing as an API in a region or country in which it is used in a drug product, ICH Q7 should be applied to the manufacturing of these mixtures [ICH Q7, Section 1.2, 20 - see Glossary for definition of 'API'].\n\n2 QUALITY MANAGEMENT\n\n3.

However, experience gained with the implementation of ICH Q7 since the approval in November 2000 shows that uncertainties related to the interpretation of some sections exist. Furthermore, the importance of the application of the life-cycle approach addressed in the new ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, Q10 Guidelines to API manufacturing procedures is emphasized by the ICH Quality Implementation Working Group (Quality IWG). Technical issues with regard to GMP of APIs - also in context with new ICH Guidelines - need to be addressed in order to harmonize expectations during inspections.\n\nA document would be helpful in removing these ambiguities and uncertainties and also in harmonizing the inspections of both small molecules and biotech APIs.\n\nIssues to be resolved\n\nThe following issues have so far been identified by practical experience and will need to be addressed in a Q&A document on Q7:\n\nOutput from the review of existing Q&As (e.g., from PIC/S Expert Circle on APIs, from initial Regulatory/PDA training 2002) currently underway by PIC/S teams will be considered for endorsement.\n\nTechnical issues for clarification such as application in the supply chain control, contractor/supplier management (outsourcing), monitoring of impurity profiles, quality systems, applicability to biologicals/biotech and relationship with Q5D, and GMP expectations in the development phase (manufacturing for clinical trials).\n\nImpact of the implementation of ICH Q8/Q11, Q9, and Q10 on Q7 (see also Quality IWG Q&As and Points to Consider).\n\nBackground to the Proposal\n\nIt has become apparent, based on the approval and implementation of ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11 principles into GMP of APIs that certain individual implementation approaches are leading to non harmonized interpretation and new expectations beyond the intention of ICH Q7. The Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme (PIC/S) launched the 'International Collaboration on APIs - Training programme on ICH Q7'. This training programme includes a basic training, an advanced training and a Q&A document on interpretation of ICH Q7. This provides a feedback by the global knowledge of its network of inspectors. PIC/S will be supportive of the Q7 IWG work.\n\nType of Implementation Working Group and Resources\n\nThe Q7 IWG should comprise of the Six ICH Parties (2 experts per Party), Observers to ICH (1 expert per Observer), RHIs, DRAs and DoH (1 expert per RHI/DRA/DoH), and Interested Parties (WSNI, IGPA, Biotechnology Industry, PIC/S, API Industry and CEP programme of EDQM, 1 expert per Interested Party).\n\nTiming\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Q&As Concept Paper\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.5412211418151855", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , How should the ICH Q7 document be read?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:1]\n\nBackground and Objectives\n\nDevelopment process\n\nScope/ Content\n\nRegulatory implementation\n\nKey message\n\nSummary\n\nFirst internationally harmonized Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidance developed jointly by industry and regulators under the ICH umbrella\n\nFinalized November 2000 and adopted by most major Health Authorities including WHO\n\nEstablishes one global GMP guideline for Active Pharmaceuticals Ingredients (APIs)\n\nIntended to facilitate API inspections\n\nImportant to international cooperative regulation of API manufacturing* ICH Q7 was published in 2000\n\nAPI manufacturing technology and practices have evolved since then\n\nGood Distribution Practice (GDP) for API was included in ICH Q7\n\nAPI supply chains are global and complex\n\nCurrently, many different health authorities regulate and/or inspect API manufacturers\n\nRegulators continue to find significant GMP deficiencies during API inspections\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]\n\n*Questions were obtained from various sources\n\nIncluding existing Q&As from the PIC/S API Expert Circle, PDA/ Regulatory training 2002\n\nSurvey of constituencies for issues needing clarification conducted by the ICH Q7 IWG Feb.- Mar. 2013\n\nIWG** * Evaluated about 200 questions and suggested answers * Consolidated, drafted, revised Q&As as needed * 5 face-to-face meetings and several regional and worldwide teleconferences * Consensus on 55 Q&As achieved on April 20, 2015\n\nThe Step 4 ICH harmonised document was posted to ICH website (www.ich.org) on 10 June 2015\n\nQuestions cover all sections of ICH Q7 except Section 9 (Packaging and Identification Labelling of APIs/ Intermediates)\n\nICH Q7 sections with the most Q&As were: Quality Management Materials Management Process Equipment Laboratory Controls\n\nQ&As include references to other ICH guidelines, including to Q8, Q9, Q10 and Q11 which were established after Q7 was finalised in 2000.\n\n2.

Based on accepted industry practice at the time ICH Q7 was written, it was not anticipated that a manufacturer would set a retest date longer than 3 years. It is a basic GMP principle that reserve samples be retained for the entire period the material is available on the market. For example, if a company sets a retest date of 5 years and the API is completely distributed immediately after manufacturing, it is not intended that the reserve sample be destroyed before the 5-year retest date is reached.\n\nWhy does ICH Q7 permit the use of a packaging system for reserve/retention samples that is \"more protective than the marketed packaging system\" (ICH Q7, paragraph 11.72)?\n\nUnlike stability samples, the purpose of the reserve/retention sample is not to represent the quality of the batch in the market place but to allow future evaluation of the quality of the original API batch (e.g., in evaluation of potential counterfeits). Therefore, reserve/retention samples may be stored in packaging (and conditions) that better preserve the original state of the API.\n\nValidation (12)\n\nIs the lifecycle approach to process validation acceptable for APIs under ICH Q7?\n\nYes, ICH Q7 does not preclude the lifecycle approach (ICH Q7, paragraph 12.10; ICH Q10; ICH Q11).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCan the range of a process parameter be expanded based only on a process deviation(s)?\n\nNo. However, information from the investigation into a process deviation(s) can be used to support expanding the range of a process parameter. Additional work and studies are normally needed to adequately demonstrate that the expanded range for the process parameter consistently produces API of the necessary quality (ICH Q7, paragraphs 2.16, 12.11, 13.13).\n\nWould additional process validation studies be needed to support a change in the source of an API starting material?\n\nAny change in the API starting material should be assessed for impact on the API manufacturing process and the resulting API quality (ICH Q7, paragraph 7.14). Additional validation studies of the API process may be warranted if the change in the API starting material is deemed significant. In most cases, validation would be expected for a different source of the starting material unless otherwise justified (ICH Q7, paragraphs 12.1, 13.13).\n\nIs a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n\nProspective validation is normally expected for processes introduced since the publication of ICH Q7. The concept of retrospective validation remains acceptable as an exception for existing, well-established products prior to the implementation of ICH Q7 (ICH Q7, paragraph 12.44).\n\nIf regulatory discussions redefine a step as critical, which had previously been considered noncritical, a protocol describing retrospective analysis of data together with the commitment for concurrent or prospective validation may be an option.\n\nRegardless of the type of validation, the quality system should confirm the ongoing robustness of the process (e.g., product quality review).\n\nChange Control (13)\n\nWho is responsible for notifying the drug product manufacturer about relevant changes in API manufacturing?\n\nEach party in the supply chain is responsible for transferring information related to quality or regulatory changes to the next customer in the supply chain. The intention is that the information is transferred along the supply chain to the drug product manufacturer in a timely manner (ICH Q7, paragraphs 13.17, 17.60).\n\nRejection and Reuse of Materials (14)\n\nShould rejected materials be stored under physical and secure segregation? ICH Q7 does not specify a need for physical and secure segregation. Both paragraphs 4.14 and 10.11 of ICH Q7 include the provision for the use of alternative control systems for storage of rejected material. Whatever control system is used, the purpose should be to prevent the unintentional or unauthorized use of the rejected material (ICH Q7, paragraphs 7.44, 10.11, section XIV.A (14.1)).\n\nDoes the definition of expiry date in ICH Q7 preclude the rework or reprocess of an expired API? According to the definition, material should not be used after the expiry date. The original intent of this definition in ICH Q7 was that expired API should not be used in drug product formulation. It may be acceptable to reprocess (ICH Q7, section XIV.B (14.2)) or rework (ICH Q7, section XIV.C (14.3)) the expired API where the API manufacturer has all related historical GMP documentation and additional stability data on the reworked or reprocessed API. There may be registration/filing considerations that are beyond the scope of ICH Q7 in addition to the GMP considerations.\n\nIs validation expected for the recovery of material from mother liquor? It depends. Recovery of material(s) from mother liquor is a process, and the need for validation should be assessed as for any other process step (ICH Q7, paragraph 14.40). Recovery of material from mother liquor in any process step that must be controlled within predetermined criteria to ensure the API meets its specification is, by definition, a critical process step and should be validated. For example, recovery of API from mother liquor would be considered a critical process step and should be validated (ICH Q7, paragraphs 12.11, 12.12, 14.41, 14.43 -- see Glossary (section 20) for definitions of critical, materials, mother liquor, and validation).\n\nComplaints and Recalls (15)\n\nCan quality defects of released APIs that are identified by another entity belonging to the same company be handled outside of the API manufacturer's complaint procedure? Yes. After the release of an API for further use, any identified quality defect should be investigated and addressed according to the API manufacturer's complaint system or equivalent (i.e., nonconformance, deviations, etc.) (ICH Q7, paragraphs 15.10 to 15.12). Where equivalent systems are used, such defects should be categorized in a manner that provides clear visibility that the defect was discovered after being released by the API site.\n\nMust a quality related return, at the request of the API manufacturing site, from another site within the same company be recorded as a \"recall\"? No, provided that no portion of the batch left direct control of the company for sale or use. The return must be clearly visible in the API site's quality system as a return triggered by the API manufacturing site so this fact is clear in quality system trend reporting and in the product quality review (ICH Q7, paragraphs 2.50, 15.13, 15.14).\n\nContract Manufacturers (Including Laboratories) (16)\n\nDoes ICH Q7 preclude a contract manufacturer's independent quality unit from performing the main responsibilities as described in ICH Q7, paragraph 2.22? No. The original intent of section II.B (2.2) was to distinguish the main responsibilities (e.g., batch record review, review of nonconformances and investigations, sampling, testing, release or rejection of intermediate or API) of the independent quality unit from other departments within a company. Contract manufacturers are expected to have an independent quality unit that meets the responsibilities defined in ICH Q7, section II.B (2.2) for all activities performed. Given the potential complexity of outsourcing contract manufacturing arrangements, GMP responsibilities should be clearly defined between both parties in detail in a written agreement (ICH Q7, paragraph 16.12). However, the overall responsibility for API quality must not be delegated.6 Footnote 6: See 21 U.S.C. 351 (\u201cthe term \u2018current good manufacturing practice\u2019 includes the implementation of oversight and controls over the manufacturer of drugs to ensure quality, including managing the risk of and establishing the safety of raw materials, materials used in the manufacturing of drugs, and finished drug products.\u201d).\n\nWhich outsourced activities are covered by ICH Q7? In the context of ICH Q7, contract manufacturing is the outsourced activity. The term outsourced activities, as defined and described in ICH Q10, section III.G (2.7) and Glossary (section VI (5)), aligns with the description of contract manufacturer in ICH Q7, section XVI (16). ICH Q7 defines manufacture as \"all operations of receipt of materials, production, packaging, repackaging, labeling, relabeling, quality control, release, storage, and distribution of APIs and related controls.\"\"Related controls\" include any activities or services necessary to support production (e.g., maintenance, calibration). ICH Q7 applies to any activities performed by the original manufacturer or the company that is performing the activity on behalf of the original manufacturer.\n\n16.3: What is meant by \"where subcontracting is allowed\" (ICH Q7, paragraph 16.14)?\n\nSubcontracting as used in ICH Q7, paragraph 16.14 refers to the contract acceptor further contracting out a specific activity to another party (third party). This should only be done when the written and approved contract, as described in ICH Q7, paragraph 16.12, specifically allows for such subcontracting. Even when subcontracting is allowed, the original contract given should approve specific subcontracting before it occurs as stated in ICH Q7, paragraph 16.14.\n\nQ.: Agents, Brokers, Traders, Distributors, Repackers, and Relabelers (17)\n\n17.1: What does ICH Q7 mean by \"agents, brokers, traders, distributors, repackers, or relabelers\"?\n\nRegardless of what terms are used in different regions, ICH Q7 applies to all parties in the supply chain after the original API/intermediate manufacturer to the drug product manufacturer, in order to maintain the integrity, traceability, and transparency of the supply chain (ICH Q7, section XVII.A (17.1)).\n\n17.2: Could a distributor of an API engage a contract manufacturer for production steps?\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.335269570350647", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , How should the ICH Q7 document be read?\n--------------------\nContext: ICH Q7 does not apply to steps prior to the introduction of the API starting material. However, there is an expectation that an appropriate level of controls suitable for the production of the API starting material should be applied (ICH Q7, section I.C (1.3)). Normally, the API-starting material is defined in the regulatory filing by the applicant and approved in the regulatory reviewing process. Additional guidance is provided to define and justify API starting material derived from various sources (ICH Q11, section V (5)); for master cell banks, see ICH Q5B, ICH Q5D.\n\nDoes ICH Q7 apply to manufacturing steps for the addition of substance(s) to an API (e.g., to stabilize the API)?When a mixture is classified in the regulatory filing as an API in a region or country in which it is used in a drug product, ICH Q7 should be applied to the manufacturing of the mixture (ICH Q7, section I.B (1.2), Glossary (20) -- see Glossary for definition of _API).\n\nQuality Management (2)\n\nWhat is meant by \"quality unit(s) independent from production\"?\n\nThe intent of the term independent is to prevent any conflict of interest and ensure unbiased decision-making regarding quality-related decisions in the organization structure. The person in the quality unit who is responsible for final decision-making (e.g., batch release decision) should not have responsibilities for production activities (ICH Q7, paragraph 2.13)4.\n\nFootnote 4: Arabic numbers preceded by the word \u201cparagraph\u201d reflect specific paragraph numbers in ICH Q7.\n\nDoes ICH Q7 expect that the quality unit performs API release testing?\n\nWhile the quality unit has responsibility for the release of the API, which includes oversight of the testing and results, ICH Q7 does not prescribe specifically who performs testing. The term quality control in the ICH Q7 Glossary (section 20) refers to the activities, not the organizational structure.\n\nFor examples of quality responsibility related to testing and release, refer to ICH Q7, paragraphs 2.13, 2.22, and 11.12. Appropriate laboratory controls should be followed (ICH Q7, paragraphs 11.10, 16.10) regardless of who performs the testing.\n\nCan other departments outside of the quality unit be held responsible for releasing raw materials and intermediates?\n\nYes. The quality unit is responsible for establishing a system to release or reject raw materials, intermediates, packaging, and labeling materials. This responsibility cannot be delegated (ICH Q7, paragraph 2.22(2)). The system established by the quality unit may allow other departments to release raw materials and intermediates (except intermediates that are for use outside the control of the manufacturer (ICH Q7, paragraph 2.22(1)) as long as oversight and the overall responsibility of this system remains with the quality unit.\n\nDoes ICH Q7 expect that sampling be performed by the quality unit?\n\nNo. ICH Q7 does not prescribe specifically who should perform the sampling (ICH Q7, paragraph 2.22). However, the quality unit has responsibility for reviewing and approving sampling plans (ICH Q7, paragraph 11.12) and procedures. Sampling should be performed by adequately trained personnel (ICH Q7, paragraph 3.10) and be appropriately documented per ICH Q7, paragraph 6.52.\n\nWhat should be the frequency of a product quality review?\n\nA product quality review is generally expected annually. Review time frames can be appropriately adjusted based upon manufacturing and campaign duration with adequate justification. Even if no manufacturing has occurred in the review period, the quality review should be conducted per section ICH Q7, paragraph 2.50, and include stability, returns, complaints, and recalls.\n\nFor example, a product quality review may encompass more or less than 12 months depending upon product campaign duration (ICH Q7, paragraph 2.50; ICH Q10, section III.F (2.6)).\n\nShould the product quality review of results include trend analysis?\n\nTrend analysis is usually an important element in verifying the consistency of the process as part of the product quality review (ICH Q7, paragraphs 2.50, 2.51). Potential tools to use are described in ICH Q9, Annex I.9.\n\nPersonnel (3)\n\nWhat is the intent of the statement in ICH Q7, paragraph 3.12 \"training should be periodically assessed\"?\n\nIn ICH Q7, paragraph 3.12, the statement \"training should be periodically assessed\" refers to a system to evaluate if personnel remain proficient and competent in their job tasks and responsibilities, whether more frequent, additional, or new training is needed, and if recurring training is up to date.\n\nDoes ICH Q7 expect the use of a consultant, and can a company delegate tasks and/or responsibility to a consultant?\n\nICH Q7 does not expect the use of a consultant. Consultants may perform delegated tasks and/or provide advice. However, the ultimate responsibility for API quality must not be delegated (ICH Q10, section III.G (2.7); ICH Q7, sections II.B (2.2), III.C (3.3)).5\n\nFootnote 5: See 21 U.S.C. 351 (\u201cthe term \u2018current good manufacturing practice\u2019 includes the implementation of oversight and controls over the manufacturer of drugs to ensure quality,....\u201d).\n\nAppendix D Buildings and Facilities -- Containment (4)\n\nICH Q7 expects dedicated production areas for highly sensitizing materials such as penicillins and cephalosporions because of the patient risk (e.g., anaphylactic shock to penicillin-allergic patients) from trace amounts of these compounds in other medicines (ICH Q7, paragraph 4.40).\n\nFor materials of an infectious nature or high pharmacological activity or toxicity, a risk-based approach should be used to determine appropriate containment measures, which may include validated inactivation, cleaning, and/or dedicated production areas (ICH Q7, paragraph 4.41).\n\nWhile ICH Q7 does not define high pharmacological activity or toxicity, these characteristics are generally determined by evaluating relevant animal and human data collected during research and development. Important considerations in this evaluation of pharmacological activity or toxicity may include occupational exposure limit (OEL), permitted daily exposure (PDE), acceptable daily exposure (ADE), threshold for toxicological concerns (TTC), no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) (ICH safety guidances; ICH E2E, section II.A.1 (2.1.1)), and the consequences of cross- contamination (ICH Q9, section IV.C (4.3)).\n\nTo what extent can quality risk management be used in establishing appropriate containment measures to prevent cross-contamination?\n\nThe principles of quality risk management (ICH Q9, Anne II.4 should be applied to the design of buildings, facilities, and controls for the purpose of containment, taking into consideration the pharmacological/toxicological/chemical/biological properties of the raw material, intermediate, and/or API to be handled or manufactured.\n\nAppropriate containment measures and controls (ICH Q7, paragraph 4.42) include but are not limited to the following:\n\nTechnical controls (e.g., dedicated production areas; closed/dedicated heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system; closed manufacturing systems; use of disposable technologies; design of facility and equipment for containment and ease of cleaning); and\n\nProcedural (organizational) controls (e.g., cleaning, personnel flow, environmental monitoring, and training).\n\nMonitoring systems are important to check the effectiveness of the containment controls.\n\nProcess Equipment -- Cleaning (5)\n\nFor dedicated equipment, is \"visually clean\" acceptable for verification of cleaning effectiveness, (i.e., no expectation for specific analytical determination)?\n\n\"Visually clean\" may be acceptable for dedicated equipment based on the ability to visually inspect and sufficient supporting data from cleaning studies (e.g., analytical determination to demonstrate cleaning effectiveness) (ICH Q7, paragraph 12.76). Equipment should be cleaned at appropriate intervals (e.g., time or number of batches) to prevent build-up and carryover of contaminants (e.g., degradants or objectionable levels of microorganisms) so that they do not adversely alter the quality of the API (ICH Q7, paragraph 5.23, section XII.G (12.7)).\n\nShould acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n\nYes. Regardless of whether equipment is dedicated or not, it is expected that acceptance criteria for residues be defined and that the equipment be cleaned at appropriate intervals to prevent build-up and carry-over of contaminants. Intervals can be based on number of batches, product change-over, time, etc. (ICH Q7, paragraphs 5.22, 5.23, 5.24, 5.25, 8.50).\n\nCleaning intervals and acceptance criteria should be established based on an understanding of the process/reactions/degradation, taking into account solubility, potency, toxicity, etc. Establishment of acceptance criteria does not necessarily imply sampling and testing after every cleaning. Visual inspection of equipment for cleanliness is an expectation of ICH Q7, paragraph 5.21. Where validation data has confirmed effective cleaning, cleaning procedures should be monitored at appropriate intervals (ICH Q7, paragraph 12.76).\n\nIs it expected that equipment cleaning time limits be confirmed in cleaning validation?\n\nYes. Equipment cleaning is addressed in two sections in ICH Q7. Although the cleaning validation (ICH Q7, section XII.G (12.7)) does not specifically address time limits for cleaning, ICH Q7, paragraph 5.21, indicates that the maximum time between completion of processing and equipment cleaning (dirty hold time) should be established by the company. This maximum established dirty hold time is the time period for which evidence is available to demonstrate that the equipment can still be reliably cleaned. This maximum established dirty hold time is confirmed during the initial cleaning validation and can be extended with appropriate supporting data.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.10914166271686554", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , How should the ICH Q7 document be read?\n--------------------\nContext: For all starting materials, applicants should set appropriate controls and be able to justify the proposed specifications.\n\nCan the Life cycle Management section of ICH Q11 (section 9) apply to starting materials?

In addition to what is submitted in the application, changes upstream of the defined starting material should be managed under the applicant's Pharmaceutical Quality System (PQS), which should address residual risks to the drug substance quality.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe Lifecycle Management section of ICH Q11 reinforces management's responsibility described in Pharmaceutical Quality Systems (ICH Q10), which is applicable to starting material lifecycle management. ICH Q10 section 2.7 (Management of Outsourced Activities and Purchased Materials) recommends that\n\nThe pharmaceutical quality system, including the management responsibilities described in this section, extends to the control and review of any outsourced activities and quality of purchased materials. The pharmaceutical company is ultimately responsible to ensure processes are in place to assure the control of outsourced activities and quality of purchased materials.\n\nICH Q7 sections 7 (Materials Management) and 13 (Change Control), ICH Q7 Q&A document sections 7 and 13, as well as ICH Q10 section 2.7 (Management of Outsourced Activities and Purchased Materials) provide guidance that can be applied to the management of starting materials and starting material suppliers.\n\nICH Q9 and its Annexes provide guidance on the use of principles for quality risk management which can be applied to changes related to the starting materials (e.g., new starting material suppliers, manufacturing processes, or specifications).\n\nQ16. Does ICH Q11 include specific guidance for post-approval changes to steps upstream of the starting material (e.g., changes in synthetic route, reagents, solvents, starting material supplier)? (5.16)\n\nNo. Post-approval changes to steps upstream of starting materials are not explicitly covered in ICH Q11. However, ICH Q11 does describe fundamental science and risk-based concepts that should be used to evaluate the impact of post-approval changes to the process after the starting material (ICH Q11 section 9 - Lifecycle Management), and these same concepts should be applied to evaluate the impact of changes upstream of the starting material.\n\nFor example, changes upstream of the starting material should be evaluated for their impact on the starting material (e.g., on current and potential new impurities, including potentially mutagenic and elemental impurities) and, when appropriate, on the drug substance. The evaluation could be based on risk assessment and scientific understanding of the proposed change and its proximity to the starting material. The evaluation should include an assessment of the control strategy (e.g., adequacy of the specification for the starting material, including the ability of the analytical procedures to detect any new impurities).\n\nAs stated in ICH Q7 Q&A document section 13.1, each party in the supply chain is responsible for transferring information related to quality or regulatory changes to the next customer in the supply chain so that the information is transferred to the drug product manufacturer in a timely manner.\n\nPost-approval changes to information on the starting material should be reported to regulatory authorities in accordance with regional regulations and guidances.\n\nVI Control Strategy (6)\n\nThere was no Q&A drafted on this section.\n\nVII Process Validation/Evaluation (7)\n\nThere was no Q&A drafted on this section.\n\nVIII Submission of Manufacturing Process Development and Related Information in the Common Technical Document (CTD) Format (8)\n\nThere was no Q&A drafted on this section.\n\nIX Lifecycle Management (9)\n\nThere was no Q&A drafted on this section.\n\nX Illustrative Examples (10)\n\nThere was no Q&A drafted on this section.\n\nXI Glossary (11)\n\nThere was no Q&A drafted on this section.\n\nANNEX 1 - Decision Tree\n\nThis decision tree serves as a pictorial exemplification to apply all ICH Q11 general principles for the selection and justification of a starting material (SM).

It does not create any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist institutional review boards (IRBs), clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA's informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. This guidance supersedes FDA's guidance entitled \"A Guide to Informed Consent,\" issued in September 1998, and finalizes FDA's draft guidance entitled \"Informed Consent Information Sheet,\" issued in July 2014. This document is structured to first present general guidance on FDA's regulatory requirements for informed consent and a discussion of the roles of IRBs, clinical investigators, sponsors, and FDA related to informed consent, followed by a series of frequently asked questions.\n\nIn a final rule published on January 19, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal departments and agencies revised the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects. The final rule became effective in 2018 (codified for HHS at 45 CFR 46, subpart A; \"the 2018 Common Rule\").2,3 The 2018 Common Rule sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by federal departments or agencies that have adopted the Common Rule. The revisions include significant changes to the provisions regarding informed consent. FDA is currently engaged in notice and comment rulemaking to harmonize its human subject protection\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nof the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Summary of the Consent process\n\nTo many, the term informed consent is mistakenly viewed as synonymous with obtaining a subject's signature on the consent form;9 however, obtaining documentation of a subject's informed consent is only part of the consent process. Informed consent involves providing a prospective subject, or their legally authorized representative (LAR), with adequate information to allow for an informed decision about participation in the clinical investigation prior to enrollment. Informed consent also involves facilitating the prospective subject's understanding of the information, providing adequate opportunity for the prospective subject to ask questions and to consider whether to participate, obtaining the prospective subject's voluntary agreement to participate prior to enrollment, and continuing to provide information as the clinical investigation progresses or as the enrolled subject or situation requires.10\n\nFootnote 9: In this guidance document, the terms informed consent form and informed consent document are used interchangeably.\n\nExcept as provided in 21 CFR 50.23 and 50.24,11 (see section III.A.1, \"Exceptions to Informed Consent\"), no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in FDA-regulated research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's LAR (21CFR 50.20).12 To be legally effective, the informed consent process must satisfy the general requirements under 21 CFR 50.20 and include the relevant elements of informed consent described at 21 CFR 50.25 (see section3), \"FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\").\n\nFootnote 12: As described in guidance, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances, with respect to its current regulations governing the requirement for informed consent when human specimens are used for FDA-regulated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device investigations. See \u201cGuidance on Informed Consent for in Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable: Guidance for Sponsors, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\u201d, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-informed- Consent-vitro-diagnostic-device-studies-using-leftover-human-specimens-are-not\n\nFDA considers advertising used to recruit subjects into the clinical trial to be the start of the ongoing consent process, and the information provided in any online or hard copy recruitment materials should be consistent with the informed consent document. Generally, FDA recommends that any advertisement to recruit subjects be limited to the information the prospective subjects need to determine their interest and potential eligibility. The FDA information sheet \"Recruiting Study Subjects\" includes information regarding scripts for those who will interface with subjects to determine basic eligibility.13\n\nFootnote 13: See the FDA Information Sheet \u201cRecruiting Study Subjects,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects, for further information.\n\nOnce a prospective subject is identified, and before research activities requiring prior consent occur, a person knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and capable of answering questions raised by the prospective subject should conduct a consent discussion. The consent discussion and the consent form must contain information to allow prospective subjects to make an informed decision about participation in a clinical investigation and provide an opportunity for prospective subjects to ask questions about the clinical investigation and the information in the consent document (see section3), \"FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\") (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25).14 The consent form serves several purposes, including helping to ensure that prospective subjects receive the required information, providing a \"take home\" reminder of the elements of the clinical investigation, providing contact information in case additional questions or concerns arise, and documenting prospective subjects' voluntary agreement to participate as well as the date of their agreement.\n\nFootnote 14: The regulations allow use of a \u201cshort form\u201d consent form when the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For a discussion of the short form written consent, see section3.5.4.2, \u201cShort Form.\u201d\n\nThe informed consent process is an ongoing exchange of information throughout a subject's participation in a clinical trial and does not end after the consent form is signed. For example, if new safety information or protocol changes occur during the conduct of the study, additional information may need to be given to the subject, and/or the subject may need additional opportunities to ask questions and receive answers throughout the clinical investigation (see sectionIII.3.5, \"Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects,\" and Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nIII FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b \"Short Form\" for more details). If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For \"applicable clinical trials\" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, \u201cElement of Informed Consent for \u2018Applicable Clinical Trials.\u201d\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.652435779571533", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 64: See section IV.A.4 for guidance regarding identification of the most up-to-date version of the informed consent form.\n\niv.2.4 Identification of Revised Consent Forms\n\nThe IRB should ensure that there is a way to identify a revised consent form so that continued use of a previously approved version does not occur. While not required by FDA regulations, the use of date stamps is one possible mechanism for ensuring use of the most recently approved version of the consent form.\n\nThe Clinical Investigator\n\nThe clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects during a clinical investigation, and for ensuring that, unless an exception applies, legally effective informed consent is obtained from each subject or the subject's LAR before that subject takes part in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.20(a), 312.60, and 812.100). Legally effective informed consent includes meeting all applicable Federal, State, and local laws that require additional information in the informed consent form beyond what FDA regulations require. Sponsors and investigators may wish to seek legal guidance regarding specific local consent requirements applicable to their research.\n\nThe clinical investigator should notify the IRB regarding the consent process, including who (e.g., the investigator or another study team member) will conduct the consent discussion. Any information that will be given to subjects to review and discuss as part of informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)). An investigator may not begin the informed consent process with prospective subjects until the IRB reviews and approves the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process (21 CFR 50.20, 50.27, and 56.109).\n\nThe clinical investigator's institution may have standard language or a standard format for consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation). FDA recognizes that investigators may also need to identify and meet institutional requirements and incorporate them into the consent form for the IRB's initial review of the clinical investigation.\n\nDuring the clinical investigation, the investigator may need to revise the consent form to address new information that might arise during the conduct of the trial, such as a change to the protocol or new safety information. The investigator will need to obtain IRB review and approval of the revised consent form (21 CFR 50.27 and 56.109). In addition, because the consent form is being modified to reflect new information that might affect the willingness of already enrolled and actively participating subjects to continue in the clinical investigation, the IRB should determine the need to inform the previously enrolled subjects of the new information and determine their willingness to continue in the research (see\n\nFrequently Asked Questions #16).\n\nAny new information that is part of the consent process must be reviewed and approved by the IRB as a change in approved research before it is initiated, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject (see 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)). In the rare event that urgent safety information is provided to the subject prior to IRB approval, the IRB should promptly be notified of both the safety issue and the notification of subjects.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the clinical investigator:\n\niv.2.1 Delegation of Consent Discussion\n\nFDA regulations require that the investigator obtain the legally effective informed consent of subjects (21 CFR 50.20, 312.60 and 812.100). If the investigator delegates this responsibility, FDA expects that the individual to whom the responsibility is delegated be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform this activity. The individual obtaining informed consent should be knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and have the appropriate training and credentials to be able to address any questions or concerns the subject may have about the study and/or alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject. The investigator should have a detailed plan for the supervision and training of staff, and oversight of the clinical investigation, including the informed consent process.65 Even when a task is delegated to another individual, the investigator remains responsible for ensuring that legally effective informed consent is obtained for all subjects in accordance with 21 CFR part 50.\n\niv.2.2 Financial Relationships and Interests\n\nThe clinical investigator should consider whether information related to financial relationships or interests should be provided to subjects.66 Clinical investigators should consider the potential effects that a financial relationship might have on the clinical investigation or on interactions with subjects. When there are financial relationships or interests, clinical investigators should consider the following actions:\n\nFootnote 66: See the HHS guidance document, \u201cFinancial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidance for Human Subject Protection,\u201d available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/financial-conflict-of-interest/index.html#.\n\nIncluding information in the informed consent form, such as:\n\nThe source of funding and funding arrangements for the conduct and review of the clinical investigation, or\n\nInformation about a financial arrangement or interest (e.g., stock in the study sponsor, patent on the investigational product) of an institution or an investigator and how it is being managed.\n\nUsing special measures to modify the informed consent process when a potential or actual financial conflict exists, such as:\n\nHaving another individual who does not have a potential or actual conflict of interest involved in the consent process, especially when a potential or actual conflict of interest could influence the tone, presentation, or type of information presented during the consent process.\n\nUsing independent monitoring of the consent process.\n\nAlthough the clinical investigator should consider these issues regarding financial relationships and interests, IRBs have the final responsibility of determining whether subjects should be provided with information regarding the source of funding, funding arrangements, or financial interests of parties involved in the clinical investigation as part of the informed consent process (see 21 CFR 56.109 and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).\n\nThe Sponsor\n\nSponsors often provide clinical investigators with a model consent form that may be adapted by the clinical investigator to meet local needs. When the consent form for studies that require an IND or IDE application is submitted to FDA for review, FDA's comments are generally directed to the sponsor (see sectionIV.4.1, \"Investigational New Drugs and Biologics,\" and sectionIV.4.2, \"Investigational Medical Devices\"). The sponsor should promptly provide the clinical investigator with any necessary modifications required to satisfy the regulations at 21 CFR 50.25 so that changes can be made to the consent forms. A modified model consent form reflecting the changes may be used to convey the necessary edits. Because the clinical investigator must receive IRB approval before starting the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 312.66 and 21 CFR 812.110(a)), the sponsor should work closely with the clinical investigator to make certain the modified consent form is reviewed and approved by the IRB. The clinical investigator should provide the sponsor with a copy of the consent form approved by the IRB.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the sponsor:\n\niv.3.1 Considerations for Multicenter Clinical Investigations\n\nFor multicenter clinical investigations, changes may need to be made to the consent form to address local and institutional requirements. For multicenter clinical investigations reviewed by more than one IRB, when local IRB review results in substantive modifications to the consent form, i.e., changes that affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects, FDA expects the sponsor to share the revisions with all investigators and their IRBs. In this situation it may be more efficient to share the changes with the sites using a modified model consent form, when appropriate. If the multicenter clinical investigation has a central IRB cooperating with local IRBs or human research protection offices, the revisions should be forwarded to the central IRB.67 Alternatively, local issues may be addressed by the central IRB depending on the review agreement between the local IRB(s) and central IRB. Note that for medicaldevice studies that require submission of an IDE application, such changes must be submitted to FDA.68\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 812.35(a).\n\nFootnote 69: The 2018 Common Rule requires that any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States, unless the research is not subject to the provision (45 CFR 46.114(b)). The compliance date for research subject to this provision was January 20, 2020. On September 28, 2022, FDA issued a proposed rule to harmonize with this requirement to the extent practicable and consistent with statutory provisions (see https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/28/2022-21089/institutional-review-boards-cooperative-research). The January 19, 2017, final rule revising the Common Rule is available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/finalized-revisions-common-rule/index.html.\n\n.4.2 Sponsor Personnel\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.622267007827759", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 53: See the response to Comment 52 in the preamble to the 1981 final rule issuing regulations for the protection of human subjects (46 FR 8942, January 27, 1981); https://www.fda.gov/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/protection-human-subjects-informed-consent: \u201cThe fact that a short form is used to document informed consent does not mean that the subject will get less information than if handed a long, detailed written document...All the \u2018form\u2019 provides [whether long or short] is evidence that the information required by 50.25 has been provided to a prospective subject.\u201d\n\nUse of the short form requires that there be a witness to the oral presentation of information to the subject or the subject's LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). FDA recommends that an impartial third party not otherwise connected with the clinical investigation (for example, clinical staff not involved in the research, a patient advocate or an independent interpreter) serve as the witness. The witness must be present physically or by some other means, for example, by phone or video conference, during the oral presentation, not just the signing of the consent form (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The purpose of the witness is generally to attest to the voluntariness of the subject's consent and the adequacy of the consent process by ensuring that the information was accurately conveyed and that the subject's questions were answered.\n\nThe subject or the subject's LAR signs and dates only the short form (21 CFR 50.27(a) and (b)(2)). The witness must sign both the short form and the summary, and the person obtaining consent must sign the summary (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). Due to the additional requirements of having a witness and providing a written summary of the consent discussion, use of the short form may not ease or expedite the consent process.\n\nIV Responsibilities for informed consent\n\nIRBs, clinical investigators, and sponsors share responsibility for ensuring that the informed consent form and process is adequate and meets FDA's regulatory requirements. The regulatory requirements represent the minimum information to be provided to prospective subjects for informed consent. The consent form should also incorporate any additional information that may affect subjects' rights and welfare or willingness to participate in the clinical research. For example, information about certain financial relationships and interests may be important to the subject (see section IV.A.1, \"Review of All Informed Consent Materials\" and section IV.B.2, \"Financial Relationships and Interests\").\n\nThe IRB\n\nFDA requires that an IRB review and have authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove all research activities covered by the IRB regulations (21 CFR 56.109(a)). A critical part of this responsibility is for the IRB to review and approve a consent form that complies with applicable regulatory requirements at 21 CFR part 50 and to help ensure there is an adequate informed consent process that protects the rights and welfare of subjects participating in clinical investigations (21 CFR 56.109 and 56.111). Below are specific areas that IRBs should consider:\n\niv.1.1 Review of All Informed Consent Materials\n\nIRBs must review all materials used in the informed consent process (see 21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).54 This includes recruitment materials55, such as advertisements, and information provided in addition to the informed consent form (for example, a chart explaining what to expect at each study visit or a document explaining the costs to subjects). The IRB's review is to ensure that information given to subjects as part of the consent process is in accordance with the requirements of 21 CFR part 50 (see 21 CFR 56.109 and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).\n\nFootnote 54: IRBs are not required under 21 CFR part 56 to review stand-alone HIPAA authorizations, so long as an IRB\u2019s written procedures, adopted pursuant to 21 CFR 56.108(a), do not require such review and approval. See page 8 of FDA\u2019s \u201cGuidance for Industry IRB Review of Stand-Alone HIPAA Authorizations Under FDA Regulations\u201d (available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/irb-review-stand-alone-hipaa-authorizations-under-fda-regulations).\n\nWhen reviewing clinical investigations, IRBs must ensure that the consent process minimizes the possibility of coercion and undue influence (21 CFR 50.20 and 56.111(a)(4)). When a clinicalinvestigation involves subjects who are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, IRBs must determine that additional safeguards have been included in the clinical investigation to protect their rights and welfare (21 CFR 56.111(b)). In the event an IRB regularly reviews clinical investigations involving vulnerable subject populations, for such clinical investigations, the IRB membership should include individuals with knowledge about and/or experience working with such subjects, in order to provide expertise and identify techniques for obtaining their informed consent.56\n\nFootnote 56: For additional information see Frequently Asked Question #6. \u201cWhat are some considerations for enrolling subjects with low literacy and numeracy?\u201d; Frequently Asked Question #7, \u201cWhat are some considerations for enrolling physically challenged subjects?\u201d; and Frequently Asked Question #8. \u201cWhat are some considerations for enrolling subjects with impaired consent capacity?\u201d\n\nThe IRB has the authority to require that subjects receive information in addition to what 21 CFR 50.25 requires, if in the judgment of the IRB, the information would meaningfully add to the protection of the rights and welfare of the subjects (21 CFR 56.109(b)). For example, the IRB may determine that local circumstances necessitate the inclusion of additional information relevant to the informed consent process for prospective subjects from that particular community.\n\nHHS recommends that IRBs consider whether subjects should be informed of any financial relationships or interests that are associated with the clinical investigation, such as payments for services, equity interests or intellectual property rights.57 As indicated in the HHS guidance, some conflicting financial interests in the clinical investigation may affect the rights and welfare of subjects, and IRBs should consider approaches to assure subjects are adequately protected, including providing subjects with information about the financial relationships and interests. IRBs should determine whether subjects should be provided with information regarding the source of funding, funding arrangements, financial interests of parties involved in the clinical investigation, and any financial interest management techniques applied. The IRB should consider the kind, amount, and level of detail of information to be provided to subjects.\n\nFootnote 57: This topic is addressed in the HHS guidance document, \u201cFinancial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidance for Human Subject Protection.\u201d This guidance, which applies to FDA-regulated clinical investigations as well as human subjects research conducted or supported by HHS, is available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/financial-conflict-of-interest/index.html.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n1.1.1 Adequacy and Appropriateness of Wording\n\nThe IRB has the authority and responsibility to require that information given to subjects as part of informed consent be in accordance with 21 CFR 50.25.58 In order to approve the research, the IRB must determine that informed consent will be obtained in accordance with the informed consent regulations (21 CFR 56.111(a)(4)).\n\nFootnote 58: See 21 CFR 56.109(b).\n\nInvestigators must use an IRB-approved written consent form when documenting informed consent, in accordance with 21 CFR 50.27, except as provided in 21 CFR 56.109(c). Thus, the IRB should review the adequacy and appropriateness of all wording in the consent materials, as well as the overall length and presentation of information. Consent forms that are long, complex, legalistic, and have a high reading level may overwhelm prospective subjects and may inhibit reading of the full document and understanding of the relevant information.\n\nThe IRB should ensure that technical and scientific concepts and terms are explained, or common terms substituted, so that the anticipated subject population can understand all provided information (see 21 CFR 50.20).59 Pictures, diagrams, or other visual aids may be used to improve understanding of medical terms or how an investigational product functions. IRBs may wish to evaluate, through subject discussions, how well the consent materials communicate critical information. Additional guidance on the requirements at 21 CFR 50.20 can be found in section 1.1.2, \"General Requirements for Informed Consent\" above.\n\nFootnote 59: Various strategies exist to improve communication with patients, for example, see Doak CC, Doak LG, Friedell GH, Meade CD.

PMID: 9594918.\n\n1.1.2 Use of Standardized Language\n\nInstitutions may develop standard language or a standard format to use in portions of all consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation) to meet certain FDA regulatory requirements, as well as institutional and other Federal, State, or local requirements.\n\n5.3.2 Review of the Consent Process\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.0719921588897705", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: In the event that an IRB waives the requirement for documentation of informed consent (under 21 CFR 56.109(c)(1)), FDA recommends that the elements of informed consent be reviewed verbally with the subject or the subject's LAR. Additionally, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects with a written statement regarding the clinical investigation (21 CFR 56.109(d)). See section III. E.2, \"Alternative Methods of Obtaining Informed Consent\" below for additional information regarding documentation of consent. FDA recommends that when an IRB waives the documentation requirement for informed consent in circumstances where there is minimal risk of harm under 21 CFR 56.109(c)(1), the consent process and discussion be described and noted in subject case histories required to be maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3).46\n\nFootnote 46: Documentation requirements related to emergency research, as mentioned in 21 CFR 56.109(c)(2), can be found in 21 CFR 50.24. Discussion of these studies is in a separate guidance, \u201cGuidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors; Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/exception-informed-consent-requirements-emergency-research.\n\nFootnote 47: For additional information on alternative methods of obtaining informed consent, please see \u201cGuidance for Institutional Review Boards, Investigators, and Sponsors, Use of Electronic Informed Consent in Clinical Investigations,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-electronic-informed-consent-clinical-investigations-questions-and-answers, and FDA\u2019s MyStudies Application (App) at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/science-and-research-drugs/covid-mystudies-application-app.\n\n2.2.2 Alternative Methods of Obtaining Informed Consent\n\nTraditionally, informed consent has been obtained and documented in a face-to-face interview using paper consent forms. Technologies are available that may serve as an alternative to the paper consent form in the informed consent process.47 Parties interested in pursuing alternative methods of obtaining informed consent should discuss their plan with their IRB and are welcome to contact FDA as needed for advice.48\n\nFootnote 48: Questions related to alternative methods of obtaining informed consent can be directed to the Office of Clinical Policy at gcpaquestions@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nEven in the context of paper consent forms, there may be certain circumstances when an alternative to a face-to-face consent discussion may be appropriate. For example, such an alternative may be appropriate\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:31]\n\nbe described and noted in subject case histories required to maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3).\n\niv.1.3 Requirement for Dating Consent Form\n\nIn addition to signing the consent form, the subject or the subject's LAR must enter the date of signature on the form (21 CFR 50.27(a)) to allow confirmation that the subject or the subject's LAR provided consent prior to participation in the clinical investigation, as required by 21 CFR 50.20. In those cases where the subject provides consent on the same day51 that they begin participation in the clinical investigation, the subject's case history must document that the subject provided consent prior to participation in the research for studies conducted under an IND or IDE, (312.62(b) and 812.140(a)(3)), and the subject's case history should contain the signed and dated consent form. Although FDA regulations do not require the subject's copy to be a signed copy, FDA recommends that a copy of the signed consent form be provided.\n\nFootnote 51: Prospective subjects should have sufficient opportunity and time to consider enrollment in the research, such that coercion and undue influence are minimized. See sectionIII.A.2, \u201cCoercion and Undue Influence\u201d.\n\niv.1.4 Forms for Documentation of Informed Consent\n\nUnder 21 CFR 50.27:\n\n(b) Except as provided in SS 56.109(c), the consent form may be either of the following:\n\nA written consent document that embodies the elements of informed consent required by SS 50.25_. This form may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, but, in any event, the investigator shall give either the subject or the representative adequate opportunity to read it before it is signed._\n\nA short form written consent document stating that the elements of informed consent required by SS 50.25 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Also, the IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the representative. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining the consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.\n\nThe regulations provide for obtaining written informed consent by two different methods: a long form that embodies all the elements of informed consent (see 21 CFR 50.25), or a short form that states that the elements of informed consent have been presented orally to the subject's LAR.\n\nLong Form\n\nAs stated above, the long form must incorporate all the elements of informed consent as required under 21 CFR 50.25. When the long form is used, a copy must be provided to the person signing the form, that is, the subject or the subject's LAR (21 CFR 50.27(a)).\n\nShort Form\n\nAn IRB may approve a short form to be used in appropriate situations where the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 are presented orally to the subject or the subject's LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For example, IRBs may consider approving the use of a short form in situations where the subject or the subject's LAR is unable to read due to low literacy or visual impairment.52\n\nFootnote 52: For additional information see Frequently Asked Question #6, \u201cWhat should be considered when enrolling subjects with low literacy and numeracy?\u201d and Frequently Asked Question #7, \u201cWhat should be considered when enrolling subjects with physical or sensory disabilities?\u201d In addition, for information on enrolling individuals with limited English proficiency see Frequently Asked Question #3, \u201cWhat are some considerations for enrolling non-English speaking subjects?\u201d, Frequently Asked Question #4, \u201cWhat process should be followed when it is expected that subjects who do not understand English will be enrolled?\u201d, and Frequently Asked Question #5, \u201cWhat process should be followed when the enrollment of subjects who do not understand English, or who are limited English proficient, is not expected?\u201d\n\nWhen the short form is used, the IRB is required to approve a written summary of the information to be presented orally (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The information presented orally should be as thorough as the information contained in the long form.53 A copy of the short form and the written summary must be given to the person signing the form (that is, the subject or the subject's LAR) (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)).\n\nFootnote 53: See the response to Comment 52 in the preamble to the 1981 final rule issuing regulations for the protection of human subjects (46 FR 8942, January 27, 1981); https://www.fda.gov/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/protection-human-subjects-informed-consent: \u201cThe fact that a short form is used to document informed consent does not mean that the subject will get less information than if handed a long, detailed written document...All the \u2018form\u2019 provides [whether long or short] is evidence that the information required by 50.25 has been provided to a prospective subject.\u201d\n\nUse of the short form requires that there be a witness to the oral presentation of information to the subject or the subject's LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). FDA recommends that an impartial third party not otherwise connected with the clinical investigation (for example, clinical staff not involved in the research, a patient advocate or an independent interpreter) serve as the witness. The witness must be present physically or by some other means, for example, by phone or video conference, during the oral presentation, not just the signing of the consent form (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The purpose of the witness is generally to attest to the voluntariness of the subject's consent and the adequacy of the consent process by ensuring that the information was accurately conveyed and that the subject's questions were answered.\n\nThe subject or the subject's LAR signs and dates only the short form (21 CFR 50.27(a) and (b)(2)). The witness must sign both the short form and the summary, and the person obtaining consent must sign the summary (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). Due to the additional requirements of having a witness and providing a written summary of the consent discussion, use of the short form may not ease or expedite the consent process.\n\nIV Responsibilities for informed consent\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.7337743043899536", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors What is the new requirement for informed consent documents?\n--------------------\nContext: 19. Should investigators/sponsors include the statement in consent documents for a trial that is not an \"applicable clinical trial?\"\n\nBecause U.S. law only requires that applicable clinical trials be submitted to www.ClinicalTrials.gov, the new statement only applies to the legal requirements for applicable clinical trial informed consent documents. Again, the new rule does not prevent investigators from voluntarily reporting data from clinical trials that do not meet the definition of an applicable clinical trial to www.ClinicalTrials.gov and sharing that information with participants.\n\n20. If an organization has used the same model template for informed consent documents for years, must they update the template?\n\nYes, the compliance deadline of March 7, 2012, provided sufficient time for all institutions involved in applicable clinical trials to update their model forms and templates.\n\n21. Do informed consent documents for studies conducted outside of the United States have to comply with the new regulations?Yes, any applicable clinical trial, including applicable clinical trials conducted outside the United States, must comply with the new regulation (21 CFR SS 50.25(c)) and include the statement regarding www.ClinicalTrials.gov in informed consent forms. The statute defines applicable clinical trials as trials of drugs and devices that are subject to FDA regulation. If the clinical trial is not of a drug or device subject to FDA regulation, and, thus, not an applicable clinical trial, at the time of the initiation of the trial, then the statement is not required. See the response to questions 3 and 4 concerning the definition of an applicable clinical trial.\n\nFDA accepts data from foreign clinical trials not under an IND when in compliance with 21 CFR SS 312.120. The mere fact that we accept data from a foreign clinical trial in connection with a marketing application does not make it an applicable clinical trial; the foreign clinical trial constitutes an applicable clinical trial only when it meets the definitions set forth in 42 U.S.C. SS 282(j)(1)(A). See, also, the response to questions 3 and 4.\n\nThis requirement does not preclude the inclusion of mandatory or recommended language from non-U.S. governments, and it does not preclude reference to other clinical trial registries or regulatory bodies.\n\n22. What if the new statement conflicts with foreign informed consent requirements?\n\nCongress did not provide an exemption from the statutory requirement. If the clinical trial is an applicable clinical trial, then it must include the new statement.\n\n23. Can sponsors or investigators translate the new required statement?\n\nYes, if potential participants are non-English speaking or the clinical investigator or IRB anticipates that the consent interviews will be conducted in a language other than English, the IRB should require investigators or sponsors to prepare translated consent documents. FDA recommends that the IRB review, and if appropriate, approve procedures for ensuring that the translations will be prepared by a qualified individual or entity. However, FDA will not provide translations of the statement. We have written the required statement to use simpler language and do not believe that the statement will pose translation difficulties.\n\n24. Are clinical trials that are funded, conducted, or supported by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (i.e., subject to 45 CFR SS 46) subject to the new regulation?\n\nAs a general matter, applicable clinical trials involving FDA-regulated products and conducted or supported by HHS must meet the requirements of both 45 CFR SS 46 and 21 CFR SS 50.\n\n25. How does the new rule affect informed consent for children?\n\nParent or guardian permission, as defined in 21 CFR SS 50.3(r), must include the elements of informed consent. Therefore, the parent and guardian consent forms must include the new statement word for word.\n\n26. What are the consequences of not including the new language in consent documents for applicable clinical trials?\n\nFDA has several options that enable enforcement of the new informed consent requirement. FDA has the authority to regulate the protection of human subjects and the authority to impose penalties for violations of these regulations. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) prohibits the failure to establish or maintain any record or make any report required under section 505(i) and the failure or refusal to comply with any requirement under 520(g). 21 U.S.C. SS 331(e) \"The FD&C Act and implementing regulations allow FDA to seek administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for violations of section 301 of the FD&C Act. 21 U.S.C.

If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For \"applicable clinical trials\" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, \u201cElement of Informed Consent for \u2018Applicable Clinical Trials.\u201d\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n\nNo informed consent, whether oral or written, may include any exculpatory language through which the subject or the representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence.\n\nii.2.1 Exceptions to Informed Consent\n\nInformed consent is required for participation in FDA-regulated clinical investigations except under limited circumstances as described in 21 CFR 50.23 (involving certain life-threatening situations, military operations, or public health emergencies) and 21 CFR 50.24 (involving emergency research16) (see 21 CFR 50.20). We note that, to implement statutory changes made to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C) Act by section 3024 of the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act), FDA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would allow IRBs responsible for the review, approval, and continuing review of clinical investigations to approve an informed consent procedure that waives or alters certain informed consent elements or that waives the requirement to obtain informed consent for certain minimal risk clinical investigations.17({}^{,})18 In addition, FDA issued guidance explaining that until the Agency promulgates regulations implementing the Cures Act amendments to the FD&C Act, FDA does not intend to object to an IRB approving a consent procedure that does not include, or that alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set forth in 21 CFR 50.25, or to an IRB waiving the requirements to obtain informed consent for certain minimal risk clinical investigations under the circumstances described in the guidance.19 Nothing in FDA's informed consent regulations is intended to limit the authority of a physician to provide emergency medical care to the extent the physician is permitted to do so under applicable Federal, State, or local law (21 CFR 50.25(e)).\n\nFootnote 16: See \u201cGuidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors; Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/exception-informed-consent-requirements-emergency-research.\n\nFootnote 17: See section 3024 of the Cures Act, Pub. L. 114-255, available at https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ255/PLAW-114publ255.pdf.\n\nFootnote 18: See \u201cInstitutional Review Board Waiver or Alteration of Informed Consent for Minimal Risk Clinical Investigations,\u201d (83 FR 57378, November 15, 2018) at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2018-11-15/pdf/2018-24822.pdf.\n\nii.2.2 Coercion and Undue Influence\n\nThe conditions under which informed consent is sought and the relationship between the subject and the person obtaining consent should be carefully considered to minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence (21 CFR 50.20). According to the Belmont Report, \"Coercion occurs when an overt threat of harm is intentionally presented by one person to another in order to obtain compliance. Undue influence,by contrast, occurs through an offer of an excessive, unwarranted, inappropriate or improper reward or other overture in order to obtain compliance.\"20\n\nFootnote 20: The Belmont Report was written by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The Commission, created as a result of the National Research Act of 1974, was charged with identifying the basic ethical principles that should underlie the conduct of biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects and developing guidelines to assure that such research is conducted in accordance with those principles. See Belmont Report, available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html.\n\nFor example, if an employer seeks to enroll employees in a clinical investigation sponsored or conducted by the employer, the informed consent process should contain safeguards to ensure that participation is voluntary and that the possibility of undue influence or coercion by supervisors, peers, or others is minimized. Similarly, because of a potential conflict of interest and the nature of the physician-patient relationship,21 when the investigator is also the prospective subject's physician, for example, the-investigator should ensure that the prospective subject understands that enrollment in the clinical investigation is voluntary, and that a decision to forgo enrollment will not adversely affect their medical care, in accordance with 21 CFR 50.25(a)(8). The consent process and form should emphasize that an individual's participation is truly voluntary.\n\nNote that coercion and undue influence may be situational, and can affect any population, not just subject populations seen as vulnerable to coercion or undue influence. For example, in a clinical investigation involving the collection of extra tissue samples during a planned surgical procedure, waiting to obtain informed consent until the prospective subject is in the preoperative area would generally fail to minimize the possibility of undue influence. The possibility of undue influence could be addressed by first discussing the study with the prospective subject during a preoperative visit as part of the informed consent process. The prospective subject could be told that the study will be reviewed with them again prior to the procedure and, after all questions are resolved, they will be asked to sign a consent form acknowledging their willingness to participate in the study at that time.\n\nIn addition, statements that claim investigational drugs and devices are safe or effective for the purposes for which they are being investigated are prohibited (21 CFR 312.7(a) and 21 CFR 812.7(d)). Likewise, statements that overstate the possibility of benefit may unduly influence prospective subjects by leading them to incorrectly assume that it is known that the investigational product will be of benefit to them, influencing them to agree to participate when they might not have otherwise chosen to do so. For example, wording that refers to the clinical investigation as a \"therapeutic trial\" could contribute to a prospective subject's misunderstanding that the trial will offer a direct benefit for their disease or condition.\n\nFurthermore, we generally recommend against including statements such as \"FDA has given permission for the clinical investigation to proceed\" or \"FDA has approved the clinical investigation\" in the informed consent process, because such statements may suggest to subjects that the investigation has FDA's endorsement. In addition, these statements may not be accurate for the particular clinical investigation at issue (see, e.g., 21 CFR 312.40(b) and 21 CFR 812.2(b)).\n\nFDA does not consider reimbursement for reasonable travel expenses to and from the clinical trial site (e.g., airfare, gas, tolls), and associated costs, such as parking and lodging, to raise issues related to coercion or undue influence. Reimbursement for other expenses may be considered by an IRB on a case-by-case basis, and IRBs should consider whether the proposed remuneration could be an undue influence. Payment for participation in research should be just and fair.

For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nFootnote 6: In this guidance, we use the terms safety and effectiveness and safety, purity, and potency interchangeably in the discussions pertaining to biosimilar products.\n\nIII General principles for draft labeling of proposed biosimilar products (biosimilar product labeling)\n\nThe goal of a biosimilar product development program is to demonstrate biosimilarity between the proposed product and the reference product -- not to independently establish safety and effectiveness of the proposed product. A demonstration of biosimilarity means, among other things, that FDA has determined that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.7 Thus, FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness for the reference product, as reflected in its FDA-approved prescribing information, may be relied upon to provide health care providers with the essential scientific information needed to facilitate prescribing decisions for the proposed biosimilar product's labeled conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)). Accordingly, FDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, such as those described in sections V and VI of this guidance.8\n\nFootnote 7: Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act.\n\nInformation and data from a clinical study of a proposed biosimilar product should be described in its labeling only when necessary to inform safe and effective use by a health care provider. As a general matter, it is FDA's view that biosimilar product labeling should not include a description of or data from clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.9 Generally, clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarityare not designed to support an independent demonstration of safety or effectiveness of the proposed biosimilar product and thus would generally not be expected to facilitate an understanding of product safety and effectiveness. For example, the endpoints used in a clinical study conducted to support a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences may not be the same endpoints evaluated to support licensure of the reference product and thus may not inform prescribing decisions regarding safety and effectiveness. Similarly, the patient population may differ from the patient population studied in the clinical trials that supported the determination of safety and effectiveness of the reference product. For example, subjects in a study conducted to support a demonstration of no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product may be healthy volunteers, or the condition of use studied may be one for which the reference product is not licensed or for which the applicant of the biosimilar product is not seeking licensure but for which sufficient data indicate that the population or condition of use is adequately sensitive to detect clinically meaningful differences between the products, should they exist.\n\nBecause clinical studies conducted to support a demonstration of biosimilarity generally are not designed to support an independent demonstration of safety or effectiveness, such studies may be misinterpreted in the context of drug labeling, resulting in an inaccurate understanding of the risk-benefit profile of the biosimilar product. Therefore, studies conducted to support biosimilarity generally should not be included in biosimilar product labeling. Biosimilar product labeling should incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, including clinical data that supported FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness of the reference product.\n\nAs required under 21 CFR 201.56(c)(1), biosimilar product labeling must meet the content and format requirements of the physician labeling rule (PLR) as described in 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57, regardless of the format of the reference product labeling.10 In addition, biosimilar product labeling must meet the content and format requirements of the pregnancy and lactation labeling final rule (PLLR) as described in 21 CFR 201.57(c)(9)(i) through (iii), regardless of whether the reference product must meet these requirements.11\n\nFootnote 10: See the final rule \u201cRequirements on Content and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products\u201d (71 FR 3922, January 24, 2006). This rule is commonly referred to as the physician labeling rule because it addresses prescription drug labeling that is used by prescribing physicians and other health care providers. Also see additional labeling guidances at https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/ucm084159.htm.\n\nFootnote 11: See the final rule \u201cContent and Format of Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products; Requirements for Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling\u201d (79 FR 72064, December 4, 2014). The final rule describes the implementation schedule for applications submitted on or after the effective date of the rule, applications pending at the time the rule became effective, and applications approved before the rule became effective (79 FR 72064 at 72095\u201396).\n\nIV Specific Recommendations on Content of Biosimilar Product Labeling\n\nFDA recommends that biosimilar product labeling incorporate relevant data and information from the reference product labeling, with appropriate modifications, as explained in sections V and VI of this guidance. The relevant data and information from the reference product labeling that should be incorporated into the biosimilar product labeling will depend on whether the applicant is seeking licensure for all conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)) or fewer than all conditions of use of the reference product for the biosimilar product.12\n\nFootnote 12: A biosimilar product applicant generally may seek licensure for fewer than all conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed. The 351(k) application must include information demonstrating that the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling submitted for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously licensed for the reference product (see section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act).\n\nIn sections of the biosimilar product labeling that are based on the reference product labeling, it is anticipated that the text will be similar to the corresponding text in the reference product labeling. Text based on the reference product labeling need not be identical to the reference product labeling and should reflect currently available information necessary for the safe and effective use of the biosimilar product. Certain differences between the biosimilar and reference product labeling may be appropriate. For example, biosimilar product labeling conforming to PLR and/or PLLR may differ from reference product labeling because the reference product labeling may not be required to conform to those requirements at the time of licensure of the biosimilar product. In addition, biosimilar product labeling may include information specific to the biosimilar product that is necessary to inform safe and effective use of the product, including administration, preparation, storage, or safety information. This information may differ from that of the reference product labeling when it reflects differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product that do not preclude licensure of the biosimilar product.\n\nAppendix A Approaches to Product Identification\n\nIn biosimilar product labeling, the approach to product identification depends on the context of the information being presented. FDA acknowledges that there will be variations on the general concepts outlined in this section because the approach to product identification will depend on the specific statements. The illustrative examples in this section use a fictional reference product JUNEXANT (replicamab-hyxf) and a fictional biosimilar product NEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen use of the biosimilar product name is recommended:\n\nThe biosimilar product name should be used in labeling text that is specific to the biosimilar product or that refers solely to the biosimilar product. If a biosimilar product has a proprietary name, the proprietary name (e.g., NEXSYMEO) should be used in the appropriate sections. However, if a proprietary name is not available, or if referring to the drug substance (as discussed below), the biosimilar product's proper name (e.g., replicamab-cznm) should be used.13\n\nFootnote 13: The proper name is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (see section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)).\n\nThe biosimilar product's proprietary name (or, if a proprietary name is not available, the biosimilar product's proper name) should be used in circumstances such as the following:\n\nIn sections where the information described is specific to the biosimilar product -- This includes, but is not limited to, the following sections: INDICATIONS AND USAGE, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, DESCRIPTION, and HOW SUPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING.\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.3786636292934418", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: III Scope\n\nThis guidance applies to certain biological products licensed under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act). This guidance applies to all manufacturing locations, including contract locations. Licensed biological products that are within the scope of this guidance include:\n\nVaccines;\n\nAllergenic products;\n\nPlasma-derived products e.g., albumin, immunoglobulins, clotting factors, fibrin sealants, proteinase inhibitors, etc.); and their recombinant analogs;\n\nAntitoxins, antivenins, and venoms;\n\nNaturally-derived (i.e., not recombinant) protein products (e.g., naturally-derived enzymes and certain toxins);\n\nCellular and gene therapy products;3 Footnote 3: For purposes of this guidance, the term \u201cgene therapy products\u201d includes cell-based gene therapies. Cellular therapy products include tissue-engineered products regulated under section 351 of the PHS Act.\n\nIn vitro diagnostics (IVDs) regulated under the PHS Act (e.g., blood donor screening assays, etc.); and\n\nOther biological products licensed under the PHS Act subject to exceptions listed below.\n\nThis guidance also applies to combination products licensed under a BLA, unless the biological product constituent part is a specified biological product described in 21 CFR 601.2(a) or is otherwise outside the scope of this guidance, as described below. Biological products that are not within the scope of this guidance include:\n\nWhole Blood, blood components (including Source Plasma) and Source Leukocytes (Ref. 4);\n\nSpecified biological products described in 21 CFR 601.2(a);4 and\n\nBiosimilar and interchangeable products subject to licensure under section 351(k) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)).\n\nThis guidance also does not apply to human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) regulated solely under section 361 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 264) and the regulations in 21 CFR Part 1271.\n\nThis guidance does not apply to changes to an applicant's name. Such submissions are handled separately as product correspondence, in accordance with established procedures. For example, see CBER's Standard Operating Policy and Procedure (SOPP) 8403: Issuance and Reissuance of Licenses for Biological Products for further information on name changes.5\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSome manufacturing changes discussed in this guidance may also require revision of the approved labeling (Ref. [6]). Such changes are outside the scope of this guidance. In general, under 21 CFR 601.12(f):\n\nLabeling changes requiring supplement submission and FDA approval before distribution of the product with the labeling change include any change in the package insert, package label, or container label, including information required under 21 CFR 201.57(a), or, if applicable a Medication Guide required under 21 CFR Part 208, except those described in 21 CFR 601.12(f)(2) and [3];6 Footnote 6: 21 CFR 601.12(f)(1). See also FDA guidance on \u201cThe \u2018Deemed To Be a License\u2019 Provision of the BPCI Act: Questions and Answers\u201d (March 2020), available at https://www.fda.gov/media/119274/download/ (recommending submission of a prior approval supplement for BLA-specific labeling changes for deemed BLAs). [7] 21 CFR 601.12(f)(2). [8] 21 CFR 601.12(f)(3).\n\nLabeling changes that require supplement submission and FDA approval, but which do not require FDA approval of the supplement before the product with the labeling change may be distributed, include certain safety-related labeling changes to the package insert, package label, or container label to reflect newly acquired information, or any other labeling change that FDA specifically requests to be submitted in a changes being effected supplement under 21 CFR 601.12(f)(2)(i)(E);7 Footnote 7: 21 CFR 601.12(f)(2).\n\nLabeling changes requiring submission in an annual report include changes to any final printed package insert, package label, container label, or Medication Guide required under 21 CFR Part 208 include, among other things, editorial or similar minor changes and changes in the information on how the product is supplied that does not involve a change in the dosage strength or dosage form.8 Footnote 8: 21 CFR 601.12(f)(3).\n\nFor manufacturing changes that impact labeling, reporting classification is generally commensurate with the risks of the manufacturing change. If the reporting classification recommendations are unclear for submissions that include both manufacturing and labeling changes, license holders are advised to consult with the appropriate FDA Review Division.\n\nDuring the finalization of this FDA guidance, the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) published Q12 Technical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmaceutical Product Lifecycle Management (see also the associated Annex) (Ref. [7]). The ICH Q12 guidance describes certainterminologies and concepts, including Established Conditions,9 that may impact how an applicant reports post-approval changes. The ICH Q12 guidance, should be used by applicants in concert with any other applicable FDA guidance to report post-approval changes to the Agency when such reporting is required by the statute and regulation.\n\nFootnote 9: Established Conditions are defined by the FDA as the description of the product, manufacturing process, facilities and equipment, and elements of the associated control strategy, as defined in an application, that assure process performance and quality of an approved product, and that can be specifically identified and proposed by the sponsor and approved as part of a BLA. Changes to the established conditions must be reported to FDA (21 CFR 601.12).\n\nIV Reporting Changes\n\nReporting Categories\n\nUnder 21 CFR 601.12, each post-approval change in the product, production process, quality controls, equipment, facilities, responsible personnel, or labeling established in the approved BLA must be reported using the submission type associated with one of the three tier-based reporting categories depending upon the potential (i.e., risk) of the change to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product (i.e., a substantial potential, moderate potential, or minimal potential). The reporting categories in this regulatory provision also specify when the product made using the change can be distributed. The submission types and associated reporting categories are as follows:\n\nPrior Approval Supplement (PAS) - Changes that have a substantial potential to have an adverse effect on product quality (i.e., major changes) require an applicant to report the change to the FDA in a supplement to the approved BLA. A PAS must be approved by the FDA prior to distribution of the product manufactured using the change (21 CFR 601.12(b)).\n\nChanges Being Effected in 30 Days/Changes Being Effected Supplements10 (CBE30/CBE) - Changes that have a moderate potential to have an adverse effect on product quality (i.e., moderate changes) require an applicant to report the change to the FDA in a supplement at least 30 days prior to distribution of the product made using the change (21 CFR 601.12(c)). In certain circumstances, the FDA may determine that, based on the Agency's experience with a particular type of moderate change, the supplement for such a change is complete and provides the proper information and particular assurances that the change has been appropriately submitted. The product made using such a change may be distributed immediately upon receipt of the supplement by the FDA (21 CFR 601.12(c)(5)). These circumstances may include substantial similarity with a type of change that ordinarily involves a CBE supplement or a situation in which the applicant presents evidence that the change has been validated in accordance with an approved comparability protocol (CP) under 21 CFR 601.12(c) and 21 CFR 601.12(e).\n\nFootnote 10: This paragraph refers to CBE supplements submitted under 21 CFR 601.12(c), and does not refer to CBE supplements for certain types of labeling changes submitted under 21 CFR 601.12(f)(2).\n\nAnnual Report (AR) - Changes that have a minimal potential to have an adverse effect on product quality (i.e., minor changes) shall be documented by the applicant in an annual report (21 CFR 601.12(d)).\n\nAssessing and Implementing Manufacturing Changes\n\nApplicant Assessment and Implementation of Change\n\nThe potential for a change to impact product quality as it may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product should be thoroughly assessed and documented. The information and data to demonstrate comparability of the product pre- and post- change can include a combination of testing, validation studies, and non-clinical or clinical studies as necessary to evaluate potential effects of the change. Knowledge and experience accumulated during development and commercial manufacturing regarding how product performance relates to material attributes and process parameters is useful in assessing the impact of manufacturing changes (Ref. 8).\n\nWhen assessing the impact of a change on product quality, some or all of the following considerations should be taken into account by the applicant:\n\nPrior knowledge (e.g., established chemical and biological engineering principles; published, peer-reviewed scientific and technical literature; and applied manufacturing experience) (Ref. 9);\n\nDevelopment and manufacturing of the drug substance and drug product11 (Ref. 10); Footnote 11: For the purposes of this document, \u201cDrug Substance\u201d also refers to \u201cIn vitro Substance.\u201d\n\nProcess validation activities and experience gained during commercial manufacture;\n\nQuality risk management activities;\n\nStudies conducted at less than commercial scale to gain an increased understanding of the effects of the change on product quality and process consistency; and\n\nCumulative impact of multiple related changes.\n--------------------\nContext title: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved Application- Certain Biological Products Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.8658308982849121", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Office of Medical Policy, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Avenue, Bldg. 51, rm. 6337, Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nThis guidance also refers to previously approved collections of information found in FDA regulations. The collections of information related to the submission of a BLA under section 351(k) of the PHS Act have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0719, and the collections of information in 21 CFR part 601 have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0338.\n\nAn Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The information collection provisions in this guidance, including resulting proposed modifications to the information collections approved under OMB control number 0910-0338, have been submitted to OMB for review as required by section 3507(d) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and are not for current implementation. Before implementing the information collection provisions contained in this guidance, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing OMB's decision to approve, modify, or disapprove those information collection provisions.\n\n6 Glossary\n\nBiosimilar Product means a biological product submitted in a 351(k) application that has been shown to be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product (see section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act).\n\nCore Name means the component shared among an originator biological product and any related biological product, biosimilar product, or interchangeable product as part of the proper names of those products. Two examples of a core name are filgrastim and epoeetin alfa.\n\nInterchangeable Product means a biological product that has been shown to meet the standards described in section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act and may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nNonproprietary Name means a name unprotected by trademark rights that is in the public domain. It may be used by the public at large, both lay and professional.\n\nOriginator Biological Product means a biological product submitted in a BLA under section 351(a) of the PHS Act (i.e., a stand-alone BLA) that is not a related biological product.\n\nProper Name means the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act.18\n\nFootnote 18: Section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a)(1)(B)(i) and \u00a7 600.3(k)( 21 CFR 600.3(k)).\n\nProprietary Name means the trademark or brand name.\n\nReference Product means the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in a 351(k) application (section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nRelated Biological Product means a biological product submitted in a BLA under section 351(a) of the PHS Act (i.e., a stand-alone BLA) for which there is a previously licensed biological product submitted in a different section 351(a) BLA that contains a drug substance for which certain nomenclature conventions (e.g., United States Adopted Names (USAN) Guiding Principles19) would be expected to provide for use of the same drug substance name.20\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.1242538690567017", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 49: See the draft guidance for industry Comparative Analyses and Related Comparative Use Human Factors Studies for a Drug-Device Combination Product Submitted in an ANDA (January 2017). When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nAs a general matter, in assessing the therapeutic equivalence of a proposed generic drug-device combination product, FDA intends to consider whether the proposed generic product can be expected to have the same clinical effect and safety profile as the RLD when administered to patients under the conditions specified in the labeling.50 While FDA does not expect the proposed generic combination product and its RLD to be identical in all respects, any differences identified between a proposed generic combination product and its RLD should be adequately analyzed, scientifically justified, and otherwise not preclude approval under an ANDA. The extent to which differences between the proposed generic combination product and the RLD affect the approximability of the ANDA product will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nFootnote 50: See 21 CFR 314.3. See also the Orange Book, preface to the 41({}^{\\text{a}}) edition, at page vii.\n\nAppendix C Biologic-Led Combination Products\n\nBiologic-led combination products are licensed through one of the two BLA pathways under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), either under a section 351(a) BLA (i.e.,a stand-alone BLA) or under a section 351(k) BLA for a biosimilar or interchangeable biological product.51\n\nFootnote 52: Section 351(a)(2)(C) of the PHS Act.\n\n3.2.1 Biologics License Applications (BLAs) Submitted Under Section 351(a)\n\nTo be licensed, a biological product must be shown to be safe, pure, and potent, and the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed, or held must meet standards designed to ensure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure, and potent.52 A BLA submitted under section 351(a) of the PHS Act is a stand-alone application in that all of the information and data necessary to demonstrate that these requirements are met are included in the application. This pathway is generally appropriate for biologic-led combination products other than products that are proposed to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, a previously licensed biological product.53\n\nFootnote 52: See footnote 17.\n\nFor example, this pathway would be appropriate for the following products when the sponsor is not seeking to rely on FDA's license of another biological product in order to demonstrate biosimilarity to, or interchangeability with, such product:\n\na gene therapy combined with a specialized delivery catheter\n\na vaccine in a pre-filled syringe\n\na protein product in an autoinjector\n\n_BLAs for Biosimilar and Interchangeable Biological Products Submitted Under Section 351(k)_Section 351(k) of the PHS Act sets forth the requirements for the licensure of biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product.54 Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act defines biosimilarity to mean that the product \"is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components\" and that \"there are no clinically meaningful differences\" between the two products with respect to safety, purity, and potency. To meet the interchangeability standard, an applicant must show that its product \"is biosimilar to the reference product,\" and must further show that the product \"can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient\" and that, for a product that is administered more than once to an individual, \"the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the [two products] is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.\"55 Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing healthcare provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nFDA has published guidance indicating the availability of this abbreviated pathway for combination products, as well as considerations related to demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability of such products. With respect to demonstrating biosimilarity, Q.I.4 of the guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act (Biosimilars Q&A Guidance) states that some design differences in the delivery device used with the proposed biosimilar product may be permissible, and explains that it may be possible to obtain licensure of a proposed biosimilar product in a pre-filled syringe or auto-injector, for example, even though the reference product is a biological product licensed in a vial presentation, provided that the proposed biosimilar product meets the statutory standard for biosimilarity.\n\nThe Biosimilars Q&A Guidance also explains that licensure under section 351(k) would not be possible if design difference in a delivery device results in any of the following:\n\nA clinically meaningful difference between the proposed product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency;\n\nA different route of administration;\n\nA condition of use (e.g., indication, dosing regimen) for which the reference product has not been previously approved; or\n\nA proposed biosimilar product that otherwise does not meet the standard for biosimilarity.\n\nSee Biosimilars Q&A Guidance for considerations for seeking licensure of a combination product as biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, a reference product.\n\nAnnex\n\nAnalysis of Pathway Availability for Device-Led Combination Products - Illustrative Examples\n\nTo date, questions regarding pathway availability for combination products have focused most often on device-led combination products. Accordingly, we have included this annex to address common questions utilizing the analyses discussed in section IV.1. The outcomes are also consistent with the expectations discussed in section III, that the application enable evaluation substantially similar to that which would occur if the constituent parts were reviewed under separate applications for the use.\n\nThese hypothetical examples are not intended to reflect a complete analysis of the premarket review considerations that need to be addressed for the types of products discussed in the examples or other types of combination products. In addition, specific products may raise distinct issues that are not taken into account in the examples below. If manufacturers have specific questions relating to their particular products, the Agency recommends that they contact the lead center for the product or OCP, as needed, for assistance.\n\nFor the purposes of the illustrative examples below, it is assumed that the sponsor submitted a 510(k) to CDRH for the combination product.\n\nExample 1: Antimicrobial coating added for the first time to a previously classified device type\n\nPredicate Product:\n\nA previously classified hypothetical class II device (product has no drug or biological product constituent part), which is subject to 510(k) requirements (e.g., an externally-communicating device intended to be implanted in the abdominal cavity for drainage of excessive fluids).\n\nDrug Constituent Part:\n\nA hypothetical antimicrobial coating (Antimicrobial A) that contains the same active ingredient that is in an NDA drug product approved for intravenous administration that has a well-established and understood risk profile as an antimicrobial indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. The sponsor has provided FDA documentation of a right of reference to the NDA.56\n\nFootnote 56: Alternatively, the sponsor could rely on FDA\u2019s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for the NDA approved antimicrobial product, provided all of the requirements of 503(g)(5)(A) and (C) are satisfied and it is scientifically justified. FDA may then consider such findings in its review of a device premarket submission.\n\nNew Product:\n\nThe sponsor proposes to add an antimicrobial coating (Antimicrobial A) to the predicate product described above, making a single-entity combination product (hereinafter referred to as Product A). The purpose of adding the antimicrobial to this device is to prevent infections associated with the surgical procedure and continued use of the product. The sponsor requests the product be considered substantially equivalent to the previously cleared uncoated version of the device. An antimicrobial drug product has never been combined with this devicetype. To make a substantial equivalence determination, the following questions are generally asked:\n\nIs the predicate product legally marketed? Yes.\n\nDoes the predicate product have the same intended use? While both the predicate and the new combination product are intended to drain excessive fluid from the abdominal cavity, the addition of the proposed drug constituent part and the indication of preventing infection are not applicable to the predicate product. These changes raise different questions of safety and effectiveness, precluding a meaningful comparison with the predicate product.57 Therefore, these changes in indications for use of the product and of adding the constituent part would result in a new intended use, and the product would be found not substantially equivalent (NSE). Also, the addition of Antimicrobial A is a different technological characteristic that would raise different questions of safety and effectiveness.\n\nFootnote 57: See 21 CFR 807.92(a)(5) and the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications [510(k)].\n--------------------\nContext title: Principles of Premarket Pathways for Combination Products Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.25533390045166", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: An application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that \"the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product\" based upon data derived from:11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(3) of the PHS Act.\n\nAnalytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;\n\nAnimal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and\n\nA clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.\n\nThe Agency has the discretion to determine that an element described above is unnecessary in a 351(k) application.12 FDA advises sponsors intending to develop biosimilar products to meet with FDA to present their product development plans and establish a schedule of milestones that will serve as landmarks for future discussions with the Agency. FDA anticipates that early discussions with FDA about product development plans and about approaches to providing adequate scientific justifications will facilitate biosimilar development.13\n\nFootnote 12: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See the draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants for a detailed discussion. When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\n4 Complexities of Protein Products\n\nA sponsor should consider the complexities of protein products and related scientific issues when designing a development program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.\n\nNature of Protein Products and Related Scientific Considerations\n\nUnlike small molecule drugs, whose structure can usually be completely defined and entirely reproduced, proteins are typically more complex and are unlikely to be shown to be structurally identical to a reference product. Many potential differences in protein structure can arise. Because even minor structural differences (including certain changes in glycosylation patterns) can significantly affect a protein's safety and/or effectiveness, it is important to evaluate these differences.\n\nIn general, proteins can differ in at least three ways: (1) primary amino acid sequence; (2) modification to amino acids, such as sugar moieties (glycosylation) or other side chains; and (3) higher order structure (protein folding and protein-protein interactions). Modifications to amino acids may lead to heterogeneity and can be difficult to control. Protein modifications and higher order structure can be affected by formulation and environmental conditions, including light, temperature, moisture, packaging materials, container closure systems, and delivery device materials. Additionally, process- as well as product-related impurities may increase the likelihood and/or the severity of an immune response to a protein product, and certain excipients may limit the ability to characterize the protein product.\n\nAdvances in analytical sciences enable some protein products to be extensively characterized with respect to their physicochemical and biological properties, such as higher order structures and functional characteristics. These analytical methodologies have increasingly improved the ability to identify and characterize not only the drug substance of a protein product but also excipients and product- and process-related impurities.\n\nDespite such significant improvements in analytical techniques, however, current analytical methodology may not be able to detect all relevant structural and functional differences between two protein products. In addition, there may be incomplete understanding of the relationship between a product's structural attributes and its clinical performance. Thus, as set forth in the PHS Act, data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies are required to demonstrate biosimilarity unless FDA determines an element unnecessary.14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nManufacturing Process Considerations\n\nDifferent manufacturing processes may alter a protein product in a way that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the product. For example, differences in biological systems used to manufacture a protein product may cause different posttranslational modifications, which in turn may affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the product. Thus, when the manufacturing process for a marketed protein product is changed, the application holder must assess the effects of the change and demonstrate--through appropriate analytical testing, functional assays, and/or in some cases animal and/or clinical studies--that the change does not have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they relate to the safety oreffectiveness of the product.15 The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process (ICH Q5E) describes scientific principles in the comparability assessment for manufacturing changes.\n\nFootnote 15: See 21 CFR 601.12 and 21 CFR 314.70 for regulatory requirements for changes (including manufacturing changes) made to a licensed biologics license application (BLA) and an approved NDA, respectively.\n\nDemonstrating that a proposed product is biosimilar to a reference product typically will be more complex than assessing the comparability of a product before and after manufacturing changes made by the same manufacturer. This is because a manufacturer that modifies its own manufacturing process has extensive knowledge and information about the product and the existing process, including established controls and acceptance parameters. By contrast, the manufacturer of a proposed product is likely to have a different manufacturing process (e.g., different cell line, raw materials, equipment, processes, process controls, and acceptance criteria) from that of the reference product and no direct knowledge of the manufacturing process for the reference product. Therefore, even though some of the scientific principles described in ICH Q5E may also apply in the demonstration of biosimilarity, in general, FDA anticipates that more data and information will be needed to establish biosimilarity than would be needed to establish that a manufacturer's post-manufacturing change product is comparable to the pre-manufacturing change product.\n\nV U.S.-LICENSED Reference Product and Other Comparators\n\nTo obtain licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act, a sponsor must demonstrate that the proposed product is biosimilar to a single reference product that previously has been licensed by FDA.16 In general, a sponsor needs to provide information to demonstrate biosimilarity based on data directly comparing the proposed product with the reference product. As a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical PK study and, if appropriate, at least one PD study, intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity for purposes of section 351(k) of the PHS Act must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed. However, a sponsor may seek to use data derived from animal or clinical studies comparing a proposed product with a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act. In such a case, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.17 Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program their plans to provide an adequate scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of such justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFootnote 16: Sections 7002(a)(2) and (b)(3) of the Affordable Care Act, adding sections 351(k), 351(i)(2), and 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act.\n\nVI Approaches to developing and assessing evidence to demonstrate biosimilarity\n\nFDA recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to develop the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity. FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence provided by a sponsor when the Agency evaluates the sponsor's demonstration of biosimilarity, consistent with a longstanding Agency approach to evaluating scientific evidence.18\n\nFootnote 18: See footnote 4.\n\nUsing a Stepwise Approach to Demonstrate Biosimilarity\n--------------------\nContext title: Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.2097504138946533", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry What are the key differences in the content of prescribing information for biological products regulated under the PHS Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 4: Section 607 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, redesignated section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act as section 7002(e)(4)(A) and added the title \u201cIn General\u201d to the new subparagraph. Confoming revisions have been made throughout this guidance to refer to the new subparagraph.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nBPCI Act\n\nThe BPCI Act amended the PHS Act and other statutes to create an abbreviated licensure pathway in section 351(k) of the PHS Act for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product (see sections 7001 through 7003 of the BPCI Act). The objectives of the BPCI Act are conceptually similar to those of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417) (commonly referred to as the \"Hatch-Waxman Amendments\"), which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of drug products under section 505(b)(2) and 505(j) of the FD&C Act. An abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products can present challenges given the scientific and technical complexities that may be associated with the generally larger, and typically more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured. Most biological products are produced in a living system, such as a microorganism or plant or animal cells, whereas small molecule drugs are typically manufactured through chemical synthesis.\n\nSection 351(k) of the PHS Act, added by the BPCI Act, sets forth, among other things, the requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product and an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product. Section 351(i) defines \"biosimilarity\" to mean \"that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components\" and that \"there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product\" (section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act). A 351(k) application must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based upon data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies, unless FDA determines, in its discretion, that certain studies are unnecessary in a 351(k) application (see section 351(k)(2) of the PHS Act). To meet the standard for \"interchangeability,\" an applicant must provide sufficient information to demonstrate biosimilarity, and also to demonstrate that the biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, if the biological product is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch (see section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act). Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\n2 Transition Period for Certain Biological Products\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act provides that a marketing application for a biological product (that previously could have been submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act) must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, subject to the following exception during the transition period described below.\n\nAn application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2020, if the biological product is in a product class5 for which a biological product in such product class was approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2010.\n\nFootnote 5: FDA has interpreted the statutory term_product class_ for purposes of determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period(see FDA\u2019s guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCIAct (December 2018) (Biosimilars Q&A Guidance), at Q. II.2). We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory:information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nHowever, an application for a biological product may not be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act if there is another biological product approved under section 351(a) of the PHS Act that could be a \"reference product\"6 if such application were submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a license for a biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act (a \"deemed BLA\") on March 23, 2020 (see section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act; see also section 7002(e)(4)(B) of the BPCI Act). For additional information about FDA's interpretation of this \"transition\" provision, please refer to FDA's guidance for industry Interpretation of the \"Deemed to be a License\" Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (December 2018) (Transition Policy Final Guidance).\n\n3 Questions and Answers\n\nIdentification of Products Subject to the Transition Provision\n\n1 What products are affected by the transition provision? How will the holder of an approved new drug application (NDA) for a biological product know if it will be affected by the transition provision?\n\nThe \"deemed to be a license\" provision in section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act (also known as the transition provision) will apply on March 23, 2020, to each approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act.7 The BPCI Act and Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, amended the definition of a \"biological product\" in section 351(i) of the PHS Act to include a \"protein.\"\n\nFootnote 7: General references in this guidance to \u201capplications\u201d submitted or approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act also may include ANDAs, to the extent applicable. An ANDA generally must contain information to demonstrate, among other things, that the proposed generic drug has the same active ingredient(s), conditions of use, dosage form, route of administration, strength, and (with certain permissible differences) labeling as the reference listed drug (section 505(i)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act). Given the complexity of protein molecules and limitations of current analytical methods, it may be difficult for manufacturers of proposed protein products to demonstrate that the active ingredient in their proposed product is the same as the active ingredient in an already approved product, and thus ANDAs are not a focus of this guidance. There are no currently marketed bio logical products that were approved through the ANDA pathway.\n\nFDA has previously stated its interpretation of the statutory term \"protein\" in the amended statutory definition of \"biological product.\"8 As explained in FDA's final rule entitled \"Definition of the Term \"Biological Product\" (Biological Product Definition Final Rule), FDA interprets the term \"protein\" to mean any alpha amino acid polymer with a specific defined sequence that is greater than 40 amino acids in size. When two or more amino acid chains in an amino acid polymer are associated with each other in a manner that occurs in nature, the size of the amino acid polymer for purposes of this interpretation will be based on the total number of amino acids in those chains, and will not be limited to the number of amino acids in a contiguous sequence.9 FDA interprets the statutory definition of \"biological product\" such that any amino acid polymer composed of 40 or fewer amino acids (i.e., a \"peptide\") is outside the scope of the term \"protein.\" A \"peptide\" is not a \"biological product\" and will continue to be regulated as a drug under the FD&C Act unless the peptide otherwise meets the statutory definition of a \"biological product\" (e.g., a peptide vaccine) (see Q. II.1 in FDA's draft guidance for industry New and Revised Draft Q&As on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act (Revision 2) (December 2018) (Biosimilars Q&A Draft Guidance)). Moreover, a drug product that contains a protein only as an inactive ingredient (e.g., a drug product formulated with human serum albumin as an inactive ingredient) is not considered to be a \"protein\" for purposes of the statutory definition of \"biological product\" and the transition provision of the BPCI Act.\n\nFootnote 9: In the Federal Register of February 21, 2020, FDA issued a final rule that amends its regulation that defines \u201cbiological product\u201d to incorporate changes made by the BPCI Act and the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, and to provide its interpretation of the statutory term \u201cprotein\u201d (85 FR 10057). This rule is effective on March 23, 2020.\n\nThe prescription or over-the-counter status of a biological product with an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act will not change when the approved application is deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act on March 23, 2020.\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.6382761001586914"], "Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: Step 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = 8.75 g / 125 g = 7%.\n\nBecause 7% is less than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength apple juice (11.5 Brix value), the added sugar from the apple juice ingredient in this hypothetical example is zero even though the starting ingredient is a concentrated apple juice.\n\nHypothetical example 2 (with drying step where water is removed):Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA product formulation contains a single juice ingredient (20% single strength apple juice at 11.5 Brix) in the wet formulation (prior to drying). The blended wet formulation has a water content of 50% (i.e., a solids content of 50%). The product goes through a drying step. The finished product has a water content of 10% (i.e., a solids content of 90%) and a serving size of 40 g.\n\nStep 1: The amount of total sugars contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving.\n\nBecause there is water loss during manufacturing, in this method we calculate the amount of wet formulation needed to yield 40 g serving size finished product.\n\nSolids content in the finished product g = 40 x 90% = 36 g.\n\nBecause the solids prior to drying is 50% (moisture = 50%), the starting wet formulation prior to drying that yielded the 40 g serving size finished product is 72 g (36 g / 50%).\n\nThe amount of total sugar contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving (based on wet formulation weight percentage) = 72 g (\\times) 20% (\\times) 11.5% = 1.656 g.\n\nStep 2: The water content of the finished product = weight per serving (\\times)moisture content = 40 g (\\times) 10% = 4 g.\n\nStep 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = (1.656 g/ 4 g) (\\times) 100 = 41.4%.\n\nSince 41.4% is greater than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength apple juice (11.5 Brix value), you would need to calculate the amount of sugars from the apple juice ingredient (41.4% sugar) that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent apple (11.5% sugar). Please note that, in this hypothetical example, even though the starting juice is a single strength juice, because of the concentration during processing, the amount of added sugars from the apple juice is not zero. You may use the method described in Q&A 11 or other alternative methods to determine the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient.\n\n13. The regulation says in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii) that added sugars are a \"statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving, except that label declaration of added sugars content is not required for products that contain less than 1 gram of added sugars in a serving if no claims are made about sweeteners, sugars, added sugars, or sugar alcohol content.\" What does FDA consider to be a \"sweetener?\" Do sweeteners include sugar alcohols and other low-calorie sweeteners?\n\nWe have used the term \"sweetener\" to refer to ingredients that provide sweetness to a food regardless of whether they provide calories (43 FR 43248, September 22, 1978; 56 FR 60437 to 60438, November 27, 1991; and 58 FR 2326 to 2327, January 6, 1993). We have not changed our approach to the use of this term. Therefore, we consider both caloric and non-caloric sweeteners, including sugar alcohols, to be sweeteners for the purposes of this regulation.\n\nSome ingredients contain mono- and disaccharides (DP1 and DP2 (one and two degrees of polymerization)) that are created through processes such as hydrolysis. Do the mono- and disaccharide portions of ingredients that are created through hydrolysis need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33832), we said that, other than sugar syrup types of products where the sugars are specifically and purposely produced via hydrolysis, we do not have information suggesting that sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates results in significant increase in the sugar content of foods. We did not receive any comments or other information suggesting that these sugars should be captured under the added sugars declaration, and we did not include sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis in our definition of added sugars (id.). Therefore, such sugars would not be declared as added sugars on the label. We also explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, since hydrolysis was purposely used by the manufacturer to increase the sugar content of the product (id.).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33835), we also said that, in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Report (2015 DGAC Report).\n\nManufacturers may purposely employ methods, such as hydrolysis, for a number of reasons, some of which result in an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides with DP1 and DP2. Ingredients such as maltodextrin and corn syrup solids are hydrolyzed to achieve various degrees of dextrose equivalence (DE). The higher the DE, the lower the degree of polymerization, and the sweeter the ingredient becomes. Maltodext (21 CFR 184.1444) are ingredients with a DE less than 20, and corn syrup (21 CFR 168.120, 168.121, and 184.1865) are ingredients with a DE of 20 or higher. Depending on the manufacturing process, different maltodextrin and corn syrup will have different DE and different amounts of mono- and disaccharides. Although maltodext are not used primarily for sweetening purposes, depending on the DE, some can contain 8-9% mono and disaccharides and can contribute to sweetness. We also understand that the hydrolysis process to manufacture maltodextrin and corn syrup are controlled so that the desired DE can be consistently achieved. This indicates that some maltodext and corn syrup solids are manufactured purposely to contain certain levels of mono- and disaccharides. Information that is publicly available (e.g., online product specification sheets and reference materials) indicates that manufacturers have knowledge of the level of mono- and disaccharides created during the processing of ingredients through controlled hydrolysis.\n\nMaltodext, corn syrups, and other ingredients with mono-and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis are widely used by manufacturers and are present in many different types of food products (47 FR 36443 at 36444, September 20, 1982). The sugars contributed by these ingredients are consistent with the concept of empty calories as described in the 2015 DGAC Report because they supply sugars and calories to the diet when they are added as an ingredient to foods. We explained in the Nutrition Facts label final rule that small amounts of added sugars that are contributed to the diet by a wide variety of foods can add up over the course of the day and can make it difficult for an individual to eat sufficient amounts of foods from the basic food groups to meet nutrient needs without exceeding the amount of calories they need in a day for weight maintenance (81 FR 33742 at 33759). As such, when an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis (e.g. maltodextrin or corn syrup) is added to a food during processing, those mono- and disaccharides contributed by the ingredient need to be declared as added sugars on the label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(9)(iii).\n\nShould sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch and other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g., beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label?\n\nYes. Sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch or other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g. beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods need to be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label because the sugars created through controlled hydrolysis add empty calories to the diet (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii); 81 FR 33742 at 33831 through 33832 (comment 201 and response), 33835 (comment 207 and response)).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, because the manufacturer purposely used hydrolysis to increase the product's sugar content (81 FR 33742 at 33832).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.600752353668213", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: The definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n\nThe determination of the amount of added sugars contributed by a powdered fruit or vegetable juice that is added as an ingredient to a product and that is not reconstituted to single strength juice during processing (e.g., that is added to a pureed fruit or to a yogurt) would be the same as the determination of the sugars contributed by a liquid or frozen fruit or vegetable juice concentrate. In our response to question 11, we have suggested that when calculating the added sugars declaration for a product containing concentrated fruit or vegetable juice, the total moisture content of the finished product can be considered to go towards reconstitution of the fruit juice concentrate in the formulation. Thus, the total moisture content of a finished product formulated with powdered fruit or vegetable juice concentrates can be considered to contribute towards the dilution of the powdered fruit or vegetable juice. Further, the sugars contributed by the powdered fruit or vegetable juice that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type must be declared as added sugars on the label, as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule.\n8. Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates? We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12). We require that, when a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)). If you use Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 to calculate the amount of added sugars in a product containing juice concentrate, you must document this information in the records regarding the amount of added sugars added to the food during processing (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). If you use the amount of sugars present in a single strength juice and/or a juice concentrate, that is determined through chemical analysis or other available information, when calculating the amount of added sugars in a product containing fruit juice concentrate, you must document the source of the information and/or the amount of sugars determined through chemical analysis in the records that you make and keep (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). If a diluted juice concentrate slightly exceeds the amount of sugar that would be found in the same volume of the same type of 100 percent fruit juice, manufacturers should document the average and consistency with cGMPs in the records that they make and keep.\n9. Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis? The amount of added sugars declared on the label must be in grams (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The added sugars definition includes sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. For juice, the serving size is based on volume (e.g., 8 oz. or 240 ml) while the amount of added sugars per serving is based on weight. Therefore, when calculating the weight of added sugars per serving, you may need to consider the densities of both the finished juice product and the single strength juice of the same type. You may choose to arrive at the gram amount of added sugars in different ways. Please see our responses to questions 11 and 12 for examples of how to calculate the amount of added sugars in products containing concentrated fruit juices on both a volume and weight basis.\n10. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit or vegetable juice (juice made from a single type of fruit or vegetable) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength juice where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)? In the hypothetical example below, we provide three general steps to calculate the amount of added sugars (in grams) for an apple juice product (240 ml serving size) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength apple juice. The product in this hypothetical example is reconstituted to have juice soluble solids above the minimum Brixrequirement in 21 CFR 101.30 where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9). Therefore, all sugars in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice must be declared as added sugars. The apple juice example here uses the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration. This example is provided solely to demonstrate one method of calculating the added sugars content of the product. You can use alternate methods.\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.3718528747558594", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: Step 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information.

In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n\na) Single strength apple juice has a Brix value of 11.5 (21 CFR 101.30). You may use the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration in a single strength apple juice or other information such as data obtained through chemical analysis, information from databases, or reference documents (see response to Q&A 9). Therefore, the sugar concentration in a single strength apple juice is 11.5% (based on weight).\n\nb) Determine the density of single strength apple juice with a Brix value of 11.5. You can either measure the density or look up references that convert Brix values to densities.\n\nc) The amount of sugars in 240 ml serving size of single strength apple juice of the same type = 240 ml x density (g/ml) x 11.5 % (or.115).\n\nStep 3: The weight of added sugars (in grams) is the weight of sugars obtained from step 1 minus that from step 2.\n\n11. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit juice blend containing the juices of multiple fruit types that is reconstituted above 100 percent where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)?\n\nIf the juice blend is reconstituted such that the amount of sugar in the finished product is equal to or less than what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice (e.g., less than 100% juice), the added sugar declaration would be zero.\n\nIf the juice blend is reconstituted such that the amount of sugar in the finished product is greater than what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final juice blend.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished juice blend product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the juice blend were reconstituted to single strength juice of the same type (i.e., the weight of sugars in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type). The single strength juice of the same type is a juice that contains the same ratios of the apple, mango, and pear juices in our hypothetical example.\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you can make a single strength juice blend with the same ratios of the three juices and measure the amount of total sugars per 240 ml serving size.\n\nYou can also calculate the sugar weight in the theoretical single strength juice blend of the same type by the following method:\n\na) Calculate the ratios of the three juices in your formulation based on weight.\n\nTo obtain the weight-based ratios of the three juices in this hypothetical juice blend example, you need to first determine the weight-based concentration factors for the three types of juice. The weight-based concentration factor is the ratio of the Brix values between the concentrate and the single strength juice. For example, the weight-based concentration factor for the apple juice in the hypothetical example is 70 / 11.5 = 6.087. Using a similar calculation, the weight based concentration factor for the mango juice is 5.385 and the weight based concentration factor for the pear juice is 5.833.\n\nBecause the hypothetical juice blend formulation has 10% apple juice concentrate (70 Brix), 10% mango juice concentrate (70 Brix), and 20% pear juice concentrate (70 Brix), the theoretical single strength juice blend of the same type would have the following ratios of single strength apple juice, single mango juice, and single pear juice:\n\nPercentage apple juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) apple juice concentration factor; percentage mango juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) mango juice concentration factor; percentage pear juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) pear juice concentration factor\n\nOr\n\n10% (\\times) 6.087; 10% (\\times) 5.385; 20% (\\times) 5.833\n\nOr\n\n0.6087; 0.5385; 1.167_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nThe above ratios for the three types of juice can be converted to percentage-based ratios with the sum of the ratios being 100%. The sum of the ratios is 100% because all of the sugars in the juice blend are from the three types of juices.\n\nTherefore:\n\nSingle apple juice: single strength mango juice: single strength pear juice =\n\n({)[0.6087 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (}):\n\n({)[0.5385 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (}):\n\n({)[1.167 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (})\n\nOr\n\n26.30%: 23.27%: 50.42%\n\nb) Calculate the theoretical Brix value of the single strength juice blend of the same type juice with the same ratios of the three juices.\n\nThe theoretical Brix value of the juice blend is the sum of the multiplication products of the Brix value and the percentage contribution (the ratio percentage from step 2a) for each type of juice.\n\n(Single strength apple juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single strength apple juice) + (single strength mango juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single strength mango juice) + (single strength pear juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single pear juice) = theoretical Brix value of the hypothetical juice blend.\n\n11.5% (\\times) 26.31% + 13% (\\times) 23.27% + 12% (\\times) 50.42% = 12.10%.\n\nc) Determine the density of single strength juice blend with a Brix value of 12.10. You can either experimentally measure the density or look up references that convert Brix values to densities.\n\nd) The amount of sugars in 240 ml serving size of the theoretical single strength juice blend of the same type with the same ratios of the three types of juice = 240 ml (\\times) density (g/ml) (\\times) 12.10 %.\n\nStep 3: The weight of added sugars (in grams) is the weight of sugars obtained from step 1 minus that from step 2.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.2362160682678223", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines includes a recommendation for healthy eating patterns that limit added sugars (including honey, syrups, and other caloric sweeteners) to less than 10 percent of calories per day (Ref. 3).\n\nNutrition Facts Label Final Rule\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016, we issued a final rule updating the Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods to reflect new scientific information (see 81 FR 33742). The Nutrition Facts label final rule includes changes in the individual nutrients that must be declared and also changes some of the DVs. The science underlying the Nutrition Facts label final rule, referenced above, is also reflected in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires that added sugars be included in the Nutrition Facts label and established a DV for added sugars. The Nutrition Facts label final rule defines \"added sugars,\" in part, to include sugars that are either added during the processing of foods or are packaged as such (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The term includes free sugars (free mono- and disaccharides), sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The Nutrition Facts label final rule requires added sugars to be declared on the food label by stating \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" indented directly below \"Total Sugars\" (see 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(ii)).\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires a declaration for added sugars, in part, because excess consumption of added sugars makes it difficult to meet nutrient needs within the calorie limits generally needed to maintain a healthy weight and can lead to an increase in overall caloric intake. Further, healthy dietary patterns characterized, in part, by lower amounts of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, as compared to less healthy dietary patterns, are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary_Guidelines demonstrates that meeting nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits is difficult with more than 10 percent of total daily calories from added sugars (50 grams of added sugars based on a 2,000 calorie diet). Based on this science, the Nutrition Facts label final rule establishes a DV for added sugars, 50 grams based on a 2,000 calorie diet for adults and children 4 years of age and older and 25 grams based on a 1,000 calorie diet for children 1 through 3 years of age (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(vii)).\n\nPure (100%) honey, pure (100%) maple syrup, other single-ingredient sugars and syrups, and certain cranberry products sweetened with added sugars contribute to the DV of added sugars, regardless of whether they are added by consumers to foods (e.g., maple syrup poured over pancakes; sugar added to dried cranberries to increase palatability) or consumed in isolation (e.g., a spoonful of honey). FDA's definition encompasses the types of added sugars that were evaluated in the science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommendation that no more than 10 percent of calories be from added sugars. These sugars were considered \"empty calories\" or \"calories for other uses\" in the USDA Food Patterns.\n\nDraft Guidance\n\nIn the Federal Register of March 2, 2018 (83 FR 8953), we made available a draft guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, and Certain Cranberry Products; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availability\" (hereafter referred to as \"the draft guidance\") and asked interested parties to submit comments by May 1, 2018. In the Federal Register of April 25, 2018 (83 FR 17961), we extended the comment period to June 15, 2018. We have considered comments to the draft guidance, and we have made modifications, where appropriate, that are now reflected in this final guidance.\n\nFarm Bill\n\nAfter we published the Nutrition Facts label final rule and the Serving Size final rule, and draft guidance, the President signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (\"the Farm Bill\"). Section 12516 of the Farm Bill states that the food labeling requirements under section 403(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)) shall not require that the Nutrition Facts label of any single-ingredient sugar, honey, agave, or syrup, including maple syrup, that is packaged and offered for sale as a single-ingredient food bear the declaration \"Includes Xg Added Sugars.\" Therefore, single-ingredient sugars, honey, agave, and syrups, including maple syrup, do not need to have this statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving of their product on their label. At the same time, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nAlthough the gram amount of added sugars in a serving of pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups does not need to be declared on the label, these single-ingredient sugars and syrups are required under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV that they contribute to added sugars in the diet. The percent DV on pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups provides important information to consumers about how the addition of sugar from these products contributes to their total daily diet. In the absence of the declaration of the amount of added sugars in a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product, a statement that includes information about the amount of sugars in a serving, as well as how that amount contributes to the consumer's diet and the percent DV for added sugars, provides information that can assist consumers in constructing a diet that is consistent with recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nTherefore, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the use of a \"(\\dagger)\" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV and, per the Farm Bill, the term \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" would not need to appear on the line on the Nutrition Facts label disclosing the added sugars percent DV. The \"(\\dagger)\" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading within a footnote in the Nutrition Facts label box that includes a description of the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent DV for added sugars in the diet. The footnote containing this factual statement should be placed beneath the required footnote that states, \"The % Daily Value (DV) tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice\" (see illustration below).5 Our intent to exercise enforcement discretion is limited to any pure, single-ingredient honey and maple syrup, and other pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups.\n\nFootnote 5: Note that the illustration provides an example of a truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet. FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for the use of any truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet.\n\nWe also intend to exercise our enforcement discretion for certain cranberry products described here (dried cranberries without added flavorings and cranberry beverages made up of cranberry juice that is sweetened with added sugars that provide an amount of total sugars in a serving that does not exceed the level of total sugars in a serving of a comparable product with no added sugars) to allow for the use of a \"(\\dagger)\" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV. The \"(\\dagger)\" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nManufacturers could explain, through the use of such statements, that the sugars added to dried cranberries or the cranberry beverage product are meant to increase the palatability of the naturally tart fruit and that the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. We have provided illustrations of such statements that we consider to be truthful and not misleading below.\n\nAt this time, we are not aware of products, other than the dried cranberry and cranberry beverage products previously discussed, for which the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. Therefore, at this time we only intend to exercise enforcement discretion for cranberry products previously discussed with respect to the use of the \"(\\uparrow)\" that would direct consumers to truthful and not misleading statements on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label, and do not intend to exercise enforcement discretion on other products (e.g., a granola bar or trail mix containing dried sugar-sweetened cranberries). We note that we would consider whether the same type of enforcement discretion discussed with respect to the cranberry products previously described might be warranted for other products where the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, such as naturally tart fruits, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.9627196788787842", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  How do I calculate the amount of added sugars from a fruit or vegetable juice ingredient when the fruit or vegetable juice ingredient is diluted by other water-containing ingredients in a formulation or concentrated due to water loss during processing (e.g., drying or baking)?\n--------------------\nContext: A food that already contains some endogenous sugar and additional added sugars, either directly or as a component in an ingredient, such as sweetened fruit added to yogurt, would be misbranded if the actual \"Total Sugars\" amount is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label, or the records requirements for \"Added Sugars\" are not met (see SS 101.9(g)(11)).\n\nDo sugars present in a sweet fermented beverage after fermentation need to be declared as total or added sugars on the label?\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains only sugars that meet our definition of added sugars (e.g. table sugar), then the amount of sugars present in a serving of the product after fermentation must be declared as both total and added sugars (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains both sugars that do and do not meet our definition of added sugars, you may determine the amount of total sugars in the finished food analytically. You have the following options related to the added sugars declaration:\n\nDetermine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in the finished product and make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information you relied upon that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation; or\n\nDeclare the amount of added sugars added prior to fermentation and make and keep records to verify the amount (21 CFR 101.9(g)). The amount of added sugars declared should not exceed the amount of total sugars on the label; or\n\nIf you have no way to determine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in the finished food, but have reason to believe that a significant reduction of added sugars took place during fermentation, you may submit a petition, under 21 CFR 10.30, to request an alternative means of compliance. The petition should provide scientific data or other information for why the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product is likely to be significantly reduced compared to the amount added prior to fermentation. A significant reduction would be where reduction in added sugars after fermentation may be significant enough to impact the label declaration for added sugars by an amount that exceeds the reasonable deficiency acceptable within good manufacturing practice under SS 101.9(g)(6). In addition, the scientific data or other information should include the reason why you are unable to determine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in a serving of the finished product and a description of the process that you used to come to that conclusion.\n\nIngredients made primarily from sugar and created through non-enzymatic browning are added to some products for coloring and flavoring purposes (e.g. caramel color). After non-enzymatic browning occurs, the sugar is reduced in the ingredient. In such a case, how much sugar must be declared as added sugars on the label? If the remaining amount of the sugar contributed by an ingredient that undergoes non-enzymatic browning is detectable by testing in the finished product, you may declare that amount of sugar that is detectible by analytical testing in the finished product as the added sugars declaration. When such an ingredient is added to a product that contains other sugars that do not meet the definition of added sugars, you must make and keep records, which should include records of the results of the analytical testing that is used to demonstrate the amount of added sugars contributed by the ingredient in the finished product after non-enzymatic browning occurs, and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(v)(A)).\n\n20. If sugar is added for fermentation during the leavening process of a baked good and some of the sugars are consumed by yeast, should the reduction in the amount of sugars be accounted for the declaration of added sugars?\n\nAs described in our response to question 19, you may declare the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation. If you do so, you must make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information relied upon by the manufacturer that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(v)(A)).\n21. There is a chance that added sugars content prior to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation may be higher than the total sugars content of the finished food determined through chemical analysis. How do I approximate the added sugars value in this case?\n\nThe added sugars declaration should not exceed the total sugars declaration. In a case where sugars added prior to or during processing are reduced through non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation, and the manufacturer chooses to declare the amount of sugars added prior to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation, the added sugars declaration could conceivably exceed the amount of total sugars determined through chemical analysis. In such a case, you should declare the same amount for added sugars as the amount of total sugars obtained through analytical testing for a serving of the food.\n\nV Question and Answer on Format Issues\n\n1. What are the specifications for thickness of lines and leading (i.e., space between lines) on the Nutrition Facts label?\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(ii)(C) and (d)(1)(v) establish certain format requirements with respect to leading and the use of hairline rules.\n\nAdditionally, Appendix B to Part 101 in Title 21 provides examples of graphic enhancements (i.e., illustrations) that FDA uses. For more examples of graphic enhancements that FDA uses, please see our webpage at: https://www.fda.gov/media/99151/download.\n\nQuestion and Answer on the Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals\n\n1. What are the requirements (e.g. for rounding) for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals declared on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels? What does \"levels of significance\" mean in this context?\n\nWe require, under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii), that the quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals, excluding sodium, be the amount of the vitamin or mineral included in a serving of the product using the units of measurement and the levels of significance given in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) (which refers to the Reference Daily Intakes (RDI) table). However, zeros following decimal points may be dropped, and additional levels of significance may be used when the number of decimal places indicated is not sufficient to express lower amounts (e.g., the RDI for zinc is given in whole milligrams, but the quantitative amount may be declared in tenths of a milligram). This is consistent with the requirements for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the Supplement Facts label (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B)).\n\nIn addition, regarding conventional foods, quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals present at less than 2 percent of the RDI are not required to be declared on the Nutrition Facts label. However, they may be declared by a zero or by the use of an asterisk (or other symbol) that refers to another asterisk (or symbol) that is placed at the bottom of the table that is followed by the statement \"Contains less than 2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients)\" or \"Contains (<)2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients).\" Alternatively, if vitamin D, calcium, iron or potassium is present in amounts less than 2 percent of the RDI, label declaration of the nutrient(s) is not required if the statement \"Not a significant source of _(listing the vitamins or minerals omitted)\" is placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii)).\n\nRegarding dietary supplements, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium must be declared when they are present in a dietary supplement in quantitative amounts by weight that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling of foods in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c). (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAs for the phrase \"levels of significance,\" as used in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii) and 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and whether the phrase refers to statistical testing of hypotheses or mathematical concepts related to the degree of accuracy starting with the first nonzero digit, the phrase \"levels of significance\" refers to the degree of accuracy when rounding nutrients for purposes of declaring quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the label.\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c), provide specific rounding requirements for nutrients such as sodium. Before we issued the Nutrition Facts label final rule, sodium and potassium content was to be expressed as zero when the serving contained less than 5 milligrams (mg), to the nearest 5 mg increment when the serving contained less than or equal to 140 mg, and to the nearest 10 mg increment when the serving contained more than 140 mg.

Do I need to take into consideration sugars from ingredients that are used in formulating my product when determining the added sugars declaration for a serving of my product?\n\nIngredients containing free mono- and disaccharides that meet our definition of added sugars need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (e.g. sugars from cane sugar and concentrated fruit juice added to sweeten an apple sauce). Manufacturers may need to work with ingredient suppliers to determine the amount of added sugars provided by ingredients used in formulating food products.\n\n4. Do the sugars in dried fruits meet the definition of added sugars?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we responded to comments on dried fruits (see response to comment 212, 81 FR 33742 at 33837). We said that dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them should not be considered to contain added sugars because they are essentially a dehydrated whole fruit and still retain the nutrients and other components of a whole fruit (e.g. diced dried apples). However, if additional sugar is added to a dried fruit, the sugar added to the dried fruit must be declared on the label as added sugars (81 FR 33742 at 33837).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5. Are the sugars used in the production of vinegar added sugars?\n\nIn the production of vinegar, naturally occurring sugars are first fermented into alcohol and then a secondary fermentation occurs in which alcohol is converted to vinegar. For most vinegar products, no sugars remain in the final product. Vinegars that do not contain any sugars in the finished food would not need an added sugars declaration. However, we are aware of some vinegars (e.g., balsamic vinegar) that are made using ingredients that are often used as sweeteners in foods, and that are similar to concentrated fruit juices (e.g., grape must). According to the definition of added sugars, sugars found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type are added sugars. Therefore, fruit juices that are concentrated before or during processing of some vinegars contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars. To the extent that sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are present in the finished product, the added sugars must be declared on the label and in labeling, as required in our Nutrition Facts label final rule. We understand that the manufacturing of vinegar involves several steps, and manufacturers need to consider the impact of these steps (e.g. potential concentration due to water loss when aged in wooden barrels) on the final added sugars declaration.\n\n6. The definition of added sugars excludes the \"fruit component of fruit spreads.\" What constitutes the \"fruit component\" of a non-standardized fruit spread?\n\nPlease see our response to question 1 above. The fruit component of a non-standardized fruit spread would include whole fruits, pieces of fruit, dried fruit, fruit or vegetable pures (single strength or concentrated), fruit pulps, single strength juices, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders that are not made from fruit or vegetable juices.\n\n7. Do sugars found in fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the form of the fruit or vegetable (e.g., concentrated fruit and vegetable pures, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders) need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833), we explained that we excluded from the definition of \"added sugars\" whole fruit, fruit pieces, dried fruit, pulps, and pures because they are nutrient rich and maintain the basic properties of a fruit when added to foods and are not considered to contain added sugars (see response to comment 208, 81 FR 33742 at33835). We also explained that sugars from 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, and sugars from certain fruit and vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under certain regulations, fruit juice concentrates used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, and preserves under our standards of identity, and 100 percent juice concentrate sold directly to consumers (e.g. frozen orange juice concentrate) are excluded from the definition of \"added sugars.\"\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833 through 33834), we explained that, while foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices can be a part of a healthful diet, the sugars added to the foods by the concentrated fruit or vegetable juice provide additional calories. Over the course of the day, small amounts of calories in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages can add up and make it difficult to balance the amount of calories expended (81 FR 33742 at 33834). For these reasons, we consider foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices to be sugar-sweetened foods (id).\n\nWe also explained that in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report (Ref. 1) (81 FR 33742 at 33835).\n\nWe are applying these same guiding principles when determining when the sugars in an ingredient are added sugars. Concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes, and some fruit and vegetable powders are essentially whole fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the physical form of the fruit or vegetable and to remove moisture. They maintain the basic properties of a whole fruit or vegetable, even if the peel and seeds may be removed. Their composition and use is more consistent with that of whole fruits or vegetables, dried fruits or vegetables, pulps and pureses than that of concentrated fruit juices, which are commonly used by industry in place of sugars. Therefore, the sugars in concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes and some fruit and vegetable powders contribute to the diet the same way that sugars found in whole fruits or vegetables do, and do not have to be declared as added sugars on the label. However, we consider sugars in powders made from fruit and vegetable juices to be the same as those found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices because such powders are essentially concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that have all moisture removed. Therefore, some or all sugars contributed by a powder made from fruit or vegetable juices must be declared as added sugars on the label as required by the Nutrition Facts label final rule, depending on the degree of reconstitution in the finished food.\n\nThe definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.1707110404968262"], "Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?\n--------------------\nContext: iv.2.1 Appearance and Description (4.2.1)\n\nA qualitative statement describing the physical state (e.g., solid, liquid), color, and clarity of the drug product should be provided.\n\niv.2.2 Identity (4.2.2)\n\nThe identity test(s) should be highly specific for the drug product and should be based on unique aspects of its molecular structure and other specific properties. The identity test(s) can be qualitative in nature. While it is recognized that in most cases a single test is adequate, more than one test (physicochemical, biological, and/or immunochemical) may be necessary to establish identity for some products. Some of the methods typically used for characterization of the product, as described in section II.A and in appendix A, may be employed and/or modified as appropriate for the purpose of establishing identity.\n\niv.2.3 Purity and Impurities (4.2.3)\n\nImpurities may be generated or increased during manufacture and/or storage of the drug product. These may be either the same as those occurring in the drug substance itself, process-related, or degradation products which form specifically in the drug product during formulation or during storage. If impurities are qualitatively and quantitatively (i.e., relative amounts and/or concentrations) the same as in the drug substance, testing is not considered necessary. If impurities are known to be introduced or formed during the production and/or storage of the drug product, the levels of these impurities should be determined and acceptance criteria established.\n\nAcceptance criteria and analytical procedures should be developed and justified, based upon previous experience with the drug product, to measure changes in the drug substance during the manufacture and/or storage of the drug product.\n\nThe choice and optimization of analytical procedures should focus on the separation of the desired product and product-related substances from impurities including degradation products, and from excipients.\n\nPotency (4.2.4)\n\nA relevant, validated potency assay (section II.A.2) should be part of the specifications for a biotechnological and biological drug substance and/or drug product. When an appropriate potency assay is used for the drug substance, an alternative method (physicochemical and/or biological) may suffice for quantitative assessment of the drug product. However, the rationale for such a choice should be provided.\n\nQuantity (4.2.5)\n\nThe quantity of the drug substance in the drug product, usually based on protein content (mass), should be determined using an appropriate assay. In cases where product manufacture is based upon potency, there may be no need for an alternate determination of quantity.\n\nGeneral Tests (4.2.6)\n\nPhysical description and the measurement of other quality attributes are often important for the evaluation of the drug product functions. Examples of such tests include pH and osmolarity.\n\nAdditional Testing for Unique Dosage Forms (4.2.7)\n\nIt should be recognized that certain unique dosage forms may need additional tests other than those mentioned above.\n\nGLOSSARY (5.0)\n\nAcceptance criteria: Numerical limits, ranges, or other suitable measures for acceptance of the results of analytical procedures which the drug substance or drug product or materials at other stages of manufacture should meet.\n\nAction limit: An internal (in-house) value used to assess the consistency of the process at less critical steps.\n\nBiological activity: The specific ability or capacity of the product to achieve a defined biological effect. Potency is the quantitative measure of the biological activity.\n\nContaminants: Any adventitiously introduced materials (e.g., chemical, biochemical, or microbial species) not intended to be part of the manufacturing process of the drug substance or drug product.\n\nDegradation products: Molecular variants resulting from changes in the desired product or product-related substances brought about over time and/or by the action of, e.g., light, temperature, pH, water, or by reaction with an excipient and/or the immediate container/closure system. Such changes may occur as a result of manufacture and/or storage (e.g., deamidation, oxidation, aggregation, proteolysis). Degradation products may be either product-related substances or product-related impurities.\n\nDesired product: (1) The protein that has the expected structure, or (2) the protein that is expected from the DNA sequence and anticipated post-translational modification (including glycoforms), and from the intended downstream modification to produce an active biological molecule.\n\nDrug product (Dosage form; Finished product): A pharmaceutical product type that contains a drug substance, generally in association with excipients.\n\nDrug substance (Bulk material): The material that is subsequently formulated with excipients to produce the drug product. It can be composed of the desired product, product-related substances, and product- and process-related impurities. It may also contain excipients including other components, such as buffers.\n\nExipient: An ingredient added intentionally to the drug substance which should not have pharmacological properties in the quantity used.\n\nImpurity: Any component present in the drug substance or drug product that is not the desired product, a product-related substance, or an excipient including buffer components. It may be either process- or product-related.\n\nIn-house primary reference material: An appropriately characterized material prepared by the manufacturer from a representative lot(s) for the purpose of biological assay andphysicochemical testing of subsequent lots, and against which in-house working reference material is calibrated.\n\nIn-house working reference material A material prepared similarly to the primary reference material that is established solely to assess and control subsequent lots for the individual attribute in question. It is always calibrated against the in-house primary reference material.\n\nPotency: The measure of the biological activity using a suitably quantitative biological assay (also called potency assay or bioassay), based on the attribute of the product which is linked to the relevant biological properties.\n\nProcess-related impurities: Impurities that are derived from the manufacturing process. They may be derived from cell substrates (e.g., host cell proteins, host cell DNA), cell culture (e.g., inducers, antibiotics, or media components), or downstream processing (e.g., processing reagents or column leachables).\n\nProduct-related impurities: Molecular variants of the desired product (e.g., precursors, certain degradation products arising during manufacture and/or storage) which do not have properties comparable to those of the desired product with respect to activity, efficacy, and safety.\n\nProduct-related substances: Molecular variants of the desired product formed during manufacture and/or storage which are active and have no deleterious effect on the safety and efficacy of the drug product. These variants possess properties comparable to the desired product and are not considered impurities.\n\nReference standards: International or national standards.\n\nSpecification: A list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and appropriate acceptance criteria which are numerical limits, ranges, or other criteria for the tests described. It establishes the set of criteria to which a drug substance, drug product, or materials at other stages of its manufacture should conform to be considered acceptable for its intended use. Conformance to specification means that the drug substance and drug product, when tested according to the listed analytical procedures, will meet the acceptance criteria. Specifications are critical quality standards that are proposed and justified by the manufacturer and approved by regulatory authorities as conditions of approval.\n\nAppendix A Appendix for Physiochemical Characterization (6.1)\n\nThis appendix provides examples of technical approaches that might be considered for structural characterization and confirmation, and evaluation of physicochemical properties of the desired product, drug substance, and/or drug product. The specific technical approach employed will vary from product to product, and alternative approaches, other than those included in this appendix, will be appropriate in many cases. New analytical technology and modifications to existing technology are continuously being developed and should be utilized when appropriate.\n\n1. Structural Characterization and Confirmation (6.1.1)\n\na. Amino acid sequence\n\nThe amino acid sequence of the desired product should be determined to the extent possible using approaches such as those described in items (b) through (e) and then compared with the sequence of the amino acids deduced from the gene sequence of the desired product.\n\nb. Amino acid composition\n\nThe overall amino acid composition is determined using various hydrolytic and analytical procedures and compared with the amino acid composition deduced from the gene sequence for the desired product, or the natural counterpart, if considered necessary. In many cases, amino acid composition analysis provides some useful structural information for peptides and small proteins, but such data are generally less definitive for large proteins. Quantitative amino acid analysis data can also be used to determine protein content in many cases.\n\nc. Terminal amino acid sequence\n\nTerminal amino acid analysis is performed to identify the nature and homogeneity of the amino- and carboxy-terminal amino acids. If the desired product is found to be heterogeneous with respect to the terminal amino acids, the relative amounts of the variant forms should be determined using an appropriate analytical procedure. The sequence of these terminal amino acids should be compared with the terminal amino acid sequence deduced from the gene sequence of the desired product.\n\nd.

More than one test (physicochemical, biological and/or immunochemical) may be necessary to establish identity. The identity test(s) can be qualitative in nature. Some of the methods typically used for characterization of the product as described in section 2.1 and in Appendix 6.1 may be employed and/or modified as appropriate for the purpose of establishing identity.\n\n4.1.3 Purity and impurities\n\nThe absolute purity of biotechnological and biological products is difficult to determine and the results are method-dependent (section 2.1.4.). Consequently, the purity of the drug substance is usually estimated by a combination of methods. The choice and optimization of analytical procedures should focus on the separation of the desired product from product-related substances and from impurities.\n\nThe impurities observed in these products are classified as process-related and product-related:\n\nProcess-related impurities (section 2.1.4) in the drug substance may include cell culture media, host cell proteins, DNA, monoclonal antibodies or chromatographic media used in purification, solvents and buffer components. These impurities should be minimized by the use of appropriate well-controlled manufacturing processes.\n\nProduct-related impurities (section 2.1.4) in the drug substance are molecular variants with properties different from those of the desired product formed during manufacture and/or storage.\n\nFor the impurities, the choice and optimization of analytical procedures should focus on the separation of the desired product and product-related substances from impurities. Individual and/or collective acceptance criteria for impurities should be set, as appropriate. Under certain circumstances, acceptance criteria for selected impurities may not be required (section 2.3).\n\n4.1.4 Potency\n\nA relevant, validated potency assay (section 2.1.2) should be part of the specifications for a biotechnological or biological drug substance and/or drug product. When an appropriate potency assay is used for the drug product (section 4.2.4), an alternative method (physicochemical and/or biological) may suffice for quantitative assessment at the drug substance stage. In some cases, the measurement of specific activity may provide additional useful information.\n\n4.1.5 Quantity\n\nThe quantity of the drug substance, usually based on protein content (mass), should be determined using an appropriate assay. The quantity determination may be independent of a reference standard or material. In cases where product manufacture is based upon potency, there may be no need for an alternate determination of quantity.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q6B Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.474105954170227", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWe recommend that you incorporate the results of in-process sterility testing into your acceptance criteria for final product specifications.\n\nii. Identity\n\nWe recommend that identity assays uniquely identify a product and distinguish it from other products in the same facility. This test is performed on the final labeled product to verify its contents (21 CFR 610.14). Sometimes, a single test is not sufficient to distinguish clearly among products, and therefore, it is good practice to use different types of test methods (e.g., vector genome restriction digest and protein capsid analysis).\n\nIf the final product is ex vivo genetically modified cells, we recommend that identity testing include an assay to measure the presence of vector (i.e., expression assay, restriction digest) or genetic change and an assay specific for the cellular composition of the final product (e.g., cell surface markers).\n\niii. Purity\n\nProduct purity is defined as the relative freedom from extraneous matter in the finished product, whether or not it is harmful to the recipient or deleterious to the product (21 CFR 600.3(r)). Purity testing includes assays for pyrogenicity or endotoxin and residual manufacturing impurities, as outlined under section V.A.3.b., \"Impurities (3.2.S.3.2),\" of this guidance, of the DS, which may include, but are not limited to: proteins; DNA; cell debris; reagents/components used during manufacture, such as cytokines, growth factors, antibodies, and serum; and in the case of ex vivo genetically modified cells, any unintended cellular populations. The assays used to demonstrate product purity should be phase appropriate and may evolve during development as you develop greater understanding of the impurities present in your product, or as you make manufacturing process changes.\n\nAlthough the rabbit pyrogen test method is the current required method for testing certain licensed biological products for pyrogenic substances (21 CFR 610.13(b)), we generally accept alternative test methods, such as the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL).). For any parenteral drug, except those administered intratheally or intraocularly, we recommend that the upper limit of acceptance criterion for endotoxin be 5 Endotoxin Unit (EU)/kg body weight/hour. For intrathecally-administered drugs, we recommend an upper limit of acceptance be set at 0.2 EU/kg bodyweight/hour. For intraocularly-administered drugs, we recommend acceptance criterion of not more than (NMT) 2.0 EU/dose/eye for injected or implanted DPs or NMT 0.5 EU/mL for ophthalmic irrigation products. iv. Potency You should describe and justify in your IND all assays that you will use to measure potency. A potency assay is not required to initiate early phase clinical studies, but we recommend that you have a well-qualified assay to determine dose, as described below and in section V.A.4.c., \"Validation of Analytical Procedures (3.2.S.4.3),\" of this guidance. For additional information on potency assays, please see FDA's Guidance for Industry: \"Potency Tests for Cellular and Gene Therapy Products (Ref. 18). v. Viability You should establish minimum release criteria for viability, where appropriate. For ex vivo genetically modified cells, we recommend a minimum acceptable viability of at least 70 percent. If this level cannot be achieved, we recommend that you submit data in support of a lower viability specification, demonstrating, for example, that dead cells and cell debris do not affect the safe administration of the product and/or the therapeutic effect. vi. Cell Number or Dose Your dose-determining assay is an important part of your DP specifications and should be qualified as suitable for use prior to initiating clinical studies. For additional information on your dose-determining assay, please see section V.A.4.a., \"Specification (3.2.S.4.1),\" of this guidance. If your final product is genetically modified cell-based gene therapy, you should have an acceptance criterion for the minimum number of genetically modified cells in a product lot. We recommend that the product dose for such products be based on the total number of genetically modified cells. c. Validation of Analytical Procedures (3.2.P.5.3) Validation of analytical procedures is usually not required for original IND submissions, but we do recommend that you qualify certain safety-related or dose-related assays, even at an early stage of development (seesection V.A.4.c., \"Validation of Analytical Procedures (3.2.S.4.3),\" of this guidance). If they are the same as those listed for DS testing, you do not need to repeat them but should reference that section of your IND. d. Batch Analyses (3.2.P.5.4) You should provide final product COA(s), if available, or a description of the batches generated to date, and the results of any batch analyses for the DP used in toxicology studies, engineering runs, or clinical studies. Sponsors can also include supportive developmental batches, if appropriate. e. Characterization of Impurities (3.2.P.5.5) You should provide information on characterization of impurities if not previously provided in the \"Impurities (3.2.S.3.2)\" section of the CTD. f. Justification of Specifications (3.2.P.5.6) You should provide justification for the DP specifications. See section V.A.4.e., \"Justification of Specification (3.2.S.4.5),\" of this guidance for additional details.\n6. Reference Standards or Materials (3.2.P.6) You should provide information on the reference standards or reference materials used in testing the DP if not previously provided in the \"Reference Standards or Materials (3.2.S.5)\" section of the CTD.\n7. Container Closure System (3.2.P.7) You should provide a description of the container closure systems, including identity of construction materials for each primary packaging component and its specification. You should also provide information on how the container is sterilized.\n\nPlease see section V.B.5.d., \"Container Closure System (3.2.P.2.4),\" of this guidance for more information and recommendations, regarding the suitability of different final product containers.\n\nIf the final container is an FDA-cleared device, we recommend that you reference the 510(k) number for the device in your submission. For combination products containing a device constituent part, we recommend that you include a table of contents for the combination product (with reference links to other files) in this section, as described in FDA's \"eCTD Technical Conformance Guide: Technical Specifications Document\" (Ref. 4).\n\nStability (3.2.P.8)\n\nStability Summary and Conclusion (3.2.P.8.1) You should summarize the types of studies conducted, protocols used, and the results of the studies. Your summary should include, for example, conclusions regarding storage conditions and shelf life as well as in-use and in-device storage conditions. If a short-term clinical investigation is proposed, or if a DP manufacturing process has limited product hold times, stability data submitted may be correspondingly limited. Early in development, stability data for the gene therapy may not be available to support the entire duration of the proposed clinical investigation. Therefore, we recommend that you submit a prospective plan to collect stability information and update this information to the IND in a timely manner (e.g., in an annual IND update).\n\nPost-Approval Stability Protocol and Stability Commitment (3.2.P.8.2) We do not recommend that you provide a post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment in your IND submission. However, as product development continues, we recommend that you consult with your Quality Reviewer to determine the type of studies that will be necessary to support product expiration dates for commercial manufacturing.\n\nStability Data (3.2.P.8.3) You should provide results of the stability studies in your IND in an appropriate format (e.g., tabular, graphic, narrative). Information on the analytical procedures used to generate the data should also be included, and this may be referenced to other sections of your submission (e.g., \"Analytical Procedures (3.2.P.5.2)\" section of the CTD).\n\nAppendices (3.2.A)\n\nFacilities and Equipment (3.2.A.1) For early phase studies we recommend that facility information should include a diagram illustrating the manufacturing flow of the manufacturing areas, information on all developmental or approved products manipulated in this area, a summary of product contact equipment, and information on procedures and design features of the facility, to prevent contamination or cross-contamination. As noted in section III.D., \"Previously Submitted Information,\" of this guidance\nthis information may be cross-referenced to other regulatory files (e.g. Type V biologics master file).\n\nWe recommend that you include a description of your Quality Unit whose duties should include establishing procedures to qualify reagents and critical materials, prevent microbial contamination, cross-contamination, and product mix-ups. In addition, your Quality Unit should have procedures in place to investigate lot failures, out-of-specification results, and ways to implement corrective actions as product development progresses. We recommend that your IND include a summary of your Quality Unit, including the manner in which quality control testing and oversight are separated from the manufacturing unit.\n--------------------\nContext title: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) Information for Human Gene Therapy Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.1311671733856201", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?\n--------------------\nContext: Although an identity test on incoming components is required to be performed, a specific identity test is not needed under certain conditions (see 21 CFR 212.40(c). When the finished-product testing of a PET drug product includes testing to ensure that the correct components have been used, the PET drug producer need only determine that each lot of incoming components complies with written specifications by examining a certificate of analysis provided by the supplier (21 CFR 212.40(c)(1)(i)). We believe that the use of this type of finished-product testing makes specific identity testing of components redundant and unnecessary. For example, when identity of the F18 radionuclide is established as part of the finished-product testing and the method of production used is well-documented and understood, it can be reasonably argued that the component that yields this radionuclide is likely to be O 18 water. In this case, a specific identity test for O 18 water is not necessary before the lot is used in production. Similarly, a specific identity test before using a lot of mannose triflate might be redundant and unnecessary when (1) a well-understood method of synthesis of FDG is used, (2) a test to confirm the radiochemical identity is performed in the finished drug product, and (3) the mannose triflate was obtained from a reliable supplier with whom a relationship has been previously established and is accompanied by a certificate of analysis.\n\nWhat is FDA's current thinking on conditional final release testing if there was a problem or malfunction? Under the CGMP regulations at 21 CFR 212.70, you may not release another batch of the PET product until you have corrected the problem concerning the malfunction of analytical equipment. A reserve sample is needed to complete the finished product testing.\n\n*Which analytical techniques, if any, require validation?\n\nNew analytical procedures must be validated appropriately based on the intended use (see 21 CFR 212.60(c)). A compendial method, generally, does not need to be validated. However, you will need to show that the method is suitable for your product, analytical equipment, and system used. The following guidances may be useful in determining which parameters to validate:\n\nText on Validation of Analytical Procedures (ICH Q2A)\n\nQ2B Validation of Analytical Procedures: Methodology\n\nAnalytical Procedures and Methods Validation6\n\nValidation of Chromatographic Methods Footnote 6: This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nAlthough the radiosynthesis is processed in the hot cell, some operations are performed in the laboratory, such as HPLC operation, buffer preparation, and weighing raw materials on a scale. Is there any specified quality for the ceiling and floor (e.g., should we use seamless, washable material)? No. The ceiling, floor, and walls of the production and laboratory work area for PET drugs must be clean and designed to minimize the level of particulate contamination in the processing area of the final product (see 21 CFR 212.30). However, if you are constructing a new PET facility, seamless ceilings and floors are recommended to help ensure that they can be readily and thoroughly cleaned.\n\nCan the PET drug solution obtained from a synthesizer in the final product vial assembly be diluted to make the final formulation solution outside of the controlled environment? USP chapter (<)823(>) states that \"solutions for parenteral administrations must be filter sterilized and aseptically transferred to a sterile, nonpyrogenic\" vial. Further, the chapter also stipulates that aseptic manipulations must be performed within the aseptic hood. The final product vial assembly (everything that is post sterile filter and including the sterile filter) should be assembled in an aseptic hood using aseptic techniques. All entries into the sterile final product vial should be done using aseptic techniques. To mitigate the risk of contamination, we recommend that the direct dilution of the product be performed in the laminar flow hood. See also 21 CFR 212.30 and the guidance Media Fills for Validation for Aseptic Preparations for PET Drugs.\nQ80: Is it acceptable for the laminar flow hood to be in the same workspace as the production?\n\nYes, it is acceptable to have the laminar flow hood in the same workspace. Controls should be in place to prevent mix-ups and the potential for contamination. FDA expects that the hood would be placed in a controlled and clean area.\nQ81: At some sites, the drug product is synthesized and transferred into a dispensing cell in the Radiopharmacy, at which time the Quality Control (QC) sample, sterility sample, and retention sample are extracted just before drawing the finished unit dose for administration. How would FDA like to see the segregation of manufacturing activities from pharmacy practice activities?\n\nAlthough there is no specific FDA requirement that manufacturing and pharmacy activities should be in separate areas, pharmacy activities and relevant facility control should comply with State Pharmacy regulation and USP chapter (<)797(>).\n\nIf the proposed product is a multidose vial or a pharmacy bulk package, the operations leading up to the production of these containers are considered to be manufacturing operations. In this case, the QC sample must be obtained from the multidose vial with appropriate sampling if multiple containers are manufactured in a batch. If the \"HOW SUPPLIED\" section of the labeling indicates that the drug is supplied as a multidose container or as a pharmacy bulk pack and the multidose vial or the pharmacy bulk pack is released to the pharmacy, dispensing into unit doses (under the practice of pharmacy) is considered a pharmacy operation.\nQ82: Can the PET radiopharmaceutical manufacturing activities be conducted in the same room as the PET dose dispensing?\n\nYes, the production of PET drug products and the dispensing by prescription of patient-specific doses of PET drug in the practice of pharmacy may be done in the same work area. The area of the facility for these two activities and the work flow should be designed to prevent contamination and mix-ups.\nQ83: Can the QC samples be drawn from the vial in the same hot cell where the PET doses are dispensed?Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIt is acceptable for the drawing of QC samples from a PET drug product batch vial in the hot cell provided there are proper controls in place to prevent contamination and ingress into the product vial. It is, however, preferable to withdraw the QC sample in the laminar flow workstation to mitigate risk of microbial and particulate contamination. This is the case when the dilution to the bulk sample vial is conducted in the laminar flow workstation where the dose calibrator is located.\nQ84: What is the proper procedure for dispensing the pharmacy dose?\n\nThe dispensing of the pharmacy dose should not be done inside the hot cell. Pharmacy dispensing into individual prescription dose should be done under laminar flow, complying with State Pharmacy regulation and USP chapter (<)797(>).\nQ85: Please clarify the environmental air quality expectations and/or requirements for different areas within a PET manufacturing site. In general, what are the minimal environmental air quality monitoring requirements?\n\nThe air quality in the production and laboratory areas should be controlled to minimize the level of contamination (particulate and microbial) that may affect analyses or the quality, purity, and strength of the PET drug.\n\nThe air quality in the hot cell should be clean and controlled to minimize the level of particle and microbial contaminants that may affect the quality of the PET drug. We recommend the use of High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filtered air for this environment when the product is being sampled or diluted to reduce the possibility of microbial contamination.\n\nAseptic workstations (hoods) should meet Class 100 conditions using HEPA filtered laminar flow air. We recommend that these workstations be located in the facility away from foot traffic and other activity to reduce the chance of disruption to air flow and contamination of the workstation.\nQ86: Is it acceptable to use settling plates for environmental monitoring or will there be a requirement to use an active air sampling system?\n\nYes, settling plates are acceptable. We recommend that microbial monitoring of the aseptic workstation be conducted during sterility testing and critical aseptic manipulations. The methods used may also include active air sampling.\nQ87: Inspections have raised issues over the requirement of mandatory standards for cyclotron maintenance, including target rebuilds. Can FDA comment on the relevance of the request given the nature of the performance of the cyclotron and final product testing?\n\nFDA has not imposed any mandatory standards for cyclotron maintenance or target rebuild. Some attention may be devoted during an inspection to target window maintenance because over a period of time, the target window foils may get etched by the target beam that may cause leaching of unintended material (including radionuclides) into the irradiated isotopic solution.\n\nInspectors may review the records on target window maintenance (including target window rebuild) to identify any problems encountered, and corrective actions. Usually, inspectors will only devote attention to this issue if a quality problem has been identified.\n\nQ88: Are we required to submit a Field Alert Report to FDA on the failure of a distributed batch to meet the specifications (e.g., sterility) established in the application?\n\nYes (see 21 CFR 314.81). This also applies to PET drugs with an application pending FDA approval.\n\nQ89: If a PET producer submits a supplement to add a manufacturing facility or facilities, how much media fill data should be submitted in the supplement?\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Oversight of PET Drug Products -- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.3178200721740723", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?\n--------------------\nContext: A suitable internal standard (IS) should be added to all calibration standards, QCs and study samples during sample processing. The absence of an IS should be justified.\n\nIt is important that the reference standard is well characterised and the quality (e.g., purity, identity) of the reference standard and the suitability of the IS is ensured, as the quality will affect the outcome of the analysis and, therefore, the study data. The reference standard used during validation and study sample analysis should be obtained from an authentic and traceable source. The reference standard should be identical to the analyte. If this is not possible, an established form (e.g., salt or hydrate) of known quality should be used.\n\nSuitable reference standards include compendial standards, commercially available standards or sufficiently characterised standards prepared in-house or by an external organisation. A certificate of analysis (CoA) or an equivalent alternative is required to ensure quality and to provide information on the purity, storage conditions, retest/expiration date and batch number of the reference standard.\n\nA CoA is not required for the IS as long as the suitability for use is demonstrated, e.g., a lack of analytical interference is shown for the substance itself or any impurities thereof.\n\nWhen MS detection is used, the use of the stable isotope-labelled analyte as the IS is recommended whenever possible. However, it is essential that the labelled standard is of high isotope purity and that no isotope exchange reaction occurs. The presence of unlabelled analyte should be checked and if unlabelled analyte is detected, the potential influence should be evaluated during method validation.\n\nStock and working solutions should only be prepared from reference standards that are within the stability period as documented in the CoA (either expiration date or the retest date).\n\nValidation\n\n3.2.1 Selectivity\n\nSelectivity is the ability of an analytical method to differentiate and measure the analyte in the presence of potential interfering substances in the blank biological matrix.\n\nSelectivity should be evaluated using blank samples (matrix samples processed without addition of an analyte or IS) obtained from at least 6 individual sources/lots (non-haemolysed and non-lipaemic). Use of fewer sources may be acceptable in the case of rare matrices. Selectivity for the IS should also be evaluated.\n\nThe evaluation of selectivity should demonstrate that no significant response attributable to interfering components is observed at the retention time(s) of the analyte or the IS in the blank samples. Responses attributable to interfering components should not be more than 20% of the analyte response at the LLOQ and not more than 5% of the IS response in the LLOQ sample for each matrix.\n--------------------\nContext title: M10_Guideline_Step4_2022_0524\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.389448165893555", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Which tests are considered to be identity tests?\n--------------------\nContext: It is important that the reference standard is well characterized and the quality (e.g., purity, identity) of the reference standard and the suitability of the IS is ensured, as the quality will affect the outcome of the analysis and, therefore, the study data.

Use of fewer sources may be acceptable in the case of rare matrices. Selectivity for the IS should also be evaluated.\n\nThe evaluation of selectivity should demonstrate that no significant response attributable to interfering components is observed at the retention time(s) of the analyte or the IS in the blank samples. Responses attributable to interfering components should not be more than 20% of the analyte response at the LLOQ and not more than 5% of the IS response in the LLOQ sample for each matrix.\n\nFor the investigation of selectivity in lipemic matrices at least one source of matrix should be used. To be scientifically meaningful, the matrix used for these tests should be representative as much as possible of the expected study samples. A naturally lipemic matrix with abnormally high levels of triglycerides should be obtained from donors. Although it is recommended to use lipemic matrix from donors, if this is difficult to obtain, matrix can be spiked with triglycerides even though it may not be representative of study samples. However, if the drug impacts lipid metabolism or if the intended patient population is hyperlipidemic, the use of spiked samples is discouraged. This evaluation is not necessary for nonclinical studies unless the drug impacts lipid metabolism or is administered in a particular animal strain that is hyperlipidemic.\n\nFor the investigation of selectivity in hemolyzed matrices at least one source of matrix should be used. Hemolyzed matrices should be obtained by spiking matrix with hemolyzed whole blood (at least 2% V/V) to generate a visibly detectable hemolyzed sample.\n\n2.2.2 Specificity (3.2.2)\n\nSpecificity is the ability of a bioanalytical method to detect and differentiate the analyte from other substances, including its related substances (e.g., substances that are structurally similar to the analyte, metabolites, isomers, impurities, degradation products formed during sample preparation, or concomitant medications that are expected to be used in the treatment of patients with the intended indication).\n\nIf the presence of related substances is anticipated in the biological matrix of interest, the impact of such substances should be evaluated during method validation, or alternatively, in the pre-dose study samples. In the case of LC-MS based methods, to assess the impact of such substances, the evaluation may include comparing the molecular weight of a potential interfering related substance with the analyte and chromatographic separation of the related substance from the analyte.\n\nResponses detected and attributable to interfering components should not be more than 20% of the analyte response at the LLOQ and not more than 5% of the IS response in the LLOQ sample.\n\nThe possibility of back-conversion of a metabolite into the parent analyte during the successive steps of the analysis (including extraction procedures or in the MS source) should also be evaluated when relevant (e.g., potentially unstable metabolites such as ester analytes to ester/acidic metabolites, unstable N-oxides or glucuronide metabolites, lactone-ring structures). It is acknowledged that this evaluation will not be possible in the early stages of drug development of a new chemical entity when the metabolism is not yet evaluated. However, this issue should be investigated, and partial validation performed, if needed. The extent of back conversion, if any, should be established and the impact on the study results should be discussed in the Bioanalytical Report.\n\nii.2.3 Matrix Effect (3.2.3)\n\nA matrix effect is defined as an alteration of the analyte response due to interfering and often unidentified component(s) in the sample matrix. During method validation the matrix effect between different independent sources/lots should be evaluated.\n\nThe matrix effect should be evaluated by analyzing at least three replicates of low and high QCs, each prepared using matrix from at least six different sources/lots. For each individual matrix sources/lots evaluated, the accuracy should be within (\\pm 15\\%) of the nominal concentration and the precision (percent coefficient of variation (%CV)) should not be greater than 15%. Use of fewer sources/lots may be acceptable in the case of rare matrices.\n\nThe matrix effect should also be evaluated in relevant patient populations or special populations (e.g., hepatically impaired or renally impaired) when available. An additional evaluation of the matrix effect is recommended using hemolyzed or lipemic matrix samples during method validation on a case-by-case basis, especially when these conditions are expected to occur within the study.\n\nii.2.4 Calibration Curve and Range (3.2.4)\n\nThe calibration curve demonstrates the relationship between the nominal analyte concentration and the response of the analytical platform to the analyte. Calibration standards, prepared by spiking matrix with a known quantity of analyte(s), span the calibration range and comprise the calibration curve. Calibration standards should be prepared in the same biological matrix as the study samples. The calibration range is defined by the LLOQ, which is the lowest calibration standard, and the ULOQ, which is the highest calibration standard. There should be one calibration curve for each analyte studied during method validation and for each analytical run.\n\nA calibration curve should be generated with a blank sample, a zero sample (blank sample spiked with IS), and at least six concentration levels of calibration standards, including the LLOQ and the ULOQ.\n\nA simple regression model that adequately describes the concentration-response relationship should be used. The selection of the regression model should be directed by written procedures. The regression model, weighting scheme, and transformation should be determined during the method validation. Blank and zero samples should not be included in the determination of the regression equation for the calibration curve. Each calibration standard may be analyzed in replicate, in which case data from all acceptable replicates should be used in the regression analysis.\n\nThe calibration curve parameters should be reported (e.g., slope and intercept in the case of a linear model). The back-calculated concentrations of the calibration standards should be presented together with the calculated mean accuracy and precision values. All acceptable curvesobtained during validation, based on a minimum of three independent runs over several days, should be reported. The accuracy of the back-calculated concentrations of each calibration standard should be within (\\pm 20\\%) of the nominal concentration at the LLOQ and within (\\pm 15\\%) at all the other levels. At least (75\\%) of the calibration standards with a minimum of six calibration standard levels should meet the above criteria.\n\nIn the case that replicates are used, the criteria (within (\\pm 15\\%) or (\\pm 20\\%) for LLOQ) should also be fulfilled for at least (50\\%) of the calibration standards tested per concentration level. In the case that a calibration standard does not comply with these criteria, this calibration standard sample should be rejected, and the calibration curve without this calibration standard should be reevaluated, including regression analysis. For accuracy and precision runs, if all replicates of the LLOQ or the ULOQ calibration standard in a run are rejected, then the run should be rejected, the possible source of the failure should be determined and the method revised, if necessary. If the next validation run also fails, then the method should be revised before restarting validation.\n--------------------\nContext title: M10 Bioanalytical Method Validation and Study Sample Analysis\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.835134029388428"], "In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA receives frequent inquiries from the academic community (e.g., clinical investigators, IRBs) and the pharmaceutical industry about whether an IND should be submitted for various types of clinical research. Inquiries have related to a range of issues concerning application of the IND requirements in part 312, including, for example:\n\nClinical investigations using marketed drugs\n\nBioequivalence/bioavailability studies\n\nStudies using radiolabeled or cold isotopes\n\nStudies using dietary supplements or foods\n\nStudies using endogenous compounds\n\nPathogenesis studies using modified organisms\n\nStudies using wild-type organisms in challenge models\n\nStudies that do not have a commercial purpose\n\nBecause of the large number of inquiries and wide range of issues, FDA determined that it would be helpful to provide to potential sponsors, clinical investigators, and sponsor-investigators an overview of the IND requirements and related issues.\n\nWith certain exceptions, clinical investigations in which a drug is administered to human subjects must be conducted under an IND as required in part 312. Sections 3, 4, and 5 of this guidance elaborate on the criteria for when a study must be conducted under an IND; the types of studies that involve drugs, but that are exempt from the IND requirements; studies involving radioactive drugs that are generally recognized as safe and effective (and to which IND requirements therefore do not apply); and FDA's use of enforcement discretion with respect to certain studies using cold isotopes conducted without an IND. Section 6 discusses specific issues that frequently arise concerning application of the IND regulations; section 7 contains frequently asked questions; and section 8 describes the process for seeking advice from FDA concerning the application of the IND regulations to a planned clinical investigation.\n\n3 Research studies that require an IND\n\nIn general, the IND regulations in part 312 require that human research studies be conducted under an IND if all of the following conditions exist:* The research involves a drug as that term is defined in section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)).\n* The research is a clinical investigation as defined in the IND regulations (21 CFR 312.3).\n* The clinical investigation is not otherwise exempt from the IND requirements in part 312 (see section IV of this guidance).\n\n1 What Is a Drug?\n\nThe definition of the term drug in section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act includes, among other things, \"articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease...\" and \"articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.\" Biological products subject to licensure under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) may also be considered drugs within the meaning of the FD&C Act. A biological product is:\n\n... a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, protein (except any chemically synthesized polypeptide), or analogous product, or argphenamine or derivative of argphenamine (or any other trivalent organic arsenic compound), applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings.\n\nBiological products include, among other products, bacterial vaccines, allergenic extracts, gene therapy products, growth factors, cytokines, and monoclonal antibodies.\n\nIt is important to note that the drug definition is not limited to compounds intended for a therapeutic purpose.4 The definition also includes compounds intended to affect the structure or function of the body, without regard to whether the compound is intended to influence a disease process. For example, the definition includes compounds administered to healthy individuals to prevent pregnancy or treat male pattern baldness. The definition also includes compounds used for research purposes in healthy subjects to blunt or provoke a physiologic response or study the mechanism of action or metabolism of a drug (see section VI.A). Note, however, that (1) a dietary supplement intended only to affect the structure or function of the body and not intended for a therapeutic purpose is not a drug5 (see section VI.D.1) and (2) a food used as such (i.e., primarily for its taste, aroma, or nutritive value) and not for a therapeutic purpose or to affect the structure or function of the body, other than by providing nutrition, is not a drug (see section VI.D.2).6\n\nWhat Is a Clinical Investigation?\n\nThe IND regulations in SS 312.3(b) define clinical investigation7 as:\n\nFootnote 7: Additional information on clinical investigations is available on FDA\u2019s Web site at http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/default.htm.\n\n... [an] experiment in which a drug is administered or dispensed to, or used involving, one or more human subjects. For the purposes of [the IND regulations], an experiment is any use of a drug [whether approved or unapproved] except for the use of a marketed drug in the course of medical practice.\n\nFor example, a randomized trial evaluating an unapproved use of a lawfully marketed drug is a clinical investigation and may require an IND.8 In contrast, use of a lawfully marketed drug for an unapproved use in the course of medical practice is not a clinical investigation and does not require an IND because it involves the use in an individual patient where the primary intent is to treat the patient.\n\nFootnote 8: See section IV.A of this guidance.\n\nIV Clinical Investigations that are Exempt from the IND requirements by Regulation\n\nFDA regulations describe two categories of clinical investigations that are exempt from the IND requirements in part 312, provided the criteria for exemption are met (see 21 CFR 312.2(b) and 320.31(b)). The two categories of clinical investigations and the applicable criteria are described in the following subsections. Ordinarily, clinical investigations of drugs that do not meet these criteria must be conducted under an IND as required in part 312.\n\nCertain Research Involving Marketed Drug Products\n\nWhether an IND is needed to conduct a clinical investigation of a marketed drug primarily depends on the intent of the investigation and the degree of risk associated with the use of the drug in the investigation. A clinical investigation of a marketed drug is exempt from the IND requirements if all of the criteria for an exemption in SS 312.2(b) are met:\n\nThe drug product is lawfully marketed in the United States.\n\nThe investigation is not intended to be reported to FDA as a well-controlled study in support of a new indication and there is no intent to use it to support any other significant change in the labeling of the drug.\n\nIn the case of a prescription drug, the investigation is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the drug.\n\nThe investigation does not involve a route of administration, dose, patient population, or other factor that significantly increases the risk (or decreases the acceptability of the risk) associated with the use of the drug product (21 CFR 312.2(b)(1)(iii)).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements for review by an IRB (21 CFR part 56) and with the requirements for informed consent (21 CFR part 50).\n\nThe investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements of SS 312.7 (i.e., the investigation is not intended to promote or commercialize the drug product).\n\nThe potential sponsor or sponsor-investigator of a planned clinical investigation using a marketed drug is responsible for determining whether the investigation meets the criteria for an exemption.9 If there is uncertainty about whether the exemption criteria are met, the potential sponsor or sponsor-investigator can seek advice from FDA on the applicability of the IND regulations (SS 312.2(e)).\n\nFootnote 9: The preamble to the rule finalizing the IND regulations provides: FDA recognizes that a considerable amount of professional judgment must be exercised in determining whether the conditions of an investigation \u201csignificantly increase\u201d the risk associated with use of the drug. Because the assessment of risks involved in a therapeutic procedure is an everyday part of the practice of medicine, the individual investigator should usually be able to determine the applicability of the exemption. (See the final rule on New Drug, Antibiotic, and Biologic Drug Product Regulations that published in the Federal Register of March 19, 1987 (52 FR 8798 at 8802)).\n\nThree of the criteria for exemption listed previously merit further discussion.\n\nWhat is meant by a drug product that is lawfully marketed in the United States?\n\nThe preamble to the final rule incorporating the IND exemption criteria into the IND regulations makes clear that the exemption provision was not intended to require use of only the marketed version of the drug product for a clinical investigation to be exempt from the IND requirements. The intent was to provide some latitude to modify the marketed version of the drug product for use in a clinical investigation. In responding to comments asking FDA to clarify to what extent a sponsor could change the marketed drug product or conditions of use and still be exempt from the IND regulations, FDA stated that: The exemption was not intended to require an investigator to use the drug in exactly the same dosage form, dosage levels, and patient populations described in the marketed labeling for the product, but rather to permit changes to the lawfully marketed drug product that do not increase the risks...over the risk presented by use of the product in conformance with its marketed labeling.10\n\nFootnote 10: Final rule, \u201cNew Drug, Antibiotic, and Biologic Drug Product Regulations\u201d (52 FR 8798 at 8801, March 19, 1987).\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.046482563018799", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n\nFDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nOffice of Good Clinical Practice\n\nMarch 2012\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:4]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nGuidance for Industry and FDA Staff1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Good Clinical Practice (OGCP) in the Office of the Commissioner (OC) in coordination with the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nFDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies\n\nNot Conducted Under an IND\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nOn April 28, 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) amended its regulations on the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application (IND) (\"non-IND foreign clinical studies\") as support for an IND or a new drug application (NDA), abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or a biologics license application (BLA) (collectively known as \"marketing applications\" or \"applications for marketing approval\").2 The final rule requires that such studies be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP), including review and approval by an independent ethics committee (IEC) and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. This final rule, which took effect on October 27, 2008, is codified at 21 CFR 312.120. It is intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data.\n\nFootnote 2: 73 Fed. Reg. 22800 (April 28, 2008).\n\nThis guidance is applicable to all applications submitted under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and\n\nCosmetic Act (FD& C Act) (21 U.S.C. 355) or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262).\n\nThis guidance document is intended to clarify for sponsors and applicants how they can\n\ndemonstrate compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.3 It provides\n\nrecommendations for the submission of information, whether in an IND or application for\n\nmarketing approval for a drug or biological drug product,4 to demonstrate that a non-IND foreign clinical study was conducted in accordance with GCP.\n\nFootnote 4: For the purposes of this guidance, all references to drugs, drug products, and drug substances include both human\n\ndrug products and biological drug products regulated by CDER and CBER, unless otherwise specified.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nClinical research is becoming increasingly global, as detailed in reports by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (\"OIG Reports\").5 FDA recognizes that sponsors may choose to conduct multinational clinical studies under a variety of scenarios. Multinational studies may include domestic sites conducted under an IND, foreign sites conducted under an IND, and/or foreign sites not conducted under an IND.6 Sponsors may decide to use the data that is obtained from non-IND foreign sites to support clinical investigations and/or marketing approval(s) in the United States. Some sponsors may even seek to rely solely on foreign clinical data as support for an IND or application for marketing approval in the U.S.7 Indeed, the number of INDs and applications for marketing approval supported by foreign clinical trials has increased in recent years and will likely continue to increase in the future.\n\nFootnote 5: See HHS OIG Report, Challenges to FDA\u2019s Ability to Monitor and Inspect Foreign Clinical Trials (June 2010), OEI-01-08-00510, available at http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-08-00510.pdf; HHS OIG Report, The Globalization of Clinical Trials: A Growing Challenge in Protecting Human Subjects (September 2001), OEI-01-00-00190, available at http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-00-00190.pdf.\n\nFootnote 6: For information on how conducting both IND and non-IND studies affects the requirement for investigators to sign the Form FDA 1572, see FDA\u2019s Guidance, Information Sheet Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs: Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572), available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM214282.pdf.\n\nThis increasing globalization of clinical trials presents challenges to both U.S. and foreign regulators, many of which are detailed in the OIG reports. Among other challenges, resource constraints limit the number of foreign clinical site inspections that can be conducted. To address these challenges, FDA has sought to leverage its resources more efficiently by: (1) encouraging sponsors to utilize data standardization in their INDs and applications for marketing approval, in order to improve review and analysis of data and facilitate implementation of a site selection model to prioritize sites for inspection; (2) engaging in collaboration and outreach with international regulatory authorities; and (3) considering alternative mechanisms of clinical trial oversight both by sponsors and FDA, such as a quality management system approach which emphasizes building quality into the research process.\n\nThis guidance document is part of FDA's overall efforts to strengthen oversight of foreign clinical trials.8 Specifically, FDA is issuing this guidance as part of its efforts to encourage sponsors and applicants to standardize information relating to foreign clinical trials in their INDs and applications for marketing approval (see (1), above). This guidance should help sponsorsand applicants submit information in a consistent and standardized manner to demonstrate compliance with the requirements in 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nMuch of the information in this guidance comes from the preamble to the final rule, 73 Fed. Reg. 22800 (April 28, 2008). It is organized in a question and answer format that tracks the regulatory provisions. In addition to addressing the substantive requirements of the final rule, this guidance addresses organization and submission procedures. Specifically, as described in Section III.B, when sponsors or applicants submit information about a non-IND foreign clinical study, they should clearly identify in the cover letter (a) that the material is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120, and (b) where in the submission the information required by 21 CFR 312.120(b) can be located.\n\nAlthough FDA will not accept as support for an IND or application for marketing approval any study that does not meet the conditions of 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will examine the data from such a study because the data may have a bearing on the safe use of the product.9 Sponsors and applicants are reminded that they must submit all studies and other information as required under the applicable regulations for drugs,10 including studies that do not comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nFootnote 9: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(2); 73 Fed. Reg. at 22807.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nA sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived.11 When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with the requirements in 21 CFR 312.120 in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Under 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and if FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary.12 Note that marketing approval of a new drug based solely on foreign clinical data is governed by 21 CFR 314.106.\n\nFootnote 10: See, for example, 21 CFR 314.50, 314.80, 600.80, and 601.2.\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR part 312.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.077178716659546", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nTreatment Use of Investigational Drugs\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/treatment-use-investigational-drugs).\n\nOffice of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nInvestigational products are sometimes used for treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions either for a single subject or for a group of subjects. The procedures that have evolved for an investigational new drug (IND) used for these purposes reflect the recognition by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that, when no satisfactory alternative treatment exists, subjects are generally willing to accept greater risks from test articles that may treat life-threatening and debilitating illnesses. The following mechanisms expand access to promising therapeutic agents without compromising the protection afforded to human subjects or the thoroughness and scientific integrity of product development and marketing approval.\n\nOpen Label Protocol or Open Protocol Ind\n\nThese are usually uncontrolled studies, carried out to obtain additional safety data (Phase 3 studies). They are typically used when the controlled trial has ended and treatment is continued so that the subjects and the controls may continue to receive the benefits of the investigational drug until marketing approval is obtained. These studies require prospective Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and informed consent.\n\nTreatment Ind\n\nThe treatment IND [21 CFR 312-34 and 312-35] is a mechanism for providing eligible subjects with investigational drugs for the treatment of serious and life-threatening illnesses for which there are no satisfactory alternative treatments. A treatment IND may be granted after sufficient data have been collected to show that the drug \"may be effective\" and does not have unreasonable risks. Because data related to safety and side effects are collected, treatment INDs also serve to expand the body of knowledge about the drug.\n\nThere are four requirements that must be met before a treatment IND can be issued: 1) the drug is intended to treat a serious or immediately life-threatening disease; 2) there is no satisfactory alternative treatment available; 3) the drug is already under investigation, ortrials have been completed; and 4) the trial sponsor is actively pursuing marketing approval. Treatment IND studies require prospective IRB review and informed consent. A sponsor may apply for a waiver of local IRB review under a treatment IND if it can be shown to be in the best interest of the subjects, and if a satisfactory alternate mechanism for assuring the protection of human subjects is available, e.g., review by a central IRB. Such a waiver does not apply to the informed consent requirement. An IRB may still opt to review a study even if FDA has granted a waiver. Treatment INDs are discussed under the general heading of expanded access to investigational drugs. On August 13, 2009, FDA issued in the Federal Register 21 CFR Part 312 and 316, Charging for Investigational Drugs Under an Investigational New Drug Application; Expanded Access to Investigational Drugs for Treatment Use; Final Rules. These rules include clinical studies conducted under an IND as well as treatment protocols and treatment INDs. These rules and the accompanying preamble are available at http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-19004.pdf (http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-19004.pdf).\n\nGroup C Treatment IND\n\nThe \"Group C\" treatment IND was established by agreement between FDA and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The Group C program is a means for the distribution of investigational agents to oncologists for the treatment of cancer under protocols outside the controlled clinical trial. Group C drugs are generally Phase 3 study drugs that have shown evidence of relative and reproducible efficacy in a specific tumor type. They can generally be administered by properly trained physicians without the need for specialized supportive care facilities. Group C drugs are distributed only by the National Institutes of Health under NCI protocols. Although treatment is the primary objective and patients treated under Group C guidelines are not part of a clinical trial, safety and effectiveness data are collected. Because administration of Group C drugs is not done with research intent, FDA has generally granted a waiver from the IRB review requirements [21 CFR 56.105]. Even though FDA has granted a waiver for these drugs, an IRB may still choose to conduct a review under its policies and procedures. The usage of a Group C drug is described in its accompanying \"Guideline Protocol\" document. The Guideline Protocol contains an FDA-approved informed consent document which must be used if there has been no local IRB review.\n\nParallel Track\n\nThe Agency's Parallel Track policy [57 FR 13250] permits wider access to promising new drugs for AIDS/HIV related diseases under a separate \"expanded access\" protocol that \"parallels\" the controlled clinical trials that are essential to establish the safety and effectiveness of new drugs. It provides an administrative system that expands the availability of drugs for treating AIDS/HIV. These studies require prospective IRB review and informed consent.\n\nEmergence use IND\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]\n--------------------\nContext title: Treatment Use of Investigational Drugs Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.056520938873291", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry\n\nIND Exemptions for Studies of Lawfully Marketed Drug or Biological Products for the Treatment of Cancer\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nJanuary 2004\n\nClinical Medical\n\nRevision 1\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nAbstract\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if that approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist sponsors in deciding whether a study of marketed drugs or biological products for treating cancer falls within the exemption under SS 312.2(b)(1) (21 CFR 312.2(b)(1)) from the general requirement to submit an investigational new drug application (IND). The guidance discusses the Agency's current thinking on when studies of marketed cancer products are exempt from IND regulation based on a risk assessment. The Agency hopes that clarifying its policy will help sponsors identify which studies are exempt, thus saving them from submitting unnecessary IND applications.\n\nThis guidance revises the guidance of the same title published in September 2003. In the September 2003 version, the Agency's final statement was that it believed that most randomized studies of a size that could support a labeling supplement would likely not be exempt from IND regulation under SS 312.2(b)(1)(i), (ii). This is because they would be intended to support approval of a new indication, a significant change in the product labeling, or a significant change in advertising. Experience has shown that this interpretation was formulated too broadly and inappropriately referred to size alone. The Agency has decided to revise this guidance by removing that statement (the last sentence in section V.B). Whether a study could support a change in labeling is a complex determination, based on study design, size, and other factors.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements arecited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nGenerally, regulations in part 312 (21 CFR part 312) require sponsors who wish to study a drug or biological product in humans to submit an IND to the Agency.2 However, these regulations also provide for the exemption of some studies from the requirement to submit an IND if they meet certain criteria. Each year, many INDs for cancer drugs are submitted that contain studies that the Agency determines are exempt. This guidance is intended to help applicants identify which studies may be exempt.\n\nFootnote 2: Part 312 applies to all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) or to the licensing provisions of the Public Health Service Act (58 Stat. 632, as amended (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.)).\n\nRegulations\n\nRegulations in SS 312.2(b)(1) provide for the exemption of some studies for some drugs from IND regulations if the studies meet the following five criteria:\n\nThe study is not intended to support FDA approval of a new indication or a significant change in the product labeling.\n\nThe study is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the product.\n\nThe investigation does not involve a route of administration or dosage level or use in a patient population or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug product.\n\nThe study is conducted in compliance with institutional review board (IRB) and informed consent regulations set forth in parts 56 and 50 (21 CFR parts 56 and 50).\n\nThe study is conducted in compliance with SS 312.7 (promotion and charging for investigational drugs).\n\nRequirements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are not directly related to the specific protocol submitted, and their interpretation is similar for oncologic and nononcologic therapies. Requirement 3 is protocol related and has special meaning in the oncology therapy setting, particularly with respect to doses above the labeled dose, use with other treatments, and use in different populations.\n\nIn the preamble to the IND regulations, which published in the Federal Register on March 19, 1987, the Agency explained that the exemption was not necessarily intended to tie the investigator to the doses and routes of administration and patient population described in the approved labeling, but to permit deviations from the approved labeling to the extent that such changes are supported by the scientific literature and generally known clinical experience. The Agency recognizes that a considerable amount of professional judgment is exercised in determining whether the planned investigation significantly increases the risk associated with the use of the drug. FDA maintains that \"because the assessment of risks involved in a therapeutic procedure is an everyday part of the practice of medicine, the individual investigator should usually be able to determine the applicability of the exemption.\"3\n\nFootnote 3: New Drug, Antibiotic, and Biologic Drug Product Regulations, Federal Register, March 19, 1987, Vol. 52, Nr. 53, p. 8802.\n\n1996 Agency Cancer Initiative\n\nIn 1996, as part of the President's National Performance Review, the Agency launched its Reinventing the Regulation of Cancer Drugs initiative with the goal of accelerating the approval of and expanding patient access to cancer drugs.4 As part of this initiative, the Agency explained that many sponsor-investigators were submitting INDs for exploratory studies for so-called off-label indications for two reasons: (1) IRBs incorrectly believe an IND is required, or (2) the pharmaceutical manufacturer agrees to provide a drug free of charge, but mistakenly concludes that the FDA will view this as promotional activity. With the intent of clarifying the Agency's policy and decreasing the number of unnecessary submissions, the Agency emphasized that it would no longer accept INDs considered exempt under SS 312.2(b)(1). (See SS 312.2(b)(4).) Furthermore, FDA stated that providing a drug for study would not, in and of itself, be viewed as a promotional activity if the manufacturer or distributor provides the product for a physician-initiated, bona fide clinical investigation. The Agency explained that it is the responsibility of the investigator to determine whether an IND is necessary.\n\nFootnote 4: Reinventing the Regulation of Cancer Drugs \u2013 Accelerating Approval and Expanding Access (March 1996), CBER, Office of Communication, Training, and Manufacturer Assistance, Voice Information System at 1-800-835-4709 or 301-827-1800, document ID number 0281. Available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cber/genadmin/reincanc.htm\n\nDespite the Agency's attempts to clarify its policy on IND exemptions, many cancer drug IND applications that the Agency determines are exempt from IND regulation are still being submitted unnecessarily. From 1997 to 1999, a majority of investigator IND submissions for marketed cancer drugs were considered exempt (204, 205, and 140 applications in 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively).\n\nIII Risk/Benefit analysis in the practice of oncology\n\nAs noted above, a critical question in determining whether a study is exempt involves criterion 3 in the exemption regulations (SS 312.2(b)(1)(iii)): The investigation may not significantly increase the risk associated with use of a drug product. The question of increased risk is determined by assessing the deviation in the planned investigation from the use described in the approved label. In oncology, modifications of labeled dosing recommendations are common and occur as part of oncologists' clinical practice. As outlined below, oncologists are familiar with evaluating the risk of off-label dosing regimens for cancer drug and biological products.\n\nTreatment with cancer drugs may be associated with significant risk from known toxicity. Because effectiveness is often related to dose, a dose close to the maximal tolerated dose is often selected for studies of cancer drugs. This same dose usually becomes the recommended dose in labeling when the new cancer drug is approved with the knowledge that the dose may be altered if it is not tolerated by a patient. Because it is not generally possible to have maximal efficacy in a population without inducing toxicity in some patients, it is not uncommon to observe severe or even lethal side effects from cancer drugs in some patients. In general, these circumstances mean that the toxicity, even potentially lethal toxicity, of cancer drugs is described in approved labeling.\n--------------------\nContext title: IND Exemptions for Studies of Lawfully Marketed Drug or Biological Products for the Treatment of Cancer Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.8617061376571655", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry\n\nContent and Format of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Phase 1 studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-derived Products\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nNovember 1995\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nI.

REFERENCESGUIDANCE FOR INDUSTRY1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration. Although this guidance does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the industry, it does represent the agency's current thinking on data requirement issues related to the initial entry of an unapproved drug into human studies in the United States. For additional copies of this guidance, contact the Consumer Affairs Branch (formerly the Executive Secretariat Staff), HFD-210, CDER, FDA, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857 (Phone: 301-594-1012) or the Congressional and Consumer Affairs Branch (HFM-12), CBER, FDA, 1401 Rockville Pike (STE 200N), Rockville, MD 20852-1448 (Phone: 301-594-1800 or 800-835-4709). An electronic version of this guidance is also available via Internet by connecting to the CDER file transfer protocol (FTP) server (CDVS2.CDER.FDA.GOV).\n\n1 Introduction\n\nWith FDA's recent successes in meeting the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 (PDUFA) review action performance goals, and the resulting significant declines in mean and median time from submission of a marketing application to approval for marketing, attention has turned to increasing the efficiency of other components of the drug development process without sacrificing the long-standing safety and efficacy standards Americans expect their drug products to meet. One part of IND regulation of particular interest - under active discussion for more than two years and the subject of various degrees of attention since the McMahon Committee - is the regulation of the initial testing of drugs in humans (i.e., Phase 1 trials).\n\nThis guidance clarifies requirements for data and data presentation in 21 CFR 312.22 and 312.23 related to the initial entry into human studies in the United States of an investigational drug, including well-characterized, therapeutic, biotechnology-derived products2. Present regulations allow a great deal of flexibility in the amount and depth of various data to be submitted in an IND depending in large part on the phase of investigation and the specific human testing being proposed. In some cases, the extent of that flexibility has not been appreciated. FDA believes clarifications of many of these requirements will help expedite entry of new drugs into clinical testing by increasing transparency and reducing ambiguity and inconsistencies, and by reducing the amount of information submitted, while providing FDA with the data it needs to assess the safety of the proposed Phase 1 study. If the guidance specified in this document is followed, IND submissions for Phase 1 studies should usually not be larger than two to three, three inch, 3-ring binders (\"jackets\").\n\nThe most significant clarifications are: 1) the explicit willingness to accept an integrated summary report of toxicology findings based upon the unaudited draft toxicologic reports of completed animal studies as initial support for human studies, and 2) specific manufacturing data appropriate for a Phase 1 investigation. For products not covered by this Guidance, other FDA guidance documents should be consulted. In addition, the Center responsible for the product may be contacted for guidance.\n\nBecause of the manufacturing and toxicologic differences between well-characterized, therapeutic, biotechnology-derived products and other biologic products, this Guidance only applies to drugs and well-characterized, therapeutic, biotechnology-derived products. For products not covered by this Guidance, the Center responsible for the product should be contacted for guidance.\n\nThis guidance applies equally to both commercial and individual investigator sponsored INDs.\n\nII Current Requirements and Practices\n\nUnder current regulations, any use in the United States of a drug product not previously authorized for marketing in the United States first requires submission of an IND to the FDA. Current regulations at 21 CFR 312.22 and 312.23 contain the general principles underlying the IND submission and the general requirements for an IND's content and format.\n\nIII Clarifications of Present IND Regulations\n\nAn IND submission for Phase 1 studies is required by regulation to contain the sections enumerated below. Clarifications are described when appropriate beneath each section heading.\n\nF. Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control Information [21 CFR 312.23(a)(7)]:\n\nThe regulations at 312.23(a)(7)(i) emphasize the graded nature of manufacturing and controls information. Although in each phase of the investigation sufficient information should be submitted to assure the proper identification, quality, purity, and strength of the investigational drug, the amount of information needed to make that assurance will vary with the phase of the investigation, the proposed duration of the investigation, the dosage form, and the amount of information otherwise available. For example, although stability data are required in all phases of the IND to demonstrate that the new drug substance and drug product are within acceptable chemical and physical limits for the planned duration of the proposed clinical investigation, if very short-term tests are proposed, the supporting stability data can be correspondingly very limited.\n\nIt is recognized that modifications to the method of preparation of the new drug substance and dosage form, and even changes in the dosage form itself, are likely as the investigation progresses. The emphasis in an initial Phase 1 CMC submission should, therefore, generally be placed on providing information that will allow evaluation of the safety of subjects in the proposed study. The identification of a safety concern or insufficient data to make an evaluation of safety is the only basis for a clinical hold based on the CMC section.\n\nReasons for concern may include, for example: 1) a product made with unknown or impure components; 2) a product possessing chemical structures of known or highly likely toxicity; 3) a product that cannot remain chemically stable throughout the testing program proposed; or 4) a product with an impurity profile indicative of a potential health hazard or an impurity profile insufficiently defined to assess a potential health hazard; or 5) a poorly characterized master or working cell bank.\n\nIn addition, for pre-clinical studies to be useful in assuring the safety of human studies, sponsors should be able to relate the drug product being proposed for use in a clinical study to the drug product used in the animal toxicology studies that support the safety of the proposed human study.\n\nThe information discussed in the following numbered paragraphs should usually suffice for a meaningful review of the manufacturing procedures for drug products used in Phase 1 clinical studies. Additional information should ordinarily be submitted for review of the larger-scale manufacturing procedures used to produce drug products for Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials or as part of the manufacturing section of a marketing application. Any questions sponsors have about potential large scale IND clinical trials or potential marketing application manufacturing requirements or specifications should be directed to the appropriate division in the CDER Office of New Drug Chemistry, or the appropriate CBER division with responsibility for the product, for clarification and discussion. As clinical development of a drug product proceeds, sponsors should discuss the manufacturing data that will be needed to support the safe use of their products in Phase 2 and 3 trials with the appropriate division in the CDER Office of New Drug Chemistry, or the appropriate CBER division with responsibility for the product.\n\n1 Chemistry and Manufacturing Introduction:\n\nAt the beginning of this section, the sponsor should state whether it believes: 1) the chemistry of either the drug substance or the drug product, or 2) the manufacturing of either the drug substance or the drug product, presents any signals of potential human risk. If so, these signals of potential risks should be discussed, and the steps proposed to monitor for such risk(s) should be described, or the reason(s) why the signal(s) should be dismissed should be discussed.\n\nIn addition, sponsors should describe any chemistry and manufacturing differences between the drug product proposed for clinical use and the drug product used in the animal toxicology trials that formed the basis for the sponsor's conclusion that it was safe to proceed with the proposed clinical study. How these differences might affect the safety profile of the drug product should be discussed. If there are no differences in the products, that should be stated.\n\nDrug Substance [312.23 (a)(7)(iv)(a)]:\n\nSponsors are reminded that, under present regulations, references to the current edition of the USP-NF may be used to satisfy some of the requirements, when applicable.\n\nInformation on the drug substance should be submitted in a summary report containing the following items.\n--------------------\nContext title: Content and Format of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-derived Products Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.092225193977356", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In accordance with Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs, Why is FDA issuing this guidance document?\n--------------------\nContext: The IND phase of drug development is typically a multiyear process, and FDA recognizes that new data will become available and that scientific and regulatory advances and changes in clinical practice may occur during this time. Because sponsors are ultimately responsible for managing the overall development program for their proposed drugs, sponsors should monitor for advances in the field and/or changes in FDA guidance, and inquire if those changes may necessitate changes in prior FDA recommendations for their development programs. Although FDA reviewers consider new information and revise recommendations as needed, they try to support and adhere to their prior critical recommendations when appropriate. Changes in recommendations are expected to be based on new scientific or safety information or advances in clinical practice that make earlier FDA recommendations outdated, inappropriate, or unethical. In such cases, review staff via the FDA RPMs should inform sponsors in writing of these changes and the rationale behind the changes.\n\nBoth FDA and sponsors use various communication methods to focus discussions to effectively exchange information and resolve issues. Because there are different business cultures, communication styles, preferences, and documentation needs, there is no single best communication method. Rather, there are best practices that enhance each method. For example, telephone communication between a sponsor and the FDA RPM may be more effective than email for time-sensitive matters. A best practice would be to follow up after the telephone call with a written communication (e.g., email, submission, correspondence) so that there is documentation of decisions, agreements, or action items that arose during the interaction.\n\nThe best practices and communication methods described within this section are intended to identify means of exchanging information in ways that permit efficient, timely, and targeted review of and response to sponsors' questions. Communication via any of these methods (except meetings where numerous attendees participate) should be conducted via the FDA RPM, typically the review division RPM, rather than FDA reviewers, team leaders, or senior management to ensure that the advice is appropriately vetted and documented.\n\nFormal Meetings Between FDA and Sponsors\n\nMeetings are useful in resolving questions and issues raised during the life cycle of drug development. There are important reasons for sponsors to discuss development plans with FDA. FDA can provide valuable scientific and regulatory advice, resulting in more efficient and robust development programs. FDA can also help sponsors understand the evidence that will be necessary to demonstrate effectiveness, safety, highly similar or no clinically meaningful differences, and product quality. It is critical for sponsors to ascertain FDA's views on the applicable statutory and evidentiary requirements well in advance of submission of a marketing application to ensure an efficient development program.\n\nMeetings between FDA and a sponsor at critical junctures in drug development can be especially helpful in minimizing wasteful expenditures of time and resources and thus in speeding the drug development and evaluation process.\n\nThese milestone meetings under PDUFA include pre-IND, end-of-phase 1 (EOP1), end-of-phase 2 (EOP2), and pre-NDA/BLA meetings.\n\nPre-IND meetings are valuable for understanding the mechanism of actions of the drug and possible study designs and initiating dialogue regarding drug development in its early stages. They can prevent clinical hold issues from arising and aid sponsors in developing a complete IND. FDA encourages sponsors to request a pre-IND meeting for the following: a drug not previously approved or licensed; a new molecular entity (NME), especially one with a novel pharmacologic mechanism; a planned marketing application intended to be submitted under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway; drugs for which it is critical to public health to have an effective and efficient drug development plan (e.g., drugs for counter-terrorism, drugs to treat life-threatening or severely debilitating illnesses); drugs with substantial early development outside the United States; a planned human factors development program; and drugs with adequate and well-controlled trials to support a new indication. However, a sponsor of any IND can request a pre-IND meeting.\n\nEOP1 meetings are useful to review and reach agreement on the design of phase 2 controlled clinical trials and to discuss issues related to the proposed drug development program, including pediatric study plans, as appropriate. Because of limited resources, FDA has traditionally encouraged sponsors to request an EOP1 meeting only for drugsintended to treat life-threatening and severely debilitating illnesses, particularly situations where approval based on phase 2 trials or accelerated approval may be appropriate.19\n\nFootnote 19: 21 CFR part 312, subpart E\n\nEOP2 meetings are of considerable importance in determining the safety of, and sufficiency of data (e.g., on dose selection) for, proceeding to phase 3, and for planning a complete and well-designed phase 3 development program. EOP2 meetings serve to evaluate the phase 3 plan and protocols, the adequacy of current studies and plans to assess pediatric safety and effectiveness, evaluate the human factors validation plan, and identify any additional information necessary to support a marketing application for the uses under investigation. FDA encourages sponsors to request an EOP2 meeting for NMEs or major new uses of marketed drugs. However, a sponsor of any IND can request an EOP2 meeting.\n\nPre-NDA/BLA meetings are helpful in acquainting FDA reviewers with the format and content of the planned marketing application, including labeling and risk management activities (if applicable), presentation and organization of data, dataset structure, acceptability of data for submission, as well as the projected submission date of the marketing application. They are also intended to uncover major issues, identify studies intended to establish the drug's safety and effectiveness, discuss the status of pediatric studies, and discuss statistical analysis methods, or the results of analyses. FDA encourages sponsors to request pre-NDA/BLA meetings for all planned marketing applications, particularly applications to be reviewed under the Program.\n\nMeetings under BsUFA include BIA and BPD Type 1 through Type 4 meetings. These meetings are intended to support an iterative process of interactions during the biosimilar development phase. They are based on the stage of development of the biosimilar product and on the amount and type of data and information provided to support the meeting.\n\nA BIA meeting is an initial assessment limited to a general discussion regarding whether licensure under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) may be feasible for a particular product, and, if so, general advice on the expected content of the development program. This meeting type does not include any meeting that involves substantive review of summary data or full study reports.\n\nA BPD Type 1 meeting is a meeting that is necessary for an otherwise stalled drug development program to proceed (e.g., meeting to discuss clinical holds, dispute resolution meeting, a special protocol assessment meeting, or a meeting to address an important safety issue).\n\nA BPD Type 2 meeting is a meeting to discuss a specific issue (e.g., proposed study design or endpoints) or questions where FDA will provide targeted advice regarding an ongoing BPD program. This meeting type can include substantive review of summary data, but does not include review of full study reports.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA BPD Type 3 meeting is an in-depth data review and advice meeting regarding an ongoing BPD program. This meeting type includes substantive review of full study reports, FDA advice regarding the similarity between the proposed biosimilar biological product and the reference product, and FDA advice regarding additional studies, including design and analysis.\n\nA BPD Type 4 meeting is a presubmission meeting to discuss the format and content of a complete application for an original biosimilar biological product application under the Program or supplement submitted under 351(k) of the PHS Act. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the format, content, and presentation of the planned submission and other items, including identification of those studies that the sponsor is relying on to support a demonstration of biosimilarity or interchangeability, discussion of any potential review issues, identification of the status of ongoing or needed studies to adequately address the Pediatric Research Equity Act, and acquainting FDA reviewers with the general information to be submitted in the marketing application (including technical information).\n\nFeedback to sponsors via the formal meeting process is provided in three main formats: face-to-face meetings, teleconferences/videoconferences, and WRO responses. Detailed information about meeting requests, packages, scheduling, preparation, conduct, and documentation (meeting minutes) are described in other guidances.20 The timelines are described in the PDUFA and BSUFA agreements.\n\nFootnote 20: See the guidances for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products and Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants.\n\nThe following represent meeting-related best practices for the various meeting formats.\n\n*Meeting Requests\n\nBefore requesting a meeting with FDA, sponsors should use the extensive sources of drug development information that are publically available. See section VII.I., Resources for Sponsors.\n--------------------\nContext title: Best Practices for Communication Between IND Sponsors and FDA During Drug Development \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.2597105801105499"], "As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n--------------------\nContext: II IRB Membership\n\n12. May a clinical investigator be an IRB member?\n\nYes, however, the IRB regulations [21] CFR 56.107(e)] prohibit any member from participating in the IRB's initial or continuing review of any study in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB. When selecting IRB members, the potential for conflicts of interest should be considered. When members frequently have conflicts and must absent themselves from deliberation and abstain from voting, their contributions to the group review process may be diminished and could hinder the review procedure. Even greater disruptions may result if this person is chairperson of the IRB.\n\n13. The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n\nYes. For example, one member could be otherwise unaffiliated with the institution and have a primary concern in a non-scientific area. This individual would satisfy two of the membership requirements of the regulations. IRBs should strive, however, for a membership that has a diversity of representative capacities and disciplines. In fact, the FDA regulations [21] CFR 56.107(a)] require that, as part of being qualified as an IRB, the IRB must have \"... diversity of members, including consideration of race, gender, cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes....\"\n\n14. When IRB members cannot attend a convened meeting, may they send someone from their department to vote for them?No. Alternates who are formally appointed and listed in the membership roster may substitute, but ad hoc substitutes are not permissible as members of an IRB. However, a member who is unable to be present at the convened meeting may participate by video-conference or conference telephone call, when the member has received a copy of the documents that are to be reviewed at the meeting. Such members may vote and be counted as part of the quorum. If allowed by IRB procedures, ad hoc substitutes may attend as consultants and gather information for the absent member, but they may not be counted toward the quorum or participate in either deliberation or voting with the board. The IRB may, of course, ask questions of this representative just as they could of any non-member consultant. Opinions of the absent members that are transmitted by mail, telephone, telefax or e-mail may be considered by the attending IRB members but may not be counted as votes or the quorum for convened meetings.\n\n15 May the IRB use alternate members?\n\nThe use of formally appointed alternate IRB members is acceptable to the FDA, provided that the IRB's written procedures describe the appointment and function of alternate members. The IRB roster should identify the primary member(s) for whom each alternate member may substitute. To ensure maintaining an appropriate quorum, the alternate's qualifications should be comparable to the primary member to be replaced. The IRB minutes should document when an alternate member replaces a primary member. When alternates substitute for a primary member, the alternate member should have received and reviewed the same material that the primary member received or would have received.\n\n16 Does a non-affiliated member need to attend every IRB meeting?\n\nNo. Although 21 CFR 56.108(c) does not specifically require the presence of a member not otherwise affiliated with the institution to constitute a quorum, FDA considers the presence of such members an important element of the IRB's diversity. Therefore, frequent absence of all non-affiliated members is not acceptable to FDA. Acknowledging their important role, many IRBs have appointed more than one member who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution. FDA encourages IRBs to appoint members in accordance with 21 CFR 56.107(a) who will be able to participate fully in the IRB process.\n\n17 Which IRB members should be considered to be scientists and non-scientists?\n\n21 CFR 56.107(c) requires at least one member of the IRB to have primary concerns in the scientific area and at least one to have primary concerns in the non-scientific area. Most IRBs include physicians and Ph.D. level physical or biological scientists. Such members satisfy the requirement for at least one scientist. When an IRB encounters studies involving science beyond the expertise of the members, the IRB may use a consultant to assist in the review, as provided by 21 CFR 56.107(f).\n\nFDA believes the intent of the requirement for diversity of disciplines was to include members who had little or no scientific or medical training or experience. Therefore, nurses, pharmacists and other biomedical health professionals should not be regarded to have \"primary concerns in the non-scientific area.\" In the past, lawyers, clergy and ethicists have been cited as examples of persons whose primary concerns would be in non-scientific areas.\n\nSome members have training in both scientific and non-scientific disciplines, such as a J.D., R.N. While such members are of great value to an IRB, other members who are unambiguously non-scientific should be appointed to satisfy the non-scientist requirement.\n\nIII. IRB Procedures\n\n18. The FDA regulations [21 CFR 56.104(c)] exempt an emergency use of a test article from prospective IRB review, however, \"... any subsequent use of the test article at the institution is subject to IRB review.\" What does the phrase \"subsequent use\" mean?\n\nFDA regulations allow for one emergency use of a test article in an institution without prospective IRB review, provided that such emergency use is reported to the IRB within five working days after such use. An emergency use is defined as a single use (or single course of treatment, e.g., multiple doses of antibiotic) with one subject. \"Subsequent use\" would be a second use with that subject or the use with another subject.\n\nIn its review of the emergency use, if it is anticipated that the test article may be used again, the IRB should request a protocol and consent document(s) be developed so that an approved protocol would be in place when the next need arises. In spite of the best efforts of the clinical investigator and the IRB, a situation may occur where a second emergency use needs to be considered. FDA believes it is inappropriate to deny emergency treatment to an individual when the only obstacle is lack of time for the IRB to convene, review the use and give approval.\n\n19. Are there any regulations that require clinical investigators to report to the IRB when a study has been completed?\n\nIRBs are required to function under written procedures. One of these procedural requirements [21 CFR 56.108(a)(3)] requires ensuring \"prompt reporting to the IRB of changes in a research activity.\" The completion of the study is a change in activity and should be reported to the IRB. Although subjects will no longer be \"at risk\" under the study, a final report/notice to the IRB allows it to close its files as well as providing information that may be used by the IRB in the evaluation and approval of related studies.\n\n20. What is expedited review?\n\nExpedited review is a procedure through which certain kinds of research may be reviewed and approved without convening a meeting of the IRB. The Agency's IRB regulations [21 CFR 56.110] permit, but do not require, an IRB to review certain categories of research through an exedited procedure if the research involves no more than minimal risk. A list of categories was last published in the Federal Register on January 27, 1981 [46 FR 8980].\n\nThe IRB may also use the expedited review procedure to review minor changes in previously approved research during the period covered by the original approval. Under an expedited review procedure, review of research may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced members of the IRB designated by the chairperson. The reviewer(s) may exercise all the authorities of the IRB, except disapproval. Research may only be disapproved following review by the full committee. The IRB is required to adopt a method of keeping all members advised of research studies that have been approved by expedited review.\n\n[See Conditions for IRB Use of Expedited Review - Federal Register: November 9, 1998 (Volume 63, Number 216), Notices (/about-fda/page-not-found)]\n\n21. The number of studies we review has increased, and the size of the package of review materials we send to IRB members is becoming formidable. Must we send the full package to all IRB members?\n\nThe IRB system was designed to foster open discussion and debate at convened meetings of the full IRB membership. While it is preferable for every IRB member to have personal copies of all study materials, each member must be provided with sufficient information to be able to actively and constructively participate. Some institutions have developed a \"primary reviewer\" system to promote a thorough review. Under this system, studies are assigned to one or more IRB members for a full review of all materials. Then, at the convened IRB meeting the study is presented by the primary reviewer(s) and, after discussion by IRB members, a vote for an action is taken.\n\nThe \"primary reviewer\" procedure is acceptable to the FDA if each member receives, at a minimum; a copy of consent documents and a summary of the protocol in sufficient detail to determine the appropriateness of the study-specific statements in the consent documents. In addition, the complete documentation should be available to all members for their review, both before and at the meeting. The materials for review should be received by the membership sufficiently in advance of the meeting to allow for adequate review of the materials.\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 8.034974098205566", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership.

These include: (\\circ) Past relationships with the sponsor that were long-term and of substantial value. (\\circ) Past involvement with the product(s) at issue.\n\n_Other Relationships or Interests, Whether Current or Past, that May Raise Questions about the Member's Impartiality:_These relationships or interests involving the member (or a member of her household) may include:\n\n(\\circ) Past involvement in a lawsuit related to the product(s) or issues before the committee or otherwise involving the sponsor.\n\n(\\circ) Involvement as a subject in a clinical trial of one of the products at issue.\n\n5 Determining Whether to Grant a Section 502 Authorization\n\nWhether a Reasonable Person Would Question the Member's Impartiality\n\nDetermining whether to grant a section 502 authorization requires evaluating the circumstances described above and then assessing whether these interests, relationships, or circumstances would cause a \"reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts\" to question the member's impartiality in the particular matter.35 This question assumes the perspective of reasonable person who knows the circumstances, not the perspective of \"the unreasonable, uninformed, or overly zealous.\"36 As discussed in Section 4, a member, under section 502, may make a threshold judgment on whether a reasonable person would question her impartiality and may disqualify herself from participation.\n\nFootnote 35: 5 CFR \u00a7 2635.502(a).\n\nIf FDA concludes that a reasonable person would not question the member's impartiality, there is no appearance issue and the member may participate in the meeting.37 If FDA concludes that an appearance issue exists and is still interested in having that member participate, FDA then asks whether the Government's interest in the member's participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the integrity of the agency's programs and operations. If so, FDA may grant an authorization before the meeting to allow the member to participate. If FDA does not grant an authorization, the member may not participate in the meeting.\n\nFootnote 36: Section 502, final rule, 57 Fed Reg. at 35008. This test does not depend on whether the public has actual knowledge of the appearance issue.\nPerson May Question the Integrity of the Agency's Programs and Operations\n\nAccording to OGE, section 502 is intended to give an agency \"broad discretion\" to determine whether a member's possible appearance issue \"is so significant that it should disqualify them from participation.\"38 As OGE has explained, section 502 authorizations \"call for the agency [decision maker's] exercise of judgment and not the application of [a] precise [formula] from which only one correct conclusion can be reached.\"39\n\nFootnote 38: Section 502 proposed rule, 56 Fed Reg at 33786.\n\nFootnote 39: Section 502 final rule, 57 Fed. Reg. at 35027.\n\nEven so, the regulation provides a non-exclusive list of factors that an agency may take into consideration in deciding whether to grant a section 502 authorization. In general, these factors are intended to provide greater flexibility and discretion to the agency than those that apply to granting waivers from disqualifying conflicts of interest under 18 USC SS 208.40 The factors that may be taken into consideration are:\n\nFootnote 40: Section 502 proposed rule, 56 Fed Reg at 33786.\n\n(1) The nature of the relationship involved;\n\n(2) The effect that resolution of the matter would have upon the financial interests of the person involved in the relationship;\n\n(3) The nature and importance of the member's role in the matter, including the extent to which the member is called upon to exercise discretion in the matter;\n\n(4) The sensitivity of the matter;\n\n(5) The difficulty of reassigning the matter to another expert; and\n\n(6) Adjustments that may be made in the member's duties that would reduce or eliminate the likelihood that a reasonable person would question her impartiality.41\n\nFootnote 41: 5 CFR \u00a7 2635.502(d)(1)-(6).\n\n(1) The Nature of the Relationship Involved: As noted, appearance issues may arise from: (1) a personal relationship between the member and another individual, e.g., a household member whose financial interests may be affected or close relative, who may be a party to the particular matter that is the subject of the advisory committee meeting; or (2) a past or present professional or other relationship between the member and a company, person, or organization that is a party or party representative to the matter before the advisory committee. Relationships with the party to the matter that have been determined to be unrelated to the particular matter before the committee might, depending on the circumstances, present lesser appearance concerns than relationships more directly related to the particular matter. For other types of relationships, in analyzing the nature of a particular relationship to determine whether a section 502 authorization may be warranted, FDA considers the totality of the circumstances, such as:\n\nWhether the relationship is current or past (past relationships weigh more in favor of participation);\n\nIf a past relationship existed within the prior 12 months (relationships that have not existed within the prior 12 months weigh more in favor of participation);\n\nWhether the relationship is, or was, related to the product before the committee (relationships not related to the product, e.g., a contractual relationship not related to the product, weigh more in favor of participation than related relationships);\n\nThe magnitude of the financial interest created by the relationship (small interests weigh more in favor to participation); and\n\nIf the member conducted or was otherwise involved with past research on the product, whether that research will be reviewed by the committee (the general principle is that a member should not review her own work).\n\n(2) The Effect that Resolution of the Matter Would Have Upon the Financial Interests of the Person Involved in the Relationship: FDA considers whether the outcome of the particular matter before the advisory committee may have an effect on the current financial interests of a household member or relative with whom the member has a close personal relationship because the household member or relative is employed by or otherwise has a financial relationship with the company (or other party) whose product is before the advisory committee. In these rare cases, FDA may take into account:\n\nWhether the company is small or large (interests in a company with a wide range of products weigh more in favor of granting a section 502 authorization because of the greater likelihood that the outcome of the meeting will not affect the financial stability of the company and, therefore, the continuing viability of the household member or relative's employment or other relationship with the sponsor).\n\nWhether the financial interest is related to a product before the committee (interests not related to the product weigh more in favor of participation);\n\nWhether a household member's or relative's employment with a party is related to the product or is in a division of the company that is responsible for the product (employment in the company that is not related to the product can weigh more in favor of participation; and\n\nThe magnitude of the interest (small interests weigh more in favor of participation).\n\nThe Nature and Importance of the Member's Role in the Matter, Including the Extent to which the Member is Called upon to Exercise Discretion in the Matter: Advisory committees provide only recommendations to FDA; final decisions are made by FDA.42 The fact that the member's recommendations are solely advisory in nature, and are not made individually but as only one member of a committee of experts, might weigh in favor of granting a section 502 authorization, depending on the circumstances. FDA\n\nFootnote 42: 5 USC App. 2 \u00a7 9(b); 21 CFR \u00a7 14.5.\n\n3.1.4 The Sensitivity of the Matter\n\nAt the time that FDA screens members for appearance issues, it may be difficult to predict whether the matter to be addressed by the committee will be considered sensitive or controversial. FDA nonetheless considers whether the issue coming before the committee is likely to generate significant public interest or the potential for litigation. In highly sensitive cases, FDA may be less likely to grant a section 502 authorization, depending on the analysis of the other factors.\n\nThe Difficulty of Reassigning the Matter to Another Expert\n--------------------\nContext title: Procedures for Evaluating Appearance Issues and Granting Authorizations for Participation in FDA Advisory Committees Draft Guidance for the Public, FDA Advisory Committee Members, and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.5755913257598877", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n--------------------\nContext: (v) An organization, other than a political party, in which the member is an \"active participant.\" Mere membership in an organization, payment of duties, or the donation or solicitation of financial support does not, by itself, constitute active participation.\n\nFootnote 27: This paragraph specifically excludes situations in which the relationship is with a \u201cprospective employer\u201d as defined in 5 CFR \u00a7 2635.603(c). The latter type of relationship is governed by the financial conflict of interest analysis under 18 USC \u00a7 208.\n\nFootnote 28: \u201cWithin the last year\u201d means within the 12 months preceding the date of the advisory committee meeting.\n\nSection 502's \"covered relationship\" prong requires consideration of a broader set of relationships and interests than under the Federal financial conflict of interest statutes. For example:\n\nHousehold Members and Relatives: Section 502 provides for consideration of situations where: the member's household (discussed above in Section IV.B.1); or (b) relatives with whom the member has a close personal relationship (e.g., adult children, parents, in-laws), whether or not they reside in the member's household, are a party or party representative to the particular matter before the committee. (As noted, Federal conflict of interest laws cover the financial interests of the member, her spouse, and minor children, not adult children or other household members.)* Certain Past Financial Interests: Section 502 covers certain past financial relationships. For example, if the member, in the previous year, has served as a consultant to a spons of a product before the committee, she has a covered relationship with a party to the particular matter before the committee. (The financial conflict of interest analysis applies only to the member's current financial interests and those under negotiation or for which she has an agreement.)\n\nCertain Current Financial Interests: Even where a member's current financial relationship has been determined not to create a recusal obligation under Federal financial conflict of interest laws, it could present an appearance issue under section 502. For example, if a member has a current consulting contract with a spons of a product being reviewed by the advisory committee, but the member's contract is not related to the product or issue being considered by the committee, FDA may conclude that the particular matter before the committee is unlikely to have a \"direct and predictable effect\" on the member's financial interest under Federal financial conflict of interest statutes (depending on the particular circumstances). However, the member's contractual relationship with the spons would constitute a \"covered relationship\" under section 502 and could present an appearance issue.\n\nCertain Relationships that Exist through the Member's Role with an Employer or Organization: Even where there is no recusal obligation under Federal financial conflict of interest laws, FDA's practice is to consider that the member could still have an appearance issue under section 502 if: (1) she holds a leadership position with her employer, or is an \"active participant\" in an organization, and; (2) that employer or organization has a financial relationship with the sponsor whose product is coming before the advisory committee. This appearance issue may exist even if the employer's or organization's relationship is unrelated to the products or issues before the committee and the member was not personally involved in the funded activity. Leadership responsibilities could include managerial or supervisory duties or any fiduciary duties. \"Active participation\" could include service as an official of the organization or otherwise directing the activitiesof the organization.29 Because of this broad coverage of section 502, FDA's practice is that a member that holds a leadership position with her employer, or is an \"active participant\" in an organization, should report any financial relationships that are known to the member between her employer and the party or parties to the particular matter before the committee. This reporting applies even when the financial relationship is unrelated to the products or issues before the committee, the member has not been personally involved in the funded activity, and the financial interest has ended within the past 12 months.30\n\nFootnote 29: For example, a member may have an appearance issue if she is an officer in a nonprofit organization that has received funding from the sponsor within the past year, whether or not that funding relates to the product or issues before the committee and even if all monies have been paid and all services rendered. A member also may have an appearance issue if she has a leadership role at a university (e.g., dean) that has funding from the sponsor to carry out clinical trials on products that are unrelated to the products before the committee, even if the member has no personal involvement with the clinical trials.\n\nFootnote 30: For example, the Chair of a clinical division at a hospital should report any grants or contracts that have been awarded to her division by the sponsor even if the grant has been completed in the past year and all monies have been paid and all services rendered. Likewise, a president or director of an organization is expected to report any funds the sponsor has given to the organization in the past year.\n\n\"Party to the Matter\": The determination of who is a party to the matter depends on the specific facts of each case, in particular whose legal rights or obligations will be affected by the particular matter before the committee. Generally, FDA considers a party to include any sponsor of the product(s) coming before the advisory committee. Other entities with certain types of financial relationships related to the product(s), such as licensees, may also be parties to the matter.\n\n3 Other Circumstances that May Raise a Question about the Member's Impartiality\n\nSection 502 provides a \"catch-all\" for other circumstances that may create an appearance issue: where circumstances other than those specifically described may raise a question about the member's impartiality.31 In FDA's experience section 502, such circumstances could include:\n\nFootnote 31: 5 CFR \u00a7 2635.502(a)(2).\n\nParticular Matters of General Applicability: Generally, section 2635.502 focuses on particular matters involving specific parties. However, section 2635.502(a)(2) provides a mechanism for SGEs to determine whether they should recuse themselves from other \"particular matters\" that are not described elsewhere in the rule. \"Particular matters of general applicability\" involve potential changes to regulations or agency guidance, or other broad topics such as policy-making and decisions that affect an entire class of products, such as reviewing labeling changes for an entire class of products32. Particular matters of general applicability tend to raise fewer appearance issues than particular matters involving specific parties33. However, the agency may require members to recuse from particular matters that do not involve specific parties, based on the concern that the member's impartiality reasonably may be questioned under the circumstances. Footnote 32: A \u201cparticular matter of general applicability means a particular matter that is focused on the interests of a discrete and identifiable class of persons, but does not involve specific parties.\u201d 5 CFR \u00a7 2640.102(m). Relationships\": Professional, social, or other relationships that are not technically a \"covered relationship\" under section 502 could still raise concerns about the member's impartiality. For example, an appearance issue may arise if the member has a close personal relationship (but not technically a \"covered relationship\") with someone who is a party or party representative, such as if the member is a close friend with the patent holder on the product at issue. Additionally, if the member has a close personal relationship with an officer of the sponsor, these scenarios may raise appearance concerns.34 Footnote 33: Section 502 proposed rule, 56 Fed. Reg. at 33786.\n\nPast Financial Interests Ending More Than One Year Before the Meeting that Suggest a Close Relationship with the Sponsor or Involvement with the Product(s) before the Committee: Although interests or relationships more than a year old do not generally give rise to appearance issues, there may be exceptions when these involvements suggest close ties to the sponsor or product(s). These include: (\\circ) Past relationships with the sponsor that were long-term and of substantial value. (\\circ) Past involvement with the product(s) at issue.\n\n_Other Relationships or Interests, Whether Current or Past, that May Raise Questions about the Member's Impartiality:_These relationships or interests involving the member (or a member of her household) may include:\n\n(\\circ) Past involvement in a lawsuit related to the product(s) or issues before the committee or otherwise involving the sponsor.\n\n(\\circ) Involvement as a subject in a clinical trial of one of the products at issue.\n\n5 Determining Whether to Grant a Section 502 Authorization\n\nWhether a Reasonable Person Would Question the Member's Impartiality\n\nDetermining whether to grant a section 502 authorization requires evaluating the circumstances described above and then assessing whether these interests, relationships, or circumstances would cause a \"reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts\" to question the member's impartiality in the particular matter.35 This question assumes the perspective of reasonable person who knows the circumstances, not the perspective of \"the unreasonable, uninformed, or overly zealous.\"36 As discussed in Section 4, a member, under section 502, may make a threshold judgment on whether a reasonable person would question her impartiality and may disqualify herself from participation.\n\nFootnote 35: 5 CFR \u00a7 2635.502(a).\n--------------------\nContext title: Procedures for Evaluating Appearance Issues and Granting Authorizations for Participation in FDA Advisory Committees Draft Guidance for the Public, FDA Advisory Committee Members, and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.397937297821045", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n--------------------\nContext: Whether the financial interest is related to a product before the committee (interests not related to the product weigh more in favor of participation);\n\nWhether a household member's or relative's employment with a party is related to the product or is in a division of the company that is responsible for the product (employment in the company that is not related to the product can weigh more in favor of participation; and\n\nThe magnitude of the interest (small interests weigh more in favor of participation).\n\nThe Nature and Importance of the Member's Role in the Matter, Including the Extent to which the Member is Called upon to Exercise Discretion in the Matter: Advisory committees provide only recommendations to FDA; final decisions are made by FDA.42 The fact that the member's recommendations are solely advisory in nature, and are not made individually but as only one member of a committee of experts, might weigh in favor of granting a section 502 authorization, depending on the circumstances. FDA\n\nFootnote 42: 5 USC App. 2 \u00a7 9(b); 21 CFR \u00a7 14.5.\n\n3.1.4 The Sensitivity of the Matter\n\nAt the time that FDA screens members for appearance issues, it may be difficult to predict whether the matter to be addressed by the committee will be considered sensitive or controversial. FDA nonetheless considers whether the issue coming before the committee is likely to generate significant public interest or the potential for litigation. In highly sensitive cases, FDA may be less likely to grant a section 502 authorization, depending on the analysis of the other factors.\n\nThe Difficulty of Reassigning the Matter to Another Expert\n\nMembers of FDA advisory committees are scientific experts who are leaders in their respective disciplines. Depending on the nature of the matter before the committee, and the needs of the agency for experts with a background in a highly specialized area or sub-specialty, the pool of individuals with the required expertise may be very limited. Scheduling conflicts may further limit the available pool of experts who are able to participate in a committee meeting. FDA evaluates each situation to determine what is best to uphold public confidence in the scientific integrity of the advisory committee process while ensuring that the committee has the necessary expertise. Where a member has particular expertise or experience that is very important to the committee's work, or where others with comparable expertise have conflicts or appearance issues more extensive than the member's, FDA is more likely to grant a section 502 authorization. Where there are alternate experts who possess comparable expertise and have fewer conflicts and appearance issues, FDA is less likely to grant a section 502 authorization. In situations where there is a need for a diversity of expert opinion and there is a limited pool of experts on a particular matter, FDA is more likely to grant a section 502 authorization.\n\n.\n6. Adjustments that May be Made in the Member's Duties that Would Reduce or Eliminate the Likelihood that a Reasonable Person Would Question the Member's Impartiality: In situations where the appearance concern is significant, the agency may consider adjusting the scope of the member's participation to minimize the concern while allowing the agency to obtain relevant expertise. If adjustments can be made to a member's role to reduce or eliminate the likelihood that a reasonable person would question the integrity of the agency's programs or operations, FDA is more likely to grant a section 502 authorization. Such adjustments may include limiting the member's participation to engaging in committee discussions but not voting, or allowing the member only to give a presentation on a select topic and respond to questions directly related to that presentation but not to participate in committee discussions or voting.\n\n(***)\n\nIn deciding whether to grant an authorization, FDA may take into account all of these six factors. To help explain this decision-making process, the Appendix contains examples of appearance issues and factors FDA would consider in deciding whether to grant a section 502 authorization for the member to participate in the advisory committee meeting.\n\nAppendix: Examples of Appearance Issues and Factors Fda would Consider in Determining Whether to Grant a Section 502 Authorization\n\nWhere a member has an appearance issue under section 502 with respect to the particular matter that is the subject of an advisory committee meeting, FDA evaluates whether, in light of all the relevant circumstances, the agency's interest in the member's participation in the meeting outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the integrity of the agency's programs and operations. This evaluation is fact-specific and is conducted on a case-by-case basis. This Appendix describes three examples in which a member would be considered to have an appearance issue under section 502. There are several factors FDA considers relevant in determining whether to grant a section 502 authorization for the member to participate in the meeting. These factors can exhibit various degrees of weight in the authorization decision depending upon the specific conditions and scenario regarding the member. The examples below are intended only to illustrate how some of these factors could be applied. Each situation is evaluated on its own merits and facts considering multiple factors.\n\nScenario: The advisory committee is reviewing the safety and efficacy of a product. The meeting is a particular matter involving specific parties with one party to the matter (\"the sponsor\").\n\nExample #1: The member's primary employment is as a dean of the medical school at a large university. The member reported that her employer has a multi-year grant from the product sponsor (i.e., the sponsor of the product that will be reviewed and evaluated at the advisory committee meeting) and the grant is not related to the product before the committee. This is an interest or relationship that could cause a reasonable person to question the member's impartiality.\n\nFactors FDA Would Consider in Determining Whether or Not to Grant a Section 502 Authorization For the Member to Participate in the Meeting:\n\nWhether the member receives any personal funding or remuneration from the grant (if not, this would weigh in favor of a section 502 authorization);\n\nSize and diversity of the range of products made or under development by the sponsor providing the grant funding to the employer (the larger and more diverse the range of products the more this would weigh in favor of a section 502 authorization);\n\nWhether the member's employer relies solely, or principally, on this grant from the sponsor (if not, this would weigh in favor of a section 502 authorization);* Whether the matter before the committee is considered sensitive or controversial (matters that are typical and routine without controversy would weigh in favor of a section 502 authorization);\n\nWhether the member has expertise that is important to the committee's work and others with comparable expertise have conflicts or appearance issues more extensive than the member's (if so, this would weigh in favor of a section 502 authorization);\n\nIf there is a need for multiple experts in a field (if so, this would weigh in favor of a section 502 authorization).\n\nExample #2:The member serves on the board of directors of a nonprofit organization that receives donations from the sponsor. This is an interest or relationship that could cause a reasonable person to question the member's impartiality.\n\nFactors FDA Would Consider in Determining Whether or Not to Grant a Section 502\n\nAuthorization For the Member to Participate in the Meeting:\n\nWhether the nonprofit organization has taken a position on the product or the meeting topic (if not, this would weigh in favor of a section 502 authorization);\n\nWhether the member receives any personal funding or remuneration from the donations given to the nonprofit by the sponsor (if not, this would weigh in favor of a section 502 authorization);\n\nSize and diversity of the range of products made or under development by the sponsor providing donations to the nonprofit organization (the larger and more diverse the range of products the more this would weigh in favor of a section 502 authorization );\n\nWhether the matter before the committee is considered sensitive or controversial (if not, this would weigh in favor of a section 502 authorization);\n\nWhether the member has expertise that is very important to the committee's work and others with comparable expertise have conflicts or appearance issues more extensive than the member's (if so, this would weigh in favor of a section 502 authorization);\n\nIf there is a need for multiple experts in the field (if so, this would weigh in favor of a section 502 authorization).\n--------------------\nContext title: Procedures for Evaluating Appearance Issues and Granting Authorizations for Participation in FDA Advisory Committees Draft Guidance for the Public, FDA Advisory Committee Members, and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.512217998504639", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership.

For more information visit: https://www.fda.gov/international-programs/international-arrangements/mutual-recognition-agreement-mra.\n\nFootnote 8: See FDA guidance for industry Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (April 2021).\n\n2.2.2 What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n\nA2: FDA's assessment of whether an inspection is mission-critical considers many factors related to the public health benefit of U.S. patients having access to the product subject to inspection. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether the product has received breakthrough therapy designation, orphan-drug designation, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation; is included in the Drug Shortage or CBER-Regulated Products Shortage list; is used for critical care or as a medical countermeasure; is used to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a serious disease or medical condition, including COVID-19, for which there is no other appropriate and available treatment. Therefore, for-cause (including follow-up and where a specific drug quality problem or facility issues come to FDA's attention), preapproval, and pre-license inspections can be deemed mission-critical. When determining whether to conduct a mission-critical inspection, FDA also takes into account concerns about the safety of its investigators, employees at a site or facility, and where applicable, clinical trial participants and other patients at investigator sites.\n\n2.3 Does FDA determine what is \"mission-critical\" using the same factors for both domestic and foreign inspections?\n\nA3: Yes, the determination is made considering the same factors regardless of whether the site is domestic or foreign.\n\n2.2.4 How will FDA ensure the quality of imported products while inspections are limited?\n\nA4: During this interim period, FDA is expanding the use of other tools and approaches for assessing manufacturing facilities, when appropriate, to help ensure the quality of the drug products imported into the United States. These may include physical examinations of products arriving at U.S. borders or product sampling and testing before release into commerce, reviewing the compliance histories of facilities, using information shared by trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements, requestingrecords directly from facilities \"in advance of or in lieu of\" certain drug inspections,9 and conducting remote interactive evaluations where appropriate. If a product appears not to meet applicable standards for safety, effectiveness, or quality based on these approaches, FDA has the authority to refuse admission of the product into the United States.10\n\nFDA continues to work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to target products intended for importation into the United States that violate applicable legal requirements for FDA-regulated products. FDA has the ability to use a risk-based analytics tool (Predictive Risk-based Evaluation for Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT)) to electronically screen regulated shipments imported or offered for import into the United States.11 PREDICT uses automated data mining, pattern discovery, and automated queries of FDA databases to determine the potential risk of a shipment. It takes into consideration the inherent risk of a product and also information about the previous history of importers, manufacturers, and shippers.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 10: See section 801(a) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: For more details visit FDA\u2019s Entry Screening Systems and Tools page at https://www.fda.gov/industr/import-systems/entry-screening-systems-and-tools.\n\nQ5: How will travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency affect my application?\n\nA5: During the COVID-19 public health emergency, FDA is using all available tools and sources of information to support regulatory decisions on applications12 that include sites impacted by travel restrictions due to COVID-19. For example, FDA will continue the assessment of all applications per normal assessment operations for all disciplines, where all manufacturing facilities will be evaluated using a risk-based approach consistent with existing guidelines. Similarly, the need for and selection of sites for BIMO inspections will continue to be risk-based, considering application and site-specific factors. During this interim period, FDA is using alternative tools, where available, to determine or mitigate the need for an inspection and to support the application assessment. This includes reviewing a firm's previous compliance history, using information sharing from trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements, requesting records \"in advance of or in lieu of\" facility inspections13 or voluntarily from facilities and sites, and conducting remote interactive evaluations where appropriate.\n\nFootnote 12: See 21 CFR 314.50(d), 314.94(a), and 601.20(d).\n\nCDER and CBER are continuing to evaluate applications, strategically applying a holistic approach in the decision-making process to determine if an inspection is warranted or if an inspection is no longer needed due to information gained through the use of the alternative tools mentioned above. FDA will continue to work directly with the applicants of those impacted applications.\n\nFDA is also working directly with facilities to communicate any issues identified through a review of records or other information requested. For example, for both CDER- and CBER-regulated products, interim processes have been implemented to communicate with manufacturing facilities regarding issues identified following a review of records or other information requested \"in advance of or in lieu of\" a preapproval or pre-license inspection. Responses from the facility regarding these issues will, as feasible, be considered before taking an action on a pending application.\n\nThe Agency encourages applicants to be in communication with all their facilities and sites to ensure timely responses to any inquiries to support application assessment.\n\nQ6: If my application includes sites that cannot be inspected because of travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency will my application automatically receive a complete response letter?\n\nA6: No, FDA will not automatically issue a complete response (CR) letter if FDA cannot conduct an inspection because of travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency.14 Decisions regarding applications will be based on the totality of the information available to FDA, including information obtained from use of the alternative tools as described in Q5/A5.\n\nFootnote 14: For mission-critical and prioritized domestic inspections needed to support application approval, FDA aims to conduct those inspections during the review of the application. However, in cases where travel restrictions due to the public health emergency prevent FDA from performing those inspections during the review clock, recommendations in Q6/A6 are applicable.\n\nBased on an assessment of the product information provided in the application and based on available information about the facility or site, FDA will take one of the following actions:\n\nFDA plans to *approve\n\nthe application if\n\nAvailable information, including information obtained from the use of alternate tools, supports the adequacy of the facilities and sites named in a pending application, no other deficiencies have been identified, and the application otherwise satisfies the requirements for approval.15 Footnote 15: See 21 CFR 314.50, 314.94, and 601.2.\n\nIn this case, the need for an inspection could be sufficiently mitigated by the FDA's use of alternate tools, including a firm's responses to outstanding issues identified from the use of alternate tools (see Q5/A5).\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter with facility- or site-related deficiencies\n\nAvailable information from a prior FDA or mutual recognition agreement inspection or the use of alternate tools identifies concerns about the adequacy of a facility or site, and an inspection needed to address those concerns cannot be completed during the review cycle, or\n\nResponses to outstanding issues identified from requested records and other alternate sources (see Q5/A5) are not sufficient to address the issues identified for a facility or site.\n\nIn this case, FDA intends to inform the applicant of the facility or site issues as soon as possible during the review cycle. Specifically, FDA intends to inform the applicant that an inspection will be needed before the application can be approved\nand that the inspection may not be conducted before the action date due to restrictions on travel. * FDA generally intends to issue a CR letter, including a deficiency related to the facility or site, if the inspection has not been conducted by the action date.\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter without facility or site deficiencies\n\nAn inspection is necessary because there is insufficient information currently available to make a determination on the acceptability of a facility or site16,17 and other deficiencies have been identified.\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.798919200897217", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry\n\nReports on the Status of\n\nPostmarketing Study Commitments --\n\nImplementation of Section 130 of the\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nModernization Act of 1997\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nFebruary 2006\n\nProceduralChapter 4 Outance for Industry Reports on the Status of Postmarketing Study Commitments - Implementation of Section 130 of the Food and Drug Administration Administration Act of 1997\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Training and Communications\n\nDivision of Drug Information, HFD-240\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\n(Tel) 301-827-4573\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm\n\nor\n\nOffice of Communication, Training, and\n\nManufacturers Assistance, HFM-40\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n1401 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852-1448\n\n(Tel) 800-835-4709 or 301-827-1800\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cber/guidelines.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nFebruary 2006\n\nProcedural\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Postmarketing Study Commitments Working Group, which includes representatives from the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nReports on the Status of Postmarketing Study Commitments -- Implementation of Section 130 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic.

This guidance provides recommendations on procedures, content, and format for submitting a postmarketing study commitment status report for an approved human drug or licensed biological product. This guidance also describes the FDA's obligations to make certain information about postmarketing study commitments public, including the type of information that will be made public and the FDA's time frames for reviewing postmarketing study commitment final reports.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nLegislative History of Postmarketing Study Commitment Status Reports\n\nSection 130(a) of Title I of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (the Modernization Act), signed into law on November 21, 1997, added section 506B (Reports ofPostmarketing Studies) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the \"Act\") (21 U.S.C. 356b). Section 506B gives the FDA additional authority for monitoring the progress of postmarketing studies that drug and biologics applicants (\"you\") have agreed to or are required to conduct. On October 30, 2000, the FDA issued final regulations implementing that law (65 FR 64607). The regulations went into effect on April 30, 2001 (66 FR 10815), and FDA issued a draft guidance related to the rule in April 2001. This final guidance complements the rule by describing in greater detail the content, format, and timing of the postmarketing study commitment reports required by section 506B. The guidance also discusses reporting of other postmarketing studies not subject to section 506B.\n\nIf you are required by the FDA, or if you have entered into an agreement with the FDA, to conduct a postmarketing study concerning clinical safety, clinical efficacy, clinical pharmacology, or nonclinical toxicology, you are required to provide the Agency with an annual report on the status of the study until the FDA notifies you, in writing, that the Agency concurs with your determination that the study commitment has been fulfilled or that the study either is no longer feasible or would no longer provide useful information. This annual report must address the progress of the study or the reasons for your failure to conduct the study (21 U.S.C. 356b(a); 21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(vii) and 601.70(b)).\n\nSection 506B also requires the FDA to make certain information available to the public about postmarketing study commitments, and your progress in completing those studies. More specifically, under section 506B(c), the FDA must develop and publish annually in the Federal Register a report on the status of postmarketing study commitments that you have agreed to or are required to conduct and for which annual status reports have been submitted (21 U.S.C. 356b(c)). Section 506B(b) indicates that any information necessary to identify you as the applicant of a study and establish the status of a study and the reasons, if any, for any failure to carry out the study, is considered to be public information (21 U.S.C. 356b(b)).\n\n2 Regulations for Reporting Postmarketing Studies\n\nThe regulations implementing section 506B of the Act apply to both human drug products and licensed biological products (21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(vii) and 601.70). These regulations are summarized as follows:\n\nApplicants are required to file postmarketing study commitment status reports (506B reports) for studies that the FDA has required an applicant to conduct or that an applicant has agreed, in writing, to conduct, provided that the study concerns a product's clinical safety, clinical efficacy, clinical pharmacology, or nonclinical toxicology (506B studies). Information from 506B reports will be included in the Agency's annual Federal Register report and on the postmarketing study commitments Web site.2 Footnote 2: http://www.fda.gov/cder/pmc\n\nThe regulations apply to 506B studies for all approved applications, with no exception for products that are not actively marketed.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\nyou are required to conduct provided that the study concerns a product's clinical safety, clinical efficacy, clinical pharmacology, or nonclinical toxicology.\n* A postmarketing study might be conducted because you and the FDA agree, in writing, that one or more such study should be conducted. These agreements can be made at the time of approval or after the FDA grants marketing approval to your drug. If you and the FDA agree at the time of drug approval that a postmarketing study should be performed, the study will likely be used to provide additional information about product risks, benefits, and/or optimal use. If you and the FDA determine after approval of the drug that a postmarketing study should be performed, the study will generally be used to address a safety concern that has been identified during the post-approval use of the drug. You must file 506B reports for postmarketing study commitments that you agreed, in writing, to conduct provided that the study concerns a product's clinical safety, clinical efficacy, clinical pharmacology, or nonclinical toxicology, and provided that the study commitment is not a CMC commitment.\n* Frequently, postmarketing CMC studies are conducted because applicants agree, in writing, to conduct such studies to ensure the consistency and reliability of product quality (e.g., strength, purity, and potency). CMC commitments are not subject to 506B's reporting requirements, although 21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(viii) requires you to advise the FDA on the status of CMC commitments in another section of your annual report.\n* Product stability studies are conducted to determine the appropriate expiration date for drug products (21 CFR 211.166). Product stability studies are not subject to 506B's reporting requirements, although 21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(viii) requires you to advise the FDA on the status of all product stability studies in another section of your annual report.\n* A voluntary study can be conducted on an applicant's own initiative for a variety of reasons, such as the evaluation of a new indication, a new delivery system for a drug, a new container or closure system, or a new formulation. Voluntary studies are not subject to 506B's reporting requirements, although 21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(viii) requires you to advise the FDA on the status of voluntary studies in another section of your annual report.\n\nSummary of the Final Rule that Implements Section 506B\n\n1.1.1 Human Drug Products\n\nThe final rule amended 21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(vii) to implement section 506B. Under this section, you must provide the FDA with annual 506B reports on each 506B study annually until we notify you, in writing, that the FDA concurs with your determination that the study commitment has been fulfilled, or that the study is either no longer feasible or would no longer provide useful information. This provision will apply in rare cases to the holder of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Reports on the Status of Postmarketing Study Commitments \u2014 Implementation of Section 130 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.7931833267211914", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry Advisory Committees: Implementing Section 120 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nOctober 1998\n\nProcedural 7Chapter 6 Outance for Industry Advisory Committee: Implementing Section 120 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997\n\nComments and suggestions regarding this document should be submitted within 90 days of publication in the Federal Register of the notice announcing the availability of the guidance.

This guidance document represents the Agency\u2019s current thinking on the advisory committee provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.\n\nAdvisory Committees: Implementing Section 120 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis document provides guidance for industry on changes to the policies and procedures being used by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) with regard to advisory committees as a result of section 120 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (the Modernization Act). This guidance document supplements the policies and procedures described in the Policy and Guidance Handbook for FDA Advisory Committee. In general, the guidance explains modifications, prompted by the Modernization Act, in CDER's and CBER's practices with regard to advisory committees.\n\nII Background\n\nAdvisory committees provide independent advice and recommendations to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on scientific and technical matters related to the development and evaluation of products regulated by the Agency. Through the advisory committee system, FDA is able to secure independent professional expertise in accomplishing its mission and maintaining the public trust. CDER and CBER request advice from advisory committees on a variety of matters, including various aspects of clinical investigations and applications for marketing approval of drug products. Although the committees provide recommendations to the Agency, final decisions are made by FDA.\n\nOn November 21, 1997, President Clinton signed the Modernization Act. Section 120 of the Modernization Act amends section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) (21 U.S.C. 355) by adding section 505(n). Section 505(n)(1) of the Act directs FDA to establish panels of experts, or to use already-established panels of experts, to provide scientific advice and recommendations to the Agency regarding the clinical investigation of drugs or the approval for marketing of drugs. FDA understands the term panels of experts to mean advisory committees.\n\nSection 505(n) of the Act includes provisions for (1) additional members to be included in new advisory committees, (2) new conflict of interest considerations, (3) education and training for new committee members, (4) timely committee consideration of matters, and (5) timely Agency notification to affected persons of decisions on matters considered by advisory committees.\n\nFDA regulations in 21 CFR Part 14 establish the general procedures for Agency use of advisory committees. FDA has determined that these regulations, described in pertinent part in this guidance document, do not need to be amended for CDER and CBER to implement the modifications in advisory committee policies and procedures that have resulted from the enactment of section 505(n) of the Act.\n\nBecause CDER and CBER advisory committees are organized according to general subject (e.g., blood products, cardiovascular and renal drugs) and not according to the topic for consideration by the committee (e.g., a clinical investigation of a drug product, the content of a guidance document), CDER and CBER generally use the same policies and procedures for all advisory committees, regardless of the topic that will be considered by the committee. Consequently, unless otherwise stated, the following guidance applies to CDER and CBER advisory committees regardless of the topic for consideration.\n\n3 Membership\n\nAdvisory committees generally consist of individuals possessing recognized expertise and judgment in a specific field. Members have the training and experience necessary to evaluate information objectively and to interpret its significance under various, often controversial, circumstances.\n\nSection 505(n)(3) of the Act describes the membership requirements for new advisory committees that may be established under section 505(n)(1) of the Act. Advisory committees that are already chartered need not amend their membership to comply with these new provisions. However, in the interest of furthering the goals of the statutory amendments, CDER and CBER intend generally to modify current advisory committee membership on a meeting-by-meeting basis and to recharter committees, as needed, to reflect the representation described in section 505(n)(3) of the Act.\n\nAdvisory committee membership under the new statute is comprised of core members of the panel and other individuals who may be called upon to participate in a given meeting on an ad hoc basis. The core members of the advisory committee are appointed by the Commissioner or his/her designee based on their scientific or technical expertise and serve for the duration of the committee or until their terms of appointment expire, they resign, or they are removed by the Commissioner or his/her designee (21 CFR 14.80). In accordance with section 505(n)(3) of the Act, the Commissioner or his/her designee may call upon individuals to supplement the core membership on an ad hoc basis so that the group considering an issue presented to an advisory committee may also include (1) representation of consumer/patient interests, (2) representation from the interests of the drug manufacturing industry, and (3) at least two members who are specialists with expertise in the particular disease or condition for which the drug under consideration is proposed to be indicated.\n\nVoting members of an advisory committee have expertise, as demonstrated by training, education,and experience, in the subject matter that the committee is considering. To the extent feasible, voting members should possess skill and experience in the development, manufacture, or use of the types of drugs to be referred to the committee, and the group of voting members should reflect a balanced composition of scientific expertise through members with diverse professional education, training, and experience (21 CFR 14.80(b)(1)). Core members of an advisory committee will be voting members of the committee, to the extent that such participation is not prevented by conflict of interest laws and regulations. Ad hoc committee members who are representatives of consumer or patient interests, or who have expertise in the particular disease or condition for which the drug under consideration is proposed to be indicated, will be voting members if (1) the members have the requisite scientific or technical expertise and (2) this participation is not prevented by conflict of interest laws and regulations. Because of inherent conflict of interest concerns, representatives of the drug manufacturing industry will not be voting members of the committee. Furthermore, no person who is a regular full-time employee of the United States government and is engaged in the administration of the Act may be a voting member of an advisory committee (section 505(n)(3) of the Act).\n\nAdvisory committee members who vote at committee meetings are selected in accordance with 21 CFR 14.80 and 14.82. At the beginning of each committee meeting, those members who are voting members will be announced.\n\nIV Conflicts of Interest\n--------------------\nContext title: Implementation of Section 120 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997-Advisory Committees \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.802128314971924", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 6: See 21 CFR 312.30(b) and 812.35(a). Under applicable Federal regulations, investigators must engage with the Drug Enforcement Administration when amending protocols for research involving Schedule I substances under the Controlled Substances Act by requesting a modification to a site-specific investigator registration (see 21 CFR 1301.18).\n\nFor all trials that are impacted by the COVID-19 public health emergency:\n\nSponsors should describe in appropriate sections of the clinical study report (or in a separate study-specific document):\n\nContingency measures implemented to manage study conduct during disruption of the study as a result of COVID-19 control measures.\n\nA listing of all participants affected by the COVID-19 related study disruption by unique trial participant number identifier and by investigational site, and a description of how the individual's participation was altered.\n\nAnalyses and corresponding discussions that address the impact of implemented contingency measures (e.g., trial participant discontinuation from investigational product and/or study, alternative procedures used to collect critical safety and/or efficacy data) on the safety and efficacy results reported for the study.\n\nRobust efforts by sponsors, investigators, and IRBs/IECs to maintain the safety of trial participants and study data integrity are expected, and such efforts should be documented. As stated above, FDA recognizes that protocol modifications may be required, including unavoidable protocol deviations due to COVID-19 illness and/or COVID-19 control measures. Efforts to minimize impacts on trial integrity, and to document the reasons for protocol deviations, will be important.\n\nIV Additional Resources\n\nFor further questions on clinical trial conduct during the COVID-19 public health emergency, please email Clinicaltrialconduct-COVID19@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nContact information for FDA's review divisions is as follows:\n\nCDER: https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/center-drug-evaluation-and-research-cder/office-new-drugs.\n\nCBER: https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/center-biologics-evaluation-and-research-cber/contacts-center-biologics-evaluation-research-cber/indcont.\n\nCDRH: https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/cdrh-offices/cdrh-management-directory-organization.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nDeciding whether to suspend, continue, or initiate trials..................................................................8\n\nDeciding whether to continue administering product appearing to provide benefit..................9\n\nManaging protocol deviations and amendments..................................10\n\nSubmitting changes to IND and IDE protocol..................................11\n\nConducting remote (virtual) clinic visits..................11\n\nCapturing data on protocol and process deviations..................12\n\nDelivering low-risk investigational products to home..................12\n\nDisposal of unused investigational product..................13\n\nChanging site for delivering high-risk investigational product..................14\n\nAlternative monitoring approaches..................14\n\nObtaining informed consent for patients in isolation..................15\n\nObtaining informed consent from legally authorized representatives..................17\n\nObtaining informed consent when electronic and paper forms cannot be provided..................18\n\nRemote clinical outcome assessments..................20\n\nRemote site monitoring visits..................22\n\nChallenges and temporary waivers for eCTDs..................24\n\nForm 1572 and accountability....25\n\nUse of commercial vs. investigational products..................26\n\nScheduling of meetings with review divisions..................27\n\nUse of alternative laboratory or imaging centers..................28\n\nUse of video conferencing for trial visits..................28\n\nPostmarketing requirements for drugs, biologics, and devices..................29\n\nReporting serious adverse events for approved drugs used to treat COVID-19..................31\n\nReporting serious adverse events associated with COVID-19 in a non-COVID trial....32\n\nReviewing IND safety reports..................33\n\nCollecting electronic signatures and Part 11 compliance..................34\n\nExclusion criteria for \"investigational medical products\"..................35\n\nRe-monitoring after pandemic-related restrictions are lifted..................36\n\nQ1.: What are some of the key factors that a sponsor should consider when deciding whether to suspend or continue an ongoing study or to initiate a new study during the COVID-19 public health emergency?\n\nCentral to any decision should be ensuring that the safety of clinical trial participants can be maintained. Sponsors, in consultation with clinical investigators and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committee (IECs), should assess whether the protection of a participant's safety, welfare, and rights is best served by continuing a study participant in the trial as per the protocol or by discontinuing the administration or use of the investigational product or even participation in the trial. Such decisions will depend on specific circumstances, including the nature of the investigational product, the ability to conduct appropriate safety monitoring, the potential impact on the investigational product supply chain, and the nature of the disease under study in the trial. As part of this assessment, sponsors should carefully consider the following aspects of clinical trial conduct when deciding how or whether to proceed with a clinical trial:\n\nAssessing whether the limitations imposed by the COVID-19 public health emergency on protocol implementation pose new safety risks to trial participants, and whether it is feasible to mitigate these risks by amending study processes and/or procedures.\n\nAssessing the continued availability of the clinical investigator/sub-investigators to provide oversight of the trial and properly assess and manage safety issues that may emerge.\n\nAssessing whether there will be sufficient clinical trial support staff given the evolving COVID-19 situation and its impact on staff availability. Are there appropriately trained staff that could be available to handle the expected tasks? Is there adequate equipment and materials for clinical trial support staff?\n\nAssessing whether clinical investigator sites will remain open to trial participants for required in-person assessments or whether the clinical investigator has the ability to provide required in-person assessments at an acceptable alternate location(s), or whether such protocol-specified, in-person assessments can instead be conducted virtually.\n\nAssessing the continued availability of clinical trial supplies and continued operations of vendors, especially related to supply of the investigational product and/or to clinical trial supplies that are essential to maintaining appropriate safety monitoring or other key trial procedures. This should include consideration of product stability (shelf life) if the treatment schedule is revised, or if the clinical site is unable to properly store the product for the needed duration.\n\nAssessing the continued availability of, and support for, information technology systems and any other technological tools that are needed to support the trial. Are current contingency plans adequate for the types of disruptions that might beanticipated? What other plans can be put in place to minimize any potential disruptions?\n\nAssessing whether there will be continued operations of, and adequate communications with, IRB/IEC and Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) staff, if applicable, to support trial needs.\n\nAssessing whether it is feasible to conduct the trial in light of any COVID-19 public health measures implemented by Federal and State authorities to control the virus.\n\nInvolvement of a study's DMC, if one has been established, can provide support for the assessments discussed above. Since a primary responsibility of the DMC is assuring the safety of participating trial participants, the DMC's assessment of the impact of modifications of trial conduct due to COVID-19 on patient safety is important to consider.\n\nThe risks and benefits of continuing a trial are likely different than a decision to initiate a trial (other than trials intended to evaluate investigational treatments or vaccines for COVID-19). Given the evolving situation, with likely increasing impacts on investigators, staff, and supply chains, sponsors should carefully consider the ability to effectively mitigate risks such that patient safety and trial integrity are assured. In addition, it is important to consider whether initiation of the trial could interfere with public health measures implemented by Federal and State authorities to control the virus.\n\nQ2.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides information on the implementation of section 1102 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA), which added section 524 to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360n).2 Section 524 authorizes the FDA to award priority review vouchers to sponsors of certain tropical disease product applications that meet the criteria specified in that section. Since the enactment of FDAAA, we have received numerous inquiries about the scope of section 524 and how various aspects of section 524 should be interpreted. The purpose of this guidance is to provide a response to those questions.\n\nFootnote 2: Section 524 of the FD&C Act subsequently was amended December 16, 2014 (Public Law 113-233).\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nSection 524 was designed to encourage development of new drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of certain tropical diseases affecting millions of people throughout the world. Although the diseases addressed by this legislation represent a significant disease burden for humanity, there has been remarkably little progress over the past 50 years in development of drugs and vaccines for these diseases. Because these diseases are found primarily in poor and developing countries, existing incentives have been insufficient to encourage development of new and innovative drug therapies. Although these tropical diseases generally are rare in the United States, intercontinental jet transport, immigration, tourism, and military operations are increasing the direct effect these diseases have on the health of Americans. By enacting section 524, Congress intended to stimulate new drug development by offering additional incentives for obtaining FDA approval of certain tropical disease drug products. Under section 524, the sponsor of a human drug application (as defined in section 735(1) of the FD&C Act) for a tropical disease drug product may be eligible for a voucher that can be used to obtain a priority review for a subsequent human drug application submitted under section 505(b)(1)3 of the FD&C Act or section 351 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act after the date of approval of the tropical disease drug product.\n\nFootnote 3: Section 505(b)(2) new drug applications (NDAs) are submitted under section 505(b)(1), so all references to NDAs submitted under section 505(b)(1) include 505(b)(2) applications.\n\n3 Provisions of Section 524 -- an overview\n\nFor Which Human Drug Application Is a Sponsor Eligible to Receive a Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher?\n\nThe application must be for the prevention or treatment of a tropical disease as defined in section 524(a)(3) of the FD&C Act (see section IV, Question 2, of this guidance)\n\nThe application must be submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act or section 351 of the PHS Act\n\nThe human drug that is the subject of the application must not contain any active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient) that has been approved in any other application under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act or section 351 of the PHS Act\n\nThe application must be \"for prevention or treatment of a tropical disease,\" and must be approved \"for use in the prevention, detection, or treatment of a tropical disease\"4 Footnote 4: The statute uses two different but overlapping qualifications for meeting the definition of \u201ctropical disease product application.\n\nWhat Are the Parameters for Use of a Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher?\n\nThe application using the priority review voucher must also be submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act or section 351 of the PHS Act, and is not limited to drug products for tropical diseases.\n\nAt least 90 days before submission of the human drug application for which the priority review voucher will be used, the sponsor planning to use the voucher must notify the FDA of an intent to use the voucher and the date on which the sponsor intends to submit the application.\n\nWhen using the voucher, a sponsor must pay an extra user fee (i.e., a separate priority review user fee) to support the review of the application based on the average cost of a priority new drug application/biologics license application (NDA/BLA) review in the previous fiscal year. Payment of this extra fee, to which the sponsor is legally committed as a result of the notification of its intent to use the voucher, is not subject to waivers, exemptions, reductions, or refunds. For further explanation, see the response to Question 21 in section IV.\n\nThe sponsor of a tropical disease drug product receiving a priority review voucher may transfer the voucher to another sponsor (see section IV, Question 17).\n\nIV Policies and Procedures -- Questions and Answers\n\nThis section provides answers to frequently asked questions regarding the scope of section 524.\n\nDefinitions: Tropical Disease Product Application and Tropical Disease\n\n0.1 What is a tropical disease product application?\n\nThe term tropical disease product application is defined in section 524(a)(4) of the FD&C Act. The term refers to an application that is:\n\nA human drug application as defined in section 735(1) of the FD&C Act:5 Footnote 5: This definition includes applications for drugs submitted under section 505(b) of the FD&C Act and applications for most biological drugs, including vaccines, submitted under section 351(a) of the PHS Act, but excludes applications for blood components and certain other biological drug products. For details, refer to section 735(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 379g(1)). The definition does not cover applications for medical devices.\n\nFor prevention or treatment of a tropical disease (see Question 2); and\n\nThat the FDA deems eligible for priority review\n\nApproved by the FDA after the date of the enactment of FDAAA for use in the prevention or treatment of a tropical disease* For a human drug, no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient) of which has been approved in any other application under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act or section 351 of the PHS Act\n\nQ2. What diseases are considered tropical diseases for priority review voucher purposes?\n\nA tropical disease is any of the following diseases (see section 524(a)(3) of the FD&C Act):\n\nTuberculosis\n\nMalaria\n\nBlinding trachoma\n\nBuruli Ulcer\n\nCholera\n\nDengue/Dengue haemorrhagic fever\n\nDracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease)\n\nFascioliasis\n\nHuman African trypanosomiasis\n\nLeishmaniasis\n\nLeprosy\n\nLymphatic filariasis\n\nOnchocerciasis\n\nSchistosomiasis\n\nSoil transmitted helminthiasis\n\nYaws\n\nFilovirus Diseases\n\nZika Virus Disease\n\nAny other infectious disease for which there is no significant market in developed nations and that disproportionately affects poor and marginalized populations, designated by order of the Secretary.\n\nQ3. Does the FDA plan to add other infectious diseases to the list? If so, when can we expect that to occur?\n--------------------\nContext title: Tropical Disease Priority Review Vouchers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.930023670196533"], "With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed?

Reference to data published in the literature is not considered sufficient. Validation of storage periods should be performed on QCs that have been stored for a time that is equal to or longer than the study sample storage periods.\n\nStability of the analyte in the studied matrix should be evaluated using low and high concentration QCs. Aliquots of the low and high QCs are analysed at time zero and after the applied storage conditions that are to be evaluated. One bulk QC should be prepared at each concentration level. For each concentration tested, the bulk sample should be divided into a minimum of three aliquots that will be stored, stressed and analysed.\n\nThe QCs are analysed against a calibration curve, obtained from freshly spiked calibration standards in a run with its corresponding freshly spiked QCs or QCs for which stability has been proven. While the use of freshly prepared calibration standards and QCs is the preferred approach, it is recognised that in some cases, for macromolecules, it may be necessary to freeze them overnight. In such cases, valid justification should be provided and freeze-thaw stability demonstrated. QCs should be kept frozen for at least 12 hours between the thawing cycles. The mean concentration at each QC level should be within (\\pm)20% of the nominal concentration.\n\nSince sample dilution may be required for many LBA methods due to a narrow calibration range, the concentrations of the study samples may be consistently higher than the ULOQ of the calibration curve. If this is the case, the concentration of the QCs should be adjusted, considering the applied sample dilution, to represent the actual sample concentration range.\n\nFor fixed dose combination products and specifically labelled drug regimens, the freeze-thaw, bench-top and long-term stability tests of an analyte in matrix should be conducted with the matrix spiked with all of the dosed compounds, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAs mentioned in Section 3.2.8, the investigation of stability should cover bench top (short-term) stability at room temperature or sample preparation temperature and freeze-thaw stability. In addition, long-term stability should be studied.\n--------------------\nContext title: M10_Guideline_Step4_2022_0524\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.6506171226501465", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed?

The guidance is applicable to the bioanalytical methods used to measure concentrations of chemical and biological drug(s) and their metabolite(s) in biological samples (e.g., blood, plasma, serum, other body fluids or tissues) obtained in nonclinical toxicokinetic (TK) studies conducted according to the principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), nonclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies conducted as surrogates for clinical studies, and all phases of clinical trials, including comparative bioavailability/bioequivalence (BA/BE) studies, in regulatory submissions. Full method validation is recommended for the primary matrix intended to support regulatory submissions. Additional matrices should be validated as necessary.\n\nFor studies that are not submitted for regulatory approval or not considered for regulatory decisions regarding safety, efficacy, or labeling (e.g., exploratory investigations), applicants may decide on the level of qualification that supports their own internal decision-making.\n\nThe information in this guidance applies to the quantitative analysis by ligand binding assays (LBAs) and chromatographic methods such as liquid chromatography (LC) or gas chromatography (GC), which are typically used in combination with mass spectrometry (MS) detection.\n\nFor studies that are subject to GLP or Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements, the bioanalysis of study samples must conform to those requirements. The bioanalysis of biomarkers and bioanalytical methods used for the assessment of immunogenicity are not within the scope of this guidance.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.\n\nInstead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII General Principles (2)\n\nMethod Development (2.1)\n\nThe purpose of bioanalytical method development is to define the design, operating conditions, limitations, and suitability of the method for its intended purpose and to ensure that the method is ready for validation.\n\nBefore or during the development of a bioanalytical method, the applicant is encouraged to, if feasible, understand the analyte of interest (e.g., the physicochemical properties of the drug, in vitro and in vivo metabolism, preferential distribution between red blood cells and plasma, and protein binding) and consider aspects of any prior analytical methods that may be applicable.\n\nMethod development involves identifying the procedures and conditions involved with quantifying the analyte. Method development can include the characterization of the following bioanalytical elements: reference standards, critical reagents, calibration curve, quality control samples (QCs), selectivity and specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, precision, recovery, stability of the analyte, and minimum required dilution (MRD).\n\nBioanalytical method development does not require extensive record keeping or notation. Once the method has been developed, bioanalytical method validation proves that the method is suited to the analysis of the study samples.\n\nIf a problem is encountered with the method during the analysis of nonclinical or clinical study samples that requires that the analysis be stopped, any changes to the method and the rationale should be documented.\n\nMethod Validation (2.2)\n\nii.2.1 Full Validation (2.2.1)\n\nBioanalytical method validation is important to ensure the acceptability of assay performance and the reliability of analytical results. A bioanalytical method is defined as a set of procedures used for measuring analyte concentrations in biological samples. A full validation of a bioanalytical method should be performed when establishing a bioanalytical method for the quantification of an analyte in clinical and in applicable nonclinical studies. Full validation should also be performed when implementing an analytical method that is reported in the literature and when a commercial kit is repurposed for bioanalytical use in drug development. Usually, one analyte has to be determined, but on occasion it may be appropriate to measure more than one analyte. This may involve two different drugs, a parent drug with its metabolites or the enantiomers or isomers of a drug. In these cases, the principles of validation and analysis apply to all analytes of interest. For chromatographic methods, a full validation should include the following elements, unless otherwise justified: selectivity, specificity, matrix effect, calibration curve (response function), range (lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) to upper limitof quantification (ULOQ)), accuracy, precision, carryover, dilution integrity, stability, and reinjection reproducibility.\n\nFor LBAs, the following elements should be evaluated, unless otherwise justified: specificity, selectivity, calibration curve (response function), range (LLOQ to ULOQ), accuracy, precision, carryover, dilution linearity, and stability. If necessary, parallelism can be conducted when appropriate study samples are available.\n\nThe assessments that are performed during validation should be relevant to the sample analysis workflow. The matrix used for bioanalytical method validation should be the same as the matrix of the study samples, including anticoagulants and additives. In cases in which it may be difficult to obtain an identical matrix to that of the study samples (e.g., rare matrices such as tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, bile or in cases where free drug is measured), surrogate matrices may be acceptable for analytical method validation.\n\nThe choice of surrogate matrix should be scientifically justified. Matrix differences within species (e.g., age, ethnicity, gender) are generally not considered different when validating a method.\n\nA specific, detailed, written description of the bioanalytical method and validation procedure should be established a priori. This description may be in the form of a protocol, study plan, report, notebook, or Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).\n\nii.1.2 Partial Validation (2.2.2)\n\nModifications to a fully validated analytical method may be evaluated by partial validation.\n\nPartial validation can range from as little as one accuracy and precision determination to a nearly full validation (refer to section VI.A (6.1)). The items in a partial validation should be determined according to the extent and nature of the changes made to the method.\n\nii.1.3 Cross Validation (2.2.3)\n\nCross validation is required to demonstrate how the reported data are related when multiple bioanalytical methods and/or multiple bioanalytical laboratories are involved (refer to section VI.B (6.2)).\n\nIII Chromatography (3)\n\nReference Standards (3.1)\n\nDuring method validation and the analysis of study samples, a blank biological matrix is spiked with the analyte(s) of interest using solutions of reference standard(s) to prepare calibration standards and QCs. Calibration standards and QCs should be prepared from separate stock solutions. However, calibration standards and QCs may be prepared from the same stock solution provided the accurate preparation and stability of the stock solution should have been verified.\n\nA suitable internal standard (IS) should be added to all calibration standards, QCs, and study samples during sample processing. The absence of an IS should be justified.\n\nIt is important that the reference standard is well characterized and the quality (e.g., purity, identity) of the reference standard and the suitability of the IS is ensured, as the quality will affect the outcome of the analysis and, therefore, the study data. The reference standard used during validation and study sample analysis should be obtained from an authentic and traceable source. The reference standard should be identical to the analyte. If this is not possible, an established form (e.g., salt or hydrate) of known quality should be used.\n\nSuitable reference standards include compendial standards, commercially available standards or sufficiently characterized standards prepared in-house or by an external organization. A certificate of analysis (CoA) or an equivalent alternative is recommended to ensure quality and to provide information on the purity, storage conditions, retest/expiration date and batch number of the reference standard.\n\nA CoA is not required for the IS as long as the suitability for use is demonstrated, e.g., a lack of analytical interference is shown for the substance itself or any impurities thereof.\n\nWhen MS detection is used, the use of the stable isotope-labeled analyte as the IS is recommended whenever possible. However, it is important that the labeled standard is of high isotope purity and that no isotope exchange reaction occurs. The presence of unlabeled analyte should be checked and if unlabeled analyte is detected, the potential influence should be evaluated during method validation.\n\nStock and working solutions should only be prepared from reference standards that are within the stability period as documented in the CoA (either expiration date or the retest date).\n\nValidation (3.2)\n\nSelectivity (3.2.1)\n\nSelectivity is the ability of an analytical method to differentiate and measure the analyte in the presence of potential interfering substances in the blank biological matrix.\n--------------------\nContext title: M10 Bioanalytical Method Validation and Study Sample Analysis\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.8224945068359375", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: No, heroic measures need not be taken. Storage conditions should be consistent with the knowledge of the stability of the mixture under conditions of use and reasonable so as not to permit accelerated decomposition.\n\nWhat are the details of the Agency's reserve sample retention policy?\n\nWith regard to reserve sample retention, the GLPs provide as follows:\n\nReserve samples are to be retained from each batch of test and control article prepared in accord with section 58.105(a) for all nonclinical laboratory studies lasting more than 4 weeks. For the purposes of these sections, the 4-week period includes initial dosing to the final in vivo observations. Only sufficient sample need be retained to permit meaningful reanalysis. The samples need be retained either for the terms specified in section 58.105 or for the useful life of the sample (dependent on the stability or the quality of the sample) whichever is shorter. Storage conditions should be those commonly accepted as minimizing the deterioration of sample quality and need not require exhaustive study to determine those which maximize stability. All batches of test and control article mixtures are to be retained even if they are prepared daily.\n\nFor medical devices, how can stability be demonstrated any more effectively than by the continued functioning of a device within specifications during an in vivo nonclinical study?\n\nThe stated procedure is acceptable.\n\nThe cost of chemical assay development and assay of dosage forms prior to conducting acute studies far exceeds the cost of doing the experiment. Will data confirming the weighing, mixing and administration of the test article be considered sufficient?\n\nNo. The test article must be sufficiently characterized to ensure that the same article is used in any further studies.\n\nDoes FDA expect a firm to conduct long-term stability tests on test article-carrier mixtures, which are used within a day of preparation?\n\nThe firm must determine the stability of the mixtures over the period of their use. The GLPs require retention of samples of all batches of test article-carrier mixtures for studies that last longer than 4 weeks. The regulations do not require stability studies on such samples. Samples placed in storage may be analyzed periodically to determine their useful storage life.\n\nAm I correct in assuming that the chemical testing done by the sponsor to characterize the test article is not covered by the GLPs when the test article is subsequently submitted to a contract laboratory as a blind sample for safety testing?\n\nThe GLPs do not cover the basic exploratory chemical tests done to derive the specifications of the test article. They do cover those chemical tests done on discrete batches of test article to determine identity, strength, purity and composition.\n\nDoes the phrase \"mixtures of articles and carriers\" also refer to solutions and suspensions, e.g., a solution of a test article in distilled water?\n\nYes.\n\nFor acute studies, is it necessary for the laboratory to analyze each batch of test article-carrier mixture prior to dosing the test system?\n\nNo. Uniformity of the mixture must be known and periodic batch analyses need to be done.\n\nWill dialogues such as this and recent inspectional experience bring about substantive changes in the final regulations through FDA initiated proposed amendments? Whatchanges are anticipated in the reserve sample retention requirements?\n\nThe Agency does not believe the initiative to change the GLPs rests with FDA. Petitions for change may be submitted to the Agency in accord with the 21 CFR 10.30. As was mentioned at the meeting, the Agency recognizes that the reserve sample retention requirements are extensive and expensive and a petition for change would be considered.\n10. What guidelines can be used by a laboratory or sponsor in deciding how frequently concentration analyses should be made?\n\nThe Agency has not established guidelines with regard to the frequency of periodic reanalysis of test article-carrier mixtures. Enough batches should be analyzed to assure that the test systems are being exposed to the quantities of test article in the specified protocol.\n11. How long must one retain samples of feed used in nonclinical laboratory studies and should they be frozen?\n\nThe sample retention period differs for the various regulated products and the periods are listed in section 58.195. Feed samples need not be frozen for storage.\n12. What is the definition of carrier?\n\nCarrier is the material with which the test article is mixed for administration to the test system. It can be feed, water, solvents and excipients depending on dosage form and route of administration.\n13. Once stability of a given concentration of a test article-carrier mixture is substantiated, is it necessary to establish a stability profile for each batch at that concentration?\n\nNo. Stability need be determined only on a single batch of test article-carrier mixture; however, periodic reanalysis to determine concentration must be done.\n14. In the course of a 14-C tissue residue study in the target animal, is it necessary to retain:\n\nAll samples listed in a - d and f above should be retained for the term listed in section 58.195.\n\na. sample of the 14-C labeled drug,\n\nb. samples of the diet fed control and experimental animals,\n\nc. samples of urine and feces after completion of the analyses,d. samples of collected tissues after completion of the analyses, e. if they must be retained, for how long? f. is similar sample retention necessary when doing \"cold\" tissue residue studies in target animals?\n15. If a battery of different tests on a substance is being conducted by different contractors, is it necessary to run replicate stability analyses from each and every contractor especially when long-term stability has been documented for the substance?\n\nNo. Once stability has been determined in accord with good science, it is not necessary to continually replicate the stability determination.\n\n58.120 Protocol\n\n58.130 Conduct of a Nonclinical Laboratory Study\n\nIn as much as only wet tissues, blocks and slides are necessary to reconstruct the histopathologic aspects of a study by a third party, are written notes, tapes, etc. of the histopathological's thought process in arriving at a final report legitimately considered \"raw data\" in the presence of a signed and dated final report? Does the Agency have the right to inspect the written notes from the pathologist?\n\nRaw data in this case, refers only to the signed and dated final report of the pathologist. Agency investigators may wish to examine the interim notes and reports in an attempt to reconstruct the study but not to second-guess the scientific process used to arrive at the final report. The GLPs do not require that these interim reports and notes be retained.\n2. What is considered to be raw data in computer systems when the data is generated from dictated results?\n\nTranscribed dictation, which has been proofread and corrected for typographical -and transcription errors, is raw data.\n3. Do the GLPs require that the protocol be amended to reflect the actual starting date of the study?\n\nYes, this is a critical piece of information, which should be supplied by way of a formal protocol amendment.\n\nIt is said that raw data may be any verified exact copy of the original data. In a computerized data system where data is put directly on disc thence to tape, what documentation of the program performing this transfer is required to assure that the tape copy is exact? The standard operating procedures, which cover computer operations, should describe the computer program and the procedure used to assure the production of an exact tape copy.\n\nIf reformatting of data is done as part of the transfer described in question 4 above, is the new file not raw data even if all data is transferred intact although in a different organization? The Agency can not precisely answer this question without further details of the new data format.\n\nAre initials and dates on data printouts (e.g., scintillation counters, gas chromatographs), when these printouts include standards, sufficient documentation for standardization? Yes.\n\nIs there a time limit for submission of the final report of a nonclinical laboratory study after its conclusion? Generally no. On occasion, for marketed products, the Agency may establish time frames for study conduct. Of course alarming findings on marketed products should be reported as soon as possible.\n\nIs it permissible to list changes in a final report on a page, which is appended, to the original final report? Yes.\n\nDoes \"studies in progress on June 20, 1979\" refer to the phase of dosing of the test system or the phase post-dosing but not yet reported? The quotation pertains to all studies for which the final report has not yet been completed. Included are all post-dosing phases.\n\nThe final report requires a list of participants. Should this include technicians as well as people who perform support functions?The final report should include the name of the study director, the names of other scientists or professionals, and the names of all supervisory personnel involved in the study.\n\nWhen an analysis protocol is developed for the first time by using standard scientific technique, who shall validate the protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.8280153274536133", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: Minimum Required Dilution\n\nMRD is a dilution factor employed in samples that are diluted with buffer solution to reduce the background signal or matrix interference on the analysis using LBA. The MRD should be identical for all samples including calibration standards and the QCs and it should be determined during method development. If MRD is changed after establishment of the method, partial validation is necessary. MRD should be defined in the Validation Report of the analytical method.\n\nCommercial and Diagnostic Kits\n\nCommercial or diagnostic kits (referred to as kits) are sometimes co-developed with new chemical or biological drugs for point-of-care patient diagnosis. The recommendations in this section of the guideline do not apply to the development of kits that are intended for point-of-care patient diagnosis (e.g., companion or complimentary diagnostic kits). Refer to the appropriate guideline documents regarding regulatory expectations for the development of these kits.\n\nIf an applicant repurposes a kit (instead of developing a new method) or utilises \"research use only\" kits to measure chemical or biological drug concentrations during the development of a novel drug, the applicant should assess the kit validation to ensure that it conforms to the drug development standards described in this guideline.\n\nValidation considerations for kit assays include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nIf the reference standard in the kit differs from that of the study samples, testing should evaluate differences in assay performance of the kit reagents. The specificity, accuracy, precision and stability of the kit assay should be demonstrated under actual conditions ofuse in the facility conducting the sample analysis. Modifications from kit processing instructions should be completely validated.\n\nKits that use sparse calibration standards (e.g., one- or two-point calibration curves) should include in-house validation experiments to establish the calibration curve with a sufficient number of standards across the calibration range.\n\nActual QC concentrations should be known. Concentrations of QCs expressed as ranges are not sufficient for quantitative applications. In such cases QCs with known concentrations should be prepared and used, independent of the kit-supplied QCs.\n\nCalibration standards and QCs should be prepared in the same matrix as the study samples. Kits with calibration standards and QCs prepared in a matrix different from the study samples should be justified and appropriate experiments should be performed.\n\nIf multiple kit assay lots are used within a study, lot-to-lot variability and comparability should be addressed for any critical reagents included in the kits.\n\nIf a kit using multiple assay plates is employed, sufficient replicate QCs should be used on each plate to monitor the accuracy of the assay. Acceptance criteria should be established for the individual plates and for the overall analytical run.\n--------------------\nContext title: M10_Guideline_Step4_2022_0524\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.9783289432525635", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: When the tonicity of a product is declared in its labeling, the manufacturing process should be appropriately controlled to assure that the osmolality of every batch will conform to labeled osmolality. Osmolality determined during development and validation might be sufficient to justify not performing testing of every batch. This data should be submitted in the application.\nQ60: When is it necessary to dilute final product to meet the concentration specification? Is there a preference to use sterile water, normal saline, or half normal saline?\n\nNormal saline is the most commonly used agent to maintain the isotonicity of the final drug product. However, you may use any of the three named diluents. Justification should be provided if an isotonic product cannot be formulated. In addition, for ANDA products, the diluent used should be the same as the diluent used in the RLD for which the ANDA is being submitted.\nQ61: What are FDA's expectations on handling invalid tests and sample size for repeat testing?\n\nUnder 21 CFR part 212, it is acceptable to repeat a test that failed the first time if a mistake or error was made in the first attempt to test (i.e., the test was truly invalid). It is not acceptable to simply retest with a new sample because of a failing result; true out-of-specification results must be investigated to determine the cause of the failure to meet the specifications, and corrections must be implemented as appropriate. If a repeat test is appropriate, the sample size depends on what parameter is being tested and should be chosen to ensure the test results are representative of the characteristics of the batch.\nQ62: Does FDA have current information about drug master files (DMFs) that might apply to PET?\n\nPET producers should contact their suppliers to determine whether they have a DMF on file with the FDA. FDA does not provide a list of DMFs that are available for reference. For further information about DMFs, see FDA Manual of Policies and Procedures (MAPPs) on DMF files, available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ManualofPoliciesProcedures/ucm079564.pdf. You can also direct any specific DMF questions to\n\ndmfquestion@cder.fda.gov.\n\nApplicants that plan to rely on one or more DMFs should provide a letter of authorization from the DMF holder that gives the ANDA or NDA applicant the right to reference the DMF and for FDA to refer to the DMF in its review of the application in the ANDA or NDA.\nQ63: Is notification to the FDA required for replacement of quality control equipment (e.g., gas chromatography (GC), HPLC, or dose calibrator)Replacement of quality control equipment is managed under the facility's quality system and should be qualified for installation, operation, and performance; therefore, notification is not necessary. However, any change in the analytical method should be reported in accordance with 21 CFR 314.70.\n* Does a change in precursor require submission of a supplement? Yes. The submission should be made under 21 CFR 314.70(b).\n* Does a change in container closure system require submission of a supplement? Yes. The submission should be made under 21 CFR 314.70.\n* Does a change in the vendor of inactive ingredients or other auxiliary materials require submission of a supplement? No, these are reported in the annual report.\n\nv.2.2 Stability Testing\n\nContent and Format for NDAs and ANDAs (the PET drug applications guidance) states that quality control needs to be done for three qualification batches at the highest concentration allowed. Upon how many batches are we required to perform stability testing?_** You should conduct stability testing of three batches. For more information, see Attachment I of the PET drug applications guidance titled \"Sample Formats\n\nChemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) Section.\"5 Footnote 5: Available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM078740.pdf.\n\nDoes stability testing need to be performed on each vial size, for example, 30 mL and 50 mL, if the components are identical? We recommend that you choose the highest vial size (i.e., the 50 mL size in the example). In some cases, multiple presentations might need to be tested (e.g., if the headspace oxygen-to-surface ratio differs significantly).\n\nAre we required to perform forced degradation studies with these short shelf life drugs?For the commonly used PET drugs (e.g., FDG, Ammonia N13, Sodium Fluoride F18), where the storage and other molecular stability characteristics under different conditions have been well defined in the scientific literature, forced degradation studies are not needed when an NDA or ANDA is submitted.\n\nFor new PET drugs, the molecular stability and storage conditions under certain stress conditions (e.g., photo-stability, pH dependant stability) might need to be evaluated and described in the application. The need for this testing should be discussed with the review division during product development (e.g., at the End of Phase-2 meeting). During inspection, the inspector may inspect the source data.\nQ70: Assuming that product stability is demonstrated, is there any limit to expiry of the product?\n\nThe stability data should support the proposed expiration dating period. These data are submitted in the application for which the expiration dating period is approved. The individual batch used may expire earlier than the approved expiration dating period. It is expected that the product will be used before its specified expiry.\n\nv.2.3 Sterility Testing\n\nQ71: With respect to sterility testing, what are the requirements for the sample hold time validation and expected storage conditions during hold time?\n\nSterility testing can begin 30 hours after manufacture without further justification.\n\nDelays beyond this time need to be justified and shown to be valid (i.e., that contamination, if present, would result in growth). Samples are to be stored appropriately during the extended hold time; the hot cell might be appropriate for storage.\nQ72: Would the air quality requirement still hold if the sterility inoculations were performed in Hungate tubes, which is generally performed within the hot cell environment, not a laminar flow environment?\n\nWe recommend that sterility tests be performed in a Class 100 environment so there is no risk of environmental contamination. However, we do understand if the sterility testing has to be performed in a hot cell because of the nature of the product.\n\nC. Current Good Manufacturing Practices\n\nQ73: Are there specific guidances for the qualification of vendors that would guide us in selecting components and establishing standards for vendor compliance?No guidance on this topic is presently available.\n\nQ74: FDA recently issued the guidance PET Drugs - Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) (Small Entity Compliance Guide) that appears to be identical to the guidance issued in December 2009. Is there a definition of small entity? Does the August 2011 version differ from the version dated December 2009?_\n\nThere are no substantive differences between the Small Entity Compliance Guide and the guidance published in December 2009. The Small Entity Compliance Guide on Drug CGMPs was prepared to comply with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121). The Act states the following:\n\nFor each rule or group of related rules for which an agency is required to prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis under section 605(b) of title 5, United States Code, the agency shall publish 1 or more guides to assist small entities in complying with the rule and shall entitle such publications \"small entity compliance guides.\"\n\nA definition for small entity can be found in section 211 of the Act.\nQ75: Is identity testing on mannose triflate required? If required, does it need to be a specific identity test?\n\nAlthough an identity test on incoming components is required to be performed, a specific identity test is not needed under certain conditions (see 21 CFR 212.40(c). When the finished-product testing of a PET drug product includes testing to ensure that the correct components have been used, the PET drug producer need only determine that each lot of incoming components complies with written specifications by examining a certificate of analysis provided by the supplier (21 CFR 212.40(c)(1)(i)). We believe that the use of this type of finished-product testing makes specific identity testing of components redundant and unnecessary. For example, when identity of the F18 radionuclide is established as part of the finished-product testing and the method of production used is well-documented and understood, it can be reasonably argued that the component that yields this radionuclide is likely to be O 18 water. In this case, a specific identity test for O 18 water is not necessary before the lot is used in production. Similarly, a specific identity test before using a lot of mannose triflate might be redundant and unnecessary when (1) a well-understood method of synthesis of FDG is used, (2) a test to confirm the radiochemical identity is performed in the finished drug product, and (3) the mannose triflate was obtained from a reliable supplier with whom a relationship has been previously established and is accompanied by a certificate of analysis.\n\nWhat is FDA's current thinking on conditional final release testing if there was a problem or malfunction? Under the CGMP regulations at 21 CFR 212.70, you may not release another batch of the PET product until you have corrected the problem concerning the malfunction of analytical equipment. A reserve sample is needed to complete the finished product testing.\n\n*Which analytical techniques, if any, require validation?\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Oversight of PET Drug Products -- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.106960296630859", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , For liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext: When several analytes are assayed simultaneously, there should be one calibration curve for each analyte studied. If an analytical run is acceptable for one analyte but has to be rejected for another analyte, the data for the accepted analyte should be used. The determination of the rejected analyte requires re-extraction and analysis only for the analyte that is reanalysed. Only data for this reanalysed analyte needs to be reported.\n\nThe back-calculated concentrations of the calibration standards and QCs of passed and accepted runs should be reported. The overall (between-run) accuracy and precision of the QCs of all accepted runs should be calculated at each concentration level and reported in the analytical report (Refer to Section 8 Documentation and Table 1). If the overall mean accuracy and/or precision fails the 15% criterion, an investigation to determine the cause of the deviation should be conducted. In the case of comparative BA/BE studies, it may result in the rejection of the data.\n\n3.3.3 Calibration Range\n\nIf a narrow range of analyte concentrations of the study samples is known or anticipated before the start of study sample analysis, it is recommended to either narrow the calibration curve range, adapt the concentrations of the QCs, or add new QCs at different concentration levels as appropriate, to adequately reflect the concentrations of the study samples.\n\nAt the intended therapeutic dose(s), if an unanticipated clustering of study samples at one end of the calibration curve is encountered after the start of sample analysis, the analysis should be stopped and either the standard calibration range narrowed (i.e., partial validation), existing QC concentrations revised, or QCs at additional concentrations added to the original curve within the observed range before continuing with study sample analysis. It is not necessary to reanalyse samples analysed before optimising the calibration curve range or QC concentrations.\n\nThe same applies if a large number of the analyte concentrations of the study samples are above the ULOQ. The calibration curve range should be changed, if possible, and QC(s) added or their concentrations modified. If it is not possible to change the calibration curve range or the number of samples with a concentration above the ULOQ is not large, samples should be diluted according to the validated dilution method.\n\nAt least 2 QC levels should fall within the range of concentrations measured in study samples. If the calibration curve range is changed, the bioanalytical method should be revalidated (partial validation) to verify the response function and to ensure accuracy and precision.\n\n3.3.4 Reanalysis of Study Samples\n--------------------\nContext title: M10_Guideline_Step4_2022_0524\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.227093696594238"], "Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide: Chapter IV.

For example, if the directions on your label say to take 1-3 tablets with breakfast, the serving size would be 3 tablets.\n\n21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2 in the Miscellaneous Category\n\n5 May I use flexibility in the wording for \"Serving Size?\"\n\nNo. You must use the term \"Serving Size.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)\n\nNutrient Declaration\n\nWhat nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nTotal calories, calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sugars, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron must be listed when they are present in measurable amounts. A measurable amount is an amount that exceeds the amount that can be declared as \"zero\" in the nutrition label of conventional foods, as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(c). If present in a measurable amount, trans fat must be listed on a separate line underneath the listing of saturated fat by January 1, 2006.\n\nCalories from saturated fat and the amount of polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, sugar alcohol, and other carbohydrate may be declared, but they must be declared when a claim is made about them.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) (see 68 FR 41434 at 41505, July 11, 3003)\n\nMust I declare vitamins and minerals (other than vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron) listed in 21 CFR 101. 9(c)(8)(iv) and (c)(9)?\n\nNo. You are only required to declare them when they are added to the product for purposes of supplementation, or if you make a claim about them.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\n8 Am I required to list any other nutrients if I make a claim about them?\n\nYes. When you make a claim about calories from saturated fat, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated fat, sugar alcohol, monounsaturated fat, other carbohydrate, and soluble fiber, you must list that nutrient.\nYes. Dietary ingredients for which no daily values have been established must be listed by their common or usual names when they are present in a dietary supplement. They must be identified as having no Daily Values by use of a symbol in the column for \"% Daily Value\" that refers to the footnote \"Daily Value Not Established.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(F) and (b)(3)\n\nIf I use a magnesium salt as a binder, where must I declare it?\n\nYou must list the specific magnesium salt in the ingredient statement below the \"Supplement Facts\" panel, not in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel. Ingredients in dietary supplements that are not dietary ingredients, such as binders, excipients, fillers, must be included in the ingredient statement.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(g)\n\nMust I declare vitamin E when it occurs naturally in my product and I make no claim for it?\n\nNo. Because Vitamin E is not one of the 14 mandatory dietary ingredients, it does not need to be declared when it occurs naturally.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\nMay I declare protein on the label if my product contains only individual amino acids?\n\nNo. You may not declare protein on your products that contain only amino acids.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\nMust I list the dietary ingredients in my products in a specified order?\n\nYes. You must list the dietary ingredients that have Daily Values in the same order as for the labels of conventional foods, except that vitamins, minerals and electrolytes are grouped together. This results in the following order for vitamins and minerals:\n\nVitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, calcium, iron, phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, and potassium.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)\n\nMay I use synonyms for my dietary ingredients?\n\nYes. You may use the following synonyms in parentheses after your dietary ingredients: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), thiamin (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folate (folacin or folic acid), and calories (energy). Alternatively, you may list \"folic acid\" or \"folacin\" without parentheses in place of \"folate.\" You may also express energy content parenthetically in kiljoules immediately following the caloric content.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)(2)\n\n23.8.25.2.37.7221 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 101.9(c)\n\nPercent Of Daily Value (% DV)\n\nWhat is the % DV?\n\nThe % DV is the percent of the Daily Value (i.e., Reference Daily Intakes or Daily Reference Value) of a dietary ingredient that is in a serving of the product.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)\n\nDo I need to list the % DV on my label?\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

(21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAs for the phrase \"levels of significance,\" as used in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii) and 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and whether the phrase refers to statistical testing of hypotheses or mathematical concepts related to the degree of accuracy starting with the first nonzero digit, the phrase \"levels of significance\" refers to the degree of accuracy when rounding nutrients for purposes of declaring quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the label.\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c), provide specific rounding requirements for nutrients such as sodium. Before we issued the Nutrition Facts label final rule, sodium and potassium content was to be expressed as zero when the serving contained less than 5 milligrams (mg), to the nearest 5 mg increment when the serving contained less than or equal to 140 mg, and to the nearest 10 mg increment when the serving contained more than 140 mg. The Nutrition\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFacts label final rule amended 21 CFR 101.9(c)(5) to replace the requirements for the labeling of potassium with those of fluoride and amended 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) to establish an RDI for potassium and add it to the list of vitamins and minerals with RDIs. The requirements for declaring the quantitative amount of potassium are now the same as those for other vitamins and minerals with RDIs.\n\nThe RDIs for some vitamins and minerals are small numerical values (e.g., copper 0.9 mg). Nutrients with an RDI of less than 5 would not be able to be declared on the Supplement Facts label if they contain less than 2 percent of the RDI (e.g. 2 percent of the RDI for copper is 0.018 mg) and the amount is declared to the nearest mg or microgram (mcg) (e.g. if the amount of copper in a serving of the product is 0.017, but is rounded to zero). The vitamins and minerals with an RDI of less than 5 mg or mcg are thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, copper, and manganese. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest hundredth of a mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 5 mg or mcg, but less than 50 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest tenth of a mg or mcg per serving. The vitamins or minerals with an RDI of at least 5 mg or mcg but less than 50 mg or mcg are iron, vitamin D, vitamin E, niacin, biotin, pantothenic acid, zinc, chromium, and molybdenum. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest tenth of a mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg, but less than 250 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest mg or mcg. The vitamins or minerals with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg but less than 250 mg or mcg are vitamin C, vitamin K, iodine, and selenium. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the minerals with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg but less than 250 mg or mcg are vitamin C, vitamin K, iodine, and selenium.

Our regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv), provide RDIs for infants through 12 months, children 1 through 3 years, and pregnant and lactating women. The declaration recommendations provided in this guidance can also be applied to the RDIs for these subpopulations.\n\nVII References\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \"Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee,\" Advisory Report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Agriculture.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the telephone number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nOn December 1, 2014, FDA (we) published a final rule entitled \"Food Labeling; Nutrition Labeling of Standard Menu Items in Restaurants and Similar Retail Food Establishments\" (\"the rule\") in the Federal Register to implement the nutrition labeling provisions in section 4205 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (\"section 4205\").2 The rule is effective on December 1, 2015. Section 4205 amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), among other things, to require restaurants and similar retail food establishments that are part of a chain with 20 or more locations doing business under the same name and offering for sale substantially the same menu items to provide calorie and other nutrition information for standard menu items, including food on display and self-service food. Under section 4205, restaurants and similar retail food establishments not otherwise covered by the law may elect to become subject to the Federal requirements by registering every other year with FDA. Providing accurate, clear, and consistent nutrition information, including the calorie content of foods, in restaurants and similar retail food establishments will make such nutrition information available to consumers in a direct and accessible manner to enable consumers to make informed and healthful dietary choices.\n\nFootnote 2: The rule is codified at 21 CFR 101.11.\n\nWe have prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121). This guidance document restates in plain language the requirements set forth in 21 CFR 101.11 concerning nutrition labeling of standard menu items in establishments covered by the rule. We have organized this guidance in a question/answer format and also identify the relevant regulation in parentheses after each answer. The rule is binding and has the full force and effect of law.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in our guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nIn the remainder of this guidance, \"you\" and \"I\" refer to establishments that are subject to the rule.\n\nII Coverage of the Rule\n\nEstablishments Covered by the Rule\n\nii.a.1 Who is subject to the rule?\n\nYou are subject to the rule if you are a \"covered establishment.\" The rule defines \"covered establishment\" as a restaurant or similar retail food establishment that is part of a chain with 20 or more locations doing business under the same name (regardless of the type of ownership, e.g., individual franchises) and offering for sale substantially the same menu items, as well as a restaurant or similar retail food establishment that is registered to be covered under the rule. (21 CFR 101.11(a)).\n\nii.a.2 Where can I find information about registering voluntarily to be covered by the rule?\n\nSee section VI of this document and 21 CFR 101.11(d) for information on how a restaurant or similar retail food establishment that is not part of a chain with 20 or more locations doing business under the same name and offering for sale substantially the same menu items may voluntarily register to be subject to the rule.\n\nii.a.3 How does the rule define \"restaurant or similar retail food establishment\"?\n\nThe rule defines \"restaurant or similar retail food establishment\" as a retail establishment that offers for sale restaurant-type food, except if it is a school as defined by 7 CFR 210.2 or 220.2. (21 CFR 101.11(a))\n\nii.a.4 How does the rule define \"restaurant-type food\"?\n\nThe rule defines \"restaurant-type food\" as food that is:\n\n(1) Usually eaten on the premises, while walking away, or soon after arriving at another location; and\n\n(2) Either:\n\n(a) Served in restaurants or other establishments in which food is served for immediate human consumption or which is sold for sale or use in such establishments; or\n\n(b) Processed and prepared primarily in a retail establishment, ready for human consumption, of the type described in subparagraph (a) of this definition, and offered for sale to consumers but not for immediate human consumption in such establishment and which is not offered for sale outside such establishment. In other words, restaurant-type food is the subset of food previously exempt from Federal nutrition labeling requirements under sections 403(q)(5)(A)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act that is usually eaten on the premises of the establishment, while walking away, or soon after arriving at another location. (21 CFR 101.11(a))\n\nii.a.5 What are some examples of foods that general would be considered \"restaurant-type food\"?\n\nExamples of food that generally would be considered restaurant-type food include: food for immediate consumption at a sit-down or quick service restaurant; food purchased at a drive-through; take-out and delivery pizza, hot pizza at grocery and convenience stores that is ready to eat, and pizza slices from a movie theater; hot buffet food, hot soup at a soup bar, and food from a salad bar; foods ordered from a menu or menu board at a grocery store intended for individual consumption (e.g., soups, sandwic, and salads); and self-service foods and foods on display that are intended for individual consumption (e.g., sandwic, wraps, and paninis at a deli counter; and cookies from a mall cookie counter; bagels, donuts, and rolls offered for individual sale).\n\nii.a.6 What foods would not be considered \"restaurant-type food\"?\n\nFoods that are grocery-type items that may be ready for immediate consumption but that consumers usually store for use at a later time or customarily further prepare would not be considered \"restaurant-type food.\" Examples of food that generally would not be considered restaurant-type food include: food bought from bulk binds or cases (e.g., dried fruit, nuts) in grocery stores; foods to be eaten over several eating occasions or stored for later use (e.g., loaves of bread, bags or boxes of dinner rolls, whole cakes, and bags or boxes of candy or cookies); foods sold by weight that are not self-serve and are not intended solely for individual consumption (e.g., deli salads sold by unit of weight such as potato salad or chicken salad), either prepacked or packed upon consumer request; and foods that are usually further prepared before consuming (e.g., deli meats and cheeses).\n\nii.a.7 How does the rule define \"location\"?\n\nThe rule defines \"location\" as a fixed position or site.\n\n(21 CFR 101.11(a))\n\nii.a.8 How does the rule define \"doing business under the same name\"?\n\nThe rule defines \"doing business under the same name\" as sharing the same name. The term \"name\" refers to the name of the establishment presented to the public. If there is no name of the establishment presented to the public (e.g., an establishment with the generic descriptor \"concession stand\"), the term \"name\" refers to the name of the parent entity that operates the establishment. When the term \"name\" refers to the name of the establishment presented to the public, the term \"same\" includes names that are slight variations or each other, for example, due to the region, location or size (e.g., \"New York Ave. Burgers\" and \"Pennsylvan Ave. Burgers\" or \"ABC\" and \"ABC Express\").\n\n(21 CFR 101.11(a))\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Nutrition Labeling of Standard Menu Items in Restaurants and Similar Retail Food Establishments \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.374024868011475", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: v.e.2 \"Other Carbohydrate\"\n\nThe voluntary declaration of \"Other Carbohydrate\" is also no longer allowed. Any reference to this declaration has been removed from the updated regulations (81 FR 33742 at 33868).\n\nVI How Do I Comply with the Recordkeeping Requirements?\n\nWhen Are Records Necessary?\n\nFor certain nutrients, there are no AOAC official methods of analysis or other reliable or appropriate analytical procedures available to verify the amount of the declared nutrient on the Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts label. Verification is important because it ensures that the declared nutrient amount is truthful, accurate, and complies with all applicable labeling requirements. In such situations, we require you to make and keep records that are necessary to verify the declaration of these nutrients, as you are in the best position to verify how you arrived at this determination and to know which of your records provide the necessary documentation for us to determine compliance.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nRecords are needed to verify the declaration of the following:\n\nThe amount of added sugars added to the food during processing, when both naturally occurring and added sugars are present in a food (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv));\n\nThe amount of added sugars, if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) when both naturally occurring and added sugars are present in a food (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv));\n\nThe amount of added non-digestible carbohydrate(s) that does not meet the definition of dietary fiber when the dietary fiber present in a food is a mixture of non-digestible carbohydrates that do and that do not meet the definition of dietary fiber (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(i));\n\nThe amount of added soluble non-digestible carbohydrate(s) that does not meet the definition of dietary fiber when the soluble dietary fiber present in a food is mixture of soluble non-digestible carbohydrates that do and that do not meet the definition of dietary fiber (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(ii));\n\nThe amount of added insoluble non-digestible carbohydrate(s) that does not meet the definition of dietary fiber when the insoluble dietary fiber present in a food is a mixture of insoluble non-digestible carbohydrates that do and that do not meet the definition of dietary fiber (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iii));\n\nThe amount of all rac-(\\alpha)-tocopherol added to the food and RRR-(\\alpha)-tocopherol in the finished food when a mixture of both forms of vitamin E are present in a food (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(vi)); and\n\nThe amount of synthetic folate and/or folic acid added to the food and the amount of naturally-occurring folate in the finished food when a mixture of both forms is present in a food (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(vii)).\n\nFor example, if you manufacture products containing fruit and vegetable juice concentrates as an ingredient that have not been reconstituted to 100 percent juice in the finished food, you must provide documentation that shows how you determined how much of the sugars provided by the juice concentrate should be declared as added sugars in the finished product (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)).\n\nSimilar verification is needed regarding the amount of added sugars in specific foods, alone or in combination with naturally occurring sugars, where the added sugars are subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation. In such situations, you must:\n\nmake and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information relied upon to demonstrate the amount of added sugars in the food after non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation, and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food manufactured; or\n\nmake and keep records of the amount of sugars added to the food before and during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient)and in no event will the amount of added sugars declared exceed the amount of total sugars on the label; or\n\nsubmit a citizen petition requesting alternative means of compliance. The petition must provide scientific data or other information for why the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product is likely to have a significant reduction in added sugars compared to the amount added prior to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation. A significant reduction is a reduction in added sugars after non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation that may be significant enough to impact the label declaration for added sugars by an amount that exceeds the reasonable deficiency acceptable within good manufacturing practice under 101.9(g)(6). You must include the reason that you are unable to determine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in a serving of your finished product and a description of the process that you used to come to that conclusion.\n\n(See 21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(v)(A) through (C).)\n\nWhat Counts as a Record?\n\nRecords can include, for example, analyses of databases, recipes or formulations, or batch records (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). They can be kept either as original records, true copies (e.g. photocopies, pictures, scanned copies), or electronic records in accordance with 21 CFR part 11 (21 CFR 101.9(g)(11)). The records requirements provide flexibility in what records you make available to FDA to verify the declared amounts of these nutrients. As our regulations pertaining to disclosure of public information, at part 20, include provisions that protect trade secrets and commercial or financial information which is privileged or confidential, you should mark the information as such before providing the records to FDA (81 FR 33742 at 33962).\n\nHow Long Must Records be Kept?\n\nRecords must be kept for a period of two years after introduction or delivery for introduction of the food into interstate commerce, and they must be provided to FDA upon request during an inspection for official review and copying (or other means of reproduction) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(11)). Records need to be reasonably accessible to FDA during an inspection at each manufacturing facility, even if not stored onsite, to determine compliance with labeling requirements (81 FR 33742 at 33963). These recordkeeping requirements are the same for foreign and domestic firms.\n\nVII How Have the Values of Nutrients Been Updated?\n\nHow Have the Calculations of Caloric Content Changed?\n\nWhile the final rule still allows for the calculation of caloric content using a variety of methods, there has been an update to the prior method of using the general factors of 4, 4, and 9 calories per gram for protein, total carbohydrate less the amount of insoluble dietary fiber, and total fat, respectively. Now, as stated in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(i)(C), calories from carbohydrate are required to be calculated using a general factor of 4 kcal/gram of total carbohydrate less the amount of non-digestible carbohydrates, which includes soluble and insoluble non-digestible carbohydrates that do and do not meet the definition of dietary fiber, and sugar alcohols. A general factor of 2 calories per gram is to be used for soluble non-digestible carbohydrates, but insoluble non-digestible carbohydrates (0 calories per gram) are not included in the caloric calculation. The calorie contribution of soluble non-digestible carbohydrate would be added to that sum to determine the total carbohydrate calorie contribution (81 FR 33742 at 33867). The following general factors are to be used for the caloric value of sugar alcohols:\n\n0 calories per gram (21 CR 101.9(c)(1)(i)(F)).\n\nHow Have the Daily Reference Values (DRVs) Changed?\n\nThe following table (Figure 1) reflects the updated DRVs for each population group that have been established for fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, protein, and added sugars (see also 21 CFR 101.9(c)(9)).\n\nWe did not establish a reference calorie intake for infants through 12 months of age. We also did not establish DRVs for trans fat, polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, insoluble fiber, total sugars, or sugar alcohol for any population group.\n\nFigure 1: Table 1 \u2013 Daily Reference Values Used to Calculate Percent DV\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:16]\n\nWhich Units of Measure Have Changed?\n\nThe units of measure have changed for vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, folate, and niacin. Where previously \"international units,\" or \"IU,\" was used for vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin E, we now require the use of a metric unit of measure (mcg RAE for vitamin A, mcg for vitamin D, and mg (\\alpha)-tocopherol for vitamin E). The declarations of vitamin A and vitamin D will be expressed in mcg on the nutrition and supplement facts labels, and vitamin E will be expressed in mg (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv)). The amount of vitamin D may also be expressed in IU, in addition to the mandatory declaration in mcg. Any declaration of the amount of vitamin D in IU must appear in parentheses after its declaration in mcg (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv)). This is allowed because vitamin D is a nutrient of public health significance, the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine (IOM)) uses IU for vitamin D, and voluntary labeling in IU will assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices (81 FR 33742 at 33912). For vitamin E, the use of this new unit of measure would account for the difference in activity between naturally occurring and synthetic vitamin E (81 FR 33742 at 33913).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.7308149337768555", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide: Chapter III.

If the principal display panel of your product is 5square inches or less, the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent does not apply when the declaration of net quantity of contents meets the other requirements of 21 CFR 101.105(f)\n3. How must I express the net quantity of contents statement on my label? You must express the net quantity of contents statement in either weight, measure, numerical count or a combination of numerical count and weight or measure. When you express this quantity as a weight or measure, you must specify both metric (grams, kilograms, milliliters, or liters) and U.S. Customary System (ounces, pounds, or fluid ounces) terms. Public Law 102-329, August 3, 1992 and 21 CFR 101.105\n4. Why must I calculate the area of the principal display panel? You must calculate the area of the principal display panel (calculated in square inches or square centimeters) to determine the minimum type size that is permitted for the net quantity of contents statement.\n5. How do I calculate the area of the principal display panel? You may calculate the area of the principal display panel for rectangular or square shaped packages by multiplying the height by the width (both in inches or both in centimeters), and for cylindrical shaped packages by multiplying 40% of the circumference by the height. For example, a rectangular package that is 8 inches high and 6 inches wide would have a principal display panel of 48 square inches. A cylindrical package having a circumference of 10 inches and a height of 2 inches would have a principal display panel of 8 square inches.\n6. Am I required to place the net quantity of contents statement conspicuously and prominently on my product labels? Yes. You are required to use a print style that is prominent, conspicuous, and easy to read, with letters not more than three times as high as wide. Use letters that contrast sufficiently with the background.\n7. What is the minimum type size that I can use for the net quantity of contents statements? The smallest type size permitted for the net quantity of contents statement is based on the size of the principal display panel. You may determine the height of the type by measuring the height of upper case letters, when only upper case letters are used, or the height of a lower case letter \"o,\" or its equivalent, when mixed upper and lower case letters are used. The table below sets out the minimum type size in inches (in.), with metric equivalents (millimeters (mm) and centimeters (cm)) in parentheses.\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\nMinimum Type Size & Area of Principal Display Panel \\ \\hline\n1/16 in. (1.6 mm) & 5 sq. in. (32 sq. cm.) or less \\ \\hline\n1/8 in. (3.2 mm) & More than 5 sq. in. (32 sq. cm.) but not more than 25 sq. in. (161 sq. cm.) \\ \\hline\n3/16 in.

(2580 sq. cm.) \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\n21 CFR 101.105(h) and (i)\n\n21.1 What must I include in a weight-based net quantity of contents statement?\n\nYou must include only the quantity of the dietary supplement in a container, and not the weight of the container, wrappers and packing materials, except that in the case of dietary supplements packed in containers designed to deliver the dietary supplement under pressure, the propellant is included in the net quantity declaration.\n\n21.2 Cfr 101.105(g)\n\n21.2 What must I include in a numerical count-based net quantity statement?\n\nYou must include the number of units in a container, e.g. \"too tablets.\"\n\n21.2 Cfr 101.105(a)\n\n21.2 May I use qualifying phrases in the net quantity of contents statement?\n\nNo. You may not use qualifying phrases that qualify a unit or weight, measure, or count (such as \"jump quart\" and \"full gallon\") in the net quantity of contents statement because they tend to exaggerate the amount of the dietary supplement in the container.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter III. Net Quantity of Contents \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.28472900390625", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , Am I required to use the units of measurement specified for use in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: (laboratory value / label value) x 100 = %\n\nIn order to evaluate the accuracy of nutrition label information against a standard for compliance purposes, FDA regulations define two nutrient classes (Class I and Class II) (2i CFR 101.9(g)(3)) and list a third group (Third Group) of nutrients (2i CFR 101.9(g)(5)). Class I nutrients are those added in fortified or fabricated foods. These nutrients are vitamins, minerals, protein, dietary fiber, or potassium. Class I nutrients must be present at 100% or more of the value declared on the label ; in other words, the nutrient content identified by the laboratory analysis must be at least equal to the label value. For example, if vitamin C is added in a fortified product and the label states that vitamin C is present at 10% Daily Value (DV), the laboratory value must equal at least 6 mg of vitamin C/serving (i.e., 10% of the 60 mg Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for vitamin C that is specified in 2i CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv)). The ratio between a laboratory finding of 4.8 mg vitamin C/serving (i.e., 8% DV) and the label value of 10% DV would be calculated as follows:\n\n(8% / 10%) x 100 = 80% or (4.8 mg / 6 mg) x 100 = 80%\n\nand the label value would not be in compliance.\n\nClass II nutrients are vitamins, minerals, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, other carbohydrate, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat, or potassium that occur naturally in a food product. Class II nutrients must be present at 80% or more of the value declared on the label. As an example: If vitamin C is a naturally occurring nutrient in a product, and the product declares 10% DV vitamin C (i.e., 6 mg/serving) on its label, then laboratory analysis must find at least 80% of the label value (80% of 6 mg or 4.8 mg vitamin C/serving) for the product to be in compliance.\n\nThe Third Group nutrients include calories, sugars, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. However, for products (e.g., fruit drinks, juices, and confectioneries) with a sugars content of 90 percent or more of total carbohydrate, to prevent labeling anomalies due in part to rounding, FDA treats total carbohydrate as a Third Group nutrient instead of a Class II nutrient. For foods with label declarations of Third Group nutrients, the ratio between the amount obtained by laboratory analysis and the amount declared on the product label in the Nutrition Facts panel must be 120% or less, i.e., the label is considered to be out of compliance if the nutrient content of a composite of the product is greater than 20% above the value declared on the label. For example, if a laboratory analysis found 8 g of total fat/serving in a product that started that it contained 6 g of total fat/serving, the ratio between the laboratory value and the label value would be (8 / 6) x 100 = 133%, and the product label would be considered to be out of compliance.\n\nReasonable excesses of class I and II nutrients above labeled amounts and reasonable deficiencies of the Third Group nutrients are usually considered acceptable by the agency within good manufacturing practices.\n\nWhy Submit a Data Base to FDA?\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(8), compliance with the provisions set forth in 2i CFR 101.9(g)(1) through (g)(6) may be provided by use of an FDA approved data base that has been developed following FDA guideline procedures and where food samples have been handled in accordance with current good manufacturing practice to prevent nutrient loss. An approval is granted when FDA has agreed to all aspects of the data base in writing or when a clear need is presented (e.g., raw produce and seafood). Approvals are granted for a limited time and will be eligible for renewal in the absence of significant changes in agricultural or industry practices. Guidance in the use of data bases may be found in this document, the FDA Nutrition Labeling Manual--a Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases.\n\nFDA published its policy concerning the review of data bases for use in the voluntary and mandatory nutrition labeling of foods in a final rule entitled \"Guidelines for the Voluntary Nutrition Labeling of Raw Fruits, Vegetables, and Fish\" in the Federal Register of August 16, 1996 (6i FR 42742). This policy is the most recent such statement of the policy made by the agency and will be referred to throughout the manual.\n\nFDA states that upon submission of a data base, \"firms are free...to begin use of the nutrient label values and to initiate the planned studies to collect and update nutrient values. During this interim period, FDA does not anticipate that it will take action against a product bearing label values included in a data base submitted to the agency for review. If any product is identified through FDA compliance activities as including label values that are out of compliance, contingent on the company's willingness to come into compliance, the agency intends to work with both the manufacturer and the data base developer to understand and correct the problem label values\" (6i FR 42742).\n\n23.8.25.2.317.31\n\nChapter II: How to Develop a Nutrition Labeling Data Base\n\nFDA recommends five general steps that industry may choose to follow in the development of a nutrition labeling data base:\n\ncharacterizing the product(s);\n\ndesigning a sampling plan;\n\ncollecting the sample units;\n\nanalyzing the laboratory test samples; and\n\nstatistically analyzing the data and interpreting the results.\n\nThis chapter will address each of the five steps. Each of the steps can be performed in several different ways, and decisions made regarding the alternatives may directly impact the available resources, data quality (error in a data set), and the statistically defined risk of making a correct decision. Please note that this manual is not intended to be a statistics book or a comprehensive sampling text. Data base developers may need to consult the scientific literature, and in some cases, a statistician or research analyst to obtain additional detailed information that is relevant to the data base(s) of interest, but that is not contained in this manual.\n\nThis chapter, with the examples and definitions that are given, should serve as a general guide for individuals needing a basic reference concerning some of the administrative and statistical considerations that are associated with the development of a data base.\n\n1 Characterizing the Product(s)\n\nIn characterizing the product, one should first determine the innate nutrient makeup of the product and obtain preliminary estimates of nutrient levels, nutrient variation, and the factors that could impact nutrient levels and variation. The first step in describing a product or products is to perform a literature search to determine if there are (1) existing nutrient data; (2) estimates that describe the market (production and sales); and, if appropriate, (3) information that describes the varieties (or species, if applicable); (4) the regions where the food is grown or raised; and (5) factors already studied and known to impact or not to impact nutrient levels. If the scientific literature and other sources reveal that a nutrient is known to be absent from the food or is present in negligible amounts (e.g., sugars and dietary fiber in seafood, cholesterol and saturated fat in produce), then the agency will not require testing for that nutrient, as long as the data base developer includes supporting documentation (58 FR 2079 at 2019, January 6, 1993).\n\nIf no information is available that adequately describes the food and its nutrients, the data base developer may choose to perform a pilot study to determine if certain factors do impact nutrient levels, to determine if there are regional differences in the nutrient levels, or to test for nutrient losses over time. In addition, the developer may choose to include other relevant factors of interest in a proposal to collect nutrient data for a data base study. For fruits and vegetables, variability may arise from seasonal and geographic influences associated with such factors as variety, location (e.g., soil type, climatic conditions); growing conditions (e.g., planting time, irrigation and fertilization practices, harvest maturity); product transport (e.g, packing, shipping, storage); and processing practices. For seafoods, the variability in nutrient levels may arise from such factors as species, dietary habits, processing practices, etc. For \"mixed products\", in addition to the factors that influence the variation in the nutrient levels in the product ingredients, processing factors associated with the formulation of the product ingredients into the \"mixed product\" may also influence the variation in the nutrient levels of the finished product. In some instances, if there is a great difference in nutrient values attributable to a particular factor (e.g., different nutrient values for different food types), a data base developer may determine that the foods are different and may even consider different nutrition labels for different food types.\n\nWhen a data base developer submits a proposal to FDA, it is important to include the results of any pilot or experimental study that was completed. One data base developer, for example, completed a number of experimental studies that determined differences in nutrient levels between/among several independent variables (e.g., variety of food (2 levels), site of sampling (production vs. retail), packing medium (brine vs. water), geographical region (5 levels), and age of product (5 levels)). FDA requests that the results of any experimental study that is submitted to the agency be included in statistical tables to better describe the type(s) of statistical test used, the sample size, and the exact probability levels that were used in drawing conclusions based on these results.\n\nIn determining the sampling plan (next section), existing nutrient data are extremely helpful in determining the number of samples to test.\n\n2 Designing a Sampling Plan\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases for Nutrition Labeling \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.6516337394714355"], "From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Questions and Answers\n\nTHE GLP REGULATIONS - GENERAL\n\nDo the GLPs require the establishment of Technical Operation Manuals?\n\nNo.\n\nIf a laboratory is accredited by AAALAC (American Association for Accreditation of\n\nLaboratory Animal Care), does this serve as assurance of meeting the GLP\n\nrequirements for animal care and facilities?\n\nAAALAC accreditation does not substitute for Agency inspection nor does it guarantee\n\nautomatic compliance with the applicable GLP sections. It is of value, however, in that\n\nit demonstrates that the facility has favorably passed a peer group review.\n\nResults of the quality assurance unit inspections are not routinely available to an\n\nAgency investigator. However, the conforming amendments require that GLP\n\ndeviations are to be reported in detail with each submission to the FDA. Are we\n\nrequired to send the contents of the quality assurance unit inspection report to the\n\nFDA?\n\nNo. The GLP compliance statement in the conforming amendments to the GLPs was\n\nincluded for several reasons:\n\n(a) to provide an orderly transition across the effective date of the regulations. It was\n\nunderstood that applications for research and marketing permits submitted to the\n\nAgency for some period of time after the GLP effective date of June 20, 1979, would\n\ncontain final reports of nonclinical studies begun and completed prior to the effective date, begun prior to the effective date and completed thereafter, and begun and completed after the effective date. Studies begun and completed prior to the effective date are not required to comply with the GLPs and accordingly, the conforming amendments require that differences be noted. Similar considerations apply to studies begun prior to and completed after the effective date, although in these studies, those portions underway as of the effective date are required to comply.\n\n(b) to provide for the submission of final reports of studies, which were not required to comply with the GLPs but which otherwise, contribute to safety evaluation. The GLPs do not apply to safety studies conducted by independent investigators studying regulated products. Such studies are not sponsored by the product manufacturer, nor is there any intention to submit the results to the Agency. The study results are published in the open literature. The sponsor is required red to submit the study to the Agency but could in no way control the research. If the sponsor wishes to use the data in support of the application, the conforming amendments provide a mechanism by which the sponsor can prove that the study was not compromised. A similar situation exists for preliminary exploratory safety studies done by the sponsor.\n\n(c) to foster GLP compliance attitudes by management. The conforming amendment causes management to act responsively to all cases of GLP non-compliance and to take prompt corrective actions.\n\nWith these purposes in mind, the conforming amendments require a brief statement of overall GLP compliance and need not contain the Quality Assurance Unit findings. The Quality Assurance Unit findings should cover short-term GLP deviations, which are promptly corrected. The conforming amendments statement should cover those systematic GLP deviations which have occurred throughout the study.\n\nWho provides the GLP compliance statement required by the conforming amendments?\n\nThis statement is provided by the applicant for the research or marketing permit.\n\nWhat is the degree of compliance with GLPs, which the FDA will require for INDs submitted after June 20, 1979, but which include toxicology studies initiated before June 20, 1979, and completed after June 20, 1979?\n\nThose portions of the studies underway as of the effective date will have to be done in accord with the applicable provisions of the GLPs.\n\nDo nonclinical laboratory studies completed *prior to June 20, 1979 but submitted as part of an IND or NDA subsequent to that date fall under the conforming amendments?\n\nThese studies would not have to have been conducted under the GLPs but the conforming amendment statement of compliance is required.\n\nHow many members of the National Association of Life Science Industries (NALSI) come under the GLPs? How can the membership list be obtained?The Agency has not compiled such a list. A membership list is available from NALSI, 1747 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 2oOo6. All members who conduct nonclinical laboratory studies are subject to the GLPs.\n\nShould a contract laboratory ask a sponsor if the article they are testing is subject to FDA regulations? Should these studies then be listed as a separate master list of studies to comply with the GLP regulations? Contract laboratories should ask sponsors to identify studies which are associated with FDA regulated products, although the GLPs place this responsibility on the sponsor. A separate listing of such studies, apart from the firm's master list of all studies undertaken by the firm will satisfy the requirements of the GLPs.\n\nWhat impact have the GLP regulations had on the cost of performing toxicology studies? The president of a large contracting laboratory has stated that three years ago a chronic rat study could be done for about $8o,0oo; and that the current cost is closer $250,000. He estimated that half of the increased cost is due to GLPs, 30% to larger numbers of test animals per study on present day protocols and 20% to inflation. The Agency has not developed cost estimates.\n\n58.1 Scope\n\n58.3 Definitionsapplicability to Studies Performed Under Grants and Contracts\n\n58.15 Inspection of a Testing Facility\n\nAre short-term microbiological screening tests and microbiological preservative stability research and development covered by the GLPs? Microbiological preservative stability research, development and quality control tests are not covered by the GLPs. However, microbiological tests conducted to establish the toxicological profile of an article are covered.\n\nDoes the Agency intend to audit analytical data collected on a test article? Yes, insofar as it contributes to the evaluation of a nonclinical laboratory study.\n\nDoes the Agency intend to audit draft final protocols and draft final reports? The regulations do not require that such materials be retained, however, if draft reports are available, they may be audited in order to help the Agency follow the process from raw data to final report.\n\nExplain why the GLPs apply to \"microorganisms or subparts thereof.\" How are microorganisms currently used by FDA in assessment of safety? For certain products, FDA does request that microbial tests be done for the purpose of obtaining information on potential neoplastic and mutagenic activity. Likewise, microsomal preparations (subparts thereof) are used as activating systems for certain in vitro tests. When this happens, the tests should be done in accord with the GLPs.\n\nDo the GLPs apply to engineering/electronic testing laboratories that perform functionality tests on medical devices? No.\n\nIs a licensed manufacturer of human biological products subject to continuing GLP inspection? The GLPs apply to safety studies submitted to the Agency in order to obtain the license. They do not apply to such studies conducted for the purpose of obtaining batch release of licensed biologicals.\n\nWill nonclinical studies in support of medical devices which do not come in contact with man (e.g., stopcocks, a gas machine, a urine bag) be subject to the GLP regulations? If the medical device application for a research or marketing permit does not require the submission of safety data for approval, then the GLPs do not apply.\n\nIf a test article is produced by microbial fermentation, are tests run on the bacteria, such as pathogenicity or virulence covered by the GLPs? No.\n\nAre studies performed for label purposes as required by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act considered to be nonclinical laboratory studies under the GLPs? No.\n\nWhen an application for Premarket Approval for a Class III Device is scrutinized, would a GLP audit by FDA become a criterion for premarket approval? Safety data are required for Class III Devices and such data are to be collected under the GLPs, but an FDA audit will not automatically become part of the premarket approval mechanisms.\n\nAre Class I, II and III Devices regulated products within the meaning of the GLPs? Yes.\n\nAre data contained in a 510(k) notification subject to the GLPs? No.\n\nHow do the GLPs apply to the testing of electromechanical medical devices (non-animal work)?It is presumed that the question refers to engineering tests and in vitro tests of such devices conducted to assess functionality. In these cases, the GLPs do not apply.\n\nPlease elaborate on the preamble statement (43 FR 59989) that studies involving \"diagnostic products\" and \"medical devices, which do not come in contact with or are implanted in man\" are not within the scope of the GLPs. Failure of diagnostic products or medical devices, which do not come in contact with man or are not implanted does pose a safety hazard. This is also true for implantable devices. Tests to establish the reliability of these articles are functionality tests, not safety tests. The GLPs cover implantable devices, which may cause adverse tissue reactions or may have components, which leach into the tissues and cause a toxic response.\n\nIs an in vitro study to quantitate the amounts of residual proteolytic enzyme on a soft contact lens (the enzyme is used to clean the lens) a safety study which is covered by the GLPs? No, the enzyme is part of the lens manufacturing process and its analysis would be covered by the GMPs and not the GLPs. If, however, the proteolytic enzyme is sold as a means of cleaning lenses after purchase by a person, the enzyme is an accessory to a medical device and the safety studies supporting the use of the enzyme would be subject to the GLPs.\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.7553023099899292", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: No, heroic measures need not be taken. Storage conditions should be consistent with the knowledge of the stability of the mixture under conditions of use and reasonable so as not to permit accelerated decomposition.\n\nWhat are the details of the Agency's reserve sample retention policy?\n\nWith regard to reserve sample retention, the GLPs provide as follows:\n\nReserve samples are to be retained from each batch of test and control article prepared in accord with section 58.105(a) for all nonclinical laboratory studies lasting more than 4 weeks. For the purposes of these sections, the 4-week period includes initial dosing to the final in vivo observations. Only sufficient sample need be retained to permit meaningful reanalysis. The samples need be retained either for the terms specified in section 58.105 or for the useful life of the sample (dependent on the stability or the quality of the sample) whichever is shorter. Storage conditions should be those commonly accepted as minimizing the deterioration of sample quality and need not require exhaustive study to determine those which maximize stability. All batches of test and control article mixtures are to be retained even if they are prepared daily.\n\nFor medical devices, how can stability be demonstrated any more effectively than by the continued functioning of a device within specifications during an in vivo nonclinical study?\n\nThe stated procedure is acceptable.\n\nThe cost of chemical assay development and assay of dosage forms prior to conducting acute studies far exceeds the cost of doing the experiment. Will data confirming the weighing, mixing and administration of the test article be considered sufficient?\n\nNo. The test article must be sufficiently characterized to ensure that the same article is used in any further studies.\n\nDoes FDA expect a firm to conduct long-term stability tests on test article-carrier mixtures, which are used within a day of preparation?\n\nThe firm must determine the stability of the mixtures over the period of their use. The GLPs require retention of samples of all batches of test article-carrier mixtures for studies that last longer than 4 weeks. The regulations do not require stability studies on such samples. Samples placed in storage may be analyzed periodically to determine their useful storage life.\n\nAm I correct in assuming that the chemical testing done by the sponsor to characterize the test article is not covered by the GLPs when the test article is subsequently submitted to a contract laboratory as a blind sample for safety testing?\n\nThe GLPs do not cover the basic exploratory chemical tests done to derive the specifications of the test article. They do cover those chemical tests done on discrete batches of test article to determine identity, strength, purity and composition.\n\nDoes the phrase \"mixtures of articles and carriers\" also refer to solutions and suspensions, e.g., a solution of a test article in distilled water?\n\nYes.\n\nFor acute studies, is it necessary for the laboratory to analyze each batch of test article-carrier mixture prior to dosing the test system?\n\nNo. Uniformity of the mixture must be known and periodic batch analyses need to be done.\n\nWill dialogues such as this and recent inspectional experience bring about substantive changes in the final regulations through FDA initiated proposed amendments? Whatchanges are anticipated in the reserve sample retention requirements?\n\nThe Agency does not believe the initiative to change the GLPs rests with FDA. Petitions for change may be submitted to the Agency in accord with the 21 CFR 10.30. As was mentioned at the meeting, the Agency recognizes that the reserve sample retention requirements are extensive and expensive and a petition for change would be considered.\n10. What guidelines can be used by a laboratory or sponsor in deciding how frequently concentration analyses should be made?\n\nThe Agency has not established guidelines with regard to the frequency of periodic reanalysis of test article-carrier mixtures. Enough batches should be analyzed to assure that the test systems are being exposed to the quantities of test article in the specified protocol.\n11. How long must one retain samples of feed used in nonclinical laboratory studies and should they be frozen?\n\nThe sample retention period differs for the various regulated products and the periods are listed in section 58.195. Feed samples need not be frozen for storage.\n12. What is the definition of carrier?\n\nCarrier is the material with which the test article is mixed for administration to the test system. It can be feed, water, solvents and excipients depending on dosage form and route of administration.\n13. Once stability of a given concentration of a test article-carrier mixture is substantiated, is it necessary to establish a stability profile for each batch at that concentration?\n\nNo. Stability need be determined only on a single batch of test article-carrier mixture; however, periodic reanalysis to determine concentration must be done.\n14. In the course of a 14-C tissue residue study in the target animal, is it necessary to retain:\n\nAll samples listed in a - d and f above should be retained for the term listed in section 58.195.\n\na. sample of the 14-C labeled drug,\n\nb. samples of the diet fed control and experimental animals,\n\nc. samples of urine and feces after completion of the analyses,d. samples of collected tissues after completion of the analyses, e. if they must be retained, for how long? f. is similar sample retention necessary when doing \"cold\" tissue residue studies in target animals?\n15. If a battery of different tests on a substance is being conducted by different contractors, is it necessary to run replicate stability analyses from each and every contractor especially when long-term stability has been documented for the substance?\n\nNo. Once stability has been determined in accord with good science, it is not necessary to continually replicate the stability determination.\n\n58.120 Protocol\n\n58.130 Conduct of a Nonclinical Laboratory Study\n\nIn as much as only wet tissues, blocks and slides are necessary to reconstruct the histopathologic aspects of a study by a third party, are written notes, tapes, etc. of the histopathological's thought process in arriving at a final report legitimately considered \"raw data\" in the presence of a signed and dated final report? Does the Agency have the right to inspect the written notes from the pathologist?\n\nRaw data in this case, refers only to the signed and dated final report of the pathologist. Agency investigators may wish to examine the interim notes and reports in an attempt to reconstruct the study but not to second-guess the scientific process used to arrive at the final report. The GLPs do not require that these interim reports and notes be retained.\n2. What is considered to be raw data in computer systems when the data is generated from dictated results?\n\nTranscribed dictation, which has been proofread and corrected for typographical -and transcription errors, is raw data.\n3. Do the GLPs require that the protocol be amended to reflect the actual starting date of the study?\n\nYes, this is a critical piece of information, which should be supplied by way of a formal protocol amendment.\n\nIt is said that raw data may be any verified exact copy of the original data. In a computerized data system where data is put directly on disc thence to tape, what documentation of the program performing this transfer is required to assure that the tape copy is exact? The standard operating procedures, which cover computer operations, should describe the computer program and the procedure used to assure the production of an exact tape copy.\n\nIf reformatting of data is done as part of the transfer described in question 4 above, is the new file not raw data even if all data is transferred intact although in a different organization? The Agency can not precisely answer this question without further details of the new data format.\n\nAre initials and dates on data printouts (e.g., scintillation counters, gas chromatographs), when these printouts include standards, sufficient documentation for standardization? Yes.\n\nIs there a time limit for submission of the final report of a nonclinical laboratory study after its conclusion? Generally no. On occasion, for marketed products, the Agency may establish time frames for study conduct. Of course alarming findings on marketed products should be reported as soon as possible.\n\nIs it permissible to list changes in a final report on a page, which is appended, to the original final report? Yes.\n\nDoes \"studies in progress on June 20, 1979\" refer to the phase of dosing of the test system or the phase post-dosing but not yet reported? The quotation pertains to all studies for which the final report has not yet been completed. Included are all post-dosing phases.\n\nThe final report requires a list of participants. Should this include technicians as well as people who perform support functions?The final report should include the name of the study director, the names of other scientists or professionals, and the names of all supervisory personnel involved in the study.\n\nWhen an analysis protocol is developed for the first time by using standard scientific technique, who shall validate the protocol?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.9054558277130127", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Certain contracts specify that a series of nonclinical laboratory studies be done on a single test article. Do the GLPs permit the designation of different study directors for each study under the contract?\n\nYes.\n\nDo the GLPs require that a sponsor approve the study director for a contracted study?\n\nNo. Testing facility management designates the study director.\n\nA firm functions as a primary contractor for nonclinical laboratory studies. The actual studies are then subcontracted to nonclinical laboratories. Is the firm considered to be a \"sponsor?\"\n\nThe GLPs define \"sponsor\" as a person who initiates and supports a nonclinical laboratory study. Sponsorship in the cited example would be determined by the specific provisions of the contract.\n\nWho is responsible for test article characterization - the sponsor or the contractor?\n\nThe GLPs do not assign the responsibility in this area. The matter is a subject of the specific contractual arrangement between the sponsor and the contractor.\n\nDo contract laboratories have to show the sponsor's name on the Master Schedule Sheet or can this information be coded?\n\nThe information can be coded but the code must be revealed to the FDA investigator on request.\n\nA sponsor desires to contract for a nonclinical laboratory study to be conducted in a foreign laboratory. Must the sponsor notify the foreign laboratory that compliance with the U.S. GLPs is required?\n\nYes.\n\nMust a contractor include in the final report information on test article characterization and stability when such information has been collected by the sponsor?\n\nNo. The contractor should identify in its final report which information will be subsequently supplied by the sponsor.\n\nMust a sponsor reveal toxicology data already collected on a test article to a contract laboratory?\n\nNo. If use of the test article involves a potential danger to laboratory personnel, the contract laboratory should be advised so that appropriate precautions can be taken.\n\nSection 58.15 Inspection of a testing facility.\n\nWhat is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n\nThe FD-483 is the written notice of objectionable\n\npractices or deviations from the regulations that is prepared by the FDA investigator at the end of the inspection. The items listed on the form serve as the basis for the exit discussion with laboratory management at which time management can either agree or disagree with the items and can offer possible corrective actions to be taken.\n\nManagement may also respond to the district office in writing after it has had sufficient time to properly study the FD-483.\n\nWill a laboratory subsequently be notified of GLP deviations not listed on the FD-483?\n\nThis does happen. The FDA investigator prepares an establishment\n\ninspection report (EIR) which summarizes the observations made at the\n\nlaboratory and which contains exhibits concerning the studies audited\n\n(Protocols, SOPs, CV's, etc.). The EIR is then reviewed by District\n\npersonnel as well as headquarters personnel. This review may reveal\n\nadditional GLP deviations that should be and are communicated to\n\nlaboratory management.\n\nWhat kinds of domestic toxicology laboratory inspections does FDA\n\nperform and how frequently are they done?\n\nFDA performs four kinds of inspections related to the GLPs and\n\nnonclinical laboratory studies. These include: A GLP inspection -\n\nan inspection undertaken as a periodic, routine determination of a\n\nlaboratory's compliance with the GLPs, it includes examination of an\n\nongoing study as well as a completed study; A data audit - an\n\ninspection made to verify that the information contained in a final\n\nreport submitted to FDA is accurate and reflected by the raw data; A\n\ndirected inspection - any of a series of inspections conducted for\n\nvarious compelling reasons (questionable data in a final report, tips\n\nfrom informers, etc.); A followup inspection - an inspection made\n\nsometime after a GLP inspection which revealed objectionable\n\npractices and conditions. The purpose of the followup inspection is\n\nto assure that proper corrective actions have been taken. GLP\n\ninspections are scheduled once every two years whereas the other\n\nkinds of inspections are scheduled as needed.\n\nShould GLP investigators comment on the scientific merits of a protocol or the scientific interpretation given in the final report? No. Their function is strictly a noting of observations and verification. Scientific judgments are made by the respective headquarters review units that deal with the test article.\n\nCan a GLP EIR be reviewed by laboratory, management prior to issuance? No. The GLP EIR is an internal agency document which reflects the observations and findings of the FDA investigator. It can not be released to anyone outside the agency until agency action has been completed and the released copy is purged of all trade secret information. Laboratories that disagree with portions of the EIR should write a letter which contains the areas of disagreement to the local FDA District Office. The laboratories can ask that their letters accompany the EIR whenever it is requested under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nCan FDA investigators take photographs of objectionable practices and conditions? It is the agency position that photographs can be taken as a part of the inspection and this position has been sustained by a District Court decision.\n\nThe GLP Compliance Program requires the FDA investigator to select an ongoing study in order to inspect current laboratory operations. What criteria are used to select the study? The studies are selected in accord with agency priorities, i.e. the longest term study on the most significant product.\n\nDoes FDA inspect international nonclinical laboratories once every two years? No. Overseas laboratories are scheduled for inspection on the basis of having submitted to FDA the results of significant studies on important products.\n\nWhat background materials are used by agency investigators to prepare for a GLP inspection? Prior to an inspection, the following materials are usually reviewed:(a) The GLP regulations; (b) The Management Briefings Post-Conference Report; (c) Assorted memoranda and policy issuances; (d) The GLP Compliance Program; (e) The protocol of an ongoing study, if available; (f) The final report of a completed study, if available; (g) The inspection report of the most recent inspection.\n\nHow long does FDA allow a laboratory to effect corrective actions after an inspection has been made? If the results of an inspection reveal that significant deviations from the GLPs exist, the laboratory will be sent a regulatory letter that lists the major deviations and that requests a response within 10 days. The response should describe those actions that the laboratory has taken or plans to take to effect correction. The response should also encompass items that were listed on the FD-483 and those that were discussed during the exit discussion with laboratory management. A specific time table should be given for accomplishing the planned actions. The reasonableness of the time table will be determined by FDA compliance staff, based on the needs of the particular situation. For less significant deviations, the laboratory will be sent a Notice of Adverse Findings letter that also lists the deviations but that requests a response within 30 days. Again, the reasonableness of the response will be determined by FDA staff.\n\nDoes a laboratory's responsibility for corrective action listed on a FD-483 begin at the conclusion of an inspection or upon receipt of correspondence from the originating bureau in which corrective action is requested? The FD-483 lists observations of violative conditions that have the capability to adversely affect nonclinical laboratory studies. Corrective actions should be instituted as soon as possible.\n\nDoes FDA preannounce all GLP inspections? Laboratory management is informed of all routine GLP inspections prior to the inspection, but special compliance or investigative inspections need not be preannounced.\n\nSUSPART B ORGANIZATION AND PERSONNEL\n\nSection 58.29 Personnel.\n\nFor what sequence in the supervisory chain should position descriptions be available?\n\nPosition descriptions should be available for each individual engaged in or supervising the conduct of the study.\n\nShould current summaries of training and experience list attendance at scientific and technical meetings?\n\nYes. The agency considers such attendance as a valuable adjunct to the other kinds of training received by laboratory personnel.\n\nIf certain specialists (pathologists, statisticians, ophthalmologists, etc.) are contracted to conduct certain aspects of a study, need they be identified in the final report?\n\nYes.\n\nDoes the QAU have to be composed of technical personnel?\n\nNo. Management is, however, responsible for assuring that \"personnel clearly understand the functions they are to perform\" (Section 58.31(f)) and that each individual engaged in the study has the appropriate combination of education, training and experience (Section 58.29(a)).\n\nSection 58.31 Testing Facility Management.\n\nCan the study director be the chief executive of a nonclinical laboratory?\n\nNo. The GLPs require that there be a separation of function between the study director and the QAU director. In the example, the QAU director would be reporting to the study director.\n\nSection 58.33 Study director.\n\nThe GLPs permit the designation of an \"acting\" or \"deputy\" study director to be responsible for a study when the study director is on leave. Should study records identify the designated \"deputy\" or \"acting\" study director?\n\nYes.\n\nIs the study director responsible for adherence to the GLPs? Yes.\n\nSection 58.35 Quality Assurance Unit.\n\nAs a QAU person, I have no expertise in the field of pathology. How do I audit pathology findings?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.9539278745651245", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Can the study director authorize changes in the SOPs? No. Approval of the SOPs and changes thereto is a function of laboratory management.\n\nHow many copies of the complete laboratory SOPs are needed? Each work station should have access to the SOPs applicable to the work performed at the station. A complete set of the SOPs, including authorized amendments, should be maintained in the archives.\n\nWho approves the SOPs of the Quality Assurance Unit? Laboratory Management.\n\nTo what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs? The GLPs do not specify the contents of individual SOPs, but the SOP that deals with computerized data acquisition should include the purpose of the program, the specifications, the procedures, the end products, the language, the interactions with other programs, procedures for assuring authorized data entry and access, procedures for making and authorizing changes to the program, the source listing of the program and perhaps even a flow chart. The laboratory's computer specialists should determine what other characteristics need to be described in the SOP.\n\nSection 58.83 Reagents and solutions.\n1. What are the GLP requirements for labeling of reagents purchased directly from manufacturers? All reagents used in a nonclinical laboratory have to be labeled to indicate identity, titer or concentration, storage requirements, and expiration date. Purchased reagents usually carry all these items except for the expiration date, so the laboratory should label the reagent containers with an expiration date. The expiration date selected should be in line with laboratory experience and need not require specific stability testing.\n2. How extensive should the procedures be for confirming the quality of incoming reagents used in nonclinical laboratory studies? Laboratory management should make this decision but the SOPs should document the actual procedures used.\n\nDo the procedures used for preparing the S9 activator fraction (liver microsomal fraction from rats challenged with a toxin) have to be performed in accord with the GLPs? No. The GLPs consider the S9 activator fraction to be a reagent. Therefore, it must be labeled properly, stored properly, tested prior to use in accord with adequate SOPs, and it can not be used if its potency is below established specifications.\n\nDo the GLPs require the use of product accountability procedures for reagents and chemicals used in a nonclinical laboratory study? No. Section 58.90 Animal care.\n\nCan diseased animals received from a supplier be diagnosed, treated, certified \"well\" and then entered into a nonclinical laboratory study? The GLPs provide for this procedure by including provisions directed towards animal quarantine and isolation. The question of whether such animals can be entered into a study, however, is a scientific one that should be answered by the veterinarian-in-charge and the study director and other scientists involved in the study.\n\nDo the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies? No. Again, the question is a scientific one and the potential impact of multiple use on study interpretation should be carefully assessed.\n\nIs a photocopy of an animal purchase order which has been signed and dated by the individual receiving the shipment sufficient proof of animal receipt? Yes, but actual shipping tickets are also acceptable.\n\nDoes FDA have guidelines for animal bedding? No, but the GLPs prohibit the use of bedding which can interfere with the objectives of the study.\n\nDoes FDA permit the sterilization of animal feed with ethylene oxide. No.\n\nFor certain test systems (timed-pregnant rodents), it is not possible to use long quarantine periods. Do the GLPs specify quarantine periods for each test system? No. The quarantine period can be established by the veterinarian in charge of animal care and should be of sufficient length to permit evaluation of health status.\n\nHow are feed and water contaminants to be dealt with? The protocol should include a positive statement as to the need for conducting feed analysis for contaminants. If analysis is necessary, the identities and specifications for the contaminants should be listed. The need for analysis as well as the specifications should be determined by the study scientists. Water contaminants can be handled similarly.\n\nHow is the adequacy of bedding materials to be handled? This can be handled as are the analyses for possible contaminants in feed and water. The study director and associated scientists should consider the bedding and its possible impact on the study. The results of this consideration should appear in the protocol.\n\nWhat do the GLPs require in regard to assuring the genetic quality of animals used in a nonclinical laboratory study? This is a scientific issue that is not specifically addressed by the GLPs. Suitability of the test system for use in a study is a protocol matter and any required testing procedure should be arrived at by the study scientists.\n\nDo the GLPs require specific procedures for the microbiological monitoring of animals used in nonclinical laboratory studies? The procedures used should be in accord with acceptable veterinary medical practice.\n\nThe Japanese are preparing animal care guidelines which are similar but not identical to the U.S. guidelines prepared by NIH. Would these be acceptable? Japanese guidelines that are similar, but no less stringent, in the important particulars with the NIH guidelines would be acceptable to FDA.\n\nJapanese guidelines that are similar, but no less stringent, in the important particulars with the NIH guidelines would be acceptable to FDA.\n12. What is the frequency of feed contaminant analysis? If contaminant analyses are required by the protocol, then the GLPs require periodic analysis of the feed to ensure that the contaminant level is at or below that judged to be acceptable. Statistical procedures should be used to determine the frequency of analysis since this is dependent on the specific chemical characteristics of the interfering contaminant.\n13. It is necessary to use \"official\" methods of analysis to determine the levels of interfering contaminants? No. The methods should be appropriate for the analysis and FDA reserves the right to examine the raw data supporting the analytical results.\n14. Do the GLPs require production facilities to be dedicated to the manufacture of specific animal feeds used in nonclinical laboratory studies? No.\n15. Is a separate room required for animal necropsy? No. The GLPs require separate areas and/or rooms as necessary to prevent any activity from having an adverse effect on the study. If the necropsy is done in an animal room, precautions should be taken to minimize disturbances that may interfere with the study.\n\nSUBPART F TEST AND CONTROL ARTICLES\n\nSection 58.105 Test and control article characterization.\n\nIs it necessary to retain samples of feed from nonclinical laboratory studies in which the feed serves as the control article? Yes. It is not necessary, however, to retain reserve samples of feed from studies that involve test article administration by routes other than feed.\n\nWhat expiration date is placed on the label of test articles whose stability is being assessed concurrently with the conduct of the study?\n\nIn this situation, the stability of the test article is unknown, but periodic analysis data exist. The label should contain a statement such as \"see protocol\" or \"see periodic analysis results\" so that test article users will know that current analytical data should be examined prior to continued use of the test article.\n3. If analysis of the reserve samples is required by the Study Director or the QAU, is it permitted?\n\nYes, but sufficient reserve sample should be retained so that the sample is not exhausted.\n4. Are physical and chemical tests conducted on test articles required to be done under the GLPs?\n\nAccording to section 58.105, such tests conducted to characterize the specific batch of test article used in the nonclinical laboratory study are covered.\n\nSection 58.107 Test and control article handling.\n\nWith regard to safety studies in large animals (cattle, horses, etc.), must test article accountability be maintained and can the animals be used for food purposes?\n\nTest article accountability must be maintained. For guidance on whether the treated animals can be used for food, you should contact the appropriate individuals in the Bureau of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nSection 58.113 Mixtures of articles with carriers.\n\nDo the GLPs require tests for homogeneity, concentration, and stability on mixtures of control articles used as positive controls?\n\nYes.\n2. Do test or control article concentration assays have to be performed on each batch of test or control article carrier mixture?\n\nNo. The GLPs require only periodic analysis of test or control article carrier mixtures.\n\nWhat is the purpose of periodic analysis requirement for test or control article mixtures? This requirement provides additional assurance that the test system is being exposed to protocol-specified quantities of test article. Whereas, in most instances proper assurance is obtained through adequate uniformity-of-mixing studies, adequate SOPs, and trained personnel, occasionally the mixing equipment can malfunction or other uncontrollable events can occur which lead to improper dosages. These events can be recognized through periodic analysis.\n\nFor acute studies, does the test article carrier mixture have to be analyzed (single dose studies)? Yes, but the analysis need not be done prior to the study provided the mixture is stable in storage.\n\nFor liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.8588931560516357", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: 58.185 Reporting of Nonclinical Laboratory Study Results\n\n58.190 Storage and Retrieval of Records and Data\n\n58.195 Retention of Records\n\nWhat types of storage conditions are required for the storage of retained specimens?\n\nThe Agency has not developed guidelines for storage conditions. The Agency does not expect heroic measures to be used, but conditions should be reasonable in light of the nature of the specimen. Storage conditions, which foster accelerated deterioration, should be avoided.\n\nIn section 58.185, it is stated that test and control article identification and characterization must appear in the final report signed by the study director. However, if the study director is affiliated with a contract laboratory, he/she has no need to know such details of a proprietary test article. Do you agree that such information can be appended to the final report by the sponsor rather than be provided by the study director?\n\nYes.\n\nIs the storage of archival material (tissues, slides, raw data) the responsibility of the testing laboratory or can this responsibility be assigned to the sponsor of the study?\n\nThe GLPs permit these materials to be stored in the archives of either the testing laboratory or the sponsor. If they are stored in the sponsor's archives, the archives of the testing laboratory must identify the storage location.\n\nIf a sponsor agrees to characterize and store test articles submitted for study to a contractor, must the contractor also verify the characterization and provide storage for the test articles? No, but the contractor must identify the storage location.\n\nWhat is the \"completion date\" of a nonclinical laboratory study? The completion date is the date that the study director signs the final report. Some discretion must be used however, since the protocol calls for a proposed \"completion date.\" In this case, it would be adequate for the protocol to list a completion date for the in vivo phase and qualify it as such.\n\nWith respect to archival material, what is required to be listed as the date of the study? The study date would be the same as the completion date of the study.\n\nDo all studies on a test article need to be submitted in support of an application for a research or marketing permit? All studies need be submitted, however, not all studies need be conducted in accord with the GLPs. The conforming amendments provide that a statement be included in the submission which identifies which studies have not been conducted in compliance with the GLPs and the extent of the non-compliance.\n\nWhat should be included in the signed and dated reports of the individual scientists participating in the study? The final report prepared by the study director should have appended to it all reports written by other participating scientists. These reports should contain sufficient detail to enable the study director to write a final report, which reflects the results of the study.\n\nSubpart K Disqualification of Testing Facilities\n\n58.200 Purposes\n\n58.202 Grounds for Disqualification\n\n58.204 Notice of And Opportunity for Hearing on Proposed Disqualification\n\n58.210 actions UPON DISQUALIFICATION\n\n58.213 PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION REGARDING\n\nDISQUALIFICATION\n\n58.215 alternative OR ADDtional actions TO DISQUALIFICATION\n\n58.217 suspension OR TERMINATION OF A TESTING FACILITY BY A SPONSOR\n\n58.219 reinstatement OF A DISQUALIFI TESTING FACILITY\n\nENFORCEMENT STRategy\n\nWhat can FDA do to force a laboratory to take corrective actions to achieve compliance with the GLPs? Are warnings given to the laboratory?\n\nFDA has a number of regulatory sanctions, which can be brought to bear on a violative firm in order to, bring about compliance with the law. These include rejection of studies, withdrawal of approval of marketed products if such products are supported by defective studies, prosecution and, after June 20, 1979, disqualification of the laboratory. FDA's present GLP enforcement policy is to provide adequate warning and to afford a reasonable opportunity to take corrective action.\n\nDisqualifying a laboratory on the basis of failing to comply with one or more provisions of the GLPs raises the question of whether all violations are considered-equally, are weighted, or are evaluated scientifically to consider the impact on the outcome of the study.\n\nA laboratory will not be considered for disqualification unless all of the following criteria are met:\n\nThe violations of the various provisions of the GLPs are evaluated to assess their impact on the validity of the studies. It is impossible to assign weights to the various provisions of the GLPs. Noncompliance with the various provisions must be evaluated in the context of the entire laboratory operation and the kinds of studies being performed. Thus, a violation of a specific provision may be critical for one laboratory doing long-term studies and not for another laboratory engaged in short term studies.\n\na. failure to comply with one or more provisions of the GLPs;\n\nb. the noncompliance adversely affected the validity of the studies;\n\nc. other lesser regulatory actions (warnings, rejection of individual studies) have not or will not be adequate to achieve compliance with the GLPs.\n\nIf a laboratory is disqualified, how long does the disqualification last? Under what conditions does reinstatement occur?The disqualification will last until the laboratory submits in writing to the Commissioner, reasons for reinstatement including a detailed description of the corrective actions it has taken to assure that the violations which led to disqualification will not recur. Reinstatement will depend upon one or more inspections which show that the laboratory is in compliance with GLPs.\n\nParagraph 231 of the preamble to the GLPs states: \"The order of disqualification creates a rebuttable presumption that all studies previously conducted by the facility are unacceptable. Paragraph 226 states: \"Studies conducted at facilities that are in substantial compliance will be presumed to be valid.\" Can we presume that studies conducted during a period when a lab is found to be substantially in compliance will be accepted by FDA as valid even if the laboratory is disqualified at a later date?\n\nYes, unless FDA develops information to the contrary.\n4. If a contract laboratory is disqualified because of a study performed for one sponsor, what effect does this have on other studies performed for other sponsors? What about studies underway at the time of disqualification?\n\nFDA will not disqualify a laboratory on the basis of one invalid study. Disqualification is viewed as a most serious regulatory sanction by FDA and will only be imposed when the facts demonstrate that the laboratory is incapable of producing valid scientific data and will not take adequate corrective measures. In the event a laboratory is disqualified, all studies performed by the laboratory, including those in progress are presumed to be unacceptable unless the sponsors of those studies can establish, to the satisfaction of FDA, that the studies were not affected by the circumstances that led to the disqualification.\n5. What steps must be taken by FDA prior to removal of a product from the market because of a rejected study which was pivotal to the assessment of safety?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.578230857849121", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs prohibit the use of primates for multiple nonclinical laboratory studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Paragraph 231 of the preamble to the GLPs states: \"The order of disqualification creates a rebuttable presumption that all studies previously conducted by the facility are unacceptable.

What steps must be taken by FDA prior to removal of a product from the market because of a rejected study which was pivotal to the assessment of safety?\n\nIf rejection of a study results in insufficient scientific data being available to support a decision on safety for a marketed product, FDA will initiate formal proceedings to withdraw the marketing approval of that product. These proceedings, for drugs, begin with a notice published in the FEDERAL REGISTER of FDA's proposal to withdraw approval setting forth the basis for the proposed action and affording affected parties an opportunity for a public hearing on the matter. If a hearing is requested, affected parties will have the opportunity to present additional facts at the hearing for the Agency to consider The Commissioner's decision to withdraw or to continue the approval is based on the facts brought out at the hearing.\n1. What is the regulatory basis for conducting GLP inspections? It would seem that by making the GLPs regulations instead of guidelines, that the attorneys and accountants are managing the studies. How does that produce good science? The GLP regulations are process-oriented; they are designed to assure that the data collected in a nonclinical laboratory study are valid and accurately reflect the responses of the test system. The GLP inspections are necessary to assess the degree of compliance with the GLPs. The science of a study depends on the appropriateness of the design selected to answer the questions raised in the use of the test article as well as the soundness of the conclusions drawn from the data collected in the study. The assessment of the scientific merit of a study is made by scientists.\n2. Does FDA have the authority to audit an ongoing study of a product for which an application for a research or marketing permit has not yet been submitted to FDA? A distinction needs to be made between an audit of a study and a GLP inspection. An audit involves a comparison of raw data with completed reports to identify errors and discrepancies. A GLP inspection involves an assessment of the procedures used to carry out the study and to record and store the data. FDA audits only studies, which have or are intended to be submitted to the Agency. The FDA will, however, look at on-going studies whether or not they involve FDA regulated products for purposes of documenting the laboratory's adherence to GLPs; such an inspection does not, however, constitute a data audit of the study rather it is an audit of the \"process.\"\n3. What happens when a laboratory refuses to permit an inspection of its facilities? If the laboratory is actively conducting studies on investigational new drugs, investigational new animal drugs, or investigational devices, refusal to permit inspection is a violation of section 301(e) or (f) of the Act and the Agency will take whatever action is required to compel inspection. Where the Agency has reason to believe that the laboratory is in fact conducting nonclinical laboratory studies, a letter will issue to the laboratory stating that FDA will not accept any future studies performed by that laboratory in support of a research or marketing application. If the laboratory has not, or is not testing an FDA regulated product, it is also advised to contact the local FDA district office to arrange for an inspection should they anticipate engaging in such safety testing.\n4. What happens if in the course of an inspection of a contract laboratory, the sponsor of the study selected for GLP inspection refuses to permit access to the study records?The FDA investigator will select another study and proceed with the inspection. If the study originally selected for inspection involved an FDA regulated product, the Agency will pursue the matter directly with the sponsor.\n5. If GLP regulations are not retroactive, will FDA audit pre-June 1979 studies? If so, will FDA investigators list non-conformance with GLPs on the FD-483 Notice of Observations associated with those studies?\n\nFDA will continue to audit pre-June 1979 studies for purposes of assessing not only the quality of a particular study, but also the general performance of the laboratory prior to the time when GLP regulations were first proposed in November 1976. This is necessary because many of the marketing applications pending before the Agency contain studies performed prior to 1976.\n\nWhile deviations from the GLPs will be noted in the FD-483 associated with these studies, the Agency will use this information only to make a judgment regarding the scientific acceptability of those studies and will not use the deviations to initiate regulatory action against the laboratory. After the June 1979 effective date, however, deviations from the GLPs could result in regulatory action against both the studies and the laboratories.\n6. Will the GLPs apply to a study, which has been completed prior to the June 20, 1979, effective date for which a final report will not be prepared until after?\n\nThe GLP regulations became effective June 20, 1979, and those portions of studies underway, as of that date, even if only the final report, became subject to the regulations at that time.\n7. Will a laboratory engaged in testing an FDA-regulated product be subject to a GLP inspection if a research or marketing application has not been submitted to the Agency, e.g., a new company developing its first products?\n\nGenerally speaking, FDA inspects only those laboratories, which have conducted studies submitted to the Agency. FDA strongly advises any laboratory which intends to engage in the safety testing of a regulated product, and which has not been previously inspected, to contact the local FDA district office and request a GLP inspection.\n8. Will FDA accept data from a study not conducted in accordance with GLPs for regulatory purposes?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.316017150878906"], "Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n--------------------\nContext: Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n\nAn outlier, an observation that lies an unexpected distance from other values, does not in itself prove that an error or violation has occurred. Therefore, the primary data analysis should include all such observations, including \"outliers\". A sponsor may perform some specific supplemental analyses on subsets of the data, if clinically and scientifically justified, that may exclude outlying data points. Excluding large amounts of data, regardless of the reasons for exclusion, will seriously bias the results.\n\nCan I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when it is hard to find study subjects?In most studies the sponsor should avoid multiple testings of the same subject because it may skew performance statistics and under-estimate standard deviations. When multiple testing is done, the sponsor should explain why it is necessary and choose methods of statistical analysis that allow adjustment for within-subject correlation. It is appropriate to conduct repeated testing of the same sample to evaluate test reproducibility - i.e., the ability of the test to yield the same or similar readings when expected.\n\n8. How much precision (see the Glossary for definition) is needed for measurement data, e.g., in terms of decimal places?\n\nStudy data should contain no more decimal places than the precision of the instrument allows, i.e., if the instrument is only precise to the second decimal place the sponsor should not analyze the data using three decimal places.\n\n9. What records should help to ensure scientific soundness of an IVD investigational study?\n\nUnless a study falls within the exemption at 21 CFR 812.2(c), specific record requirements are listed in 21 CFR 812.140. In general, the records that are needed are those that provide the data for testing the study hypotheses. Records should contain sufficient detail to allow the study to be reproduced when the same protocol is followed. We recommend that investigators maintain detailed records because a review of the study may indicate the need for other analyses of the collected data.\n\nWe also recommend that investigators:\n\na. Maintain records of all data elements captured in the study, including raw measurements and subject co-variables in the form of demographic and morbidity factors; b. Link every observation recorded to the subject and that person's co-variable data; c. Preserve information obtained for all subjects enrolled and for all specimens collected.\n\nAdditionally, electronic spreadsheets of study data are useful. Given the possible need to review or analyze study data at the most detailed level, electronic spreadsheets may help to minimize review time. For information on electronic records, see the guidance document, \"Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures -- Scope and Application,\" at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation\n\nn/Guidances/ucm072322.pdf. There is also a more general guidance document available on electronic records for clinical studies that is entitled \"Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Trials,\" which can be found at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126402.htm.\n\nWhat does FDA recommend be included in the final report of the investigation from the sponsor to all reviewing IRBs (and to FDA for significant risk studies) (21 CFR 812.150(b)(7))?\n\nA final report should be a basic scientific report of the studies conducted, including the results of testing the study hypotheses. This report can be a useful means of providing a simple account of the data collection and study outcome. Such a report can facilitate preparation of the eventual submission for regulatory action, particularly when accompanied by the information included in the investigational plan (see the Glossary for definition).\n\nThe suggested format for the IDE final report, which FDA includes as an enclosure in all IDE approval letters, is found in Appendix 5 of this guidance.\n\nIt should be noted that FDA will consider submission of a marketing application (510(k), PMA, or HDE) to serve as the final report for the IDE. When a study sponsor submits a marketing application in lieu of the final report, the sponsor should still submit a supplement to the IDE stating that the marketing application should be considered the final report for the study.\n\nThe final report for significant risk device investigations must be submitted to the IRBs and/or FDA within six months after termination or completion of the study. 21 CFR 812.150(b)(7).\n\nVII. Glossary\n\nNote: this glossary is written in plain language and is for use exclusively with this guidance document.\n\nDefinitions that have been taken from the Act, other pertinent laws, or in Federal regulations include the relevant citation.\n\n510(k) - See Premarket Notification.\n\nAgreement meeting - a meeting, under section 520(g)(7) of the Act (21 U.S.C. SS 360j(g)(7)), that is available to anyone planning to investigate the safety or effectiveness of a class III device (see definition below) or any implant. The purpose of the meeting is to reach agreement on the key parameters of the investigational plan, including the study protocol. The meeting is to be held within 30 days of the receipt of a written request. FDA will document in writing any agreement reached and make it a part of the administrative record. The agreement is binding on FDA and can only be changed with the written agreement of the applicant or when there is a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the device. See 21 U.S.C. SS 360j(g)(7). A guidance document regarding these meetings, \"Early Collaboration Meetings Under the FDA Modernization Act (FDAMA); Final Guidance for Industry and for CDRH Staff,\" is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocument\n\ns/ucm073604.htm.\n\nAnalyte specific reagent (ASR) - ASRs are defined as \"antibodies, both polyclonal and monoclonal, specific receptor proteins, ligands, nucleic acid sequences, and similar reagents which, through specific binding or chemical reactions with substances in a specimen, are intended for use in a diagnostic application for identification and quantification of an individual chemical substance or ligand in biological specimens.\" 21 CFR 864.4020(a). ASRs are medical devices that are regulated by FDA. They are subject to general controls, including current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs), 21 CFR Part 820, as well as the specific provisions of the ASR regulations (21 CFR 809.10(e), 809.30, 864.4020).\n\nClass I devices - devices for which the general controls of the Act are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness. They typically present minimal potential for harm to the user and the person being tested. They are subject to general controls, which include registration and listing, labeling, and adverse event reporting requirements (section 513(a)(1)(A) of the Act). Most Class I devices are exempt from premarket notification (see definition below), subject to certain limitations found in section 510(l) of the Act and in 21 CFR 862.9, 864.9, and 866.9. Some are also exempt from the \"Quality Systems Regulation\" found in 21 CFR Part 820. IVD examples of Class I devices include complement reagent, phosphorus (inorganic) test systems (21 CFR 862.1580), and E. coli serological reagents (21 CFR 866.3255).\n\nClass II devices - devices for which general controls alone are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness and for which establishment of special controls can provide such assurances. Special controls may include special labeling, mandatory performance standards, risk mitigation measures identified in guidance, and postmarket surveillance (section 513(a)(1)(B) of the Act). Some Class II devices are exempt from premarket notification (see definition below), subject to limitation in 21 CFR 862.9, 864.9, and 866.9. IVD examples of Class II devices include glucose test systems (21 CFR 862.1345), antinuclear antibody immunological test systems (21 CFR 866.5100), and coagulation instruments (21 CFR 864.5400).\n\nClass III devices - devices for which insufficient information exists to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness through general or special controls. Class III devices are usually those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury (section 513(a)(1)(C) of the Act). Most Class III devices require premarket approval (PMA, see definition below). IVD examples of these include automated PAP smear readers, nucleic acid amplification devices for tuberculosis, and total prostate specific antigen (PSA) for the detection of cancer. A limited number of Class III devices that are equivalent to devices legally marketed before enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 may be marketed through the premarket notification (510(k)) process (see definition below), until FDA has published a requirement for manufacturers of that generic type of device to submit PMA data.\n\nCompassionate use - The compassionate use provision allows access for patients with a serious disease or condition who do not meet the requirements for inclusion in the clinical investigation but for whom the treating physician believes the device may provide a benefit in treating and/or diagnosing their disease or condition. There must be no feasible alternative therapies/diagnostics available. Compassionate use is typically available only for individual patients but also may be used to treat a small group. Prior FDA approval is needed before compassionate use occurs.\n\nFurther information can be found at\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.791296005249023", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 5: FDA does not believe that this guidance is suitable for use in its entirety when immunohematology tests (e.g., blood grouping, blood group antibody detection and/or identification, crossmatching) are being migrated because of the differences in assay methodology and results reading and interpretation as compared to the other assays and systems described in this guidance. If you believe that your immunohematology reagents and system can be evaluated using the criteria outlined in this guidance, contact the responsible review division in CBER. Immunohematology products are reviewed in the Devices Review Branch, Division of Blood Applications, Office of Blood Research and Review, CBER.\n\nAssay migration studies are ideally suited for test systems for which the assay output (raw signal) is a numeric result or is expressed as a signal to cutoff (S/CO). Devices for which a numeric output is not available might be more difficult to analyze and may not be suitable candidates for use of this approach.\n\nMigration studies would not be applicable to the following devices or to system changes that are generally considered significant, such as:\n\nsystems intended for over-the-counter use,\n\nsystems intended for prescription home use, or\n\ndevices that do not meet the Critical Considerations criteria stated below.\n\nThe FDA strongly recommends that sponsors discuss proposed migration studies with the Agency early in the product design and testing process in order to determine if the proposed changes are consistent with the considerations that would allow for focused testing. An early contact with the Agency is especially recommended for an assay being transferred from a manual system to an automated or semi-automated instrument system. For CBER licensed devices, this contact may be through an IND, or protocol review, providing preliminary protocols, data, and justifications prior to performing the migration studies. The size, nature,and scope of migration studies we recommend will depend on a detailed evaluation of the old and new systems, the level of regulation appropriate for the product (e.g., PMA, BLA, or 510(k)), the performance characteristics of the assay, and the design and scope of the analytical testing and clinical trials used to support approval, licensure, or clearance of the assay on the old system.\n\nCritical Considerations for Determining Whether The Migration Studies Paradigm May Apply To A Particular Device\n\nA sponsor should take into account the following critical considerations in determining whether the migration studies approach is appropriate for a particular product, and describe these considerations in the submission:\n\nThe intended use and indications for use for the new system should be unchanged from the old system, except for inclusion of the new system.\n\nReagent and assay parameters (e.g., cutoff) should be unchanged, except for very minor differences (such as small changes in incubation times) in order to optimize the assay on the new system. However, the sponsor should provide evidence that the changes do not compromise the assay's performance.\n\nSome assay technologies may not be good candidates for the migration studies paradigm (e.g., assays with relatively high imprecision near the assay cutoff).\n\nAssay and system technologies should remain unchanged. All biochemical (e.g., antibody and antigen interactions or DNA probe construct) and physical detection (e.g., colorimetric, chemiluminescence, or dye binding) technologies should be unchanged from the old system. Minor differences in hardware instrumentation may be appropriate and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThere should be no expected change to the assay performance when run on the new system. However, actual changes will be evaluated in the context of their impact on the clinical use of the assay. Due to the limited number of positive and negative samples, the migration studies approach is not appropriate to support changes in clinical performance claims.\n\n5 Additional Considerations\n\nIn addition to addressing each of the critical considerations noted in Section 4, you should also include the information listed below to demonstrate the applicability of migration studies to the transfer of the assay from the old system to the new system. The information in your submission should include, but is not limited to, the following:Footnote 5: http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm089543.html\n\nContents\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nDevice description, including functional block diagrams and hardware and software components for both the old and new systems to allow an evaluation of the changes to the new system when compared to the old system.\n\nA similarities and differences table for a side-by-side comparison of assay parameters and hardware/software functions, requirements and design.\n\nA risk analysis of the new system (software/hardware/assay) using relevant guidance documents [6, 7].\n\nSummaries of software data validating functional operation of alerts and alarms in real or simulated circumstances.\n\nSystem Operator Manual(s): If the new system was previously approved or licensed with analytes other than the one under consideration, a new review of the System Operator Manual may only be called for if changes have been made that impact safety and effectiveness, or if there are assay-specific sections or changes.\n\nProposed modifications to the labeling that appropriately describe respective prior data and new migration study information. The sponsor should consult with FDA when determining whether a dual or separate package insert will be appropriate. Inclusion of the old system's analytical and performance data should be included where appropriate.\n\nIn addition, the sponsor should include documentation on software and instrumentation for the new system. When appropriate for the device, this documentation should meet all recommendations for the appropriate Level of Concern[7]. To further minimize risk, studies should be performed on the final production model of the new system that is intended to be marketed. Likewise, studies should be performed using the final release candidate of the software and any differences between the release candidate and the final release should be evaluated using a risk based approach and included in the submission for FDA review.\n\nIf you are using the migration paradigm to migrate an approved Class III assay to an instrument that has not previously been cleared or approved, or to move an approved Class III manual assay to an instrument not previously cleared or approved, you should submit documentation describing the hardware and software design controls, including design verification and validation, along with other appropriate Quality Systems documentation. (See 21 CFR Part 820 - Quality System Regulation). For a general discussion of the Quality System information that FDA recommends including in premarket applications please also refer to the guidance document available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm089543.htmlm070897.htm. In addition, if the instrument manufacturing site has not been inspected as part of the original class III assay approval process, then a site inspection may be conducted.\n\nVI Assay Migration Studies\n\nThis section outlines specific studies that may be appropriate to support assay migration for in vitro diagnostic devices. Before preparing to use the migration studies approach, you should determine whether the assay is quantitative, qualitative or semi-quantitative, according to the definitions in this guidance. Specifically, for the purposes of this guidance, qualitative assays are those that use numeric values (e.g., signal, S/CO), to determine nominal categorical assay results (e.g., positive or negative). Quantitative assays determine numeric values which are referenced to a measuring interval, and standards that allow determination of analyte concentrations. Section VI.A below describes studies for qualitative assays; Sections VI.B and VI.C address quantitative assays and semi-quantitative assays respectively; and Section VI.D addresses point-of-care assays. Special considerations for blood screening assays are covered in Appendix I, \"Migration Studies for Blood Donor Screening Assays.\"\n\nMigration Studies for Qualitative Assays\n\nAnalytical Studies for Qualitative Assays\n\nThe evaluations described below are based on the idea that similar studies were conducted previously for the old system. If the study design of the analytical studies conducted for the old system were different from the design of the studies described in this guidance, please contact the FDA for feedback. If you believe that some of the studies outlined in this document do not apply to your particular device, you should present your justification for FDA review.\n\nWe recommend that you use fresh clinical specimens for all analytical studies. If this is impractical, in some cases you may substitute or supplement fresh clinical specimens with archived samples. If archived samples are not available, spiked or diluted clinical samples may be used. In some instances, use of otherwise contrived matrix-specific samples may also be appropriate; however these should mimic clinical specimens as much as is feasible. We recommend that you contact FDA if you wish to discuss appropriate sample types for these evaluations. The matrix of any of these alternative specimens should be the same as that specified by the intended use of the old system.\n\na) Performance at Low Analyte Levels\n\nYou should evaluate the performance of the assay on the new system compared to the old system at low analyte levels (e.g., with dilution panels and seroconversion panels).\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.5631566047668457", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n--------------------\nContext: A similar approach should be adopted to exploring the influence of outliers, the statistical definition of which is, to some extent, arbitrary. Clear identification of a particular value as an outlier is most convincing when justified medically as well as statistically, and the medical context will then often define the appropriate action. Any outlier procedure set out in the protocol or the statistical analysis plan should be such as not to favor any treatment group a priori. Once again, this aspect of the analysis can be usefully updated during blind review. If no procedure for dealing with outliers was foreseen in the trial protocol, one analysis with the actual values and at least one other analysis eliminating or reducing the outlier effect should be performed and differences between their results discussed.\n\nData Transformation (5.4)\n\nThe decision to transform key variables prior to analysis is best made during the design of the trial on the basis of similar data from earlier clinical trials. Transformations (e.g., square root, logarithm) should be specified in the protocol and a rationale provided, especially for the primary variable(s). The general principles guiding the use of transformations to ensure that the assumptions underlying the statistical methods are met are to be found in standard texts; conventions for particular variables have been developed in a number of specific clinical areas. The decision on whether and how to transform a variable should be influenced by the preference for a scale that facilitates clinical interpretation.\n\nSimilar considerations apply to other derived variables, such as the use of change from baseline, percentage change from baseline, the area under the curve of repeated measures, or the ratio of two different variables. Subsequent clinical interpretation should be carefully considered, and the derivation should be justified in the protocol. Closely related points are made in section II.2.2.\n\nEstimation, Confidence Intervals, and Hypothesis Testing (5.5)\n\nThe statistical section of the protocol should specify the hypotheses that are to be tested and/or the treatment effects that are to be estimated in order to satisfy the primary objectives of the trial. The statistical methods to be used to accomplish these tasks should be described for the primary (and preferably the secondary) variables, and the underlying statistical model should be made clear. Estimates of treatment effects should be accompanied by confidence intervals, whenever possible, and the way in which these will be calculated should be identified. A description should be given of any intentions to use baseline data to improve precision or to adjust estimates for potential baseline differences, for example, by means of analysis of covariance.\n\nIt is important to clarify whether one- or two-sided tests of statistical significance will be used and, in particular, to justify prospectively the use of one-sided tests. If hypothesis tests are not considered appropriate, then the alternative process for arriving at statistical conclusions should be given. The issue of one-sided or two-sided approaches to inference is controversial, and a diversity of views can be found in the statistical literature. The approach of setting Type I errors for one-sided tests at half the conventional Type I error used in two-sided tests is preferable in regulatory settings. This promotes consistency with the two-sided confidence intervals that are generally appropriate for estimating the possible size of the difference between two treatments.\n\nThe particular statistical model chosen should reflect the current state of medical and statistical knowledge about the variables to be analyzed as well as the statistical design of the trial. All effects to be fitted in the analysis (for example, in analysis of variance models) should be fully specified, and the manner, if any, in which this set of effects might be modified in response to preliminary results should be explained. The same considerations apply to the set of covariates fitted in an analysis of covariance. (See also section V.G.) In the choice of statistical methods, due attention should be paid to the statistical distribution of both primary and secondary variables. When making this choice (for example between parametric and nonparametric methods), it is important to bear in mind the need to provide statistical estimates of the size of treatment effects together with confidence intervals (in addition to significance tests).\n\nThe primary analysis of the primary variable should be clearly distinguished from supporting analyses of the primary or secondary variables. Within the statistical section of the protocol or the statistical analysis plan there should also be an outline of the way in which data other than the primary and secondary variables will be summarized and reported. This should include a reference to any approaches adopted for the purpose of achieving consistency of analysis across a range of trials, for example, for safety data.\n\nModeling approaches that incorporate information on known pharmacological parameters, the extent of protocol compliance for individual subjects, or other biologically based data may provide valuable insights into actual or potential efficacy, especially with regard to estimation of treatment effects. The assumptions underlying such models should always be clearly identified, and the limitations of any conclusions should be carefully described.\n\nAdjustment of Significance and Confidence Levels (5.6)\n\nWhen multiplicity is present, the usual frequentist approach to the analysis of clinical trial data may necessitate an adjustment to the Type I error. Multiplicity may arise, for example, from multiple primary variables (see section II.B.2), multiple comparisons of treatments, repeated evaluation over time, and/or interim analyses (see section IV.E). Methods to avoid or reduce multiplicity are sometimes preferable when available, such as the identification of the key primary variable (multiple variables), the choice of a critical treatment contrast (multiple comparisons), and the use of a summary measure such as area under the curve (repeated measures). In confirmatory analyses, any aspects of multiplicity that remain after steps of this kind have been taken should be identified in the protocol; adjustment should always be considered and the details of any adjustment procedure or an explanation of why adjustment is not thought to be necessary should be set out in the analysis plan.\n\nSubgroups, Interactions, and Covariates (5.7)\n\nThe primary variable(s) is often systematically related to other influences apart from treatment. For example, there may be relationships to covariates such as age and sex, or there may be differences between specific subgroups of subjects, such as those treated at the different centers of a multicenter trial. In some instances, an adjustment for the influence of covariates or for subgroup effects is an integral part of the planned analysis and hence should be set out in the protocol. Pretrial deliberations should identify those covariates and factors expected to have an important influence on the primary variable(s), and should consider how to account for these in the analysis to improve precision and to compensate for any lack of balance between treatment groups. If one or more factors are used to stratify the design, it is appropriate to account for those factors in the analysis. When the potential value of an adjustment is in doubt, it is often advisable to nominate the unadjusted analysis as the one for primary attention, the adjusted analysis being supportive. Special attention should be paid to center effects and to the role of baseline measurements of the primary variable. It is not advisable to adjust the main analyses for covariates measured after randomization because they may be affected by the treatments.\n\nThe treatment effect itself may also vary with subgroup or covariate. For example, the effect may decrease with age or may be larger in a particular diagnostic category of subjects. In some cases such interactions are anticipated or are of particular prior interest (e.g., geriatrics); hence a subgroup analysis or a statistical model including interactions is part of the planned confirmatory analysis. In most cases, however, subgroup or interaction analyses are exploratory and should be clearly identified as such; they should explore the uniformity of any treatment effects found overall. In general, such analyses should proceed first through the addition of interaction terms to the statistical model in question, complemented by additional exploratory analysis within relevant subgroups of subjects, or within strata defined by the covariates. When exploratory, these analyses should be interpreted cautiously. Any conclusion of treatment efficacy (or lack thereof) or safety based solely on exploratory subgroup analyses is unlikely to be accepted.\n\nH. Integrity of Data and Computer Software Validity (5.8)\n\nThe credibility of the numerical results of the analysis depends on the quality and validity of the methods and software (both internally and externally written) used both for data management (data entry, storage, verification, correction, and retrieval) and for processing the data statistically. Data management activities should therefore be based on thorough and effective standard operating procedures. The computer software used for data management and statistical analysis should be reliable, and documentation of appropriate software testing procedures should be available.\n\nVI. EVALUATION OF SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY\n\nA. Scope of Evaluation (6.1)\n--------------------\nContext title: E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.805552959442139", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n--------------------\nContext: Migration Studies for Point Of Care (POC) Assays\n\nBefore preparing to use the migration studies approach for a POC assay, you should determine whether the assay is quantitative, qualitative or semi-quantitative, according to the definitions in this guidance. The migration studies should be conducted in the hands of intended users of the POC assays. You should contact the appropriate FDA CDRH or CBER Division to obtain recommendations about migration studies for a POC device.\n\nVII Other Studies\n\nDepending upon the unique characteristics of the qualitative, quantitative or semi-quantitative assay being migrated to the new system, the following studies may be called for. If not previously conducted for the old system, they should be performed for the new system.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf you determine that a study described below is not applicable for your system, you should describe your reasoning in detail in your application to FDA. FDA will consider such explanations on a case-by-case basis particularly for manual to semi-automated or automated system migrations.\n\nCarry-over or cross-contamination studies: The importance of repeating these studies on a new system can be ascertained by a thorough analysis of the new system. As mentioned in Section V of this document, block diagrams and side-by-side comparison tables would be beneficial in this determination. Changes to specific physical features such as a change in sample pipettor design or the layout of the new system could indicate the need for new carry-over studies. If a carry-over study for the new system is appropriate and the new design is sufficiently similar to the old system, the new study can be the same as previously used for the old system. Samples with high positive concentrations of analyte should be tested alternating with analyte-negative samples in patterns dependent on the operational function of the instrument. The concentration of analyte in the high positive samples should exceed 95%-99% or more of the results normally obtained in clinical samples from diseased patients in the intended use population. This testing should be done over multiple runs (at least 5 runs are recommended by the Commission of European Communities10). Footnote 10: Commission Decision 2002/364/EC of 7 May 2002 on common technical specifications for in vitro-diagnostic medical devices [Official Journal L 131 of 16.05.2002].\n\nMatrix equivalency and recovery studies: Presumptively, because there are no changes to the assay, there should be no new effects on the assay performance due to different matrices unless physical alterations of the new system could create such an effect. Similarly, recovery studies should not be affected by the migration of an assay from an old to a new system.\n\nInterfering substances studies: Presumptively, with no changes to the assay, there should be no new effects on the assay performance due to interfering substances.\n\nOn-board reagent/calibrator and sample stability studies: Unless there are physical or process changes to the new system, presumptively, there should be no effect on assay performance due to on-board reagent or sample stability.\n\nCross-reactivity studies: Presumptively, as there are no changes in assay components, a migration to a new system should have no effect on the existing cross-reactivity.\n\nHook effect studies: Presumptively, because there is no assay change, the parameters of the hook effect should be the same, unless physical alterations in the new system could create such an effect.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nVerification of kit control material and calibrators: Presumptively because there is no change to the assay, the control results and calibration ranges should remain the same, unless physical alterations in the new system could create new effects.\n\nIf new analyte-specific information requires new studies to bring the assay's performance characteristics up-to-date, please contact FDA for guidance.\n\nVIII. Molecular Assays\n\nThere are specific criteria that are unique to nucleic acid tests (NAT) and therefore NATs present additional specific concerns over serological and antigen assays:\n\nWhen appropriate, you should provide testing with panels showing a rise in viral titer over time from serial bleeds (viremic profile). Similar to seroconversion panels, they should have a minimum number of days between bleeds and begin with at least one negative bleed. They should be of clinical relevance to the appropriate individual marker.\n\nCarryover studies: Because of the increased risks of carryover due to the amplification methodologies utilized in molecular testing (e.g., PCR, TMA), you should perform carryover studies for all NAT migration studies.\n\nSample stability: Because of the nature of DNA and especially RNA, careful attention should be given to the stability of samples in relation to on-board storage and manipulation.\n\nSample processing: The processes of purification and extraction of DNA or RNA from clinical samples is critical to the success of molecular tests. You should evaluate any additions or modifications associated with the new system that could affect these processes.\n\nValidation of control material and calibrators: You should perform these studies on the new system due to the sensitive nature of molecular assays.\n\nFor molecular assays detecting multiple analytes, please contact FDA for further discussion.\n\nIX. Regulatory Outcomes\n\nShould the acceptance criteria noted in Sections VI.A.4 or VI.B.4 above be met, it would be appropriate for the sponsor to claim that the new system does not compromise the results as compared to the old system. It would not be appropriate to claim improved performance characteristics. It would also not be appropriate to compute clinical performance claims for the new system based on the migrationstudies described here, since these studies are analytical, rather than clinical. Should you wish to develop more extensive claims, the migration studies paradigm would not be an appropriate scientific approach.\n\nIf the acceptance criteria are not met and the aberrant performance could affect clinical management, you will be asked to perform a complete clinical study presenting the clinical performance of the assay on the new system.\n\nX Glossary\n\nFor the purposes of this document the following definitions are used. HTD referenced terms are based on the CLSI Harmonized Terminology Database.\n\nC({}_{\\$}): a concentration at which repeated tests of a sample with this concentration under stipulated conditions are 95% negative (or 5% positive) (see CLSI EP12-A2).\n\nC({}_{\\$}): a concentration at which repeated tests of a sample with this concentration under stipulated conditions are 95% positive (see CLSI EP12-A2).\n\nC({}_{\\$}): a concentration at which repeated tests of a sample with this concentration under stipulated conditions are 50 % positive (or 50% negative). Under ideal circumstances, C({}_{50}) will exactly equal the cutoff established by the manufacturer.\n\nCalibrators: a substance or device that is based on a reference preparation or in which the analyte concentration or other quantity has been determined by an analytical procedure of stated reliability. Calibrators are used to calibrate, graduate, or adjust a measurement [HTD].\n\nCarry-over: amount of analyte carried by the measuring system from one sample reaction into subsequent sample reactions, thereby erroneously affecting the apparent amounts in subsequent samples [HTD].\n\nControl material: a device, solution, or preparation intended for use in the quality control process to monitor the reliability of a test system and to evaluate its performance within established limits.\n\nCross-reactivity: the ability of a drug, metabolite, a structurally similar compound other than the primary analyte, or even unrelated compound to affect the assay [HTD].\n\nCutoff value (CO): for a qualitative test, the threshold above which the result of the test is reported as positive and below which the result is reported as negative.\n\nHigh negative sample (C({}_{\\$})): a sample with a concentration of analyte close to the C({}_{\\$}) as determined by the old system. This term is equivalent to a \"weak negative sample\" for example as used in the guidance document \"Recommendations for CLIA Waiver Applications for Manufacturers of IVDs\",\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo\n\ncuments/ucm070890.pdf.\n\nHook effect (high dose hook effect): effect of a suboptimal antigen-antibody reaction in which either the antibody or antigen is in excess resulting in an incomplete, or blocked reaction leading to a decreasing signal response at very high levels of analyte. It is used interchangeably with \"prozone effect,\" [HTD].\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nInterfering substances: endogenous (e.g., blood components, acidic polysaccharides) or exogenous (e.g., talc, anticoagulant) substances in clinical samples that can cause false-positive or false-negative results in a test system [HTD].\n\nLimit of blank (LoB): highest measurement result that is likely to be observed (with a stated probability) for a blank sample (a sample with concentration at or near zero) (CLSI EP17-A; [HTD]).\n\nLimit of detection (LoD): the lowest concentration of analyte that can be reported to be present at a specified level of confidence, although perhaps not quantified to an exact value. Similarly, an amount of analyte in a sample for which the probability of falsely claiming the absence is (\\beta) (type II error) given a probability (\\alpha) (type I error) of falsely claiming its presence (CLSI EP17-A; [HTD])\n\nLimit of quantitation (LoQ): the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be quantitatively determined with {stated} acceptable precision and {stated, acceptable} accuracy, under stated experimental conditions (CLSI EP17-A; [HTD]).\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.2108588218688965", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n--------------------\nContext: Migration Studies for Qualitative Assays\n\nAnalytical Studies for Qualitative Assays\n\nThe evaluations described below are based on the idea that similar studies were conducted previously for the old system. If the study design of the analytical studies conducted for the old system were different from the design of the studies described in this guidance, please contact the FDA for feedback. If you believe that some of the studies outlined in this document do not apply to your particular device, you should present your justification for FDA review.\n\nWe recommend that you use fresh clinical specimens for all analytical studies. If this is impractical, in some cases you may substitute or supplement fresh clinical specimens with archived samples. If archived samples are not available, spiked or diluted clinical samples may be used. In some instances, use of otherwise contrived matrix-specific samples may also be appropriate; however these should mimic clinical specimens as much as is feasible. We recommend that you contact FDA if you wish to discuss appropriate sample types for these evaluations. The matrix of any of these alternative specimens should be the same as that specified by the intended use of the old system.\n\na) Performance at Low Analyte Levels\n\nYou should evaluate the performance of the assay on the new system compared to the old system at low analyte levels (e.g., with dilution panels and seroconversion panels).\n\nWhere available, assay performance at low positive analyte levels usingdilution panels should be based on international standards (e.g., World Health Organization (WHO) standards, Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) standards) and compared with the old system.\n\nIf available and appropriate, test well-characterized seroconversion panels similar in number and type to the panels originally used to support approval/licensure/clearance. The seroconversion panels should be run on both the old system and the new system.\n\n3.2.2 Precision\n\nThis section describes precision study designs including panel composition.\n\n(i) Composition of Precision Panel\n\nThe categorical result of a qualitative test is determined using the numeric test data and a cutoff(s) (e.g., a numeric threshold), which define numeric ranges that correspond to the final result categories. For a qualitative test with two categorical results, a cutoff (one threshold) is used to define positive and negative results of the test. When the observed numeric test data exceeds the threshold, the final result is considered positive (or \"reactive\", \"detected\"). When the observed numeric test result is below the cutoff, it is considered negative (or \"not reactive\", \"not detected\").\n\nQualitative assays discriminating between two classes of subjects (non-diseased vs diseased) can fall into two groups: 1) assays used in situations where non- diseased subject samples have a true zero concentration of the analyte of interest, and 2) assays used in situations where non-diseased subject samples have a detectable analyte concentration. For the latter, the cutoff was chosen to optimize clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity of the assay based on a clinical data set. Appropriate precision panels for these two types of assays, as well as assays that produce equivocal results, and/or have a re-test zone, are discussed in more detail in (a)-(c), below:\n\n(a) When non-diseased subject samples have a detectable amount of analyte.\n\nFor the non-diseased subject samples that have a detectable amount of analyte the cutoff of the assay is higher than the limit of the blank. A useful characteristic of the cutoff is that a sample with a concentration (determined by the mean signal to cutoff value from a large a series of replicate measurements) at the cutoff yields a positive result 50% of the time and a negative result 50% of the time when a large number of replicates of that sample are run under stipulated conditions (see Figure 1 below). We denote this concentration as C({}_{50}).\n\nFor samples with concentrations exceeding C({}{50}), one expects to see positive results more than 50% of the time, and similarly for samples with a concentration below C({}{50}), one expects to see positive results less than 50% of the time. In this guidance we refer to an analyte concentration that yields, upon evaluating many replicates, a positive result 95% of the time (and a negative result 5% of the time) as a Low Positive concentration (C({}{95}) concentration). We refer to a sample concentration which yields a positive result 5% of the time (and negative result 95% of the time) as a High Negative concentration (C({}{5}) concentration). Samples with concentrations of analyte close to C({}{95}) and C({}{5}) as determined by the old system are recommended for the within-laboratory precision (see CLSI8 document EP12). The panel should consist of at least four members, as described below (also, see Figure 2):\n\nFootnote 8: Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute. CLSI documents referenced in this guidance are listed in Section XI of this document.\n\nA True Negative sample: a sample with a true analyte concentration of zero.\n\nA High Negative sample: a sample that repeatedly tests negative approximately 95% of the time and positive 5% of the time by the old system. One should expect that the same concentration tested by the new system will also produce negative results approximately 95% of\n\nFigure 1: Results of a qualitative assay (probability density function) for a sample with a concentration at the cutoff measured multiple times.\n\nthe time (C({}{5}) concentration as determined by the old system).\n* A Low Positive sample: a sample with an analyte concentration around C({}{95}) as determined by the old system. Repeatedly testing this sample by the old system should give a positive result approximately 95% of the time and a negative result 5% of the time. One should expect that the same concentration tested by the new system will also produce positive results approximately 95% of the time. Note that if the LoB is used as a cutoff, then the concentration C({}_{95}) is the same as the LoD.\n* A Moderate Positive sample: a sample with a concentration close to the cutoff, and at which one observes positive results by the old system approximately 100% of the time (e.g., a sample with a signal approximately two to three times the signal at the cutoff if the cutoff=1.0, or a sample with concentration approximately two to three times the 95% LoD if the cutoff is based on LoB).\n\nFor the details of how the C({}{95}) and C({}{5}) concentrations can be evaluated from the previous precision studies of the old system, see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 1. For the precision study of the new system, it is not necessary to have the High Negative and Low Positive samples at exactly C({}{5}) or C({}{95}) of the old system. If the High Negative and Low Positive samples in the precision study of the new system are close enough to the cutoff that the standard\n\nFigure 2: Relationship between percent of positive results and the analyte cutoff concentration.\n\ndeviation (or percent coefficient of variation (CV) is approximately constant over the range around the cutoff, the C({}{5}) and C({}{95}) of the new system can be evaluated from this precision study (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 1).\n\n(b) When non-diseased subject samples have a true zero analyte concentration.\n\nWhen non-diseased subject samples have a true zero analyte concentration there are two types of assays: (1) assays for which samples with zero concentration have a distribution of numeric signals and the cutoff of the assay is the limit of blank (with some type I error, for example, 5%); and (2) ultrasensitive assays for which samples with zero analyte concentration almost always have a negative assay result (type I error is close to zero). These two types of assays are discussed further in the two bullets below.\n\nConsider assays where samples with zero analyte concentration have a distribution of numeric signals and the limit of blank is used as a cutoff. In this case the concentration C({}{95}) is the same as the limit of detection (LoD) and zero concentration (no analyte present in sample) is C({}{5}) as illustrated in Figure 3, below. The precision panel should consist of at least the following three members: True Negative, Low Positive (around LoD) and Moderately Positive.\n\nFigure 3: Relationship between the percent of positive results and the analyte concentration where True Negative samples produce numeric results and the C({}_{95}) concentration is the LoD of the assay.\n\nFor ultrasensitive assays that employ, for example, a signal amplification methodology (e.g., real-time PCR), the following approaches for precision panel members are recommended. For ultrasensitive assays, the concentration range that spans High Negative (around C({}{5})) to Low Positive (around C({}{95})=LoD) is narrow with respect to the observed concentration range of clinical specimens. Due to this narrow range, it may be difficult to prepare a sample with C({}{5}) concentration. If less than 10% of all subjects positive by the old system have an observed concentration less than C({}{95}), then samples at the C({}{5}) concentration could be excluded from the precision panel. In this case, samples which compose the precision panel should include the following concentrations: True Negative, Low Positive (around C({}{95})) and Moderately Positive. If more than 10% of all subjects positive by the old system have an observed concentration less than C({}{95}), then samples which compose the precision panel should include the following concentrations: True Negative, Low Positive (around C({}{95})), samples in the range of C({}{20}) to C({}{80}) and Moderately Positive as illustrated in Figure 4, below.\n--------------------\nContext title: Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.402307033538818", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body of the dataset (i.e., \"outliers\")?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 19: Treatment-na\u00efve subjects could be healthy individuals or a patient population not exposed to a therapeutic protein product, depending on the stage of assay development or validation and the availability of samples. Sponsors should provide justification for the appropriateness of the samples used.\n\nThe sponsor should consider the impact of statistically determined outlier values and true-positive samples when establishing the cut-point. The sponsor should provide justification for the removal of any data points, along with the respective method used to determine their status as outliers. Sponsors should consult with FDA if there is a concern regarding the exclusion of outliers.\n\nApparent positive values and samples may derive from the presence of pre-existing antibodies or other serum factors in subject samples (Ross et al., 1990; Turano et al., 1992; Coutinho et al., 1995; Caruso and Turano, 1997; van der Meide and Schellekens, 1997; Boes, 2000). Although pre-existing antibodies to a variety of endogenous proteins are present in healthy individuals, these can be much higher in some disease states. The sponsor should identify those samples with pre-existing antibodies (for example, through competition with drug) and remove them from the cut-point analysis. If subjects in the study have pre-existing antibodies, it may be necessary to assign positive responses using a cut-point based on the difference between individual subject results before and after exposure to identify subjects in whom ADA increases following treatment, also known as treatment-boosted ADA. A common approach to evaluating treatment-boosted ADA responses is to assess changes in antibody titers. If it is not possible to use the methods described earlier in section IV.B for establishing the cut-point, sponsors should consult with the Agency to explore alternative methods.\n\nSensitivity\n\n3.3.1 Assay Sensitivity\n\nAssay sensitivity is the lowest concentration at which the antibody preparation consistently produces either a positive result or a readout equal to the cut-point determined for that assay. The assays should have sufficient sensitivity to enable detection of ADA before they reach levels that can be associated with altered pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), safety, or efficacy profiles. Assay sensitivity is assessed using positive control antibody preparations that may not represent the ADA response in a specific subject. For example, positive controls are frequently developed under conditions that enrich for high affinity antibodies. Such high affinity positive controls may overestimate the sensitivity of the assay. Because of this, the assay sensitivity determination contributes to the overall understanding of how the assay performs rather than setting an absolute mass of ADA that will be detected in any given subject. Because the measurement of assay sensitivity can be affected by onboard drug, it is also important to determine assay sensitivity in the presence of the expected concentration of onboard drug (see section IV.C.2).20 FDA recommends that screening and confirmatory IgG and IgM ADA assays achieve a sensitivity of at least 100 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) although a limit of sensitivity greater than 100 ng/mL may be acceptable depending on risk and prior knowledge. Traditionally, FDA has recommended sensitivity of at least 250 to 500 ng/mL. However, recent data suggest that concentrations as low as 100 ng/mL may be associated with clinical events (Plotkin, 2010; Zhou et al., 2013). It is understood that neutralization assays may not achieve that level of sensitivity. Assays developed to assess IgE ADA should have sensitivity in the high picograms per milliliter (pg/mL) to low ng/mL range.\n\nFootnote 20: See the USP General Chapters 1106 and 1106.1 for a discussion on Relative Sensitivity.\n\nThe sensitivity should be expressed as mass of antibody detectable/mL of undiluted matrix; for example, plasma, sera, saliva. Assay sensitivity should not be reported as titer. Assay sensitivity should be reported after factoring in the minimal required dilution (MRD). For example, an assay with 50 ng/mL sensitivity and an MRD of 20 would be reported as 1000 ng/mL. Testing of assay sensitivity should be performed with the relevant dilution of the same biological matrix as will be used to test the clinical samples. For example, assay sensitivity should be determined using the same anticoagulant as the diluent used with clinical samples.\n\nDuring development, sensitivity may be assessed by testing serial dilutions of a positive control antibody of known concentration, using individual or pooled matrix from treatment-naive subjects. The dilution series should be no greater than two- or threefold, and a minimum of five dilutions should be tested. The sensitivity can be calculated by interpolating the linear portion of the dilution curve to the assay cut-point.\n\nA purified preparation of antibodies specific to the therapeutic protein product should be used as the positive control to determine the sensitivity of the assay so that assay sensitivity can be reported in mass units/mL of matrix. Positive control antibodies used to assess sensitivity can take the form of polyclonal preparations affinity purified against the therapeutic protein product or monoclonal antibodies (mAb).\n\nDuring routine performance of the assay, a low positive system suitability control should be used to ensure that the sensitivity of the assay is acceptable across assay runs. Additionally, the low positive control should be consistently demonstrated as positive in both screening and confirmatory tiers (see section IV.1). Both positive and negative controls are discussed in detail in sections IV.1 and IV.1.2.\n\niv.1.2 Drug Tolerance, Sensitivity, and Assay Suitability\n\nThe therapeutic protein product or its endogenous counterpart present in the serum may interfere with the sensitivity of the assay. The assessment of assay sensitivity in the presence of the expected levels of interfering therapeutic protein product, also known as the assay's drug tolerance, is critical to understanding the sensitivity and suitability of the method for detecting ADA in dosed subjects.21 FDA recommends that sponsors examine assay drug tolerance early in assay development. The sponsor may examine drug tolerance by deliberately adding different known amounts of positive control antibody into ADA-negative control samples in the absence or presence of different quantities of the therapeutic protein product to determine whether the therapeutic protein product interferes with ADA detection. Results obtained in the absence and presence of different quantities of the therapeutic protein product under consideration should be compared. Drug tolerance may be improved using approaches such as acid dissociation that disrupt circulating ADA-drug complexes. The selectivity of the assay, the nature of the target, and the type of positive control should be taken into consideration when developing the assay because these factors impact the assessment of drug tolerance. For example, acid dissociation may not be appropriate when antibodies are acid labile or the drug target is soluble. Interference from the therapeutic protein product can be minimized by collecting subject samples at trough drug levels. See section VII.1 for recommendations regarding the timing of ADA sample collection.\n\nFootnote 21: See the USP General Chapters 1106 and 1106.1.\n\nSpecificity\n\nSpecificity refers to the ability of a method to exclusively detect the target analyte, in this case the ADA.22 Lack of assay specificity can lead to false-positive results, which could obscure relationships between ADA generating immune response, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical safety and efficacy measures. Demonstrating the specificity of antibody responses to mAb, Fc-fusion proteins, and Ig-fusion proteins poses challenges because of the high concentration of Ig in human serum. The assay should specifically detect anti- mAb antibodies but not the mAb product itself, soluble drug target, non-specific endogenous antibodies, or antibody reagents used in the assay. Similarly, for subject populations with a high incidence of rheumatoid factor (RF), the sponsor should demonstrate that RF does not interfere with the detection method or that the assay can differentiate between RF and specific antibodies. RF is discussed in detail in section IV.1.2. In cases where ADA demonstrates cross-reactivity with host cell proteins and other product-related impurities, the specificity of these reactions may need further evaluation.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA straightforward approach to addressing specificity is to demonstrate that binding can be blocked by soluble or unlabeled purified therapeutic protein product. One approach is to incubate positive and negative control antibody samples with the purified therapeutic protein product or its components under consideration. Inhibition of signal in the presence of the relevant therapeutic protein product or its components indicates that the response is specific. Establishing the specificity of multimeric antibodies such as IgM by competitive inhibition may be difficult, so establishing assay capability for these circumstances requires careful development or additional approaches. For ADA to mAb products, inclusion of another mAb with the same Fc but different variable region can be informative. If the assay is specific and selective for ADA to the therapeutic protein product being studied, generally the addition of that therapeutic protein product or its components in solution will reduce the assay signal. Conversely, addition of the therapeutic protein product or its components should have little effect on antibodies of other specificities.\n\nSelectivity\n--------------------\nContext title: Immunogenicity Testing of Therapeutic Protein Products \u2014Developing and Validating Assays for Anti-Drug Antibody Detection \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.638120174407959"], "Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: Research interactions that involve no more than minimal risk to subjects (e.g., quality of life surveys); and\n\nCollection of follow-up data from procedures or interventions that would have been done as part of routine clinical practice to monitor a subject for disease progression or recurrence, regardless of whether the procedures or interventions are described in the research protocol.\n\nIn contrast, FDA interprets \"long-term follow-up\" to exclude:\n\nResearch interventions that would not have been performed for clinical purposes, even if the research interventions involve no more than minimal risk.\n\nOf note, some studies that are not eligible for expedited review under category (8)(a) at the time of continuing review may be eligible for expedited review under one of the other expedited review categories. For example, if a study's only remaining activity involves long-term follow-up of subjects by drawing 15 ml of blood once annually for a test that is not part of routine clinical practice, such research would not be eligible for expedited review under category (8)(a), but might be eligible for expedited review under category (2).\n\nExpedited review category (8)(b)\n\nIRBs conducting continuing review should be aware that if a study previously received expedited continuing review under category (8)(b), but has now begun enrolling subjects, the study may need to be referred for review by the IRB at a convened meeting. The criterion that \"no additional risks have been identified\" is interpreted by FDA to mean that neither the investigator nor the IRB has identified any additional risks in the research from any relevant source20 since the IRB's most recent prior review.\n\nFootnote 20: For example, \u201cany relevant source\u201d would include a review of scientific literature or adverse event reports by the IRB or investigator, as well as communication with FDA or the sponsor.\n\nExpedited review category (8)(c)\n\nFDA notes that the process for conducting continuing review of research eligible under expedited review category (8)(c) can be accomplished through a simple, abbreviated process. For example, if the study is no longer enrolling subjects, all subjects have completed all protocol required visits, and no new data is being collected, and the investigator's sole activity is data analysis, the investigator, as part of the continuing review process, could provide to the IRB the following statement regarding the research: \"The study only involves data analysis, which is proceeding in accordance with the IRB-approved research protocol, and there are no problems to report.\" This statement could be provided by email or as part of a standard continuing review application form. Upon receipt of such a statement from the investigator, the IRB chairperson, or other member(s) designated by the chairperson, under the expedited review procedure, may approve continuation of the research project for another year without further deliberation or review.\n\nOnce the data collection from all trial sites is complete and the overall study results database has been locked and the only remaining activity is analysis of the aggregate data by the study sponsor, further continuing review of the research is generally no longer required.\n\n4.4.2 Expedited Review Category (9)\n\nSimilar to review category (1)21 for initial review, under category (9), an expedited review procedure may be used for the continuing review of research previously approved by the IRB at a convened meeting that meets the following conditions:\n\nFootnote 21: Category 1 research addresses \u201c(1) Clinical studies of drugs and medical devices only when condition (a) or (b) is met: (a) Research on drugs for which an investigational new drug application (21 CFR Part 312) is not required. (Note: Research on marketed drugs that significantly increases the risks or decreases the acceptability of the risks associated with the use of the product is not eligible for expedited review.)\n\nThe research is not conducted under an investigational new drug (IND) application or an investigational device exemption (IDE);\n\nExpedited review categories (2) through (8) do not apply to the research;\n\nThe IRB has documented at a convened meeting that the research involves no greater than minimal risk to the subjects; and\n\nNo additional risks have been identified.\n\nWith regard to the third condition, the IRB at a convened meeting must have determined that either (a) the research project as a whole involved no more than minimal risk, or (b) the remaining research activities present no more than minimal risk to human subjects. With regard to multi-site studies, the fourth condition, that no additional risks have been identified, is interpreted to mean that neither the investigator nor the IRB at a particular institution has identified any additional risks of the research based on information from any other institution engaged in the research project or from any other relevant source since the IRB's most recent prior review.\n\nFrequency of Continuing Review\n\nUnder 21 CFR 56.108(a)(2) and 56.109(f), the IRB must determine the frequency of continuing review for each clinical investigation to ensure the continued protection of the rights and welfare of research subjects. FDA regulations at 21 CFR 56.109(f) require an IRB to conduct continuing review of research at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk posed to the subjects, but not less than once a year.\n\nMore frequent review (i.e., more frequently than once per year) is appropriate, for example, when the risks to subjects require close monitoring. The IRB should consider the factors set forth below when deciding on an appropriate interval for continuing review. These factors should be outlined in the IRB's written procedures for deciding on the frequency of continuing review:\n\nThe nature of and any risks posed by the clinical investigation;\n\nThe degree of uncertainty regarding the risks involved;\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe vulnerability of the subject population;\n\nThe experience of the clinical investigator in conducting clinical research;\n\nThe IRB's previous experience with that investigator and/or sponsor (e.g., compliance history, previous problems with the investigator obtaining informed consent, prior complaints from subjects about the investigator);\n\nThe projected rate of enrollment; and\n\nWhether the study involve novel therapies.\n\nAt the time of initial approval of the study, FDA recommends that the IRB notify the investigator of the interval at which continuing review will occur (at least annually) and the date by which continuing review must occur. Similarly, at the time of continuing review, the IRB should consider whether the current frequency of continuing review for the study is adequate or should be adjusted. In addition to specifying a time interval, the IRB may also specify a subject enrollment number as a threshold for determining when continuing review is to occur. For example, at the time of initial review and approval of a high-risk clinical trial, the IRB might require that continuing review occur either in 6 months or after 5 subjects have been enrolled, whichever occurs first. However, if the continuing review interval is described in relation to a subject enrollment number, it must at a minimum also provide for continuing review annually, regardless of the number of subjects enrolled at that time; it is therefore not acceptable to describe the review interval solely in relation to a number of subjects enrolled. The minutes of IRB meetings should clearly document the approval period (continuing review interval).\n\nThe IRB's determinations regarding the approval of research must be communicated to the investigator in writing (21 CFR 56.109(e)). This written determination should also notify the investigator of the required interval for, and expected date of, continuing review.\n\nDetermining the Effective Date of Initial IRB Approval and the Dates for Continuing Review\n\nContinuing review must occur at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less frequently than once per year (21 CFR 56.109(f)). IRBs should establish written procedures for informing investigators of the FDA's regulations and the IRB's own policies and procedures on continuing review requirements. (See 21 CFR 56.108(a)(1) & (2).) This applies whether a study is reviewed by the convened IRB or through an expedited process.\n\nThe IRB's written procedures should describe how the IRB determines the effective date of approval for the study and how the date and period of approval will be communicated to the clinical investigator.\n\nWhen the IRB Reviews and Initially Approves Research Without Conditions at a\n\nConvened Meeting\n\nWhen the IRB conducts the initial review of a study at a convened meeting and approves the research for one year without requiring either (a) changes to the protocol or informed consent document(s), or (b) submission of clarifications or additional documents, the effective date of the initial approval is the date of that IRB meeting. In such circumstances, the expiration date of theinitial approval period and the date by which the first continuing review must occur may be as late as one year after the date of the IRB meeting at which the research initially was approved (21 CFR 56.109(f)).\n\nWhen the IRB Reviews and Initially Approves Research With Conditions at a Convened IRB Meeting Without Requiring Further Review at a Subsequent Convened Meeting\n\nA much more common scenario is when an IRB conducting the initial review of a research project at a convened meeting takes the following set of actions:\n\nApproves the project for one year;\n--------------------\nContext title: IRB Continuing Review After Clinical Investigation Approval Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.6647751331329346", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: This formal review of the research effort, as required under 21 CFR 56.109(f), is the subject of this guidance. An IRB must review previously approved research at least once a year (21 CFR 56.109(f)). Review must be conducted at convened meetings at which a majority of the IRB members are present, including at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas, unless the research qualifies for review through an expedited process (21 CFR 56.108(c) and 56.110). See Section III.D. of this guidance for more information on the application of expedited review procedures to continuing review.\n\nIRBs involved in multi-site studies may find it difficult to conduct a thorough review with data solely from the site(s) under their purview and may need to obtain study-wide information. Sponsors are in the unique position of having information for the entire study6 and may provide it to investigators, who in turn provide it to the IRBs. FDA's regulations do not prohibit sponsors from providing study-wide information directly to IRBs.7 FDA encourages efforts by investigators and sponsors to ensure that IRBs receive meaningful study-wide information, particularly when doing so may assist IRBs in reviewing the studies and protecting subjects.\n\nFootnote 6: See FDA\u2019s Guidance for Industry, \u201cAdverse Event Reporting to IRBs \u2013 Improving Human Subject Protection,\u201d http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126572.pdf.\n\nFootnote 7: Note that FDA\u2019s regulations for device studies specifically assign general responsibility to sponsors \u201c...for ensuring IRB review and approval are obtained and ensuring that any reviewing IRB and FDA are promptly informed of significant new information about an investigation...\u201d 21 CFR 812.40.\n\nOne way to enable a useful continuing review of multi-site studies while reducing or eliminating duplication of effort is through the use of cooperative review agreements or other mechanisms (e.g., using a centralized IRB review process), in accordance with 21 CFR 56.114. Cooperative agreements may vary with respect to how continuing review will be carried out. For example, some agreements may designate a specific IRB as having primary responsibility for continuing review of an investigation.8 Other agreements may assign responsibility for local issues to the institution's IRB, but assign the remaining aspects of continuing review to a central IRB.\n\nFootnote 8: See FDA\u2019s Guidance for Industry, \u201cUsing a Centralized IRB Review Process in Multicenter Clinical Trials,\u201d http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm080606.pdf.\n\nWhatever the arrangement, the IRB(s) responsible for continuing review of multi-site studies may find it helpful to obtain and review information across the entire study. For additional discussion, see Section III.B. of this guidance.\n\nAppendix A Criteria for Approving Research During Continuing Review\n\nFDA regulations set forth the criteria for IRB approval of research (21 CFR 56.111). These criteria apply to both initial review and continuing review. In order to approve research, the IRB must determine that all of following requirements are satisfied:\n\nRisks to subjects are minimized;\n\nRisks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may be expected to result;\n\nSelection of subjects is equitable;\n\nInformed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and appropriately documented;\n\nWhere appropriate, the research plan adequately provides for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects;\n\nWhere appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data;\n\nAppropriate additional safeguards are included to protect vulnerable subjects; and\n\nWhere the study involves children, the research complies with 21 CFR part 50, Subpart D.\n\nThe IRB makes its continuing review determination by considering whether any new information is available that would affect the IRB's prior finding that the research meets the criteria in 21 CFR 56.111. IRBs have authority to disapprove or require modifications in (to secure re- approval of) a research activity that does not meet any of the above criteria (e.g., the full study or any part thereof, such as changes to the protocol, advertisements; 21 CFR 56.109(a))\n\nAppendix B Process for Conducting Continuing Review\n\nContinuing review takes place at a convened meeting of the IRB, unless it meets the criteria for expedited review under 21 CFR 56.110. (See 21 CFR 56.108(c) and Section III.D. of this guidance.) The IRB is required to review the research (21 CFR 56.109(f)) and must maintain records of its continuing review activities, including minutes of meetings at which such activities are undertaken (21 CFR 56.115(a)(2) and (3)). The minutes must be in sufficient detail to show actions taken by the IRB, and the vote on these actions, and to summarize the discussion of controverted issues and their resolution (21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)). For research to be approved, a majority of IRB members present at a meeting must approve it (21 CFR 56.108(c)).\n\nThe IRB must ensure that a member does not participate in the IRB's continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB (21 CFR 56.107(e)). Meeting minutes must reflect meeting attendance, the votes taken, and a summary of the discussion and resolution of controverted issues, and should provide confirmation that conflicted members did not participate in the IRB's continuing review of their studies (21 CFR 56.115((a)(2)). FDA recommends that IRB members with a conflicting interest in a project recuse themselves by leaving the meeting room when the IRB conducts continuing review of that project, except when requested by the IRB to be present to provide information.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThis IRB member recusal should be noted in the minutes of the IRB meeting when recording votes on IRB actions.\n\nAn IRB must maintain and follow written procedures for the continuing review of research (21 CFR 56.108(a)(1) and 56.115(a)(6)). In developing procedures for continuing review, the IRB should consider the use of templates, checklists, or other tools to standardize the request for information or list of materials to be provided to the IRB at the time of continuing review.\n\nInvestigators are responsible for ensuring that studies they conduct comply with applicable regulatory requirements.9 To ensure that the reviewing IRB can carry out its review prior to the expiration date of the current IRB approval, investigators should follow the IRB's policies and procedures for continuing IRB review of research (procedures required by 21 CFR 56.108(a)(1)), in particular by submitting materials and information required by the IRB. FDA encourages IRBs to make investigators aware of the IRB's procedures, for example, by enclosing a copy in correspondence informing the investigator of the IRB's decisions, or posting the information on a website.\n\nFootnote 9: See 21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vii), 312.60, 312.66, 812.36(c)(viii), 812.100, 812.110(b), 812.40, and 812.43(c)(4)(i).\n\nFDA recommends that the IRB's written procedures call for submission of the following information for consideration by the IRB in continuing review, if not already available to the IRB as part of the existing IRB records for the research10:\n\nFootnote 10: Some of this information may come from the sponsor, who would have access to data across all study sites. Sponsors may provide information directly to IRBs or to the clinical investigators who in turn would share it with the IRBs.\n\nA written progress report/brief project summary that includes the following or references other documents made available to the IRB:\n\nThe number of subjects accrued; (For multi-site studies, the number of subjects accrued at the local site and the number accrued study-wide, if available, should be provided.)\n\nA brief summary of any amendments to the research approved by the IRB since the IRB's initial review or the last continuing review;\n\nAny new and relevant information, published or unpublished, since the last IRB review, especially information about risks associated with the research; (Note that FDA does not expect the IRB to perform an independent review of the relevant scientific literature related to a particular research project undergoing continuing review.)\n\nA summary of any unanticipated problems.11 In many cases, such a summary could be a brief statement that there have been no unanticipated problems (i.e., adverse events have occurred at the expected frequency and level of severity as documented in the research protocol, the informed consent document, and Investigator's Brochure (if applicable)); *\n(\\circ) A summary of any subject withdrawals from the research since the last IRB review, and the reasons for withdrawal, if known; and (\\circ) A summary of any complaints about the research from subjects enrolled at the local site since the last IRB review;\n\nThe latest version of the protocol and sample informed consent document(s) in use at the site;\n\nAny proposed modifications to the informed consent document or protocol;\n\nThe current Investigator's Brochure, if any, including any modifications;\n--------------------\nContext title: IRB Continuing Review After Clinical Investigation Approval Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.7593011260032654", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: Information Sheet\n\nInstitutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions\n\nGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n\nJANUARY 1998\n\nFinal\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/institutional-review-boards-frequently-asked-questions)\n\nOffice of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nThe following is a compilation of answers to questions asked of FDA regarding the protection of human subjects of research. For ease of reference, the numbers assigned to the questions are consecutive throughout this section. These questions and answers are organized as follows.\n\nI. IRB Organization\n\nII. IRB Membership\n\nIII. IRB Procedures\n\nIV. IRB Records\n\nV. Informed Consent Process\n\nVI. Informed Consent Document Content\n\nVII. Clinical Investigations\n\nVIII. General Questions\n\nI. IRB Organization\n\nWhat is an Institutional Review Board (IRB)?\n\nUnder FDA regulations, an IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects. In accordance with FDA regulations, an IRB has the authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove research. This group review serves an important role in the protection of the rights and welfare of human research subjects.\n\nThe purpose of IRB review is to assure, both in advance and by periodic review, that appropriate steps are taken to protect the rights and welfare of humans participating as subjects in the research. To accomplish this purpose, IRBs use a group process to review research protocols and related materials (e.g., informed consent documents and investigator brochures) to ensure protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects of research.\n\n2 Do IRBs have to be formally called by that name?\n\nNo, \"IRB\" is a generic term used by FDA (and HHS) to refer to a group whose function is to review research to assure the protection of the rights and welfare of the human subjects. Each institution may use whatever name it chooses. Regardless of the name chosen, the IRB is subject to the Agency's IRB regulations when studies of FDA regulated products are reviewed and approved.\n\n3 Does an IRB need to register with FDA before approving studies?\n\nAs published in the Federal Register on January 15, 2009, (74 FR 2358), 21 CFR Part 56, Institutional Review Boards, was amended with regard to IRB registration (21 CFR 56.106). This amendment requires each IRB in the United States (U.S.) that reviews FDA-regulated studies to register. IRB registration information is entered into an Internet-based registration system maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). (See Guidance for Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) Frequently Asked Questions - IRB Registration (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/frequently-asked-questions-irb-registration)).\n\n4 What is an \"assurance\" or a \"multiple project assurance?\"\n\nAn \"assurance,\" is a document negotiated between an institution and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in accordance with HHS regulations. For research involving human subjects conducted by HHS or supported in whole or in part by HHS, the HHS regulations require a written assurance from the performance-site institution that the institution will comply with the HHS protection of human subjects regulations [45 CFR part 46]. The assurance mechanism is described in 45 CFR 46.103. Once an institution's assurance has been approved by HHS, a number is assigned to the assurance. The assurance may be for a single grant or contract (a \"single project assurance\"); for multiple grants (\"multiple project assurances\" - formerly called \"general assurances\"); or for certain types of studies such as oncology group studies and AIDS research group studies (\"cooperative project assurances\"). The Office for Human Research Protection (OHRP) is responsible for implementing the HHS regulations. The address and telephone number for OHRP are: 1101 Wootton Parkway, The Tower Building, Suite 200, Rockville, MD 20852; Toll-Free Telephone within the U.S.: (866) 447-4777, Telephone: (240) 453-6900, FAX: (240) 453-6909.\nCurrently, FDA regulations do not require an assurance. FDA regulations [21 CFR parts 50 and 56] apply to research involving products regulated by FDA - federal funds and/or support do not need to be involved for the FDA regulations to apply. When research studies involving products regulated by FDA are funded/supported by HHS, the research institution must comply with both the HHS and FDA regulations. [A table of significant differences between 45 CFR Part 46, Subpart A and 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 (/science-research/good-clinical-practice-educational-materials/comparison-fda-and-hhs-human-subject-protection-regulations) is available on the FDA website.]\n\n6 Must an institution establish its own IRB?\n\nNo. Although institutions engaged in research involving human subjects will usually have their own IRBs to oversee research conducted within the institution or by the staff of the institution, FDA regulations permit an institution without an IRB to arrange for an \"outside\" IRB to be responsible for initial and continuing review of studies conducted at the non-IRB institution. Such arrangements should be documented in writing. Individuals conducting research in a non-institutional setting often use established IRBs (independent or institutional) rather than form their own IRBs. Also see the information sheets entitled \"Non-local IRB Review\" and \"Cooperative Research.\"\n\n7 May a hospital IRB review a study that will be conducted outside of the hospital?\n\nYes. IRBs may agree to review research from affiliated or unaffiliated investigators, however, FDA does not require IRBs to assume this responsibility. If the IRB routinely conducts these reviews, the IRB policies should authorize such reviews and the process should be described in the IRB's written procedures. A hospital IRB may review outside studies on an individual basis when the minutes clearly show the members are aware of where the study is to be conducted and when the IRB possesses appropriate knowledge about the study site(s).\n\n8 May IRB members be paid for their services?\n\nThe FDA regulations do not preclude a member from being compensated for services rendered. Payment to IRB members should not be related to or dependent upon a favorable decision. Expenses, such as travel costs, may also be reimbursed.\n\n9 What is the FDA role in IRB liability in malpractice suits?\n\nFDA regulations do not address the question of IRB or institutional liability in the case of malpractice suits. FDA does not have authority to limit liability of IRBs or their members. Compliance with FDA regulations may help minimize an IRB's exposure to liability.\nThe fundamental purpose of IRB review of informed consent is to assure that the rights and welfare of subjects are protected. A signed informed consent document is evidence that the document has been provided to a prospective subject (and presumably, explained) and that the subject has agreed to participate in the research. IRB review of informed consent documents also ensures that the institution has complied with applicable regulations.\n\n11. Does an IRB or institution have to compensate subjects if injury occurs as a result of participation in a research study?\n\nInstitutional policy, not FDA regulation, determines whether compensation and medical treatment(s) will be offered and the conditions that might be placed on subject eligibility for compensation or treatment(s). The FDA informed consent regulation on compensation [21] CFR 50.25(a)(6)] requires that, for research involving more than minimal risk, the subject must be told whether any compensation and any medical treatment(s) are available if injury occurs and, if so, what they are, or where further information may be obtained. Any statement that compensation is not offered must avoid waiving or appearing to waive any of the subject's rights or releasing or appearing to release the investigator, sponsor, or institution from liability for negligence [21] CFR 50.20].\n\nII IRB Membership\n\n12. May a clinical investigator be an IRB member?\n\nYes, however, the IRB regulations [21] CFR 56.107(e)] prohibit any member from participating in the IRB's initial or continuing review of any study in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB. When selecting IRB members, the potential for conflicts of interest should be considered. When members frequently have conflicts and must absent themselves from deliberation and abstain from voting, their contributions to the group review process may be diminished and could hinder the review procedure. Even greater disruptions may result if this person is chairperson of the IRB.\n\n13. The IRB regulations require an IRB to have a diverse membership. May one member satisfy more than one membership category?\n\nYes. For example, one member could be otherwise unaffiliated with the institution and have a primary concern in a non-scientific area. This individual would satisfy two of the membership requirements of the regulations. IRBs should strive, however, for a membership that has a diversity of representative capacities and disciplines. In fact, the FDA regulations [21] CFR 56.107(a)] require that, as part of being qualified as an IRB, the IRB must have \"... diversity of members, including consideration of race, gender, cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes....\"\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.8198288083076477", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: In response to stakeholder inquiries, we are clarifying that the provisions of the 2018 Requirements related to the content, organization, and presentation of information included in the consent form and process as well as the basic and additional elements of informed consent are not inconsistent with FDA's current policies and guidances. This may avoid the need for sponsors or investigators to develop, and IRBs to review, two separate informed consent forms. See Appendix for a subset of the new informed consent provisions from the 2018 Requirements.\n\n4 Expedited Review Procedures and List\n\nFDA's regulation at 21 CFR 56.110 sets forth expedited IRB review procedures for certain kinds of research involving no more than minimal risk. Section 56.110(a) describes a list of categories of research that may be reviewed by an IRB through an expedited review procedure that may be established through a Federal Register Notice. FDA established and published this list in the Federal Register on November 9, 1998 (the 1998 list).8 Section 56.110(b) makes clear that, as appropriate, IRB \"reviewer(s)\" must find that the research on the list involves no more than minimal risk in order for the IRB to use the expedited review procedure.\n\nFootnote 8: 63 FR 60353, November 9, 1998; https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1998-11-09/pdf/98-29748.pdf.\n\nFDA recognizes that under the 2018 Requirements at 45 CFR 46.110(b), an IRB may use the expedited procedures for research appearing on the expedited review list, unless the IRB reviewer determines that the study involves more than minimal risk. Because FDA has not revised its regulations, IRBs must continue to comply with FDA's regulation at 21 CFR 56.110(b) and use the 1998 list for FDA-regulated clinical investigations, including those that are subject to both HHS and FDA regulations.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nV IRB Continuing Review\n\nThe 2018 Requirements eliminated the requirement to conduct continuing review in certain circumstances (see 45 CFR 46.109(f)(1)). Under 45 CFR 46.109(f)(1)(i) and (iii), continuing review will not be required for research that is either eligible for expedited review in accordance with 45 CFR 46.110, or for research that has progressed to the point that the only remaining activities are data analysis, and/or accessing follow-up clinical data from procedures that subjects would undergo as part of clinical care, unless the IRB determines otherwise.\n\nBecause FDA has not revised its regulations, IRBs must continue to comply with our current requirements for IRB continuing review at 21 CFR 56.109(f), including for clinical investigations that are subject to both HHS and FDA jurisdiction. IRBs are required to conduct continuing review of research at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once per year (21 CFR 56.109(f)).9\n\nFootnote 9: For further information, see FDA\u2019s \u201cGuidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors; IRB Continuing Review after Clinical Investigation Approval,\u201d (February 2012),\n\n(https://www.fda.gov/downloads/regulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm294558.pdf).\n\nVI Further Clarification\n\nFDA is actively working to harmonize its human subject protection regulations consistent with the Cures Act. We recognize there may be questions regarding the application of other provisions of the 2018 Requirements to FDA-regulated clinical investigations during this interim period. Questions and/or comments requesting further clarification may be submitted at any time to the public docket for this guidance, and FDA will consider issuing additional guidance, if necessary, to address other provisions.\n\nAppendix: Selected Informed Consent provisions from the 2018 requirements\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\nThe 2018 Requirements contain new general requirements for informed consent related to the content, organization, and presentation of information in the consent form and process to facilitate a prospective subject's decision about whether to participate in the research.\n\nThe provisions which are new or include new information are as follows:\n\n46.116(a)(4) The prospective subject or the legally authorized representative must be provided with the information that a reasonable person would want to have in order to make an informed decision about whether to participate, and an opportunity to discuss that information.\n\n46.116(a)(5)(i) Informed consent must begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a prospective subject or legally authorized representative in understanding the reasons why one might or might not want to participate in the research. This part of the informed consent must be organized and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension.\n\n46.116(a)(5)(ii) Informed consent as a whole must present information in sufficient detail relating to the research, and must be organized and presented in a way that does not merely provide lists of isolated facts, but rather facilitates the prospective subject's or legally authorized representative's understanding of the reasons why one might or might not want to participate.\n\n46.117(b)(2) A short form written informed consent form stating that the required elements of informed consent required by 45 CFR 46.116 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative and that the key information required by 45 CFR 46.116(a)(5)(i) was presented first to the subject, before other information, if any, was provided.\n\nBasic and Additional Elements of Informed Consent\n\nThe 2018 Requirements contain a new basic element and three additional elements of informed consent, as follows:Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNew Basic Element at 45 CFR 46.116(b)(9)\n\nOne of the following statements about any research that involves the collection of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecicmens:10\n\nFootnote 10: Private information includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information that has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and that the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (e.g., a medical record). (45 CFR 46.102(e)(4)).\n\n(i) A statement that identifiers might be removed from the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecicmens and that, after such removal, the information or biospecicmens could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without additional informed consent from the subject or the legally authorized representative, if this might be a possibility; or (ii) A statement that the subject's information or biospecicmens collected as part of the research, even if identifiers are removed, will not be used or distributed for future research studies.\n\nNew Additional Elements at 45 CFR 46.116(c)(7) - (9)\n\n46.116(c)(7) A statement that the subject's biospecicmens (even if identifiers are removed) may be used for commercial profit and whether the subject will or will not share in this commercial profit; 46.116(c)(8) A statement regarding whether clinically relevant research results, including individual research results, will be disclosed to subjects, and if so, under what conditions; and 46.116(c)(9) For research involving biospecicmens, whether the research will (if known) or might include whole genome sequencing (i.e., sequencing of a human germline or somatic specimen with the intent to generate the genome or exome sequence of that specimen).\n--------------------\nContext title: Impact of Certain Provisions of the Revised Common Rule on FDA-Regulated Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Investigators, and Institutional Review Boards\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.6604769229888916", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: of investigations or a particular investigation.\n\n4. Inspections (21 CFR 812.145)\n\nInvestigators are required to permit FDA to inspect and copy any records pertaining to the investigation including, in certain situations, those which identify subjects.\n\n5. Submitting Reports (21 CFR 812.150)\n\nAn investigator shall prepare and submit the following complete, accurate, and timely reports:\n\na. To the sponsor and the IRB:\n\n(1) Any unanticipated adverse device effect occurring during an\n\ninvestigation. (Due no later than 10 working days after the investigator first learns of the effect.)\n\n(2) Progress reports on the investigation. (These reports must be provided at regular intervals, but in no event\n\nless often than yearly. If there is a study monitor, a copy of the report should also be sent to the monitor.)(3) Any deviation from the investigational plan made to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency. (Report is due as soon as possible but no later than 5 working days after the emergency occurs. Except in emergency situations, a protocol deviation requires prior sponsor approval; and if the deviation may affect the scientific soundness of the plan or the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects, prior FDA and IRB approval are required.)\n\n(4) Any use of the device without obtaining informed consent. (Due within 5 working days after such use.)\n\n(5) A final report. (Due within 3 months following termination or completion of the investigation or the investigator's part of the investigation. For additional guidance, see the discussion under the section entitled \"Annual Progress Reports and Final Reports.\")\n\n(6) Any further information requested by FDA or the IRB about any aspect of the investigation.\n\nb. To the Sponsor:\n\n(1) Withdrawal of IRB approval of the investigator's part of an investigation. (Due within 5 working days of such action).\n\n6. Investigational Device Distribution and Tracking\n\nThe IDE regulations prohibit an investigator from providing an investigational device to any person not authorized to receive it (21 CFR 812.110(c)). The best strategy for reducing the risk that an investigational device could be improperly dispensed (whether purposely or inadvertently) is for the sponsor and the investigators to closely monitor the shipping, use, and final disposal of the device(s). Upon completion or termination of a clinical investigation (or the investigator's part of an investigation), or at the sponsor's request, an investigator is required to return to the sponsor any remaining supply of the device or otherwise to dispose of the device as the sponsor directs (21 CFR 812.110(e)). Investigators must also maintain complete, current and accurate records of the receipt, use, or disposition of investigational devices (21 CFR 812.140(a)(2)). Specific investigator recordkeeping requirements are set forth at 21 CFR 812.140(a).\n\n7. Prohibition of Promotion and Other Practices (21 CFR 812.7)\n\nThe IDE regulations prohibit the promotion and commercialization of a device that has not been first cleared or approved for marketing by FDA. This prohibition is applicable to sponsors and investigators (or any person acting on behalf of a sponsor or investigator), and encompasses the following activities:\n\na. Promotion or test marketing of the investigational device\n\nb. Charging subjects or investigators for the device a price larger than is necessary to recover the costs of manufacture, research, development, and handling c. Unduly prolonging an investigation beyond the point needed to collect data required to determine whether the device is safe and effective, and d. Representing that the device is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is being investigated.\n8. Annual Progress Reports and Final Reports\n\nThe IDE regulations do not specify the content of the annual progress or final reports. With respect to reports to the IRB, the IRB itself may specify what information it wishes to be included in these reports. Because FDA does require the information listed below, it is suggested that, at a minimum, the annual progress and final reports to the sponsor and the IRB also include the following items:\n\na. IDE number\n\nb. Device name\n\nc. Indications for use\n\nd. Brief summary of study progress in relation to investigational plan\n\ne. Number of investigators and investigational sites\n\nf. Number of subjects enrolled\n\ng. Number of devices received, used, and the final disposition of unused devices\n\nh. Brief summary of results and conclusions\n\ni. Summary of anticipated and unanticipated adverse device effects\n\nj. Description of any deviations from investigational plan\n\nk. Reprints of any articles published by the investigator in relation to the study\n\nAppendix 5 Suggested Format for IDE Final Report\n\n1. The Basics\n\na. IDE Number\n\nb. Device name and indication for use\n\nc. Sponsor's name, address and phone number\n\nd. Contact person\n\n2. Study Progress\n\n(Data from beginning of the study should be reported, unless otherwise indicated.)\n\na. Brief summary of study progress in relation to investigational plan\n\nb. Number of investigators/investigational sites (attach list of investigators)\n\nc. Number of subjects enrolled (by indication or model)\n\nd. Number of devices shipped\n\ne.

Description of any deviations from the investigational plan by investigators (since last progress report)\n\n3. Risk Analysis\n\na. Summary of any new adverse information (since last progress report) that may affect the risk analysis; this includes preclinical data, animal studies, foreign data, clinical studies, etc.\n\nb. Reprints of any articles published from data collected from this study\n\n4. Other Changes\n\na. Summary of any changes in manufacturing practices and quality control\n\n(including changes not reported in a supplemental application)\n\nb. Summary of all changes in investigational plan not required to be submitted in a supplemental application\n\n5. Marketing Application or Future Plans\n\na. Progress toward product approval, with date (or projected date) of PMA or 510(k) submission; or indication that marketing of device is not planned.\n\nb. Any plans to submit another IDE application for this device or a modification of this device.\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.7427797317504883", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expedited review?\n--------------------\nContext: [See Conditions for IRB Use of Expedited Review - Federal Register: November 9, 1998 (Volume 63, Number 216), Notices (/about-fda/page-not-found)]\n\n21. The number of studies we review has increased, and the size of the package of review materials we send to IRB members is becoming formidable. Must we send the full package to all IRB members?\n\nThe IRB system was designed to foster open discussion and debate at convened meetings of the full IRB membership. While it is preferable for every IRB member to have personal copies of all study materials, each member must be provided with sufficient information to be able to actively and constructively participate. Some institutions have developed a \"primary reviewer\" system to promote a thorough review. Under this system, studies are assigned to one or more IRB members for a full review of all materials. Then, at the convened IRB meeting the study is presented by the primary reviewer(s) and, after discussion by IRB members, a vote for an action is taken.\n\nThe \"primary reviewer\" procedure is acceptable to the FDA if each member receives, at a minimum; a copy of consent documents and a summary of the protocol in sufficient detail to determine the appropriateness of the study-specific statements in the consent documents. In addition, the complete documentation should be available to all members for their review, both before and at the meeting. The materials for review should be received by the membership sufficiently in advance of the meeting to allow for adequate review of the materials.\n\nSome IRBs are also exploring the use of electronic submissions and computer access for IRB members. Whatever system the IRB develops and uses, it must ensure that each study receives an adequate review and that the rights and welfare of the subjects are protected.\n\n22. Are sponsors allowed access to IRB written procedures, minutes and membership rosters?\n\nThe FDA regulations do not require public or sponsor access to IRB records. However, FDA does not prohibit the sponsor from requesting IRB records. The IRB and the institution may establish a policy on whether minutes or a pertinent portion of the minutes are provided to sponsors.\n\nBecause of variability, each IRB also needs to be aware of State and local laws regarding access to IRB records.\n\nMust an investigator's brochure be included in the documentation when an IRB reviews an investigational drug study?\n\nFor studies conducted under an investigational new drug application, an investigator's brochure is usually required by FDA [21 CFR 312.23(a)(5) and 312-55]. Even though 21 CFR part 56 does not mention the investigator's brochure by name, much of the information contained in such brochures is clearly required to be reviewed by the IRB. The regulations do outline the criteria for IRB approval of research. 21 CFR 56.111(a)(1) requires the IRB to assure that risks to the subjects are minimized. 21 CFR 56.111(a)(2) requires the IRB to assure that the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits. The risks cannot be adequately evaluated without review of the results of previous animal and human studies, which are summarized in the investigator's brochure.\n\nThere is no specific regulatory requirement that the Investigator's Brochure be submitted to the IRB. There are regulatory requirements for submission of information which normally is included in the Investigator's Brochure. It is common that the Investigator's Brochure is submitted to the IRB, and the IRB may establish written procedures which require its submission. Investigator's Brochures may be part of the investigational plan that the IRB reviews when reviewing medical device studies.\n\nTo what extent is the IRB expected to actively audit and monitor the performance of the investigator with respect to human subject protection issues?\n\nFDA does not expect IRBs to routinely observe consent interviews, observe the conduct of the study or review study records. However, 21 CFR 56.109(f) gives the IRB the authority to observe, or have a third party observe, the consent process and the research. When and if the IRB is concerned about the conduct of the study or the process for obtaining consent, the IRB may consider whether, as part of providing adequate oversight of the study, an active audit is warranted.\n\nHow can a sponsor know whether an IRB has been inspected by FDA, and the results of the inspection?\n\nThe Division of Scientific Investigations, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, maintains an inventory of the IRBs that have been inspected, including dates of inspection and classification. The Division recently began including the results of inspections assigned by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. This information is available through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) procedures. Once an investigational file has been closed, the correspondence between FDA and the IRB and the narrative inspectional report are also available under FOI.\n\nIf an IRB disapproves a study submitted to it, and it is subsequently sent to another IRB for review, should the second IRB be told of the disapproval? Yes. When an IRB disapproves a study, it must provide a written statement of the reasons for its decision to the investigator and the institution [21 CFR 56.109(e)]. If the study is submitted to a second IRB, a copy of this written statement should be included with the study documentation so that it can make an informed decision about the study. 21 CFR 56.109(a) requires an IRB to \"... review... all research activities [emphasis added]...\" The FDA regulations do not prohibit submission of a study to another IRB following disapproval. However, all pertinent information about the study should be provided to the second IRB. 27. May an independent IRB review a study to be conducted in an institution with an IRB? Generally, no. Most institutional IRB have jurisdiction over all studies conducted within that institution. An independent IRB may become the IRB of record for such studies only upon written agreement with the administration of the institution or the in-house IRB. 28. Could an IRB lose its quorum when members with a conflict of interest leave the room for deliberation and voting on a study? Yes. \"The quorum is the count of the number of members present. If the number present falls below a majority, the quorum fails. The regulations only require that a member who is conflicted not participate in the deliberations and voting on a study on which he or she is conflicted. The IRB may decide whether an individual should remain in the room.\" 29. Does FDA expect the IRB chair to sign the approval letters? FDA does not specify the procedure that IRBs must use regarding signature of the IRB approval letter. The written operating procedures for the IRB should outline the procedure that is followed. 30. Does FDA prohibit direct communication between sponsors and IRBs? It is important that a formal line of communication be established between the clinical investigator and the IRB. Clinical investigators should report adverse events directly to the responsible IRB, and should send progress reports directly to that IRB. However, FDA does not prohibit direct communication between the sponsor and the IRB, and recognizes that doing so could result in more efficient resolution of some problems. FDA does require direct communication between the sponsors and the IRBs for certain studies of medical devices and when the 21 CFR 50.24 informed consent waiver has been invoked. Sponsors and IRBs are required to communicate directly for medical device studies under 21 CFR 812.2, 812.66 and 812.150(b). For informed consent waiver studies, direct communication between sponsors and IRBs is required under 21 CFR 50.24(e), 56.109(e), 56.109(g), 56.109(g), 312.54(b), 312.130(d), 812.38(b)(4) and 812.47(b).\n\nIV IRB Records\n\n31. Are annual IRB reviews required when all studies are reviewed by the IRB each quarter?\n\nThe IRB records for each study's initial and continuing review should note the frequency (not to exceed one year) for the next continuing review in either months or other conditions, such as after a particular number of subjects are enrolled.\n\nAn IRB may decide, to review all studies on a quarterly basis. If every quarterly report contains sufficient information for an adequate continuing review and is reviewed by the IRB under procedures that meet FDA requirements for continuing review, FDA would not require an additional \"annual\" review.\n\n21 CFR 56.115(a)(1) requires that the IRB maintain copies of \"research proposals reviewed.\" Is the \"research proposal\" the same as the formal study protocol that the investigator receives from the sponsor of the research?\n\nYes. The IRB should receive and review all research activities [21 CFR 56.109(a)]. The documents reviewed should include the complete documents received from the clinical investigator, such as the protocol, the investigator's brochure, a sample consent document and any advertising intended to be seen or heard by prospective study subjects. Some IRBs also require the investigator to submit an institutionally-developed protocol summary form. A copy of all documentation reviewed is to be maintained for at least three years after completion of the research at that institution [21 CFR 56.115(b)]. However, when the IRB makes changes, such as in the wording of the informed consent document, only the finally approved copy needs to be retained in the IRB records.\n\n33. What IRB records are required for studies that are approved but never started?\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.598827838897705"], "Delving into Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications , Are raw agricultural commodities, such as fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state, subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications , Are raw agricultural commodities, such as fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state, subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n--------------------\nContext: For a list of petition and notification requests, see Inventory of Petitions Received under 21 U.S.C. 343(w)(6) for Exemptions from Food Allergen Labeling and Inventory of Notifications Received under 21 U.S.C. 343(w)(7) for Exemptions from Food Allergen Labeling.\n\nIs there a penalty for failure to comply with the food allergen labeling requirements under section 403(w) of the FD&C Act?\n\nYes. FDA can carry out a number of regulatory actions if a food label fails to comply with the food allergen labeling requirements under the FD&C Act. Such products are misbranded and subject to enforcement actions such as recalls, import refusal, and seizure by FDA. Food facilities making such food may be issued warning letters or put on FDA's import alerts. When there is a problem that justifies a recall, firms generally recall such food products from the marketplace voluntarily.\n\nAppendix B Types of Foods That Fall Under the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the FD&C Act\n\nWhat types of foods do the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act apply to?\n\nAll packaged foods, including dietary supplements, in the United States or its territories and subject to FDA regulations, that are domestically manufactured or imported into the United States, are covered by the allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act (except most meat, poultry, catfish, and certain processed egg products2).

The FD&C Act requires that the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived be declared on the label as follows:\n\nMilk\n\nEgg\n\nThe specific species of fish (e.g., bass, flounder, tilapia, salmon or cod)\n\nThe specific species of Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, or shrimp)\n\nThe specific type of tree nut (e.g., almond, pecans, or walnuts)\n\nWheat\n\nPeanuts\n\nSoybeans\n\nSesame (effective date January 1, 2023)\n\nSee the draft guidance \"Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergens and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).\"\n\nDo the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act provide any specific direction for declaring the presence of ingredients from the three food groups that are designated as major food allergens (i.e., tree nuts, fish, and Crustacean shellfish)?\n\nYes. Section 403(w) of the FD&C Act requires that the specific type of tree nut be declared (e.g., almonds, pecans, or walnuts). It also requires that the species must be declared for fish (e.g., bass, flounder, or cod) and Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, or shrimp) (section 403(w)(2) of the FD&C Act). This means the ingredient list or the \"Contains\" statement cannot broadly declare \"tree nuts,\" \"fish,\" or \"Crustacean shellfish\" as the major food allergen.\n\nFor the purposes of the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act, what is the \"species\" of fish or Crustacean shellfish?For the ingredient list, manufacturers should declare the acceptable market name or the common name provided in FDA's Seafood List as the \"species\" of fish or Crustacean shellfish. Both names may alternatively be used as the statement of identity. However, for the \"Contains\" statement, in addition to one of these names being used, manufacturers may use the generic name, e.g., Salmon for Chum Salmon or Flounder for Peacock or Tropical Flounder. FDA's Seafood List of acceptable market names for imported and domestically available seafood is available at https://www.cfsanappsexternal.fda.gov/scripts/fdcc/?set=SeafoodList\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance \"Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).\"\n\nFor the purposes of complying with the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act, what is \"wheat\"?\n\nIs it acceptable to use a singular term to satisfy the food allergen labeling requirements if the FD&C Act identifies a major food allergen using a plural term?\n\nYes. FDA considers it acceptable to use a singular term even if the FD&C Act identifies the major food allergen using a plural term. For example, it is acceptable to use \"peanut\" rather than \"peanuts\" or \"almond, pecan, or walnut\" rather than \"almonds, pecans, or walnuts,\" respectively.\n\nAre there synonyms for the common or usual name \"soybeans\" for the purpose of satisfying the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act in some circumstances?\n\nYes. \"Soybean,\" \"soy,\" and \"soya\" are reasonable synonyms for the common or usual name \"soybeans,\" and any one of these terms may be used to identify the food source of the major food allergen \"soybeans\" as appropriate.\n\nAppendix D The Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the FD&C Act\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance \"Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).\"Are single ingredient foods required to comply with the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n\nYes. Single ingredient foods must comply with the food allergen labeling requirements in section 403(w)(1) of the FD&C Act. A single ingredient food that is, or contains, protein derived from milk, egg, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, or soybeans, may identify the food source in the Statement of Identity, i.e., name of the food (e.g., \"All-purpose wheat flour\"), or use the \"Contains\" statement format. Because a single-ingredient food does not require an ingredient list, FDA recommends that if a \"Contains\" statement format is used for a retail package, the statement be placed immediately above the manufacturer, packer, or distributor statement. For single ingredient foods intended for further manufacturing where the \"Contains\" statement format is used, we recommend that the Contains statement be placed on the front of the package of the food near the statement of identity.

The use of the word should in FDA guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. Statutory Authority\n\nThe Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA) (Title II of Public Law 108-282) amended the FD&C Act by defining the term \"major food allergen\" and stating that foods regulated under the FD&C Act are misbranded unless they declare the presence of each major food allergen on the product label using the common or usual name of that major food allergen. Section 201(qq) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(qq)) now defines a major food allergen as \"[m]ilk, egg, fish (e.g., bass, flounder, or cod), Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, or shrimp), tree nuts (e.g., almonds, pecans, or walnuts), wheat, peanuts, and soybeans\" and also as a food ingredient that contains protein derived from these foods. The definition excludes any highly refined oil derived from a major food allergen and any ingredient derived from such highly refined oil.\n\nIn some cases, the production of an ingredient derived from a major food allergen may alter or eliminate the allergenic proteins in that derived ingredient to such an extent that it does not contain allergenic protein. In addition, a major food allergen may be used as an ingredient or as a component of an ingredient such that the level of allergenic protein in finished food products does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health. Therefore, FALCPA provides two mechanisms through which such ingredients may become exempt from the labeling requirement of section 403(w)(1) of the FD&C Act. An ingredient may obtain an exemption through submission and approval of a petition containing scientific evidence that demonstrates that the ingredient \"does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health\" (section 403(w)(6) of the FD&C Act). This section also states that \"the burden shall be on the petitioner to provide scientific evidence (including the analytical method used to produce the evidence) that demonstrates that such food ingredient, as derived by the method specified in the petition, does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health.\" Alternately, an ingredient may become exempt through submission of a notification containing scientific evidence showing that the ingredient \"does not contain allergenic protein\" or that there has been a previous determination through a premarket approval process under section 409 of the FD&C Act that the ingredient \"does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health\" (section 403(w)(7) of the FD&C Act).\n\nTo evaluate these petitions and notifications, we will consider scientific evidence that describes:\n\nThe identity or composition of the ingredient;\n\nThe methods used to produce the ingredient;\n\nThe methods used to characterize the ingredient;\n\nThe intended use of the ingredient in food; and\n\nFor a petition, data and information, including the expected level of consumer exposure to the ingredient, that demonstrate that the ingredient when manufactured and used as described does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health; or 5b. For a notification, data and information that demonstrate that the ingredient when manufactured as described does not contain allergenic protein, or documentation of a previous determination under a process pursuant to section 409 of the FD&C Act that the ingredient does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health.\n\nWe will evaluate this scientific evidence only for the specific ingredient and specific use(s) identified in the submission.\n\nFDA recognizes that there are several methods that can be used to demonstrate that an ingredient meets the standards in 403(w)(6) and 403(w)(7) of the FD&C Act. Each submitter may determine which approach is most appropriate for the specific ingredient and specific use(s) identified in the submission.\n\n3 Recommendations for Preparing Submissions\n\nDetermining Need for Submission\n\nThe following points should be considered in determining whether to submit a petition or notification:\n\nAn ingredient derived from a major food allergen that does not contain protein is not subject to the labeling requirements described in section 403(w)(1) of the FD&C Act. We are aware that there are some technologies (e.g., distillation) that may be able to produce protein-free ingredients because of the nature of the process and fundamental biochemical properties of proteins, peptides, and amino acids. When other technologies are used to produce an ingredient, information and expertise available to the manufacturer should make it possible to identify and apply the appropriate analytic methods to ensure that the ingredient does not contain protein. The methods used should be shown to be sufficiently accurate and sensitive under the conditions of use, including consideration of extraction efficiencies and possible interferences, should be scientifically appropriate, and sufficiently sensitive to demonstrate that no proteins or peptide fragments are present in the ingredient. Manufacturers should also consider potential batch to batch variation in the composition of the ingredient. Manufacturers may discuss methodological issues with us.\n\nA petition should be used to demonstrate that an ingredient derived from a major food allergen that may contain allergenic proteins, or derivatives of allergenic proteins such as peptide fragments, does not cause an allergic response that poses a risk to human health in food allergic individuals.\n\nA notification should be used to demonstrate that an ingredient that may contain proteins or protein fragments derived from a major food allergen does not contain allergenic protein.\n\nGeneral\n\nEach submission should contain information identifying the organization and individual primarily responsible for the submission. This should include the name of the individual and organization, a complete mailing address, a physical address if this differs from the mailing address, phone and fax numbers, and an electronic mail (email) address for the organization and for a primary contact. A joint submission from several organizations should include complete information for each organization.\n\nIngredient Description\n\nFor the purposes of this guidance document, ingredients include substances that are-\n\nDerived (e.g., through chemical, biochemical, mechanical, fermentation or bioengineering processes) from a major food allergen and that contain proteins or peptides\n\nA submission should provide a complete description of the ingredient including-\n\nBoth the common or usual name and any scientific name(s) of the ingredient;\n\nThe major food allergen source of the ingredient, if this is not obvious from the name, or the major food allergen sources used in the manufacture or engineering of the ingredient;\n\nThe chemical and biological properties or characteristics of the ingredient including molecular structure, sequence, etc., as appropriate;\n\nAny existing food standards of identity or specifications for the ingredient, such as from the FDA's food standards of identity regulations, Food Chemicals Codex, or Codex Alimentarius; and\n\nThe composition of the ingredient, including the methods used to determine composition, and batch-to-batch variation in composition should be described. If the ingredient contains more than one component, all components, including non-allergens, (including carriers or diluents), as well as the relative proportion of each in the ingredient should be described.\n\nIngredient Preparation or Manufacture\n\nThe method(s) or procedure(s) used to prepare or manufacture the ingredient should be described completely, particularly those steps that alter the amount, relative composition, or biochemical state of the proteins present. This description should include, for example-\n\nsuch as grinding, pressing, filtration;\n\nsuch as heating, cooking, baking, retorting;\n\nsuch as solvent extraction, hydrolysis (both enzymatic and non-enzymatic), cross-linking;\n\nsuch as the composition of the growth or nutrient media used in the manufacture of enzymes or organisms; and/or\n\nsuch as details of the construct, transformation event, and DNA and amino acid sequences.\n\nThe description of the manufacturing or preparation process should include-\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.886749029159546", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications , Are raw agricultural commodities, such as fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state, subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Person in Charge, the person in charge shall ensure that employees of the food establishment are properly trained in food safety, including food allergy awareness, as it relates to their assigned duties (Subparagraph 2.103.11(M)). This allows industry to develop and implement operational-specific training programs for food employees.\n\nFood Labels, label information for food that is packaged at the retail level includes the food allergen labeling provisions of the FD&C Act (Subparagraph 3-602.11(B)(5)).\n\nEquipment Food-Contact Surfaces and Utensils, cleaning and sanitizing frequency for food contact surfaces or utensils that are in contact with a raw animal food that is a major food allergen such as fish, followed by other types of raw animal foods are specified (Subparagraph 4-602.11).\n\nAdditional background information on food allergens in Annex 4, including common characteristics of a food allergic response and detailed information regarding the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act.\n\nDo the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act apply regardless of whether a jurisdiction has adopted the 2017 FDA Food Code?\n\nYes. FALCPA and the FASTER Act are federal laws that amended the FD&C Act. Thus, regardless of whether a jurisdiction has adopted the 2017 Food Code, the requirements of these laws apply to domestically manufactured or imported packaged foods regulated under the FD&C Act (see question B.1). FDA regulates all packaged foods except most meat, poultry, catfish, and certain processed egg products. These laws also preempt State and local laws, which means that other governmental entities (such as those at the state or local level) may not adopt labeling requirements that are not identical to those in section 403(w) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAppendix E Dietary Supplements\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance \"Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).\"\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance \"Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).\"\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance \"Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).\"\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance \"Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).\"\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance \"Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).\"\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance \"Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).\"\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance \"Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).\"\n\nAppendix III Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n\nThis guidance document refers to previously approved collections of information found in federal laws.

Single ingredient foods must comply with the food allergen labeling requirements in section 403(w)(1) of the FD&C Act. A single ingredient food that is, or contains, protein derived from milk, egg, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, or soybeans, may identify the food source in the Statement of Identity, i.e., name of the food (e.g., \"All-purpose wheat flour\"), or use the \"Contains\" statement format.

For example, if sodium caseinate, whey, egg yolks, and natural peanut flavor are declared in a product's ingredients list, a \"Contains\" statement appearing on the label immediately after or adjacent to that statement is to identify all three food sources of the major food allergens present (e.g., \"Contains milk, egg, peanuts\") in the same type (i.e., print or font) size as that used for the ingredient list.\n\nIs there more than one way to word a \"Contains\" statement used to declare the major food allergens in a packaged food?\n\nYes. The wording for a \"Contains\" statement may be limited to just stating the word \"Contains\" followed by the names of the food sources of all major food allergens that either are or are contained in ingredients used to make the packaged product (see section 403(w) of the FD&C Act). Alternatively, additional wording may be used for a \"Contains\" statement to more accurately describe the presence of any major food allergens, provided that the following three conditions are met (see section 403(w) of the FD&C Act):\n\nThe word \"Contains\" with a capital \"C\" is the first word used to begin a \"Contains\" statement. (The use of bolded text and punctuation within a \"Contains\" statement is optional.)\n\nThe names of the food sources of the major food allergens declared on the food label are the same as those specified in section 403(w) of the FD&C Act, except that the names of food sources may be expressed using singular terms versus plural terms (e.g., walnut versus walnuts) and the synonyms \"soy\" and \"soya\" may be substituted for soybeans.\n\nIf included on a food label, the \"Contains\" statement is to identify the names of the food sources for all major food allergens that either are in the food or are contained in ingredients of the food.\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance \"Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergens Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).\"\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance \"Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergens and Answers Regarding Food Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).\"RESERVED - See the draft guidance \"Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).\"\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance \"Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).\"\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance \"Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).\"\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance \"Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).\"\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance \"Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).\"\n\nDoes section 403(w) of the FD&C Act address the use of allergen advisory labeling (such as \"may contain\")?\n\nNo. Section 403(w) of the FD&C Act does not address the use of allergen advisory labeling, including statements describing the potential presence of unintentional allergens in food products resulting from the manufacturing of the ingredients or the preparation and packaging of the food in a retail or food service establishment. Advisory labeling, such as \"may contain [allergen],\" is not a substitute for adherence to current good manufacturing practices and, when used by a facility, food allergen preventive controls. In addition, any advisory statement such as \"may contain [allergen]\" must be truthful and not misleading.\n\nRESERVED - See the draft guidance \"Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5).\"\n\nDo retail and foodservice establishments have to comply with the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n\nThe food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act extend to foods packaged by a retail or foodservice establishment that are offered for human consumption. However, these labeling requirements do not apply to foods provided by a retail or food service establishment that are placed in a wrapper or container in response to a consumer's order, such as the paper or box used to transport a sandwich that has been prepared in response to a consumer's order.\nFDA's Food Code is a model code available for local, state, and other jurisdictions to adopt and apply to retail food establishments, including restaurants, grocery stores, supermarkets, hospitals, nursing homes, child-care centers, and temporary food establishments that provide food directly to consumers. The 2017 FDA Food Code contains provisions regarding food allergens in the model code as well as food allergen information in its annexes. The 2017 Food Code specifies the following information pertaining to food allergens:\n\nA definition of \"major food allergen,\" which is consistent with the definition in section 201(qq) of the FD&C Act (Paragraph 1-201.10(B)).\n\nDemonstration, the person in charge of a food establishment shall have an understanding of the foods identified as major food allergens and the symptoms that a major food allergen could cause in a sensitive individual (Subparagraph 2-102.11(C)(9)). This element is significant because nationally recognized certifiers train and test food managers and consult these elements when routinely upgrading training and testing programs.\n\nPerson in Charge, the person in charge shall ensure that employees of the food establishment are properly trained in food safety, including food allergy awareness, as it relates to their assigned duties (Subparagraph 2.103.11(M)). This allows industry to develop and implement operational-specific training programs for food employees.\n\nFood Labels, label information for food that is packaged at the retail level includes the food allergen labeling provisions of the FD&C Act (Subparagraph 3-602.11(B)(5)).\n\nEquipment Food-Contact Surfaces and Utensils, cleaning and sanitizing frequency for food contact surfaces or utensils that are in contact with a raw animal food that is a major food allergen such as fish, followed by other types of raw animal foods are specified (Subparagraph 4-602.11).\n\nAdditional background information on food allergens in Annex 4, including common characteristics of a food allergic response and detailed information regarding the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act.\n\nDo the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act apply regardless of whether a jurisdiction has adopted the 2017 FDA Food Code?\n\nYes. FALCPA and the FASTER Act are federal laws that amended the FD&C Act. Thus, regardless of whether a jurisdiction has adopted the 2017 Food Code, the requirements of these laws apply to domestically manufactured or imported packaged foods regulated under the FD&C Act (see question B.1). FDA regulates all packaged foods except most meat, poultry, catfish, and certain processed egg products. These laws also preempt State and local laws, which means that other governmental entities (such as those at the state or local level) may not adopt labeling requirements that are not identical to those in section 403(w) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAppendix E Dietary Supplements\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergen Labeling (Edition 5) \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.4642574787139893", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications , Are raw agricultural commodities, such as fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state, subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Q: How should I design my FSVP to provide assurances that a human food from a foreign supplier is not misbranded under section 403(w) of the FD&C Act with respect to labeling for the presence of major food allergens?\n\nA: As part of your FSVP, you should assure that the label of each human food you import complies with the labeling requirements for major food allergens. You should determine by audit, inspection, or other appropriate foreign supplier verification activity (see 21 CFR 1.506) whether the food contains a major food allergen that is not declared on the food label. Major food allergen means any of the following:\n\nMilk, egg, fish (e.g., bass, flounder, or cod), crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, or shrimp), tree nuts (e.g., almonds, pecans, or walnuts), wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame. (For sesame, its addition to the definition of major food allergen applies to \"any food that is introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce on or after January 1, 2023\" (Public Law 117-11)).\n\nA food ingredient that contains protein derived from a food specified in paragraph 1 above, except the following: 1. Any highly refined oil derived from a food specified in paragraph 1 above and any ingredient derived from such highly refined oil. 2. A food ingredient that is exempt under section 403(w)(6) and (7) of the FD&C Act (section 201(qq) of the FD&C Act).\n\nPackaged food for humans (except for RACs) that is, or contains an ingredient that bears or contains, a major food allergen must meet the label and labeling requirements set forth in section 403(w) of the FD&C Act. Under section 403(w)(1), the food is misbranded (with respect to the labeling of food allergens) unless it meets one of the following criteria:\n\nThe word \"Contains,\" followed by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, is printed immediately after or is adjacent to the list of ingredients (in a type size no smaller than the type size used in the list of ingredients) required under section 403(g) or (i); or\n\nThe common or usual name of the major food allergen in the list of ingredients required under section 403(g) or (i) is followed in parentheses by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, except that the name of the food source is not required when: (1) the common or usual name of the ingredient uses the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived; or (2) the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived appears elsewhere in the ingredient list, unless the name of the food source that appears elsewhere in the ingredient list appears as part of the name of the food ingredient that is not a major food allergen.\n\nYou can find additional information on food allergen labeling in FDA's \"Guidance for Industry:\n\nQuestions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens, including the Food Allergen Labeling and\n\nConsumer Protection Act of 2004 (Edition 4).\"\n\nThe requirement to provide assurances that a human food is not misbranded with respect to labeling for the presence of major food allergens under section 403(w) of the FD&C Act does not apply to food for animals. Therefore, if you are importing an animal food, you are not required verify that the animal food is not misbranded under section 403(w).\n\nQ: How should I design my FSVP to provide assurance that the foreign supplier did not adulterate a human food under section 402 of the FD&C Act due to cross-contact with a major food allergen?\n\nA: The presence of a major food allergen in a human food due to allergen cross-contact is a chemical hazard (21 CFR 117.130(b)(1)(ii)). Cross-contact can occur either between foods of different allergen profiles (e.g., foods that contain different food allergens or foods with and without food allergens). Introduction of an allergen through cross-contact may occur under various conditions, including during receiving, handling, processing and storage of ingredients and foods, utensils, and packaging; through improper handling and cleaning of equipment, utensils, and facilities; and through improper facility design. Your FSVP should be designed to determine by audit, inspection, or other appropriate foreign supplier verification activity whether your foreign supplier is controlling the potential for allergen cross-contact through processes and procedures such as:\n\nAppropriately scheduling the production of products so that there is no cross-contact between foods of different allergen profiles.\n\nAdequately cleaning between two different formulations of food of different allergen profiles.\n\nStoring allergen-containing ingredients separately from ingredients that do not contain the same allergen profile, especially where leakage of allergen-containing materials could lead to cross-contact.\n\nHandling powdered allergens in a way that prevents particles from blowing onto foods or food-contact surfaces for foods that have different allergen profiles.\n\n(See draft \"Food Hazards Guide\" (Chapter 3, 3.4.2.1.4 Undeclared food allergen hazards due to allergen cross-contact))\n\n2 Low-Acid Canned Food\n\nQ: How does the FSVP regulation apply to a low-acid canned food?\n\nA: For a thermally processed low-acid food packaged in a hermetically sealed container (low-acid canned food or LACF) that you import, you are not required to meet FSVP requirements for microbiological hazards that are controlled by 21 CFR part 113. That means, for example, that you are not required to address microbiological hazards that are controlled by 21 CFR part 113 in your hazard analysis. However, you must verify and document that your foreign supplier is producing the food in accordance with the LACF regulation in 21 CFR part 113 (see 21 CFR 1.502(b)(1)). The LACF regulation is designed to ensure control of microbiological hazards in an LACF.\n\nFor hazards in an LACF other than the microbiological hazards that are controlled by the low-acid canned food regulation (i.e., chemical and physical hazards), you must develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP in accordance with 21 CFR 1.502(a).\n\nIn addition, you are not required to comply with the FSVP requirements with respect to microbiological hazards in raw materials or other ingredients that you import and use in the manufacturing or processing of an LACF, provided that you comply with the LACF regulation for the food that you manufacture or process from the imported raw materials or other ingredients (21 CFR 1.502(b)(2)). With respect to other hazards in such raw materials or other ingredients, you must have an FSVP.\n\nAn appropriate verification activity to determine that your foreign supplier is producing an LACF in compliance with the LACF regulation may be that you conduct an onsite audit or review and assess the results of an onsite audit or inspection conducted by another entity. Alternatively, for each entry of an LACF, you might conclude that, instead of an onsite audit, it is appropriate to review the scheduled process and the processing and production records required under the LACF regulation and verify the integrity of the containers (e.g., cans are not swollen or leaking).\n\nChemical and physical hazards are not controlled under the LACF regulation. For chemical and physical hazards requiring a control, a verification activity (e.g., onsite audit or sampling and testing) would be required as part of your FSVP (see 21 CFR 1.506(d)). You may verify control of all hazards you identify as requiring a control, including non-microbiological hazards, during a single onsite audit or inspection of the LACF facility, instead of conducting separate activities to verify control of the non-microbiological hazards and compliance with the LACF regulation.\n\nFor more information on application of the FSVP regulation and other FSMA regulations to LACF and raw materials or other ingredients used in manufacturing or processing LACF, see FDA's guidance \"Low-Acid Foods Packaged in Hermetrically Sealed Containers (LACF) Regulation and the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act.\"\n\n3 Importers That Also Are Receiving Facilities Under the Preventive Controls Regulations\n\nQ: What is a \"receiving facility\"?\n\nA: A receiving facility is a facility that is subject to the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements and the supply-chain program requirements of 21 CFR part 117 or 507 and that manufactures/processes a raw material or other ingredient that it receives from a supplier(21 CFR 117.3 and 507.3). (A \"facility\" is a domestic facility or a foreign facility that is required to register under section 415 of the FD&C Act in accordance with the registration requirements of 21 CFR part 1, subpart H.)\n\nQ: Do I have to comply with all FSVP requirements if I am a receiving facility for a food I import?\n\nA: Although you must identify yourself as the FSVP importer at entry (21 CFR 1.509), you are deemed to be in compliance with the other FSVP requirements for a food you import if you are a receiving facility and you are in compliance with any of the following requirements with respect to the food:\n\nYou have implemented preventive controls for the hazards in the food in accordance with 21 CFR 117.135 or 507.34; or\n\nYou are not required to implement a preventive control under 21 CFR 117.136 or 507.36 with respect to the food; or\n\nYou are in compliance with the supply-chain program requirements of the preventive controls for human food regulation (21 CFR part 117, subpart G) or preventive controls for animal food regulation (21 CFR part 507, subpart E) (see 21 CFR 1.502(c)).\n\nFSVP requirements and examples for each of these categories of receiving facility are:\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Foreign Supplier Verification Programs for Importers of Food for Humans and Animals\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.336117148399353", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Guidance for Industry- Food Allergen Labeling Exemption Petitions and Notifications , Are raw agricultural commodities, such as fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state, subject to the food allergen labeling requirements of the FD&C Act?\n--------------------\nContext: Appendix D Allergen Statement\n\nSection 403(w) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 343(w)) requires that major food allergens be identified on the label. Generally, major food allergens must be identified either in a statement beginning with the word \"Contains\" or by common or usual name of the allergen as part of the list of ingredients (section 403(w)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 343(w)(1)). Section 201(qq) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(qq)) defines \"major food allergen\" to include nine types of foods, including milk and soybeans, and also extends the definition of \"major food allergen\" (subject to exceptions) to food ingredients that contain protein derived from one of the nine types of foods (including milk and soybeans).\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nInfant formulas, like other foods, must also declare the name of the source of the major food allergen if a food ingredient contains protein derived from one of the nine foods, unless an exception applies (see section 201(qq)(2) of the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 321(qq)(2)).11 Therefore, if your infant formula contains one of the major food allergens (e.g., milk or soybeans), then your food must identify the source of the ingredient either in the ingredient list or in a \"Contains\" statement. For example, if your infant formula contains enzymatically hydrolyzed whey protein isolate, then under section 403(w)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 343(w)(1)(A)), you must either declare the source in the ingredient statement, i.e., \"enzymatically hydrolyzed whey protein isolate (milk),\" or in a Contains statement, i.e., \"Contains milk.\" Similarly, if your infant formula is a soybean-based formula or contains an ingredient with protein derived from soybeans, you must declare \"soybeans\" (\"soy\" and \"soya\" are reasonable synonyms) by one of the methods described above.\n\nFootnote 11: Under section 201(qq)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(qq)(2)), the term \u201cmajor food allergen\u201d means a food ingredient that contains protein derived from one of nine foods\u2014milk, egg, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame\u2014but it excepts \u201cany highly refined oil derived from [these nine foods] and any ingredient derived from such highly refined oil,\u201d and a food ingredient that is exempt pursuant to the exemption processes at section 403(w)(6) or (w)(7) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 343(w)(6) or (w)(7)).\n\nDocument History\n\nFirst edition of guidance was issued.\n\nSecond edition. The guidance was updated to include sesame as a major food allergen.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Labeling of Infant Formula \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.7519988417625427"], "After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Yes, with two exceptions. The first is that the FDA requirements for IRBs under 21 CFR Part 56 are slightly different with respect to membership and function. To address this issue, as described in #12 above, FDA can provide a specific waiver from the Part 56 IRB requirements, allowing an IEC that complies with good clinical practice to substitute for the IRB.4 The second exception is that the requirements for informed consent under 21 CFR Part 50 for particular clinical trials (e.g., emergency research under 21 CFR 50.24, clinical investigations involving pediatric subjects under Subpart D) are more extensive with respect to IRB responsibilities. Because these types of trials are uncommon, our experience has not revealed that this has caused a conflict; but in the event of one, we would be willing to discuss a resolution with the sponsor on a case-by-case basis. If the investigator or sponsor believes that there are other conflicting requirements, the sponsor may request a waiver from FDA from the specific requirement under 21 CFR 312.10.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n14.  Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n\nNo. A multinational study may include domestic sites under the IND and foreign sites not under the IND.  Investigation drug and biologics studies conducted in the U.S. must be conducted in compliance with the IND requirements contained in 21 CFR 312, which includes the requirement that investigators sign the 1572.  If a study also involves foreign clinical sites, the sponsor may choose, but is not required, to include the foreign clinical sites under the IND.  The investigators from the U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND would be required to sign the 1572.  The investigators from the foreign sites that are not included under the IND are not required to sign the 1572.\n\nIf the sponsor chooses to conduct a multinational study with U.S. and some foreign sites under the IND, and other foreign sites not under the IND, the sponsor can submit a single protocol to the IND and all sites would follow this protocol.  Alternatively, the sponsor can conduct a multinational study with one protocol for sites under the IND (U.S. sites and some foreign sites) and a different protocol(s) for foreign sites not under the IND.  If the intent is to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites, the protocols would ordinarily be very similar or identical.  The U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND must follow the protocol that was submitted to the IND.  For foreign sites that are not included under the IND, the protocol(s) does not need to be submitted to the IND.  In general, if the sponsor intends to submit the data in an application for marketing approval, we recommend that the sponsor identify the foreign sites that will not be conducted under the IND and discuss plans to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites with the appropriate FDA review division.\n\nNote, however, that 21 CFR 312.32(b) requires sponsors to promptly review information about the safety of the investigational drug obtained or otherwise received by the sponsor from any source, foreign or domestic.  Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), sponsors must also notify FDA and all participating investigators in an IND safety report of any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected.  This means that FDA and all participating investigators under the IND would be informed of such an adverse experience, even if it occurred in a foreign study not conducted under the IND.\n\n15.  How does a sponsor submit information to FDA about a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND?\n\nUnder 21 CFR 312.120, the sponsor can submit information to FDA from a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND to support clinical investigations in the United States and/or marketing approval.  When submitting information about a foreign clinical study, it is helpful to clearly identify in the cover letter that the material is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120.  The submission requirements for supporting documentation can be found at 21 CFR 312.120(b).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n16. Should a new form be prepared and signed when the OMB expiration date is reached?\n\nNo. There is no need to prepare and sign a new 1572 when the OMB expiration date has been reached.\n\n17. Does FDA expect a double-sided 1572, or is a two-page document printed from the FDA website acceptable?\n\nEither is acceptable; however, FDA recommends that a two-page document be stapled so that there is no question about what form the investigator signed.\n\n18. How should the 1572 be completed?\n\nThe 1572 on FDA's website may be completed by typing the information directly into the fillable form and printing the completed form. Alternatively, it is acceptable to print the blank form from FDA's website and hand-write or type the information onto the form. Typed forms are preferable because they are usually more legible. The completed form must be signed and dated by the investigator (either by hand or using an acceptable electronic method).\n\nII. SECTION #1: NAME AND ADDRESS OF INVESTIGATOR\n\n19. How should an investigator's name appear on the 1572?\n\nSection #1 should contain the investigator's full legal name (e.g., name on the investigator's birth certificate or marriage certificate). Titles, degrees, and/or professional qualifications may follow the investigator's legal name, if desired.\n\n20. What address should be entered into Section #1?\n\nThe address where the investigator can be reached by mail or in person should be entered in Section #1 of the 1572. Usually, this corresponds to the investigator's work or business address.\n\n21. Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n\nThe term co-investigator is not defined in FDA regulations. As commonly used, the term is meant to indicate that each co-investigator is fully responsible for fulfilling all of the obligations of an investigator as identified in 21 CFR 312.60. Thus under 21 CFR 312.3(b), each co-investigator is an investigator, and as such must sign a separate 1572.\n\nIn some situations, it is preferable to have more than one investigator responsible for a clinical investigation. For example, when a study is conducted at multiple research facilities that are not in close proximity, FDA expects an investigator who has signed a 1572 to be available at each location to either personally conduct or supervise the study. This responsibility cannot be delegated to a subinvestigator.\n\nAlthough not necessary, it is acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site. For example, the conduct and supervision of a large investigation with many subjects or complicated procedures might be shared among several investigators, each of whom has signed a 1572 when the investigation is conducted under an IND. This is distinct from a subinvestigator (see #31) whose role in the clinical investigation is more limited.\n\nIII. SECTION #2: EDUCATION, TRAINING, AND EXPERIENCE THAT QUALIFY THE INVESTIGATOR AS AN EXERT IN THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION\n\n22. What is the purpose of Section #2?\n\nSection #2 requires the investigator to attach a curriculum vitae (CV) or other statement of qualifications, showing the education, training and experience that qualifies the investigator as an expert in the clinical investigation of the drug/biologic for the use under investigation. Information identified in this section and attached to the 1572 enables the sponsor to assess an investigator's qualifications.\n\n23. Does the CV or other statement of qualifications need to be updated during a clinical study?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV or other statement of qualifications to be updated during a clinical study.\n\n24. Are CVs required to be signed and dated?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV to be signed and dated. The investigator's dated signature on the 1572 is sufficient to attest to the accuracy of the CV or other statement of qualifications submitted with the 1572.\n\nIV. SECTION #3: NAME AND ADDRESS OF ANY MEDICAL SCHOOL. HOSPITAL, OR OTHER RESEARCH FACILITY WHERE THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION(S) WILL BE CONDUCTED\n\n25. What address(es) should be entered in Section #3?\n\nThe address(es) of the location(s) where the investigation will be conducted and to where the test articles will be shipped, if different from the investigator's address of record, should be entered in Section #3.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n26. What qualifies as a research facility for Section #3?\n\nSection #3 is intended to identify facilities where study activities will be conducted and clinical data will be generated or collected. This includes facilities where subjects will be seen and study procedures performed. For example, this might include locations such as health care facilities where the test article will be administered, or where physical exams will be performed. Facilities where other important clinical investigation functions are performed may also be identified in Section #3. For example, a research laboratory where the test article is prepared, a special storage facility where the test article will be kept, or a location where tissue specimens are collected should be listed in this section.\n\n27. If an investigator sees study subjects at more than one site, should the investigator list all sites on the 1572?\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572) Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 7.727199554443359", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Although FDA will not accept as support for an IND or application for marketing approval any study that does not meet the conditions of 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will examine the data from such a study because the data may have a bearing on the safe use of the product.9 Sponsors and applicants are reminded that they must submit all studies and other information as required under the applicable regulations for drugs,10 including studies that do not comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nFootnote 9: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(2); 73 Fed. Reg. at 22807.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nA sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived.11 When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with the requirements in 21 CFR 312.120 in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Under 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and if FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary.12 Note that marketing approval of a new drug based solely on foreign clinical data is governed by 21 CFR 314.106.\n\nFootnote 10: See, for example, 21 CFR 314.50, 314.80, 600.80, and 601.2.\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR part 312.\n\nThe GCP requirements at 21 CFR 312.120 help protect human subjects and enhance the quality and integrity of the resulting clinical data.13 They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.14 Many of the requirements at 21 CFR 312.120 are already incorporated into the IND regulations at 21 CFR part 312, as well as 21 CFR parts 50 and 56,15 and are consistent with certain international ethical and policy standards for clinical trials (e.g., International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) \"GoodClinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline\" (ICH E6), which FDA adopted for use as guidance for industry in 1997).16\n\nFootnote 16: ICH E6 and other FDA guidance documents adopted from the ICH are available electronically at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\n1 Acceptance of Studies (21 Cfr 312.120(a))\n\nFDA regulations define GCP as \"a standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials in a way that provides assurance that the data are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects are protected.\"17\n\nFootnote 17: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(1)(i).\n\nGCP includes review and approval (or provision of a favorable opinion) by an independent ethics committee (IEC) before initiating a study, continuing review of an ongoing study by an IEC, and obtaining and documenting the freely given informed consent of the subject (or a subject's legally authorized representative, if the subject is unable to provide informed consent) before initiating a study.\n\nAs defined at 21 CFR 312.3(b), an IEC is \"a review panel that is responsible for ensuring the protection of the rights, safety, and well-being of human subjects involved in a clinical investigation, and is adequately constituted to provide assurance of that protection.\" We consider an IEC to be \"adequately constituted\" if it includes a reasonable number of members with the qualifications and experience to perform the IEC's functions. One type of IEC is an institutional review board (IRB) as defined in 21 CFR 56.102(g) and subject to the requirements of 21 CFR part 56. Another type of IEC is one that adheres to section 3.2.1 of ICH E6. Compliance with 21 CFR part 56 or ICH E6 is not required, however, for an IEC to be considered \"adequately constituted\" under 21 CFR 312.120. We have expressly allowed for flexibility in how to meet the requirements of this regulation in recognition that the organization and membership of IECs may differ among countries because of local needs.18 For more information on IEC membership, see Section 3.2.6 of this guidance document, below.\n\nFootnote 18: 73 Fed. Reg. at 22805.\n\nICH E6 defines informed consent as \"a process by which a subject voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to participate in a particular trial, after having been informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to the subject's decision to participate.\"19 Informed consent is \"documented by means of a written, signed, and dated informed consent form.\"20 In obtaining and documenting informed consent, an investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) and should adhere to principles of GCP.21 Prior to the beginning of the trial, the investigator should obtain the IEC's written approval of the informed consent form and any additional written information that will be provided to study subjects.22\n\nFootnote 19: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM073122.pdf.\n\nAppendix B Supporting Information (21 CFR 312.120(b))\n\nA sponsor or applicant submitting non-IND foreign data in support of an IND or an application for marketing approval for a drug must include a description of the actions the sponsor or applicant took to ensure that the research conformed to GCP. Because the description is not required to duplicate information already submitted in the IND or the application for marketing approval, the sponsor or applicant may indicate the location of the required information by providing cross-references (and/or hyperlinks) to relevant sections of the IND application, to relevant sections of an application for marketing approval, or to relevant sections of previously submitted materials.\n\nThe location of all information required by 21 CFR 312.120 should be clearly delineated in the submission. FDA recommends that the sponsor or applicant clearly indicate the following:\n\nwhether each clinical study was conducted at both foreign and domestic sites or only foreign sites;\n\nwhether each foreign site was under an IND or was subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120; and\n\nfor each clinical study subject to 21 CFR 312.120, where in the submission or in previously submitted materials the following information can be found: 1. each of the elements required under 21 CFR 312.120(b) (e.g., \"Information showing that the study is adequate and well controlled, 21 CFR 312.120(b)(5) -- See IND Application, Section X.1, pp. y-z\"); and 2. any waiver requests as applicable under 21 CFR 312.120(c) (e.g., \"Waiver request for certain requirements applicable to Study [X] -- see IND Application, Section X.6, pp. y-z\").\n\nClearly delineating where the required information can be found will facilitate FDA's review of the IND or marketing application by enabling Agency confirmation of the sponsor's/applicant's compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nWithin an eCTD format of an application (for marketing approval or an IND), FDA recommends that a sponsor or applicant list the studies subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120 in Section 5.2 of Module 5. The listing can be part of an overall tabular listing or be constructed as an accompanying table and appropriately identified as such. A sponsor or applicant might also use a submission's cover letter, particularly in the case of an IND, to indicate whether the submission contains studies subject to 21 CFR 312.120. Whether in Module 5 or in a cover letter, the submission should contain page references and/or links to the respective individual full Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) for the identified studies.\n\nWithin a CSR of a study, using an ICH E3 format as an example, FDA recommends that a sponsor or applicant identify on the Title Page that the study is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120. The Title Page should contain a reference and/or alink to a section or an appendix which specifically addresses the sponsor's compliance with 21 CFR 312.120. (In ICH E3 format, such an Appendix would be in addition to the kind of Appendices already listed in the ICH E3 Guidance, e.g. 16.5). FDA further recommends identifying specific foreign non-IND clinical sites using Appendix 16.1.4 (\"List and Description of Investigators\") in ICH E3 format or a similarly designated section.\n\nThe section or appendix specifically intended to address compliance with 21 CFR 312.120 should include a brief statement describing actions the sponsor has taken and should provide supporting information in accordance with all the required elements as listed in the regulations (see below). FDA anticipates that for each such element the sponsor would provide the necessary information or provide reference and/or links to other sections of the study report which contain the information. FDA strongly advises against duplicating information provided elsewhere in the application.\n\nThe regulation allows for flexibility in how the requirements are to be met. For example, a full CSR prepared in accordance with ICH E3 \"Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports\"23 may meet many of the requirements under 21 CFR 312.120, but adherence to ICH E3 is not required. The same holds for ICH E6: a sponsor or applicant may choose but is not required to meet many of the requirements of this rule through adherence to ICH E6. Note, however, that even if studies are submitted according to ICH E3 or E6, in some cases it may be necessary to provide additional information to FDA to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120, as well as other applicable requirements in 21 CFR parts 312, 314, or 601.24\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.3137001991271973", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n\nFDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nOffice of Good Clinical Practice\n\nMarch 2012\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:4]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nGuidance for Industry and FDA Staff1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Good Clinical Practice (OGCP) in the Office of the Commissioner (OC) in coordination with the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nFDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies\n\nNot Conducted Under an IND\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic.

The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. This final rule, which took effect on October 27, 2008, is codified at 21 CFR 312.120. It is intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data.\n\nFootnote 2: 73 Fed. Reg. 22800 (April 28, 2008).\n\nThis guidance is applicable to all applications submitted under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and\n\nCosmetic Act (FD& C Act) (21 U.S.C. 355) or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262).\n\nThis guidance document is intended to clarify for sponsors and applicants how they can\n\ndemonstrate compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.3 It provides\n\nrecommendations for the submission of information, whether in an IND or application for\n\nmarketing approval for a drug or biological drug product,4 to demonstrate that a non-IND foreign clinical study was conducted in accordance with GCP.\n\nFootnote 4: For the purposes of this guidance, all references to drugs, drug products, and drug substances include both human\n\ndrug products and biological drug products regulated by CDER and CBER, unless otherwise specified.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nClinical research is becoming increasingly global, as detailed in reports by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (\"OIG Reports\").5 FDA recognizes that sponsors may choose to conduct multinational clinical studies under a variety of scenarios. Multinational studies may include domestic sites conducted under an IND, foreign sites conducted under an IND, and/or foreign sites not conducted under an IND.6 Sponsors may decide to use the data that is obtained from non-IND foreign sites to support clinical investigations and/or marketing approval(s) in the United States. Some sponsors may even seek to rely solely on foreign clinical data as support for an IND or application for marketing approval in the U.S.7 Indeed, the number of INDs and applications for marketing approval supported by foreign clinical trials has increased in recent years and will likely continue to increase in the future.\n\nFootnote 5: See HHS OIG Report, Challenges to FDA\u2019s Ability to Monitor and Inspect Foreign Clinical Trials (June 2010), OEI-01-08-00510, available at http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-08-00510.pdf; HHS OIG Report, The Globalization of Clinical Trials: A Growing Challenge in Protecting Human Subjects (September 2001), OEI-01-00-00190, available at http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-00-00190.pdf.\n\nFootnote 6: For information on how conducting both IND and non-IND studies affects the requirement for investigators to sign the Form FDA 1572, see FDA\u2019s Guidance, Information Sheet Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs: Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572), available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM214282.pdf.\n\nThis increasing globalization of clinical trials presents challenges to both U.S. and foreign regulators, many of which are detailed in the OIG reports. Among other challenges, resource constraints limit the number of foreign clinical site inspections that can be conducted. To address these challenges, FDA has sought to leverage its resources more efficiently by: (1) encouraging sponsors to utilize data standardization in their INDs and applications for marketing approval, in order to improve review and analysis of data and facilitate implementation of a site selection model to prioritize sites for inspection; (2) engaging in collaboration and outreach with international regulatory authorities; and (3) considering alternative mechanisms of clinical trial oversight both by sponsors and FDA, such as a quality management system approach which emphasizes building quality into the research process.\n\nThis guidance document is part of FDA's overall efforts to strengthen oversight of foreign clinical trials.8 Specifically, FDA is issuing this guidance as part of its efforts to encourage sponsors and applicants to standardize information relating to foreign clinical trials in their INDs and applications for marketing approval (see (1), above). This guidance should help sponsorsand applicants submit information in a consistent and standardized manner to demonstrate compliance with the requirements in 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nMuch of the information in this guidance comes from the preamble to the final rule, 73 Fed. Reg. 22800 (April 28, 2008). It is organized in a question and answer format that tracks the regulatory provisions. In addition to addressing the substantive requirements of the final rule, this guidance addresses organization and submission procedures. Specifically, as described in Section III.B, when sponsors or applicants submit information about a non-IND foreign clinical study, they should clearly identify in the cover letter (a) that the material is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120, and (b) where in the submission the information required by 21 CFR 312.120(b) can be located.\n\nAlthough FDA will not accept as support for an IND or application for marketing approval any study that does not meet the conditions of 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will examine the data from such a study because the data may have a bearing on the safe use of the product.9 Sponsors and applicants are reminded that they must submit all studies and other information as required under the applicable regulations for drugs,10 including studies that do not comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nFootnote 9: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(2); 73 Fed. Reg. at 22807.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nA sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived.11 When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with the requirements in 21 CFR 312.120 in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Under 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and if FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary.12 Note that marketing approval of a new drug based solely on foreign clinical data is governed by 21 CFR 314.106.\n\nFootnote 10: See, for example, 21 CFR 314.50, 314.80, 600.80, and 601.2.\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR part 312.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.7257086634635925", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA receives frequent inquiries from the academic community (e.g., clinical investigators, IRBs) and the pharmaceutical industry about whether an IND should be submitted for various types of clinical research. Inquiries have related to a range of issues concerning application of the IND requirements in part 312, including, for example:\n\nClinical investigations using marketed drugs\n\nBioequivalence/bioavailability studies\n\nStudies using radiolabeled or cold isotopes\n\nStudies using dietary supplements or foods\n\nStudies using endogenous compounds\n\nPathogenesis studies using modified organisms\n\nStudies using wild-type organisms in challenge models\n\nStudies that do not have a commercial purpose\n\nBecause of the large number of inquiries and wide range of issues, FDA determined that it would be helpful to provide to potential sponsors, clinical investigators, and sponsor-investigators an overview of the IND requirements and related issues.\n\nWith certain exceptions, clinical investigations in which a drug is administered to human subjects must be conducted under an IND as required in part 312. Sections 3, 4, and 5 of this guidance elaborate on the criteria for when a study must be conducted under an IND; the types of studies that involve drugs, but that are exempt from the IND requirements; studies involving radioactive drugs that are generally recognized as safe and effective (and to which IND requirements therefore do not apply); and FDA's use of enforcement discretion with respect to certain studies using cold isotopes conducted without an IND. Section 6 discusses specific issues that frequently arise concerning application of the IND regulations; section 7 contains frequently asked questions; and section 8 describes the process for seeking advice from FDA concerning the application of the IND regulations to a planned clinical investigation.\n\n3 Research studies that require an IND\n\nIn general, the IND regulations in part 312 require that human research studies be conducted under an IND if all of the following conditions exist:* The research involves a drug as that term is defined in section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)).\n* The research is a clinical investigation as defined in the IND regulations (21 CFR 312.3).\n* The clinical investigation is not otherwise exempt from the IND requirements in part 312 (see section IV of this guidance).\n\n1 What Is a Drug?\n\nThe definition of the term drug in section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act includes, among other things, \"articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease...\" and \"articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.\" Biological products subject to licensure under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) may also be considered drugs within the meaning of the FD&C Act. A biological product is:\n\n... a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, protein (except any chemically synthesized polypeptide), or analogous product, or argphenamine or derivative of argphenamine (or any other trivalent organic arsenic compound), applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings.\n\nBiological products include, among other products, bacterial vaccines, allergenic extracts, gene therapy products, growth factors, cytokines, and monoclonal antibodies.\n\nIt is important to note that the drug definition is not limited to compounds intended for a therapeutic purpose.4 The definition also includes compounds intended to affect the structure or function of the body, without regard to whether the compound is intended to influence a disease process. For example, the definition includes compounds administered to healthy individuals to prevent pregnancy or treat male pattern baldness. The definition also includes compounds used for research purposes in healthy subjects to blunt or provoke a physiologic response or study the mechanism of action or metabolism of a drug (see section VI.A). Note, however, that (1) a dietary supplement intended only to affect the structure or function of the body and not intended for a therapeutic purpose is not a drug5 (see section VI.D.1) and (2) a food used as such (i.e., primarily for its taste, aroma, or nutritive value) and not for a therapeutic purpose or to affect the structure or function of the body, other than by providing nutrition, is not a drug (see section VI.D.2).6\n\nWhat Is a Clinical Investigation?\n\nThe IND regulations in SS 312.3(b) define clinical investigation7 as:\n\nFootnote 7: Additional information on clinical investigations is available on FDA\u2019s Web site at http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/default.htm.\n\n... [an] experiment in which a drug is administered or dispensed to, or used involving, one or more human subjects. For the purposes of [the IND regulations], an experiment is any use of a drug [whether approved or unapproved] except for the use of a marketed drug in the course of medical practice.\n\nFor example, a randomized trial evaluating an unapproved use of a lawfully marketed drug is a clinical investigation and may require an IND.8 In contrast, use of a lawfully marketed drug for an unapproved use in the course of medical practice is not a clinical investigation and does not require an IND because it involves the use in an individual patient where the primary intent is to treat the patient.\n\nFootnote 8: See section IV.A of this guidance.\n\nIV Clinical Investigations that are Exempt from the IND requirements by Regulation\n\nFDA regulations describe two categories of clinical investigations that are exempt from the IND requirements in part 312, provided the criteria for exemption are met (see 21 CFR 312.2(b) and 320.31(b)). The two categories of clinical investigations and the applicable criteria are described in the following subsections. Ordinarily, clinical investigations of drugs that do not meet these criteria must be conducted under an IND as required in part 312.\n\nCertain Research Involving Marketed Drug Products\n\nWhether an IND is needed to conduct a clinical investigation of a marketed drug primarily depends on the intent of the investigation and the degree of risk associated with the use of the drug in the investigation. A clinical investigation of a marketed drug is exempt from the IND requirements if all of the criteria for an exemption in SS 312.2(b) are met:\n\nThe drug product is lawfully marketed in the United States.\n\nThe investigation is not intended to be reported to FDA as a well-controlled study in support of a new indication and there is no intent to use it to support any other significant change in the labeling of the drug.\n\nIn the case of a prescription drug, the investigation is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the drug.\n\nThe investigation does not involve a route of administration, dose, patient population, or other factor that significantly increases the risk (or decreases the acceptability of the risk) associated with the use of the drug product (21 CFR 312.2(b)(1)(iii)).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements for review by an IRB (21 CFR part 56) and with the requirements for informed consent (21 CFR part 50).\n\nThe investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements of SS 312.7 (i.e., the investigation is not intended to promote or commercialize the drug product).\n\nThe potential sponsor or sponsor-investigator of a planned clinical investigation using a marketed drug is responsible for determining whether the investigation meets the criteria for an exemption.9 If there is uncertainty about whether the exemption criteria are met, the potential sponsor or sponsor-investigator can seek advice from FDA on the applicability of the IND regulations (SS 312.2(e)).\n\nFootnote 9: The preamble to the rule finalizing the IND regulations provides: FDA recognizes that a considerable amount of professional judgment must be exercised in determining whether the conditions of an investigation \u201csignificantly increase\u201d the risk associated with use of the drug. Because the assessment of risks involved in a therapeutic procedure is an everyday part of the practice of medicine, the individual investigator should usually be able to determine the applicability of the exemption. (See the final rule on New Drug, Antibiotic, and Biologic Drug Product Regulations that published in the Federal Register of March 19, 1987 (52 FR 8798 at 8802)).\n\nThree of the criteria for exemption listed previously merit further discussion.\n\nWhat is meant by a drug product that is lawfully marketed in the United States?\n\nThe preamble to the final rule incorporating the IND exemption criteria into the IND regulations makes clear that the exemption provision was not intended to require use of only the marketed version of the drug product for a clinical investigation to be exempt from the IND requirements. The intent was to provide some latitude to modify the marketed version of the drug product for use in a clinical investigation. In responding to comments asking FDA to clarify to what extent a sponsor could change the marketed drug product or conditions of use and still be exempt from the IND regulations, FDA stated that: The exemption was not intended to require an investigator to use the drug in exactly the same dosage form, dosage levels, and patient populations described in the marketed labeling for the product, but rather to permit changes to the lawfully marketed drug product that do not increase the risks...over the risk presented by use of the product in conformance with its marketed labeling.10\n\nFootnote 10: Final rule, \u201cNew Drug, Antibiotic, and Biologic Drug Product Regulations\u201d (52 FR 8798 at 8801, March 19, 1987).\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.20399847626686096", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA had provided additional information about aggregate safety assessment and reporting for INDs in the guidance for industry and investigators, Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies (December 2012),64 and has proposed recommendations in the draft guidance for industry Safety Assessment for IND Safety Reporting (December 2015).65\n\n6.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhere an IND safety report is required to be submitted to FDA under 21 CFR 312.32, the investigator must also send that IND safety report to the IRB.66 The IRB may have additional reporting requirements regarding COVID-19 during the clinical trial.\n\nFootnote 66: See 21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vii) and 312.66. See also the guidance for clinical investigators, sponsors, and IRBs Adverse Event Reporting to IRBs\u2014Improving Human Subject Protection (January 2009), available on the FDA guidance web page.\n\nQ25. Trial participants with COVID-19 may experience a number of serious and unexpected adverse clinical events, which may increase the volume of corresponding IND safety reports. If an investigator receives an IND safety report from a sponsor, is it acceptable to review only reports that the sponsor indicates will result in a change to the investigator brochure, informed consent, or protocol? Which IND safety reports must an investigator send to the IRB?\n\nNo, it is not acceptable for an investigator to review only certain IND safety reports. Under 21 CFR 312.60, investigators are responsible for protecting the safety of trial participants in a clinical investigation. IND safety reports must be sent by the sponsor to FDA and all participating investigators67 when the sponsor determines that a serious adverse event is unexpected and there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the serious adverse event, i.e., there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.68 Reviewing IND safety reports is essential for protecting the safety of trial participants because a serious and unexpected adverse event represents a new potential risk associated with the investigational product. FDA considers the review of all IND safety reports critical to fulfilling investigators' responsibility to protect the safety of trial participants in a clinical investigation.69\n\nFootnote 67: See 21 CFR 312.53(c)(1)(vii) and 312.66. See also the guidance for clinical investigators, sponsors, and IRBs Adverse Event Reporting to IRBs\u2014Improving Human Subject Protection (January 2009), available on the FDA guidance web page.\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 312.32(c)(1).\n\nFootnote 69: See 21 CFR 312.32. IND safety reports must be submitted as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. Unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reactions must be submitted no later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor\u2019s initial receipt of the information (21 CFR 312.32(c)(2)).\n\nFootnote 60: See 21 CFR 312.60.\n\nFootnote 61: Many study protocols specify that the sponsor will submit IND safety reports to the IRB on the investigator\u2019s behalf. In these situations, where the investigator receives confirmation that the report has been sent to the IRB (e.g., the investigator is copied on the report sent to the IRB by the sponsor), FDA does not intend to object to the sponsor submitting the report to the IRB on the investigator\u2019s behalf and would not expect an investigator to provide the IRB with a duplicate copy of the report.\n\nIn addition, investigators are required under 21 CFR 312.66 to report all \"unanticipated problems involving risk to human subjects or others\" to the IRB. FDA considers a serious and unexpected adverse event that meets the criteria for sponsor reporting to FDA and all investigators in an IND safety report under 21 CFR 312.32, and would generally consider a serious adverse event that meets the criteria for safety reporting for an IND-exempt bioavailability/bioequivalence study under 21 CFR 320.31(d)(3), to be an \"unanticipated [problem] involving risk to human subjects or others\" that therefore must be reported to the IRB by the investigator.70,71\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor more information about safety reporting, see FDA's guidances Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies (December 2012)72 and Adverse Event Reporting to IRBs--Improving Human Subject Protection (January 2009).73\n\nFootnote 72: Available on the FDA guidance web page.\n\nFootnote 73: Available on the FDA guidance web page.\n\nFootnote 74: For the purposes of this guidance, the term electronic systems means systems, including hardware and software, that produce electronic records.\n\nFootnote 75: For the purposes of this guidance, the term electronic signature means a computer data compilation of any symbol or series of symbols executed, adopted, or authorized by an individual to be the legally binding equivalent of the individual\u2019s handwritten signature (21 CFR 11.3(b)(7)).\n\nQ26. What considerations apply to the electronic systems used to generate electronic signatures on clinical trial records, including informed consent documents, during the COVID-19 public health emergency?\n\nElectronic systems74 used to generate electronic signatures75 on clinical trial records, including informed consent documents, during informed consent documents, during the COVID-19 public health emergency must comply with the requirements outlined in FDA regulations at 21 CFR part 11 (Part 11) when applicable.76,77\n\nFootnote 76: See 21 CFR 11.1(b). See also the guidance for industry Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures\u2014Scope and Application (August 2003), available on the FDA guidance web page.\n\nFDA is aware that there are multiple commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software systems providing electronic signature services for clinical trial records. FDA does not certify individual electronic systems or methods to obtain Part 11 compliant electronic signatures, but COTS vendors may be able to provide sponsors and other regulated entities with information regarding whether their systems are Part 11 compliant. When such information is unavailable from the vendor, and a Part 11 compliant electronic system is required, sponsors and other regulated entities must take other steps to ensure the electronic system or software in use is Part 11 compliant. For further information regarding Part 11 compliance, see FDA's guidance for industry Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures--Scope and Application (August 2003)78 and the additional recommendations proposed in the draft guidance for industry Use of Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures in Clinical Investigations under 21 CFR Part 11--Questions and Answers (June 2017).79\n\nFootnote 79: For records that are not subject to Part 11, sponsors and other regulated entities should rely on their internal business practices to determine acceptable electronic signature methods and controls.\n\nFootnote 78: Available on the FDA guidance web page. When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nWhen an electronic system that is Part 11 compliant is not available, regulated entities must have an alternate means of obtaining required signatures (e.g., handwritten80 wet ink signatures executed on documents, handwritten stylus or finger-drawn signatures executed on electronic documents that are then printed or appropriately witnessed). Alternative methods for obtaining signatures on informed consent documents during the COVID-19 public health emergency are described in Q11 and Q12 of this guidance. When handwritten methods are used, the sponsor and other regulated entities should ensure that all records containing original handwritten signatures are (1) collected and archived, as either original paper copies or appropriately certifiedelectronic copies (e.g., using a validated process for scanning paper copies), and (2) retained according to applicable FDA record retention requirements.81\n\nFootnote 81: See 21 CFR 312.57, 312.62, and 812.140.\n\nQ27. Certain clinical trial protocols have an exclusion criterion for receipt of another \"investigational medical product.\" If a participant receives a vaccine or other medical product for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 authorized under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), would FDA consider this receipt of an investigational medical product?\n\nWhen a medical product is being used under an EUA, it is an authorized (though not an approved or cleared) medical product for use in clinical care that has met the statutory criteria under section 564 of the FD&C Act. The product is not being studied under an IND or IDE when used pursuant to an EUA, and FDA therefore does not consider receipt under an EUA as receipt of an investigational product.82 In contrast, when the same product is used in a clinical investigation under an IND or IDE, the product's safety and/or effectiveness is being studied for investigational uses, and FDA would consider receipt in this situation to be receipt of an investigational product.\n\nAs always in the design of a clinical investigation, there may be valid scientific reasons to have an exclusion (and even a discontinuation) criterion for a medical product--a monoclonal antibody or vaccine, for example--whether that product was used under an EUA or not. These scientific reasons may include risks to an individual if they enroll or continue to participate in a clinical trial after receiving (or having received) the excluded product, or the potential impact of the use of the excluded product on trial objectives, such as confounding the determination of effectiveness of the product under investigation.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Institutional Review Boards\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.5251548886299133", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n--------------------\nContext: 10. Do I need an IND if my study uses a home-made version of a lawfully marketed drug?\n\nSome investigators, or research pharmacies affiliated with the institution in which an investigator is conducting a study, compound their own versions of lawfully marketed drug products for use in clinical studies. For example, FDA is aware of instances in which the methacholine used in respiratory studies for challenge purposes has been prepared locally from raw materials obtained from a chemical supply company. Studies that use a drug product that is prepared from raw materials in place of the approved, finished product marketed by the manufacturer must be conducted under an IND (21 CFR part 312). These studies cannot meet the criteria for an exemption from the IND requirements for marketed drugs (SS 312.2(b)) because the drug product manufactured by the investigator or research pharmacy is not considered to be the lawfully marketed drug.\n\n11. Do I need an IND if my study enrolls only a small number of subjects?\n\nThe number of subjects enrolled has no bearing on whether the study is subject to the IND regulations. The definition of clinical investigation specifically includes studies with as few as one subject (see section III.B).\n\n12 Do I need an IND if my study enrolls only healthy volunteers?\n\nThe clinical condition of study subjects (e.g., the presence or absence of disease) has no bearing on whether the study is subject to the IND requirements in part 312. The definition of clinical investigation refers only to subjects involved in an experiment. It makes no distinction between healthy subjects or those with a disease (see section III.B).\n\nVIII Process for addressing novelties concerning the application of the IND requirements\n\nThe sponsor (or sponsor-investigator of an individual investigator-initiated study) should, in most cases, be able to determine whether the IND regulations apply to a planned clinical investigation as required under 21 CFR 312.2(a). If a sponsor is uncertain, however, we recommend that the sponsor contact the appropriate review division (i.e., for the therapeutic area being studied) in the appropriate FDA center for advice about whether the IND regulations apply (21 CFR 312.2(e)).

Filing Documentation Prior approval supplement (all information including accelerated stability data); annual report (long-term stability data).\n\n4 Components and Composition -- Release Controlling Excipient\n\nThis section of the guidance focuses on changes in release controlling excipients in the drug product. For modified release solid oral dosage forms, consideration should be given as to whether or not the excipient is critical to drug release. The sponsor should provide appropriate justifications (i.e., mechanism of drug release and manufacturing process) for claiming any excipient(s) as a release controlling excipient in the formulation of the modified release solid oral dosage form. The functionality of each excipient should be identified. Changes in the amount of the drug substance are not addressed by this guidance. Changes exceeding the ranges defined in each of the levels below may be allowed if considered to be within normal batch-to-batch variation and contained within an approved original application. In such situations, sponsors should contact the appropriate CDER review division for further guidance.\n\nA. Level 1 Change\n\nDefinition of Level\n\nLevel 1 changes are those that are unlikely to have any detectable impact on formulation quality and performance.\n\nExample:\n\nChanges in the release controlling excipient(s), expressed as percentage (w/w) of total release controlling excipient(s) in the formulation less than or equal to 5% w/w of total release controlling excipient content in the modified release solid oral dosage form.\n\nThe drug substance in the product is formulated to 100% of label/potency. The total additive effect of all release controlling excipient changes should not be more than 5% w/w of the total release controlling excipients in the original approved formulation.4 The total weight of the dosage form should still be within the approved original application range.\n\nFootnote 4: Example: In a product consisting of active ingredient A, ethylcellulose and a plasticizer, the ethylcellulose and plasticizer content should not vary by more than an absolute total of 5% w/w of the total release controlling excipients (e.g., ethylcellulose content increases by 2.5% and plasticizer content increases by 2.5%) relative to the original approved total release controlling excipient content weight in the modified release solid oral dosage form if it is to stay within the given range allowed for level 1.\n\nThe components (active and excipients) in the formulation should have numerical targets that represent the nominal composition of the product on which any future changes in the composition of the product are to be based. Allowable changes in the composition should be based on the original approved target composition and not on previous level 1 changes in the composition. For products approved with only a range for excipients, the target value may be assumed to be the midpoint of the original approved application range.\n\nTest Documentation\n\na. Chemistry documentation\n\nApplication/compendial product release requirements.\n\nStability: First production batch on long-term stability data reported in annual report.\n\nb. Dissolution documentation\n\nNone beyond application/compendial requirements.\n\nc. Bioequivalence documentation\n\nNone.\n\nFiling Documentation\n\nAnnual report (all information including long-term stability data).\n\nB. Level 2 Change\n\nDefinition of Level\n\nLevel 2 changes are those that could have a significant impact on formulation quality and performance. Test documentation for a level 2 change would vary depending on whether the product could be considered to have a narrow therapeutic range.5\n\nFootnote 5: At present, there is no official CDER list of narrow therapeutic range drugs. A list was developed earlier in a preliminary attempt to identify drugs where there was greater concern that deviation from the specifications and potential changes in bioavailability could raise clinical issues. This preliminary list was not based solely on 21 CFR 320.33(c) which is contained in a section of the regulations related to criteria and evidence to assess actual or potential bioequivalence problems, nor does it accurately reflect the Agency\u2019s opinion on narrow therapeutic range drugs. Currently, the issue of narrow therapeutic range drugs is under discussion within CDER. If unsure about the classification of a drug as a narrow therapeutic range drug, sponsors should contact the appropriate CDER review division.\n\nExamples:\n\nChange in the technical grade and/or specifications of the release controlling excipient(s).6 Footnote 6: Example: Eudragit RS-100 vs. Eudragit RL-100.\n\nChanges in the release controlling excipient(s), expressed as percentage (w/w) of total release controlling excipient(s) in the formulation, greater than those listed above for a level 1 change, but less than or equal to 10% w/w of total release controlling excipient content in the modified release solid oral dosage form.\n\nThe drug substance in the drug product is formulated to 100% of label/potency. The total additive effect of all release controlling excipient changes should not be more than 10% w/w of the total release controlling excipient(s) in the original approved formulation. The total weight of the dosage form could still be within or outside the approved original application range.\n\nThe components (active and excipients) in the formulation should have numerical targets that represent the nominal composition of the product on which any future changes in the composition of the product are to be based. Allowable changes in the composition are based on the original approved target composition and not on the composition based on previous level 1 or level 2 changes. For products approved with only a range for excipients, the target value may be assumed to be the midpoint of the original approved application range.\n* Test Documentation\n* Chemistry documentation Application/compential product release requirements and updated executed batch records.\n\nStability:\n\nNonnarrow therapeutic range drugs: One batch with three months' accelerated stability data reported in prior approval supplement and long-term stability data of first production batch reported in annual report.\n\nNarrow therapeutic range drugs: Three batches with three months' accelerated stability data reported in prior approval supplement and long-term stability data of first three production batches reported in annual report.\n\nDissolution documentation\n\nNonnarrow therapeutic range drugs\n\nExtended release: In addition to application/compendial release requirements, multipoint dissolution profiles should be obtained in three other media, for example, in water, 0.1N HCl, and USP buffer media at pH 4.5, and 6.8 for the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product). Adequate sampling should be performed, for example, at 1, 2, and 4 hours and every two hours thereafter until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached. A surfactant may be used with appropriate justification.\n\nDelayed release: In addition to application/compendial release requirements, dissolution tests should be performed in 0.1 N HCl for 2 hours (acid stage) followed by testing in USP buffer media in the range of pH 4.5-7.5 (buffer stage) under standard (application/compendial) test conditions and two additional agitation speeds using the application/compendial test apparatus (three additional test conditions). If the application/compendial test apparatus is the rotating basket method (Apparatus 1), a rotation speed of 50, 100, and 150 rpm may be used, and if the application/compendial test apparatus is the rotating paddle method (Apparatus 2), a rotation speed of 50, 75, and 100 rpm may be used. Multipoint dissolution profiles should be obtained during the buffer stage of testing. Adequate sampling should be performed, for example, at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 minutes (following the time from which the dosage form is placed in the buffer) until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached. The above dissolution testing should be performed using the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product).\n--------------------\nContext title: SUPAC-MR- Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes- Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Dissolution Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.9588835835456848", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: Modified-Release Drug Products\n\nWe recommend that food-effect BA and fed BE studies be performed for all modified-release dosage forms.\n\n1.2.1 INDs/NDAs\n\nWe recommend a study comparing the BA under fasting and fed conditions for all orally administered modified-release drug products.\n\nWhen changes occur in components, composition, and/or method of manufacture between the to-be-marketed formulation and the primary clinical trial material, the sponsor may wish to use relevant principles described in the guidance for industry on SUPAC-MR: Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms: Scale-Up and Post-Approval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls: In Vitro Dissolution Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation (SUPAC-MR guidance) to determine if documentation of in vivo BE is recommended. These BE studies, if indicated, should generally be conducted under fasting conditions.\n\n1.2.2 ANDAs\n\nIn addition to a BE study under fasting conditions, a BE study under fed conditions should be conducted for all orally administered modified-release drug products.\n\nIV Study Considerations\n\nThis section provides general considerations for designing food effect BA and fed BE studies. A sponsor may propose alternative study designs and data analyses. The scientific rationale and justification for these study designs and analyses should be provided in the study protocol. Sponsors may choose to conduct additional studies for a better understanding of the drug product and to provide optimal labeling statements for dosage and administration (e.g. different meals and different times of drug intake in relation to meals). In studying modified-release dosage forms, consideration should be given to the possibility that co-administration with food can result in dose dumping, in which the complete dose may be more rapidly released from the dosage form than intended, creating a potential safety risk for the study subjects.\n\nGeneral Design\n\nWe recommend a randomized, balanced, single-dose, two-treatment (fed vs. fasting), two-period, two-sequence crossover design for studying the effects of food on the BA of either an immediate-release or a modified-release drug product. The formulation to be tested should be administered on an empty stomach (fasting condition) in one period and following a test meal (fed condition) in the other period. We recommend a similar, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence crossover design for a fed BE study except that the treatments should consist of both test and reference formulations administered following a test meal (fed condition). An adequate washout period should separate the two treatments in food-effect BA and fed BE studies.\n\nSubject Selection\n\nBoth food-effect BA and fed BE studies can be carried out in healthy volunteers drawn from the general population. Studies in the patient population are also appropriate if safety concerns preclude the enrollment of healthy subjects. A sufficient number of subjects should complete the study to achieve adequate power for a statistical assessment of food effects on BA to claim an absence of food effects, or to claim BE in a fed BE study (see DATA ANALYSIS AND LABELING section). A minimum of 12 subjects should complete the food-effect BA and fed BE studies.\n\nDosage Strength\n\nIn general, the highest strength of a drug product intended to be marketed should be tested in food-effect BA and fed BE studies. In some cases, clinical safety concerns can prevent the use of the highest strength and warrant the use of lower strengths of the dosage form. For ANDAs, the same lot and strength used in the fasting BE study should be tested in the fed BE study. For products with multiple strengths in ANDAs, if a fed BE study has been performed on the highest strength, BE determination of one or more lower strengths can be waived based on dissolution profile comparisons (for details see the guidance on Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies for Orally Administered Drug Products - General Considerations.\n\nTest Meal\n\nWe recommend that food-effect BA and fed BE studies be conducted using meal conditions that are expected to provide the greatest effects on GI physiology so that systemic drug availability is maximally affected. A high-fat (approximately 50 percent of total caloric content of the meal) and high-calorie (approximately 800 to 1000 calories) meal is recommended as a test meal for food-effect BA and fed BE studies. This test meal should derive approximately 150, 250, and 500-600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively.4 The caloric breakdown of the test meal should be provided in the study report. If the caloric breakdown of the meal is significantly different from the one described above, the sponsor should provide a scientific rationale for this difference. In NDAs, it is recognized that a sponsor can choose to conduct food-effect BA studies using meals with different combinations of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins for exploratory or label purposes. However, one of the meals for the food-effect BA studies should be the high-fat, high-calorie test meal described above.\n\nFootnote 4: An example test meal would be two eggs fried in butter, two strips of bacon, two slices of toast with butter, four ounces of hash brown potatoes and eight ounces of whole milk. Substitutions in this test meal can be made as long as the meal provides a similar amount of calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat and has comparable meal volume and viscosity.\n\nAdministration\n\nFasted Treatments: Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects should be administered the drug product with 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of water. No food should be allowed for at least 4 hours post-dose. Water can be allowed as desired except for one hour before and after drug administration. Subjects should receive standardized meals scheduled at the same time in each period of the study.\n\nFed Treatments: Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects should start the recommended meal 30 minutes prior to administration of the drug product. Study subjects should eat this meal in 30 minutes or less; however, the drug product should be administered 30 minutes after start of the meal. The drug product should be administered with 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of water. No food should be allowed for at least 4 hours post-dose. Water can be allowed as desired except for one hour before and after drug administration. Subjects should receive standardized meals scheduled at the same time in each period of the study.\n\nSample Collection\n\nFor both fasted and fed treatment periods, timed samples in biological fluid, usually plasma, should be collected from the subjects to permit characterization of the complete shape of the plasma concentration-time profile for the parent drug. It may be advisable to measure other moieties in the plasma, such as active metabolites, and sponsors should refer to the guidance on Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies for Orally Administered Drug Products -- General Considerations for recommendations on these issues. Consideration should be given to the possibility that co-administration of a dosage form with food can alter the time course of plasma drug concentrations so that fasted and fed treatments can have different sample collection times.\n\nV Data Analysis and Labeling\n\nFood-effect BA studies may be exploratory and descriptive, or a sponsor may want to use a food-effect BA study to make a label claim.5 The following exposure measures and pharmacokinetic parameters should be obtained from the resulting concentration-time curves for the test and reference products in food-effect BA and fed BE studies:\n\nFootnote 5: Regulations on labeling requirements for a drug product submitted in an NDA can be found in 21 CFR part 201.\n\nTotal exposure, or area under the concentration-time curve (AUC({}{0\\text{-inf}}), AUC({}{0\\text{-t}}))\n\nPeak exposure (C({}_{\\text{max}}))\n\nTime to peak exposure (T({}_{\\text{max}}))\n\nLag-time (t({}_{\\text{lag}})) for modified-release products, if present\n\nTerminal elimination half-life\n\nOther relevant pharmacokinetic parameters\n\nIndividual subject measurements, as well as summary statistics (e.g., group averages, standard deviations, coefficients of variation) should be reported. An equivalence approach isrecommended for food-effect BA (to make a claim of no food effects) and fed BE studies, analyzing data using an average criterion. Log-transformation of exposure measurements (AUC and C({}{\\text{max}}) ) prior to analysis is recommended. The 90 percent CI for the ratio of population geometric means between test and reference products should be provided for AUC({}{\\text{0-inf}}), AUC({}{\\text{0-t}}), and C({}{\\text{max}}) (see guidance for industry on Statistical Approaches to Establishing Bioequivalence). For IND or NDA food-effect BA studies, the fasted treatment serves as the reference. For ANDA fed BE studies, the RLD administered under fed condition serves as the reference treatment.\n\nThe effect of food on the absorption and BA of a drug product should be described in the CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section of the labeling. In addition, the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section of the labeling should provide instructions for drug administration in relation to food based on clinical relevance (i.e., whether or not the changes in systemic exposure caused by co-administration with food results in safety or efficacy concerns, or when there is no important change in systemic exposure but there is a possibility that the drug substance causes GI irritation when taken without food).\n--------------------\nContext title: Food-Effect Bioavailability and Fed Bioequivalence Studies Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.7507860660552979", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: For modified release dosage forms, changes in release controlling excipients in the formulation should be within the range of release controlling excipients of the established correlation. In the presence of an established in vitro/in vivo correlation (6), only application/ compential dissolution testing need be performed. Also, an established in vitro/in vivo correlation can be used for any level of changes described in this guidance.\n\nJustification: Reports containing scientific data and expert professional judgment to substantiate decisions.\n\nLot: A batch or a specific identified portion of a batch, having uniform character and quality within specified limits or, in the case of a drug product produced by continuous process, a specific identified amount produced in a unit of time or quantity in a manner that assures its having uniform character and quality within specified limits (21 CFR 210.3(b)(10)).\n\nModified Release Dosage Forms: Dosage forms whose drug-release characteristics of time course and/or location are chosen to accomplish therapeutic or convenience objectives not offered by conventional dosage forms such as a solution or an immediate release dosage form. Modified release solid oral dosage forms include both delayed and extended release drug products.\n\nNonrelease Controlling Excipient (Non-Critical Composition Variable): An excipient in the final dosage form whose primary function does not include modifying the duration of release of the active drug substance from the dosage form.\n\nOperating Principles: Rules or concepts governing the operation of the system.\n\nPilot Scale: The manufacture of either drug substance or drug product by a procedure fully representative of and simulating that used for full manufacturing scale. For solid oral dosage forms this is generally taken to be, at a minimum, one tenth that of full production, or 100,000 tablets or capsules, whichever is larger (4).\n\nProcess: A series of operations, actions and controls used to manufacture a drug product.\n\nRanges: The extent to which or the limits between which acceptable variation exists.\n\nRelease Controlling Excipient (Critical Composition Variable): An excipient in the final dosage form whose primary function is to modify the duration of release of the active drug substance from the dosage form.\n\nRelease Mechanism: The process by which the drug substance is released from the dosage form. Typically the definition contains the energy source or pictorially describes the way the drug is released.\n\nRepresentative: Corresponding to or replacing some other species or the like; exemplifying a group or kind; typical.\n\nSame: Agreeing in kind, amount; unchanged in character or condition.\n\nSatisfactory Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) Inspection: A satisfactory cGMP inspection is one during which (1) no objectionable conditions or practices were found during an inspection or (2) objectionable conditions were found, however, corrective action is left to the firm to take voluntarily and the objectionable conditions do not justify further administrative or regulatory actions.\n\nScale-up: The process of increasing the batch size.\nScale-down: The process of decreasing the batch size.\nSignificant Body of Information:\n\nImmediate Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms: A significant body of information on the stability of the drug product is likely to exist after five years of commercial experience for new molecular entities, or three years of commercial experience for new dosage forms.\n\nModified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms: A significant body of information should include, for \"Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms,\" a product-specific body of information. This product-specific body of information is likely to exist after five years of commercial experience for the original modified release solid oral drug product, or three years of commercial experience for any subsequent modified release solid oral drug product utilizing similar drug release mechanism.\nSimilar: Having a general likeness.\n\nTechnical Grade: Technical grades of excipients may differ in (1) specifications and/or functionality, (2) impurities, and (3) impurity profiles.\n\nValidation: Establishing through documented evidence a high degree of assurance that a specific process will consistently produce a product that meets its predetermined specifications and quality attributes. A validated manufacturing process is one that has been proven to do what it purports or is represented to do. The proof of validation is obtained through collection and evaluation of data, preferably beginning from the process development phase and continuing through into the production phase. Validation necessarily includes process qualification (the qualification of materials, equipment, systems, buildings, and personnel), but it also includes the control of entire processes for repeated batches or runs.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nFDA, Guideline for Submitting Documentation for the Manufacture of and Controls for Drug Products, February 1987.\n\nFDA, \"Interim Policy on Exceptions to the Batch-Size and Production Condition Requirements for Non-Antibiotic, Solid, Oral-Dosage Form Drug Products Supporting Proposed ANDA's\" Policy and Procedure Guide #22-90, September 13, 1990.

If the application/compendial test apparatus is the rotating basket method (Apparatus 1), a rotation speed of 50, 100, and 150 rpm may be used, and if the application/compendial test apparatus is the rotating paddle method (Apparatus 2), a rotation speed of 50, 75, and 100 rpm may be used. Multipoint dissolution profiles should be obtained during the buffer stage of testing. Adequate sampling should be performed, for example, at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 minutes (following the time from which the dosage form is placed in the buffer) until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached.

Dissolution documentation Extended release: In addition to application/compential release requirements, a multipoint dissolution profile should be obtained using application/compential test conditions for the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product). Adequate sampling should be performed, for example at 1, 2, and 4 hours and every two hours thereafter until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached.\n\nDelayed release: In addition to application/compential release requirements, a multipoint dissolution profile should be obtained during the buffer stage of testing using the application/compential test conditions for the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch (unchanged drug product). Adequate sampling should be performed, for example at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 minutes (following the time from which the dosage form is placed in the buffer) until either 80% of the drug from the drug product is released or an asymptote is reached. c.   Bioequivalence documentation A single-dose bioequivalence study [(3)]. The bioequivalence study may be waived in the presence of an established in vitro/in vivo correlation [(6)].\n3.   Filing Documentation Prior approval supplement (all information including accelerated stability data); annual report (long-term stability data).\n\nGlossary of Terms\n\nThe following terms and their definitions (9) are being provided to assist the reader in using this guidance document.\n\nBatch: A specific quantity of a drug or other material produced according to a single manufacturing order during the same cycle of manufacture and intended to have uniform character and quality, within specified limits (21 CFR 210.3(b)(2)).\n\nBatch formula (Composition): A complete list of the ingredients and their amounts to be used for the manufacture of a representative batch of the drug product. All ingredients should be included in the batch formula whether or not they remain in the finished product (1).\n\nBiobatch: The lot of drug product formulated for purposes of pharmacokinetic evaluation in a bioavailability/bioequivalency study. For modified release solid oral, this batch should be 10% or greater than the proposed commercial production batch or at least 100,000 units, whichever is greater.\n\nBioequivalence Studies For Modified Release Drug Product: Refer to the OGD Guidance (3). The bioequivalence study should be conducted using the reference listed drug (RLD) product and/or the innovator drug product as the reference and the test product should be the product (generic or innovator) which has undergone postapproval change.\n\nContiguous Campus: Continuous or unbroken site or a set of buildings in adjacent city blocks.\n\nCritical Equipment Variable: A specific design, operating principle, or automation of equipment that can affect a specific performance variable critical to the ultimate and predictable performance of the dosage form and its drug.\n\nCritical Manufacturing Variable: Includes those manufacturing materials (critical composition variable), methods, equipment, and processes that significantly affect drug release, from the formulation (e.g., coating thickness, particle size, crystal form, excipient type, concentrations and distribution, and tablet hardness).\n\nCritical Processing Variable: A specific step, unit process, or condition of a unit process that can affect a specific performance variable critical to the ultimate and predictable performance of the dosage form and its drug.\n\nDelayed Release: Release of a drug (or drugs) at a time other than immediately following oral administration.\n\nDissolution Testing: Extended release: Dissolution testing should be conducted on 12 individual dosage units for the changed drug product and the biobatch or marketed batch(unchanged drug product). The potential for pH dependence of drug release from a modified release drug product is well recognized. Multipoint dissolution profiles should be obtained using discriminating agitation speed and medium. A surfactant may be used with appropriate justification. Early sampling times of 1, 2, and 4 hours should be included in the sampling schedule to provide assurance against premature release of the drug (dose dumping) from the formulation. Differing sampling times should be justified to prevent premature drug release. See current USP 23 NF 18, sections <711> and <724>, for general dissolution requirements. The general dissolution conditions to be followed are shown below:\n\nApparatus: USP 23 Apparatus 1 (rotating basket)  USP 23 Apparatus 2 (rotating paddle)  USP 23 Apparatus 3 (reciprocating cylinder)({}^{})  USP 23 Apparatus 4 (flow-through cell)({}^{})  USP 23 Apparatus 7 (reciprocating disk)({}^{*})\n\nRotation Speed: 50, 100, and 150 rpm (basket) 50, 75 and 100 rpm (paddle)\n\nTemperature: 37(\\pm)0.5({}^{\\circ})C\n\nUnits To Be Tested: 12\n\nDissolution Volume: 500-1000 mL\n\nDissolution Medium: Aqueous media of various pH.\n\nSampling Schedule: Adequate sampling should be performed, for example at 1, 2, and 4 hours, and every two hours thereafter until either 80% of the drug is released or an asymptote is reached.\n\nTolerances: As established.\n--------------------\nContext title: SUPAC-MR- Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes- Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Dissolution Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.5157560706138611", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: Chapter 6 Outdance for Industry SUPAC-MR: Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms\n\n1 Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Dissolution Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation\n\nChapter 5 Outance for Industry SUPAC-MR: Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms\n\nScale-Up and Postapproval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Dissolution Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Training and Communications\n\nDivision of Communications Management\n\nThe Drug Information Branch, HFD-210\n\n5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\n(Tel) 301-827-4573\n\n(Internet) http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/index.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nSeptember 1997\n\nCMC 8\n\nTable of Contents\n\nI.

This guidance represents the Agency\u2019s current thinking on modified release solid oral dosage forms scale-up and postapproval changes. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirement of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.\n\nSUPAC-MR: Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms\n\nScale-Up and Postapproval Changes:\n\nChemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls;\n\nIn Vitro Dissolution Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to pharmaceutical sponsors of new drug applications (NDAs), abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), and abbreviated antibiotic drug applications (AADAs) who intend to change (1) the components or composition, (2) the site of manufacture, (3) the scale-up/scale-down of manufacture, and/or (4) the manufacturing (process and equipment) of a modified release solid oral dosage form during the postapproval period.\n\nThe guidance defines (1) levels of change, (2) recommended chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) tests for each level of change, (3) recommended in vitro dissolution tests and/or in vivo bioequivalence tests for each level of change; and (4) documentation that should support the change. This guidance specifies application information that should be provided to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) to ensure continuing product quality and performance characteristics of a modified release solid oral dose formulation for specified postapproval changes.\n\nThis guidance does not comment on or otherwise affect compliance/inspection documentation that has been defined by CDER's Office of Compliance or FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs. This guidance does not affect any postapproval changes other than the ones specified. For those changes filed in a Changes Being Effected (CBE) supplement (21 CFR 314.70(c)), the FDA may, after a review of the supplemental information, decide that the changes are not approvable. For changes not addressed in this guidance, or for multiple changes submitted at one time or over a short period of time, sponsors should contact the appropriate CDER review division or consult other CDER guidances to obtain information about tests and application documentation.\n\nFDA regulations at 21 CFR 314.70(a) provide that applicants may make changes to an approved application in accordance with a guidance, notice, or regulation published in the Federal Register that provides for a less burdensome notification of the change (for example, by notification at the time a supplement is submitted or in the next annual report). This guidance permits less burdensome notice of certain postapproval changes within the meaning of SS 314.70(a).\n\nFor postapproval changes for modified release solid oral dosage forms that affect components and composition, scale-up/scale-down, site change, and manufacturing process or equipment changes, this guidance supersedes the recommendations in section 4.G of the Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) Policy and Procedure Guide 22-90 (September 11, 1990). For all other dosage forms and changes, this guidance does not affect the recommendations in Guide 22-90.\n\nII General stability considerations\n\nThe effect SUPAC-type changes have on the stability of the drug product should be evaluated. For general guidance on conducting stability studies, applicants are referred to the FDA Guideline for Submitting Documentation for the Stability of Human Drugs and Biologics (02/87). For SUPAC submissions, the following points also should be considered:\n\nIn most cases (except those involving scale up), stability data from pilot scale batches will be acceptable to support the proposed change.\n\nWhere stability data show a trend toward potency loss or degradant increase under accelerated conditions, it is recommended that historical accelerated stability data from a representative prechange batch be submitted for comparison. It is also recommended that under these circumstances, all available long-term data on test batches from ongoing studies be provided in the supplement. Submission of historical accelerated and available long-term data would facilitate review and approval of the supplement.\n\nA commitment should be included to conduct long-term stability studies through the expiration dating period, according to the approved protocol, on the first or first three (see text for details) production batches and to report the results in the annual reports.\n\nIII Components and composition -- nonrelease controlling excipient\n\nThis section of the guidance focuses on changes in nonrelease controlling excipients in the drug product. For modified release solid oral dosage forms, consideration should be given as to whether the excipient is critical or not critical to drug release. The sponsor should provide appropriate justifications for claiming any excipient(s) as a nonrelease controlling excipient in the formulation of the modified release solid oral dosage form. The functionality of each excipient should be identified. Changes in the amount of the drug substance are not addressed by this guidance. Changes in components or composition that have the effect of adding a new excipient or deleting an excipient are defined at level 3 (defined below), except as described below in Section III.A.1.a. Waiver of bioequivalence testing for a change in composition which involves only a different color, flavor or preservative may be permissible as described in 21 CFR 320.22(d)(4).\n\nA.: Level 1 Change\n\nDefinition of Level\n\nLevel 1 changes are those that are unlikely to have any detectable impact on formulation quality and performance.\n\nExamples:\n\nDeletion or partial deletion of an ingredient intended to affect the color or flavor of the drug product; or change in the ingredient of the printing ink to another approved ingredient.\n\nChanges in nonrelease controlling excipients, expressed as percentage (w/w) of total formulation, less than or equal to the following percent ranges:\n\nFiller (\\pm)5\n\nDisintegrant (\\pm)3\n\nStarch Other (\\pm)1\n\nBinder (\\pm)0.5\n\nLubricant Ca or Mg Stearate (\\pm)0.25\n\nOther (\\pm)1\n\nGlidant\n\nTalc (\\pm)1\n\nOther (\\pm)0.1\n\nFilm Coat (\\pm)1\n\nThese percentages are based on the assumption that the drug substance in the product is formulated to 100% of label/potency. The total additive effect of all nonrelease controlling excipient changes should not be more than 5%.2 The total weight of the dosage form should still be within the original approved application range.\n\nFootnote 2: Example: In a product consisting of active ingredient A, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, and magnesium stearate, the lactose and microcrystalline cellulose should not vary by more than an absolute total of 5% (e.g., lactose increases by 2.5% and microcrystalline cellulose decreases by 2.5%) relative to the target dosage form weight if it is to stay within the level 1 range.\n\nThe components (active and excipients) in the formulation should have numerical targets that represent the nominal composition of the drug product on which any future changes in the composition of the product are to be based. Allowable changes in the composition should be based on the original approved target composition and not on previous level 1 changes in the composition. For products approved with only a range for excipients, the target value may be assumed to be the midpoint of the original approved application range.\n\nTest Documentation\n\na. Chemistry documentation\n\nApplication/compendial product release requirements.\n\nStability: First production batch on long-term stability data reported in annual report.\n\nb. Dissolution documentation\n\nNone beyond application/compendial requirements.\n\nc. Bioequivalence documentation\n\nNone.\n--------------------\nContext title: SUPAC-MR- Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes- Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Dissolution Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.0213632583618164", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Drawing from the insights of ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , What are the recommendations for stability testing data of modified release dosage forms?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance is provided with regard to acceptance criteria which should be established for all new drug substances and new medicinal products, i.e. universal acceptance criteria, and those that are considered specific to individual drug substances and/or dosage forms. This guidance should not be considered all encompassing. New analytical technologies, and modifications to existing technology, are continually being developed. Such technologies should be used when justified.\n\nDosage forms addressed in this guidance include solid oral dosage forms, powders, liquid oral dosage forms, and parenteals (small and large volume). This is not meant to be an all-inclusive list, or to limit the number of dosage forms to which this guidance applies. The dosage forms presented serve as models, which may be applicable to other dosage forms which have not been discussed. The extended application of the concepts in this guidance to other dosage forms, e.g., to topical formulations (pour-on, spot-on, creams, ointments, gels) is encouraged.\n\n2 General Concepts\n\nThe following concepts are important in the development and setting of harmonized specifications. They are not universally applicable, but each should be considered in particular circumstances. This guidance presents a brief definition of each concept and an indication of the circumstances under which it may be applicable. Generally, proposals to implement these concepts should be justified by the applicant and approved by the appropriate regulatory authority before being put into effect according to 21 CFR 514.1(b)(5).\n\nPeriodic or Skip Testing\n\nPeriodic or skip testing is the performance of specified tests at release on pre-selected batches and/or at predetermined intervals, rather than on a batch-to-batch basis with the understanding that those batches not being tested still meet all acceptance criteria established for that product. This represents a less than full schedule of testing and should therefore be justified and presented to and approved by the regulatory authority prior to implementation. This concept may be applicable to, for example, residual solvents and microbiological testing, for solid oral dosage forms. It is recognized that only limited data may be available at the time of submission of an application (see section 2.5). This concept should therefore generally be implemented post-approval. When tested, any failure to meet acceptance criteria established for the periodic test should be handled by proper notification of the appropriate regulatory authority(ies). If these data demonstrate a need to restore routine testing, then batch by batch release testing should be reinstated.\n\nRelease vs. Shelf-life Acceptance Criteria\n\nThe concept of different acceptance criteria for release vs. shelf-life specifications applies to medicinal products only; it pertains to the establishment of more restrictive criteria for the release of a medicinal product than are applied to the shelf-life. Examples where this may be applicable include assay and impurity (degradation product) levels. In some regions, the concept of release limits may only be applicable to in-house limits and not to the regulatory shelf-life limits. Thus, in these regions, the regulatory acceptance criteria are the same from release throughout shelf-life; however, an applicant may choose to have tighter in-house limits at the time of release to provide increased assurance to the applicant that the product will remain within the regulatory acceptance criterion throughout its shelf-life. In the European Union, there is a regulatory requirement for distinct specifications for release and for shelf-life where different.\n\nIn-process Tests\n\nIn-process tests, as presented in this guidance, are tests which may be performed during the manufacture of either the drug substance or medicinal product, rather than as part of the formal battery of tests which are conducted prior to release.\n\nIn-process tests which are only used for the purpose of adjusting process parameters within an operating range, e.g., hardness and friability of tablet cores which will be coated and individual tablet weights, are not included in the specification.\n\nCertain tests conducted during the manufacturing process, where the acceptance criterion is identical to or tighter than the release requirement, (e.g., pH of a solution) may be sufficient to satisfy specification requirements when the test is included in the specification. However, this approach should be validated to show that test results or product performance characteristics do not change from the in-process stage to finished product.\n\nDesign and Development Considerations\n\nThe experience and data accumulated during the development of a new drug substance or product should form the basis for the setting of specifications. It may be possible to propose excluding or replacing certain tests on this basis. Some examples are:\n\nmicrobiological testing for drug substances and solid dosage forms which have been shown during development not to support microbial viability or growth (see Decision Trees #6 and #8).\n\nextractables from product containers where it has been reproducibly shown that either no extractables are found in the medicinal product or the levels meet accepted standards for safety.\n\nparticle size testing may fall into this category, may be performed as an in-process test, or may be performed as a release test, depending on its relevance to product performance.\n\ndissolution testing for immediate release solid oral medicinal products made from highly water soluble drug substances may be replaced by disintegration testing, if these products have been demonstrated during development to have consistently rapid drug release characteristics (see Decision Trees #7(1) and #7(2)).\n\n2.5.1 Contains Non-Binding Recommendations\n\nIt is recognized that only a limited amount of data may be available at the time of filing, which can influence the process of setting acceptance criteria. As a result it may be important to propose revised acceptance criteria as additional experience is gained with the manufacture of a particular drug substance or drug product (example: acceptance limits for a specific impurity). The basis for the acceptance criteria at the time of filing should necessarily focus on safety and efficacy.\n\nWhen only limited data are available, the initially approved tests and acceptance criteria should be reviewed as more information is collected, with a view towards possible modification. This could involve loosening, as well as tightening, acceptance criteria as appropriate.\n\nParametric Release\n\nParametric release can be used as an operational alternative to routine release testing for the medicinal product in certain cases when approved by the regulatory authority (see 21 CFR 514.1(b)(5)). Sterility testing for terminally sterilized medicinal products is one example. In this case, the release of each batch is based on satisfactory results from monitoring specific parameters, e.g., temperature, pressure, and time during the terminal sterilization phase(s) of medicinal product manufacturing. These parameters can generally be more accurately controlled and measured, so that they are more reliable in predicting sterility assurance than is end-product sterility testing. Appropriate laboratory tests (e.g., chemical or physical indicator) may be included in the parametric release program. It is important to note that the sterilization process should be adequately validated before parametric release is proposed and maintenance of a validated state should be demonstrated by revvalidation at established intervals. When parametric release is performed, the attribute which is indirectly controlled (e.g., sterility), together with a reference to the associated test procedure, still should be included in the specifications.\n\nAlternative Procedures\n\nAlternative procedures are those which may be used to measure an attribute when such procedures control the quality of the drug substance or medicinal product to an extent that is comparable or superior to the official procedure.\n\nPharmacopoeial Tests and Acceptance Criteria\n\nReferences to certain procedures are found in pharmacopoeias in each region. Wherever they are appropriate, pharmacopoeial procedures should be utilized. Whereas differences in pharmacopoeial procedures and/or acceptance criteria have existed among the regions, a harmonized specification is possible only if the procedures and acceptance criteria defined are acceptable to regulatory authorities in all regions.\n\nThe full utility of this Guidance is dependent on the successful completion of harmonization of pharmacopoeial procedures for several attributes commonly considered in the specification for new drug substances or new medicinal products. The Pharmacopoeial Discussion Group (PDG) of the European Pharmacopoeia, the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP), and the United States Pharmacopoeia has expressed a commitment to achieving harmonization of the procedures in a timely fashion.\n\nWhere harmonization has been achieved, an appropriate reference to the harmonized procedure and acceptance criteria is considered acceptable for a specification in all three regions. For example, after harmonization, sterility data generated using the JP procedure, as well as the JP procedure itself and its acceptance criteria, are considered acceptable for registration in all three regions. To signify the harmonized status of theseprocedures, the pharmacopoeias have agreed to include a statement in their respective texts which indicates that the procedures and acceptance criteria from all three pharmacopoeias are considered equivalent and are, therefore, interchangeable.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #176 (VICH GL39) Specifications- Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Veterinary Drug Substances and New Medicinal Products- Chemical Substances \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.735827445983887"], "According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide: Chapter IV.

A measurable amount is an amount that exceeds the amount that can be declared as \"zero\" in the nutrition label of conventional foods, as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(c). If present in a measurable amount, trans fat must be listed on a separate line underneath the listing of saturated fat by January 1, 2006.\n\nCalories from saturated fat and the amount of polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, sugar alcohol, and other carbohydrate may be declared, but they must be declared when a claim is made about them.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) (see 68 FR 41434 at 41505, July 11, 3003)\n\nMust I declare vitamins and minerals (other than vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron) listed in 21 CFR 101. 9(c)(8)(iv) and (c)(9)?\n\nNo. You are only required to declare them when they are added to the product for purposes of supplementation, or if you make a claim about them.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\n8 Am I required to list any other nutrients if I make a claim about them?\n\nYes. When you make a claim about calories from saturated fat, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated fat, sugar alcohol, monounsaturated fat, other carbohydrate, and soluble fiber, you must list that nutrient.\nYes. Dietary ingredients for which no daily values have been established must be listed by their common or usual names when they are present in a dietary supplement. They must be identified as having no Daily Values by use of a symbol in the column for \"% Daily Value\" that refers to the footnote \"Daily Value Not Established.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(F) and (b)(3)\n\nIf I use a magnesium salt as a binder, where must I declare it?\n\nYou must list the specific magnesium salt in the ingredient statement below the \"Supplement Facts\" panel, not in the \"Nutrition Facts\" panel. Ingredients in dietary supplements that are not dietary ingredients, such as binders, excipients, fillers, must be included in the ingredient statement.\n\n21 CFR 101.4(g)\n\nMust I declare vitamin E when it occurs naturally in my product and I make no claim for it?\n\nNo. Because Vitamin E is not one of the 14 mandatory dietary ingredients, it does not need to be declared when it occurs naturally.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\nMay I declare protein on the label if my product contains only individual amino acids?\n\nNo. You may not declare protein on your products that contain only amino acids.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)\n\nMust I list the dietary ingredients in my products in a specified order?\n\nYes. You must list the dietary ingredients that have Daily Values in the same order as for the labels of conventional foods, except that vitamins, minerals and electrolytes are grouped together. This results in the following order for vitamins and minerals:\n\nVitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, calcium, iron, phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, and potassium.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)\n\nMay I use synonyms for my dietary ingredients?\n\nYes. You may use the following synonyms in parentheses after your dietary ingredients: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), thiamin (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folate (folacin or folic acid), and calories (energy). Alternatively, you may list \"folic acid\" or \"folacin\" without parentheses in place of \"folate.\" You may also express energy content parenthetically in kiljoules immediately following the caloric content.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)(2)\n\n23.8.25.2.37.7221 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 101.9(c)\n\nPercent Of Daily Value (% DV)\n\nWhat is the % DV?\n\nThe % DV is the percent of the Daily Value (i.e., Reference Daily Intakes or Daily Reference Value) of a dietary ingredient that is in a serving of the product.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) and (9)\n\nDo I need to list the % DV on my label?\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV. Nutrition Labeling \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.436607837677002", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: The \"Supplement Facts\" nutrition information (referred to as a panel) must be enclosed in a box by using hairlines. The title, \"Supplement Facts,\" must be larger than all other print in the panel and, unless impractical, must be set full width of the panel. The title and all headings must be bolded to distinguish them from other information.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n36. How must I present the information in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nYou must present all information using the following:\n\na. A single easy-to-read type style;\n\nb. All black or one color type, printed on a white or neutral contrasting background, whenever practical;3. Upper- and lowercase letters, except that you may use all uppercase lettering on small packages (i.e., packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches); d. At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text); and e. Letters that do not touch.\n37. What are the type size requirements for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nExcept as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must set information other than the title, headings, and footnotes in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. You also must use a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label for the title \"Supplement Facts.\" You may set the column headings and footnotes in type no smaller than 6 point type. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nMust I use hairlines in the Supplement Facts panel?\n\nExcept for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must use a hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text to separate each dietary ingredient from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it. FDA has provided an exception for certain packages with space constraints. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nHow closely must I follow the \"Examples of graphic enhancements used by the FDA\" in appendix B to Part 101?\n\nYou are not required to follow Appendix B to Part 101. Appendix B and its specifications are a model, which FDA has suggested in the interest of uniformity of presentation. For example, 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(i) requires the use of an \"easy-to-read\" type style, not specifically Helvetica type, as suggested in Appendix B.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)(9)\n\nHow do I provide nutrition labeling when my product contains two or more packets of supplements (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening)?\n\nYou may present the information for each packet (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening) in an individual nutrition label or you may use an aggregate nutrition label. For two packets, this would consist of five columns. List all of the dietary ingredients in the first column. List the amounts and percents of the morning packet in the second and third columns and similar information for the evening packet in the fourth and fifth columns (see the illustration of aggregate nutrition labeling in 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iii)).\n\nCompliance\n\nWhat kind of samples will FDA collect to determine compliance with 21 CFR 101.36?\n\nFDA will collect a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller. FDA will randomly select these packages.\n\nWhat if it is not technically feasible for me to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements?\n\nFDA may permit you to use an alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9). If your firm needs such special allowances, you must make your request in writing to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(f)(2)\n\nMust dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?\n\nFor dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value.\n\nExemptions\n\nWhat are the circumstances in which my dietary supplement products would be exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements? Your dietary supplement product is not required to have a \"Supplement Facts\" panel if: a. Your firm is a small business that has not more than $50,000 gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers or not more than $500,000 per year from total sales in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1); b. You sell less than 100,000 units of the product annually, your firm has fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(2) andyou file an annual notification with FDA as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(18)(iv); or c. You ship the product in bulk form, do not distribute it to consumers in such form, and you supply it for use in the manufacture of other dietary supplements in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(3). The two exemptions for small businesses and low-volume products (a. and b. above) are available to you only if your products' labels bear no claims or other nutrition information.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(h)(1) - (3)\n\nSpecial Labeling Provisions\n\nWhat are small packages?\n\nSmall packages are those packages having less than 12 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)\n\nWhat is the telephone provision for small packages?\n\nIn lieu of a \"Supplement Facts\" panel, you may print labels for small packages with a telephone number or address that consumers can use to obtain nutrition information. You may use a telephone number or an address in place of the \"Supplement Facts\" panel only if you place no claims or other nutrition information on the product label.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size that I may use for small packages?\n\nYou may use a type size no smaller than 4-5 point for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of small packages.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(i)\n\nMay I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small package?\n\nYes. You may use a tabular format on small packages. You also may present \"Supplement Facts\" information in a linear (i.e., string) fashion if the label will not accommodate the \"Supplement Facts\" panel in a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j) (13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display.)\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n\nWhat are intermediate-sized packages?\n\nIntermediate-sized packages are those packages having from 12 to 40 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(ii)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size for intermediate-sized packages?The \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of intermediate-sized packages must use type size no smaller than 6 point, except that type no smaller than 4-5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches that list more than 16 dietary ingredients. Also, 4-5 point type may be used on packages with less than 20 square inches that list more than 8 dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the type size used in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an inner container may be as small as needed to accommodate all required information if the \"Supplement Facts\" on the outer container meets these type size requirements.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv)\n51. May I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an intermediate-sized package? You may use a tabular format on an intermediate-sized package if the package shape or size cannot accommodate vertical columns. You may use a linear format if the label will not accommodate a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n52. May I abbreviate on the labels of intermediate- sized packages? You may use the abbreviations in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel for small and intermediate-sized packages, e.g, \"Serv size\" for \"Serving Size\" and \"Servings\" for \"Servings Per Container.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B)\n53. Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV. Nutrition Labeling \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.0493738651275635", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: How Do the Nutrient Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels Differ?\n\nBoth the content and format of the Supplement Facts label have been updated to correspond to the Nutrition Facts label, wherever possible. However, there are still some differences between the two. On the Supplement Facts label, information on calories and serving size was not made more prominent through increased type size, as it has been on the Nutrition Facts label. While the percentage of the RDI for protein for foods purported to be for infants through 12 months of age is allowed on Nutrition Facts labels, this declaration must be omitted for Supplement Facts labels (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)).\n\nIn addition, the new ordering for vitamins and minerals on the Supplement Facts label is as follows: vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate and folic acid, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, choline, calcium, iron,phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, potassium, and fluoride (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(B)).\n\nHas Nutrient Compliance or the Level of Variance Allowed Changed?\n\nThere are still two classes of nutrients for compliance purposes. Class I covers those added nutrients in fortified or fabricated foods (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(i)), and Class II nutrients are those that are naturally occurring, or indigenous, nutrients (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(ii)). For compliance purposes, if both Class I and Class II nutrients are present in the final food product, then the total amount of the nutrient (both indigenous and exogenous) is subject to class I requirements.\n\nThe updated rule does not change the level of variances allowed in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and 101.9(g)(5), but the rule also now includes soluble fiber and insoluble fiber in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and added sugars in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Therefore, 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) now states that a food with a label declaration of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat will be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the FD&C Act, unless the nutrient content of the composite is formulated to be at least equal to the declared value for the vitamin, mineral, protein, or dietary fiber meeting the definition of a Class I nutrient (potassium has been removed), or the nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to 80 percent of the declared value for the vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber meeting the definition of a Class II nutrient (potassium and \"other carbohydrate\" have been removed). Our regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5), state that a food with a label declaration of calories, sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium will be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the FD&C Act if the nutrient content of the composite is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label. Reasonable excesses of soluble fiber, insoluble fiber and sugar alcohols, and reasonable deficiencies of added sugars are also now acceptable within current good manufacturing practices.\n\nWhich Version of the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International Should be Used?\n\nThe final rule now incorporates by reference the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International, 19th edition (2012) (21 CFR 101.9(l)(1)(i)).\n\nVIII. How Do I Comply with the Formatting Requirements?\n\nThere are required formats for Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels. We strongly recommend that the nutrition information be presented using the graphic specifications below (see also Appendix B to 21 CFR part 101 and Ref. 8).\n\nVIII.1 How Do I Comply with the Standard Version of the Nutrition Facts Label?\n\nFigures 3 through 5 reflect what a standard vertical Nutrition Facts label must look like (see 21 CFR 101.9(d)(12)). This format is to be used except on foods where the tabular display is\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]\n\n11 How Has the Formatting Changed for the \"Nutrition Facts\" Header on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe \"Nutrition Facts\" heading must be in a type size no smaller than all other print size in the nutrition label, except for the numerical information for \"Calories,\" which according to 21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii) must be in a type size no smaller than 22 point for the standard label (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)). It must be set the full width of the nutrient information, unless impractical (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)). It is not required to be set the full width of the nutrient information for labels presented according to the following formats: tabular display, aggregate display, tabular dual column display, tabular display for small or intermediate-sized packages, and linear display for small or intermediate-sized packages (21 CFR 101.9(d)(2)).\n\nA thin horizontal line (i.e., a hairline rule) is to be inserted directly beneath the Nutrition Facts heading, before the servings per container statement (except on the linear display discussed below) (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(v)).\n\nFigure 5: Standard Vertical, Mandatory and Voluntary Nutrients\n\n11.2 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declaration of Calories on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe type size has increased for \"Calories\" and the numeric value of \"Calories.\" On the standard vertical display of the Nutrition Facts label, the numeric value of \"Calories\" must be listed in a type size no smaller than 22 point, as well as in bold or extra bold type highlighting (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). The word \"Calories\" must be listed in a type size no smaller than 16 point, as well as in bold or extra bold type highlighting (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 3 through 5.\n\n3 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declarations of Serving Size and Servings Per Container on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe \" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container\" declaration now immediately follows the \"Nutrition Facts\" heading and must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i)).\n\nBelow \" (\\underline{\\phantom{\\rule{0.0pt}{0.0pt}}}) servings per container\" is the declaration of \"Serving size.\" \"Serving size\" is to be highlighted in bold or extra bold and in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(ii)). While the \"Serving size\" declaration is still left-justified, the corresponding numerical value is now right-justified on Nutrition Facts labels only (not on Supplement Facts labels), provided that adequate space is available (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(ii)). If the \"Serving size\" declaration does not fit in the allocated space, then a type size no smaller than 8 point may be used on packages of any size.\n\nFor further information on the updates made to the Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed and Serving Size regulations, please reference the Small Entity Compliance Guide entitled \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments: Guidance for Industry\" (Ref. 9), as well as the final guidance entitled \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Size-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics\" (Ref. 10).\n\n4 How Has the Formatting Changed for the Declaration of Vitamins and Minerals on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nNutrient information for vitamins and minerals (except sodium) are to be separated from information regarding other nutrients by a bar (21 CFR 101.9(d)(8)). They may be listed vertically (Figures 3 and 5) or horizontally (Figure 4). If listed horizontally in two columns, then vitamin D and calcium should be listed on the first line, and iron and potassium should be listed on the second line (21 CFR 101.9(d)(8)). Nutrient information must be in a type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)).\n\n11.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhile \"Calories from fat\" can no longer be declared, \"Calories from saturated fat\" is still allowed (21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(ii)). When declared, it is to be indented under the statement of calories and must be in a type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(5)).\n\n11.4 Where, and How, Do I Declare \"Added Sugars\" on a Standard Vertical Label?\n\nThe statement \"Includes 'X' g Added Sugars\" must be used to declare added sugars content (except on packages of single ingredient sugars), and this statement must be indented directly beneath the listing for \"Total Sugars\" on the Nutrition Facts label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The 'X' will be filled in with the respective added sugar content (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). In Appendix B to 21 CFR 101, we illustrate our recommendation to shorten the length of the hairline requirement between total sugars and added sugars to help denote that \"added sugars\" are a subcomponent of \"total sugars.\" As mentioned above, a DRV has been established for added sugars for most population groups, and the % Daily Value declaration is required as well (21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii)). Added sugars must also be declared on the Supplement Facts label (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAdded sugars content must be expressed to the nearest gram, except in the following circumstances:\n\nThe statement \"Contains less than 1 gram\" or, alternatively, \"less than 1 gram\" may be used if a serving contains less than 1 gram added sugars; or\n\nThe added sugars content may be expressed as zero if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram.\n\nSee 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.0188891887664795", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: 21 CFR 101.13(h)(4)(iii)\n* 14._When may I make a \"high\" or \"good source\" claim? You may make a \"high\" claim when your dietary supplement contains at least 20% of the Daily Value (DV) (i.e. the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) or Daily Reference Value (DRV)) of the nutrient that is the subject of the claim per reference amount customarily consumed. You may make a \"good source\" claim when your dietary supplement contains 10 to 19% of DV. 21 CFR 101.54(b)(i) and (c)(i)\n* 15._Is there any way that I can let consumers know that my product contains nutrients without DVs, such as phosphatidylserine? You may make a statement about a nutrient for which there is no established Daily Value (DV) so long as the claim specifies only the amount of the nutrient per serving and does not imply that there is a lot or a little of that nutrient in the product (e.g., \"x grams of phosphatidylserine\"). You must list the dietary ingredient for which there is no DV and the quantitative amount of that dietary ingredient in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel in the section below the nutrients with DVs. These dietary ingredients must be identified as having no DVs by the use of the footnote \"Daily Value Not Established.\" 21 CFR 101.13(i)(3) and 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)\n* 16._May I make statements using the words \"contains\" and \"provides\" for nutrients without DVs? Yes. You may use such statements if, and only if, you include the specific amount of the nutrient (e.g., \"Contains x grams of phosphatidylserine per serving\" or \"Provides x g of phosphatidylserine\"). 21 CFR 101.13(i)(3) and 101.54(c)(1)\n* 17._Is a statement outside of the \"Supplement Facts\" panel that describes the percentage of the RDI of a vitamin or mineral in my dietary supplement product a nutrient content claim? Yes. These claims are considered nutrient content claims and are not exempt from bearing a disclosure statement when required. 21 CFR 101.13(b)(1), (c) and (i) back to top\n* 18._Am I permitted to make a \"low\" or \"free\" claim when my dietary supplement product is specially processed? Yes. If a similar dietary supplement is normally expected to contain a nutrient and your dietary supplement is specially processed, altered, formulated, or reformulated as to lower the amount of the nutrient in the food, remove the nutrient in the food, or not include the nutrient, then you are permitted to make a \"low\" or \"free\" claim as applicable.\n\n21 CFR 101.13(e)(1)\n* 19. May I make a \"low\" or \"free\" claim for my dietary supplement product if it is normally low in or free of a nutrient, and I use an appropriate disclaimer? No. However, a claim may be used if you indicate that it refers to all products of that type and not merely to that particular brand. 21 CFR 101.13(e)(2)\n* 20. Are claims such as \"100 percent milk free\" and \"contains no preservatives\" subject to the nutrient content claim requirements? No. Such statements are not nutrient content claims so long as they are not used in a nutrient context that would make them an implied claim under 21 CFR 101.13(b)(2). The statement \"100 percent milk free\" is generally a claim to facilitate avoidance of milk products. \"Contains no preservatives\" is a claim about a substance that does not have a nutritive function. 21 CFR 101.65(b)(1) and (b)(2)\n* 21. Is a \"no sugar\" claim subject to the nutrient content claim requirements? Yes. Sugar content claims are subject to the nutrient content claim requirements. 21 CFR 101.60(c)(1)\n* 22. When can the nutrient content claim \"no added sugar\" be used? To avoid misleading consumers, the term \"no added sugar\" should be limited to dietary supplements containing no added sugars that are normally expected to contain them. 21 CFR 101.60(c)(2)(iv)\n* 23. Must a dietary supplement bearing a \"sugar free\" claim be labeled \"low calorie\"? No. A \"low calorie\" claim may not be made on dietary supplements, except when an equivalent amount of a dietary supplement that the labeled dietary supplement resembles and for which it substitutes (e.g., another protein supplement), normally exceeds the definition for \"low calorie.\" 21 CFR 101.60(c)(1)(iii)(A)\n\nback to top\n\nAntioxidant Claims\n\nWhat is a nutrient content claim for antioxidants? It is a nutrient content claim that characterizes the level of one or more antioxidant nutrients present in a dietary supplement. 21 CFR 101.54(g)23.8.25.3.723\n\nMust the nutrient or dietary ingredient have an RDI to qualify for an antioxidant claim?\n\nYes, except as noted in question #28 below.\n\n21 CFR 101.54(g)(1)\n\nAre there any other requirements for a dietary supplement to qualify for an antioxidant nutrient content claim?\n\nYes. The nutrients that are the subject of the claim must have recognized antioxidant activity. In addition, the level of each nutrient that is the subject of the claim must be sufficient to qualify for either \"high\" claims in 21 CFR 101.54(b), \"good source\" claims in 21 CFR 101.54(c), or \"more\" claims in 21 CFR 101.54(e). For example, for a product to qualify for a \"high in antioxidant vitamin C\" claim, it must contain 20 percent or more of the RDI for vitamin C. That is, it must meet the level for \"high\" defined in $101.54(b). For a product to qualify for a \"good source of antioxidant vitamin C\" claim it must contain 10 to 19 percent of the RDI for vitamin C.\n\n21 CFR 101.54(g)(2) and (g)(3)\n\nWhat do you mean by \"recognized antioxidant activity\"?\n\nRecognized antioxidant activity means that there is scientific evidence that, following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, the substance participates in physiological, biochemical, or cellular processes that inactivate free radicals or prevent free radical-initiated chemical reactions.\n\n21 CFR 101.54(g)(2)\n\nMay beta-carotene, which does not have an RDI, be the subject of an antioxidant claim?\n\nYes. You may make a claim for beta-carotene when the level of vitamin A present as beta-carotene is sufficient to qualify for the claim. For example, you may make the claim \"good source of antioxidant beta-carotene\" when 10% or more of the RDI for vitamin A is present as beta-carotene.\n\n21 CFR 101.54(g)(3)\n\nMust I list all antioxidants present in my product when making an antioxidant nutrient content claim?\n\nYes. The names of the nutrients that are the subject of the claim must be included as part of the claim (e.g., \"high in antioxidant vitamins C and E\"). Alternatively, you may link the term \"antioxidant\" or \"antioxidants\" in a nutrient content claim (as in \"high in antioxidants\") by a symbol (e.g., an asterisk) that refers to the same symbol that appears elsewhere on the same panel followed by the name or names of the nutrients with recognized antioxidant activity. This list should be in letters at least 1/16 of an inch in height or no smaller than half the type size of the largest nutrient content claim, whichever is larger.\n\n23.8.25.5.723\n\nCan I make other claims that describe the antioxidant properties of my product?Yes. You may craft a statement, subject to section 403(a) of the act (the false and misleading provisions), that describes how a dietary ingredient that does not have an RDI participates in antioxidant processes. Likewise, structure/function claims may be made about antioxidants as long as such claims are not false or misleading and, if appropriate, are made in accordance with section 403(r)(6) of the act (the provisions for statements of nutritional support). For example, a claim that reads \", involved in antioxidant processes\" would be acceptable as long as it is:\n\n1) truthful and not misleading; and\n\n2) meets the requirements of section 403(r)(6) of the act (see questions #44 through #51 of this chapter).\n\n62 FR 49868 at 49873 (September 23, 1997)\n\nHigh Potency Claims31. Can I use the term \"high potency\" to describe an individual nutrient?Yes. You may use the term \"high potency\" on your dietary supplement labels to describe individual vitamins or minerals that are present at 100 percent or more of the RDI per reference amount customarily consumed.\n\n21 CFR 101.54(f)(1)(i)\n\nCan the term \"high potency\" be used for combination products, such as botanicals with vitamins?Yes. However, when you use the term \"high potency\" to describe individual vitamins or minerals in your product that contains other nutrients or dietary ingredients, you must clearly identify which vitamin or mineral you are describing by the term \"high potency\" (e.g., \"Botanical 'X' with high potency vitamin E\").\n\n21 CFR 101.54(f)(1)(ii)\n\nHow many nutrients must be present at 100% of the DV for a multinutrient product to qualify for the term \"high potency?\"You may use the term \"high potency\" on your multinutrient product to describe the product if it contains 100 percent or more of the RDI for at least two-thirds of the vitamins and minerals that are listed in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv), and that are present in the product at 2 percent or more of the RDI (e.g., \"High potency multivitamin, multimineral dietary supplement tablets\").\n\n21 CFR 101.54(f)(2)\n\nPercentage Claims34. What is a percentage claim?It is a statement that characterizes the percentage level of a dietary ingredient for which a reference daily intake (RDI) or daily reference value (DRV) has not been established. You may make a percentage claim on your products without a regulation that specifically defines such a statement. These statements must be accompanied by any disclosure statement required under 21 CFR 101.13(h). There are simple percentage claims and comparative percentage claims.\n\n21 CFR 101.13(q)(3)(ii)\n35.What is a simple percentage claim?\n\nIt is a statement that characterizes the percentage level of a dietary ingredient for which there is no RDI or DRV (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids, amino acids, phytochemicals). The statement of the actual amount of the dietary ingredient per serving must be declared next to the percentage statement (e.g., \"4o percent omega-3 fatty acids, 10 mg per capsule\").\n\n21 CFR 101.13(q)(3)(ii)(A)\n36.What is a comparative percentage claim?\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter VI. Claims \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.7241277694702148", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels  What nutrients am I required to list in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n--------------------\nContext: Regarding dietary supplements, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium must be declared when they are present in a dietary supplement in quantitative amounts by weight that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling of foods in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c). (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAs for the phrase \"levels of significance,\" as used in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii) and 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and whether the phrase refers to statistical testing of hypotheses or mathematical concepts related to the degree of accuracy starting with the first nonzero digit, the phrase \"levels of significance\" refers to the degree of accuracy when rounding nutrients for purposes of declaring quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the label.\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c), provide specific rounding requirements for nutrients such as sodium. Before we issued the Nutrition Facts label final rule, sodium and potassium content was to be expressed as zero when the serving contained less than 5 milligrams (mg), to the nearest 5 mg increment when the serving contained less than or equal to 140 mg, and to the nearest 10 mg increment when the serving contained more than 140 mg. The Nutrition\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFacts label final rule amended 21 CFR 101.9(c)(5) to replace the requirements for the labeling of potassium with those of fluoride and amended 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) to establish an RDI for potassium and add it to the list of vitamins and minerals with RDIs. The requirements for declaring the quantitative amount of potassium are now the same as those for other vitamins and minerals with RDIs.\n\nThe RDIs for some vitamins and minerals are small numerical values (e.g., copper 0.9 mg). Nutrients with an RDI of less than 5 would not be able to be declared on the Supplement Facts label if they contain less than 2 percent of the RDI (e.g. 2 percent of the RDI for copper is 0.018 mg) and the amount is declared to the nearest mg or microgram (mcg) (e.g. if the amount of copper in a serving of the product is 0.017, but is rounded to zero). The vitamins and minerals with an RDI of less than 5 mg or mcg are thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, copper, and manganese. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest hundredth of a mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 5 mg or mcg, but less than 50 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest tenth of a mg or mcg per serving. The vitamins or minerals with an RDI of at least 5 mg or mcg but less than 50 mg or mcg are iron, vitamin D, vitamin E, niacin, biotin, pantothenic acid, zinc, chromium, and molybdenum. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest tenth of a mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg, but less than 250 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest mg or mcg. The vitamins or minerals with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg but less than 250 mg or mcg are vitamin C, vitamin K, iodine, and selenium. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the minerals with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg but less than 250 mg or mcg are vitamin C, vitamin K, iodine, and selenium.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended for conventional food and dietary supplement manufacturers. It provides questions and answers on topics related to compliance with our final rules issued on May 27, 2016, entitled \"Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels\" (81 FR 33742; the \"Nutrition Facts label final rule\") and \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments\" (81 FR 34000; the \"serving size final rule\") (codified at title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 101 (21 CFR part 101)). This guidance also discusses labeling of added sugars, as well as formatting for lines (e.g. thickness of lines) and leading (e.g. space between lines) in the examples of graphics used by FDA on the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nIn this guidance, \"you\" (or \"I\") refers to a manufacturer of conventional food or dietary supplements.\n\nII Background\n\nOn May 27, 2016, we published the Nutrition Facts label and the serving size final rules related to the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels, which amended our labeling regulations for foods to provide updated nutrition information to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices.\n\nBelow is a summary of the combined major provisions of the Nutrition Facts label final rule and serving size final rule.\n\nThe final rules revise the Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts labels by:\n\nRemoving the declaration of \"Calories from fat\";\n\nRequiring the declaration of the gram (g) amount of \"added sugars\" in a serving of a product, establishing a Daily Reference Value (DRV) for added sugars, and requiring the percent Daily Value (DV) declaration for added sugars;\n\nChanging \"Sugars\" to \"Total Sugars\" and requiring that \"Includes 'X' g Added Sugars\" be indented and declared directly below \"Total Sugars\";\n\nUpdating the list of vitamins and minerals of public health significance;\n\nUpdating certain reference values used in the declaration of percent DVs of nutrients on the Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts labels;\n\nRevising the format of the Nutrition Facts labels to increase the prominence of the declaration of \"Calories\";\n\nRemoving the requirement for the footnote table listing the reference values for certain nutrients for 2,000 and 2,500 calorie diets;\n\nRequiring the maintenance of records to support the declarations of certain nutrients under specified circumstances;\n\nAmending the definition of a single-serving container;\n\nRequiring dual-column labeling for certain packages;\n\nAmending several reference amounts customarily consumed that are used by manufacturers to determine their label serving size; and * Establishing an effective date of July 26, 2016, and a compliance date of January 1, 2020, for manufacturers with more than $10 million in food sales (originally scheduled to be July 26, 2018) and January 1, 2021, for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales (originally scheduled to be July 26, 2019).2 Footnote 2: On October 2, 2017, FDA issued a proposed rule that would extend the compliance dates to January 1, 2020 (i.e., for manufacturers with more than $10 million in food sales) and January 1, 2021 (i.e., for manufacturers with less than $10 million in food sales) (82 FR 45753). We finalized the changes to the compliance date in the Federal Register of May 4, 2018 (83 FR 19619).\n\nIII. Questions and Answers on Compliance Issues\n\nMust the updated Nutrition or Supplement Facts label appear on all foods sold by the applicable compliance date? After publication of the final rule, we included a frequently asked question on our website asking \"When must the label be displayed on food packages?\" In our response, we stated that the revised labels were to be displayed on food products that are initially introduced into interstate commerce on or after the compliance date, and said we would address the issue further in guidance. We received a number of questions about products at various points in the distribution chain and whether the product would need to bear the new version of the Nutrition or Supplement Facts label. After further consideration, we are providing the following guidance. Products that are labeled (i.e., when the label is placed on the product) on or after the applicable compliance date must bear a nutrition label that meets our new nutrition labeling requirements in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36. Products that are labeled before the applicable compliance date do not need to be in compliance with the new labeling requirements, and therefore, do not need to bear the new nutrition label. We consider the date the food product was labeled for purposes of determining whether the product must bear a nutrition label that meets the new requirements. We would not consider the location of the food in the distribution chain to determine whether a food product must bear a nutrition label that meets our new nutrition labeling requirements. For example, the food product, whether labeled before or after the compliance date, may be at the manufacturing facility awaiting distribution, at a warehouse awaiting further distribution, in transit to the United States to be offered for import, or on the store shelf of a U.S. retail establishment. We do not object to the use of a sticker for providing a revised nutrition label that meets our new requirements in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 before new packaging is printed. The sticker label should not cover any other mandatory information and should adhere to the package during normal handling.\n\nWhen determining whether labels need to be in compliance with the new requirements, should the determination as to whether my company has $10 million or more in annual food sales be based on domestic food sales or total food sales, including international sales, and how many years of sales should I consider? To determine whether a company has $10 million or more in annual food sales, a firm can either take the smallest sales volume from the previous three years (e.g., 2013, 2014, and 2015), or alternately the firm can take the average of the previous three years sales volume. A firm's total (domestic plus international) food sales best reflects the firm's resources and, thus, ability to comply with the final rules by the applicable compliance date.\n\nAre there certain approved companies or nutrition databases that manufacturers can use to get the nutrition values for their products? FDA does not approve nutrition databases. However, the United States Department of Agriculture provides nutrition information for a number of foods, and there are also several commercially available nutrition databases you can use to determine nutrition values for your products.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.2956962287425995"], "As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 40: See section 513(i)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act; 21 CFR 807.100(b). See also the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications [510(k)].\n\nFDA considers the product's relative safety and effectiveness in the substantial equivalence determination, and safety and effectiveness considerations are also critical to the Agency's evaluation of compliance with any applicable special controls, all of which FDA has determined to be necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the product type.\n\nThe following products cannot be cleared in a 510(k) submission:\n\nProduct with a new intended use as compared to the predicate product\n\nProduct with different technological characteristics than the predicate product if such differences raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate product.41\n\nFootnote 41: Ibid.\n\nGenerally, a device that is not combined with a drug or biological product constituent part could not be successfully used as a predicate for a 510(k) for a device-led combination product. This is because the addition of the drug or biological product constituent part would likely result in a new intended use and/or constitute a different technological characteristic that raises different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate. In addition, a product with a different active ingredient from a predicate would differ significantly in features such as design and materials, which would likely raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as well.42\n\nFootnote 42: In certain instances, it may be possible for special controls to specify multiple specific active ingredients or an active ingredient class, provided general and special controls are sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the product.\n\nSee annex for illustrative examples on how these principles can be applied.\n\nDrug-Led Combination Products\n\nAn NDA or ANDA is generally the appropriate marketing authorization pathway for a drug-led combination product. This discussion outlines current Agency thinking on the availability of the NDA and ANDA pathways to obtain marketing authorization for drug-led combination products.\n\n1.1.1 New Drug Application (NDA)\n\nAn NDA is generally the appropriate pathway for drug-led combination products other than generic versions of already-approved drug-led combination products. An NDA for a drug-led combination product must contain, among other things, a demonstration of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling.\n\nThere are two types of NDAs described in section 505 of the FD&C Act. A 505(b)(1) application, also known as a stand-alone NDA, contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness that were conducted by or for the applicant or for which the applicant has a right of reference or use. A 505(b)(2) application also contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, but at least some of the safety or effectiveness information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use.43 Section 505(b)(2) permits reliance on FDA'sfinding of safety and/or effectiveness for an approved drug product (or an approved drug-led combination product), as well as on published literature. The 505(b)(2) pathway should not be used to obtain approval of duplicates of existing drug-led combination products that are eligible for approval under section 505(j) of the FD&C Act (see next section) (see 21 CFR 314.101(d)(9)). Both 505(b)(1) and 505(b)(2) applications are submitted under section 505(b)(1) and approved under section 505(c) of the FD&C Act.\n\nBy way of example, a 505(b)(1) application may be appropriate for a drug-led combination product that contains a new molecular entity, such as a novel corticosteroid for treatment of asthma delivered via inhalation. The drug-device combination product may, for example, be an inhalation aerosol (also known as a metered dose inhaler (MDI) or inhalation powder (also known as a dry powder inhaler (DPI)). These products consist of a drug formulation and a container closure system that includes, or is, a device constituent part. A 505(b)(2) application may be appropriate, however, if, for example, the corticosteroid has already been approved as an oral tablet and the sponsor seeks to rely upon FDA's finding of safety and/or effectiveness for the tablet dosage form in seeking approval of a drug-device combination product (MDI or DPI consisting of the drug formulation containing the corticosteroid and the container closure system that includes, or is, the device constituent part), provided that the 505(b)(2) applicant establishes a scientific bridge to demonstrate that the extent of reliance on the oral tablet product is scientifically appropriate, any differences between the proposed and relied upon products are otherwise supported, and the applicant complies with additional requirements, including but not limited to requirements related to patent certification described in section 505(b)(2)&(3) of the FD&C Act.44 A 505(b)(2) applicant could also rely, in part, upon FDA's NDA approval of a drug-device combination product containing the corticosteroid indicated for treatment of asthma as one source of support for approval of a drug-device combination product containing the same corticosteroid for treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Again, the 505(b)(2) applicant would need to establish a scientific bridge to demonstrate that reliance is appropriate, would need to submit data to support differences between the products, and would need to comply with requirements for a 505(b)(2) application (including but not limited to requirements related to patent certification).45\n\nFootnote 44: In addition, approval of the 505(b)(2) application might be delayed because of exclusivity or patent protections for a listed drug.\n\nFootnote 45: Ibid.\n\nii.2.2 Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA)\n\nAn ANDA is generally the appropriate pathway for a drug-led combination product that has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, conditions of use, and (with certain permissible differences) labeling as a product (i.e., a reference listed drug46 (RLD)) previously approved under section 505(c) of the FD&C Act.47 In addition to the above, an ANDA must also include sufficient information to demonstrate that the proposed product is bioequivalent48 to the RLD, and to ensure the product's identity, strength, quality, and purity. To obtain approval, an ANDA applicant is not required to provide independent evidence to establish the safety and effectiveness of the proposed product; instead, an ANDA relies on FDA's finding that the RLD is safe and effective.\n\nFootnote 48: Bioequivalence means the absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives becomes available at the site of drug action when administered at the same molar dose under similar conditions in an appropriately designed study. See 21 CFR 314.3(b).\n\nANDAs for drug-led combination products should include sufficient information to demonstrate that the non-lead constituent part is compatible for use with the final formulation of the drug constituent part. Potential applicants should refer to relevant FDA guidance documents and other sources that provide information on what data and information should be included to support a device constituent part(s) of a proposed generic combination product (e.g., information analyzing the proposed user interface for a generic drug-device combination product when compared to the user interface for the RLD).49\n\nFootnote 49: See the draft guidance for industry Comparative Analyses and Related Comparative Use Human Factors Studies for a Drug-Device Combination Product Submitted in an ANDA (January 2017). When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nAs a general matter, in assessing the therapeutic equivalence of a proposed generic drug-device combination product, FDA intends to consider whether the proposed generic product can be expected to have the same clinical effect and safety profile as the RLD when administered to patients under the conditions specified in the labeling.50 While FDA does not expect the proposed generic combination product and its RLD to be identical in all respects, any differences identified between a proposed generic combination product and its RLD should be adequately analyzed, scientifically justified, and otherwise not preclude approval under an ANDA. The extent to which differences between the proposed generic combination product and the RLD affect the approximability of the ANDA product will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nFootnote 50: See 21 CFR 314.3. See also the Orange Book, preface to the 41({}^{\\text{a}}) edition, at page vii.\n\nAppendix C Biologic-Led Combination Products\n\nBiologic-led combination products are licensed through one of the two BLA pathways under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), either under a section 351(a) BLA (i.e.,a stand-alone BLA) or under a section 351(k) BLA for a biosimilar or interchangeable biological product.51\n\nFootnote 52: Section 351(a)(2)(C) of the PHS Act.\n\n3.2.1 Biologics License Applications (BLAs) Submitted Under Section 351(a)\n--------------------\nContext title: Principles of Premarket Pathways for Combination Products Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.618467330932617", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 11: See section 503(g)(3) of the FD&C Act: \u201cThe [FDA] may require that the sponsor of such combination product submit to the [FDA] only data or information that the [FDA] determines is necessary to meet the standard for clearance or approval, as applicable, under this Act or the Public Health Service Act, including any incremental risks and benefits posed by such combination product, using a risk-based approach and taking into account any prior finding of safety and effectiveness or substantial equivalence for the approved constituent part relied upon by the applicant.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, the amount of information that can be leveraged for such proposed combination products may be minimal, or leveraging may not be possible. For example, a change in route of administration for a complex biological product may raise additional safety and/or efficacy considerations, and such considerations may make it difficult to bridge to the proposed combination product. Discussions with the Agency about planned leveraging are appropriate to identify questions early in drug development.\n\nDeveloping an Analytical Framework for Identifying Information Gaps to Inform a Bridging and Leveraging Approach\n\nDeveloping a framework that identifies where information gaps may exist in a combination product development program is an important task for applicants. The following information assumes that applicants are familiar with existing FDA regulations, guidance documents, and resources on drug and device development available from the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, and the Office of Combination Products to assess the information that should be included in an IND, NDA, or BLA, as appropriate. Under this premise, the example of a framework below supposes that an applicant seeks to bridge from the FDA-approved, drug-device (delivery system) Combination Product A to proposed Combination Product B. The Agency recommends that an applicant use the stepwise approach presented below to conduct a gap analysis for the proposed Combination Product B:\n\nStep 1. Identify all differences between Combination Products A and B, and consider the potential effect of the individual and aggregate differences on the safety and effectiveness profile for Combination Product B.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nDraft--Not for Implementation\n\nSpecifically, for Combination Product B in comparison with Combination Product A, the safety and effectiveness profile should include a clear, comprehensive listing of the differences in the device constituent part, the drug constituent part, and the combination product as a whole. Some examples of the potential effect of a change in drug or device constituent part for Combination Product B compared to the existing safety and/or effectiveness profile for Combination Product A include the following:\n\nChanges to the local injection adverse reaction profile including those related to an increase in drug concentration, a change in drug viscosity or formulation, or a change in injection rate Change in the dose accuracy of the same device constituent part when the drug formulation is changed Changes in the manufacturing process and/or device constituent part that may affect drug quality Change in whether the intended users can use Combination Product B safely and effectively when the user interface of the device constituent part changes Changes in the bioavailability of the drug and/or its metabolic profile that can occur because of changes in the device, formulation, or route of administration, such as the following:\n\nChanges in the needle depth, tissue plane, or rate of infusion Change in drug formulation that results in differential lung depositions even when the drug is administered with the same device Changes in drug formulation that can affect the leachable and extractable profiles of the combination product\n\nStep 2. Identify existing information for Combination Product B (i.e., information that has been gathered or generated through studies and assessments of the proposed combination product itself) and compare it to the safety and effectiveness submission requirements necessary for approval.\n\nStep 3. Identify and explain how and why existing information on Combination Product A can be bridged and leveraged to support approval of Combination Product B, taking into account the considerations in Step 1 and the information already gathered in Step 2.\n\nStep 4. Focus on any information gaps remaining from Steps 2 and 3, and consider whether other existing information, outside of that directly gathered for Combination Product A or B,Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nDraft--Not for Implementation\n\n178 can be reviewed and used to address these gaps under the proposed regulatory pathway as described in Step 5 below.12\n\nFootnote 12: Note that use of certain sources of information may not be permitted under certain regulatory pathways, but that discussion is beyond the scope of this guidance.\n\n180\n\nStep 5. Compare findings from Step 2 through 4 and identify the remaining gaps in information that need to be addressed in the product application.\n\n181\n\nAfter completing a gap analysis, FDA recommends that applicants meet with FDA's lead center review division along with consulting reviewers to discuss what new information or studies may be needed to support the application for Combination Product B.\n\n182\n\nSpecial considerations: The stepwise framework and associated analyses described above represent general considerations regarding how the applicant should prepare an application.\n\n190 However, leveraging may be challenging or not possible with some combination products\n\n191 because they contain complex constituent parts and/or are likely to be affected by seemingly\n\n192 minor changes. For example, combination products that include certain biological products or\n\n193 complex delivery systems may not allow the same degree of leveraging as would be possible for\n\n194 a combination product that includes a well-characterized drug or a well-understood device.\n\n195 Nonetheless, the framework and associated analyses in this guidance are at least potentially\n\n196 applicable to such combination products.\n\n197\n\n4 Bridging and Leveraging Examples\n\n198\n\n5 Bridging and Leveraging Examples\n\n199\n\nIn this section, we present three case examples to illustrate how an applicant might appropriately\n\n190 apply the above stepwise framework and associated analyses to determine the bridging strategy\n\n191 and informational needs in a development program, which it would then present to FDA. It is\n\n192 important to note that the cases represent hypothetical examples. The approach taken provides\n\n193 one acceptable way to break down the thought process around preparing applications from an\n\n194 applicant's viewpoint. We recognize that many applicants would likely be considering multiple\n\n195 steps from the framework simultaneously. Most importantly, these considerations and\n\n196 recommendations are not intended to apply to any particular development program. Product-\n\n197 specific considerations will lead to differing informational requirements by FDA. We encourage\n\n198 applicants to discuss their particular development program and bridging strategy with FDA.\n\n199\n\nIf the applicant determines early in a drug development program that the intent will be to market\n\n190 multiple presentations or a presentation that is different from that studied in early development,19\n\n191 FDA encourages the applicant to conduct clinical studies using the device constituent parts with\n\n192 which it intends to market the combination product (i.e., the final finished combination product).\n\n193 By doing so, bridging to clinical data likely would not be needed because the data would have\n\n194 been developed with the final finished combination product.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nDraft--Not for Implementation\n\ntissue depth (potentially associated with the rate of drug delivery as determined by the injection time), and completeness of the injection.\n\nAssembling the autoinjector around the PFS will require, among other things, assessment of design features of the additional autoinjector combination product.14\n\nFootnote 14: Combination products are subject to 21 CFR part 4, which sets forth current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements for combination products. The constituent parts of a combination product retain their regulatory status (as a drug or device, for example) after they are combined. The CGMP requirements that apply to each of the constituent parts apply to the combination product they constitute.\n--------------------\nContext title: Bridging for Drug-Device and Biologic-Device Combination Products Draft Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.302720069885254", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n--------------------\nContext: This guidance focuses on those applications that can be submitted as ANDAs under section 505(j) of the FD&C Act, petitioned ANDAs under section 505(j)(2)(C) of the FD&C Act, or NDAs pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act. This guidance does not discuss stand-alone NDAs.\n\nA scientific premise underlying the Hatch-Waxman Amendments is that a drug product approved in an ANDA under section 505(j) of the FD&C Act is presumed to be therapeutically equivalent8 to its RLD. Products classified as therapeutically equivalent can be substituted with the full expectation that the substituted product will produce the same clinical effect and safety profile as the prescribed product when administered to patients under the conditions specified in the labeling.9 In contrast to an ANDA, a 505(b)(2) application allows greater flexibility as to the characteristics of the proposed product. A 505(b)(2) application will not necessarily be rated therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug it references.\n\nFootnote 8: See 21 CFR 314.3(b) (\u201cTherapeutic equivalents are approved drug products that are pharmaceutical equivalents for which bioequivalence has been demonstrated, and that can be expected to have the same clinical effect and safety profile when administered to patients under the conditions specified in the labeling.\u201d). See also preface to FDA\u2019s Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book) (pg. vii-viii, 39th ed.), available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/UCM071436.pdf.\n\nFootnote 9: See preface to the Orange Book (pg. vii, 39th ed.).\n\n3 Abbreviated approval pathways\n\nAndas10\n\nFootnote 10: Please note that this guidance is intended to assist applicants deciding whether to submit an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) application but does not provide details on the content and format of or the submission process for an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) application. For more information on the content and format of or the submission process for an ANDA, select the \u201cGenerics\u201d heading on the FDA guidance web page. For information on the content and format of or the submission process for an NDA, select the \u201cClinical\u201d and \u201cProcedural\u201d headings on the FDA guidance web page.\n\nAs discussed in section 2 of this guidance, section 505(j) of the FD&C Act, together with its implementing regulations, generally requires that an ANDA demonstrate that the proposedgeneric drug product and the applicable RLD are the same with respect to their active ingredient(s), dosage form, route of administration, strength, conditions of use, and labeling (with certain exceptions).11 An ANDA must also include sufficient information (1) to demonstrate that the proposed product is bioequivalent to the RLD12 and (2) to ensure the product's identity, strength, quality, and purity. Consistent with any statutory provisions related to the exclusivity of and patents listed for the RLD, FDA must approve an ANDA unless there is insufficient evidence that these criteria are met.13 An ANDA relies on the Agency's finding of safety and effectiveness for an RLD and, as a result, that ANDA may be approved without submission of the same type and extent of information as is required for an NDA to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product.14\n\nFootnote 11: See section 505(j)(2)(A) and 505(j)(4) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 314.94 and 314.127.\n\nFootnote 12: See section 505(j)(2)(A)(iv) and 505(j)(4)(F) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 320.21(b).\n\nFootnote 13: See section 505(j)(2)(A) and 505(j)(4) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 314.94, 314.105, and 314.127.\n\nAlso, as discussed in section II above, an ANDA may contain certain types of differences from an RLD (e.g., a change approved in response to a suitability petition or other permissible differences, such as certain differences in inactive ingredients, labeling, or container closure systems), as long as clinical investigations are not necessary to establish the safety or effectiveness of the drug product proposed in the ANDA.\n\n505(b)(2) Applications\n\nAs discussed in section II above, an application submitted through the pathway described in section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use15 (e.g., the Agency's finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug, published literature). A 505(b)(2) applicant may rely on FDA's finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug only to the extent that the proposed product in the 505(b)(2) application shares characteristics (e.g., active ingredient, dosage form, route of administration, strength, indication or other conditions of use) in common with the relied-upon listed drug(s).16 The applicant is expected to establish a bridge (e.g., by using comparative bioavailability data) between the proposed drug product and each listed drug that the applicant seeks to rely upon to demonstrate that reliance on the listed drug is scientifically justified. To the extent that the listed drug and the drug proposed in the 505(b)(2) application differ (e.g., a product with a different dosage form or a product that is intentionally more bioavailable than the listed drug), the 505(b)(2) application must include sufficient data to support those differences.17 If FDA has approved one or more pharmaceutically equivalent products in one or more NDAs before the date of the submission of the original 505(b)(2) application, the applicant must identify one such pharmaceutically equivalent product as a listed drug (or an additional listed drug) relied upon but need not provide a scientific bridge to that product unless it is scientifically necessary to support approval.18\n\nFootnote 17: See 21 CFR 314.54(a).

However, if FDA approves a duplicate drug product after a 505(b)(2) application is submitted but before the 505(b)(2) application is approved, that application would remain eligible for approval as a 505(b)(2) application, and FDA would not require the applicant of the pending 505(b)(2) application to withdraw the application and submit an ANDA.\n\niv.0.2 Petitioned ANDAs\n\nAs noted in section II of this guidance, certain differences between an RLD and a proposed generic drug product may be permitted in an ANDA if these differences are the subject of an approved suitability petition.20 An applicant may submit a suitability petition to FDA requesting permission to submit an ANDA for a generic drug product that differs from an RLD in its route of administration, dosage form, or strength or that has one different active ingredient in a fixed-combination drug product.21 An ANDA citing a suitability petition that is pending or has been denied will not be received for review because the application lacks a legal basis for the submission.[22]\n\nFDA will approve a suitability petition unless, among other things, (1) it determines that the safety and effectiveness of the proposed change from the RLD cannot be adequately evaluated without data from investigations that exceed what may be required for an ANDA[23] or (2) the petition is for a drug product for which a pharmaceutical equivalent has been approved in an NDA, including, for example, a 505(b)(2) application that referenced the same listed drug named in the suitability petition.[24] In the latter case, the ANDA applicant should instead refer to the approved pharmaceutical equivalent designated by the Agency as the RLD as the basis for submission of its ANDA. After approval of an NDA for a drug product that is a pharmaceutical equivalent to the drug product described in the suitability petition, the approved suitability petition (and listed drug described therein) may no longer be used as the basis for an ANDA submission by applicants with pending ANDAs or by prospective ANDA applicants for that petitioned drug product.[25] In this scenario, an applicant with a pending ANDA will be required to submit a new ANDA that both identifies the pharmaceutically equivalent product as the RLD and complies with applicable regulatory requirements.[26]\n\nii.1.3 Bundling\n--------------------\nContext title: Determining Whether to Submit an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) Application \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.575257778167725", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 12: See guidance for industry and review staff Formal Dispute Resolution: Sponsor Appeals Above the Division Level (November 2017), guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Appeals Processes (July 2019), and draft guidance for industry Requests for Reconsideration at the Division Level Under GDUFA (October 2017) (when final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic).\n\nIII Basics of Premarket Regulation of Combination Products\n\nThe regulatory requirements for combination products arise from the statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to drugs, devices, and biological products, which retain their discrete regulatory identities when they are constituent parts of a combination product.13 At the same time, combination products comprise a distinct category of medical products that can be subject to specialized regulatory requirements, where appropriate.14 Specialized regulatory requirements for combination products generally are designed to address the overlaps and distinctions between the statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the drug, device, and biological product constituent parts that comprise them.\n\nFootnote 13: See combination product current good manufacturing practice and postmarketing safety reporting rules, 78 FR 4307-22 (2013) (21 CFR part 4, subpart A) and 81 FR 92603-26 (2016) (21 CFR part 4, subpart B).\n\nFootnote 14: Ibid.\n\nSection 503(g)(1)(B) and 503(g)(6) of the FD&C Act provide that FDA \"shall conduct the premarket review of any combination product under a single application, whenever appropriate\" and that a sponsor may choose to submit separate applications for the different constituent parts of a combination product unless FDA \"determines that a single application is necessary.\" FDA's current thinking is that a single application15 would generally be appropriate for a combination product, to streamline regulatory interactions with the Agency and to avoid unnecessary duplication that may occur with multiple applications. However, separate applications would generally be permissible for the constituent parts of a cross-labeled combination product; when using such an approach applicants should coordinate with both centers (and may request OCP assistance), to help enable efficient, timely consideration of issues that may be relevant to each constituent part, or both, and to their combined use, including with respect to changes during the product lifecycle to either constituent part. In limited situations, FDA may determine that a single application is not appropriate and thus that an application for each constituent part is warranted.\n\nThe marketing application type submitted should generally coincide with the PMOA of the combination product (a PMA, De Novo, or 510(k) for a device-led combination product; an NDA or ANDA for a drug-led combination product; or a BLA for a biologic-led combination product). To appropriately ensure the safety and effectiveness of a combination product in a single application, such application should enable a substantially similar evaluation to that which would be applied to each constituent part if they were reviewed under separate applications (e.g., an ANDA or NDA for a drug and a PMA, De Novo, or 510(k) for a device), including consideration of data and information that would be reviewed under the separate applications. If one type of application coinciding with the PMOA of the combination product (PMOA-based application type), e.g., an ANDA, does not enable such an evaluation for each constituent part, the combination product should typically be reviewed in a different application type, e.g., an NDA, that still coincides with the PMOA of the combination product.16 In limited cases, FDA has determined that the product should be reviewed under an application type associated with the statutory authorities applicable to the non-lead constituent part.17 If a sponsor believes a particular application type is appropriate for other reasons, it should discuss with FDA.\n\nFootnote 16: For example, if an independent showing of safety and effectiveness would be needed for any constituent part then 510(k) would likely not be appropriate. Please refer to the annex of this document and page 7 of the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications [510(k)] (July 2014).\n\nFootnote 17: See, for example, the guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act (Biosimilars Q&A Guidance) (September 2021), which discusses regulatory clarity and consistency considerations for why a BLA would be the more appropriate application type for antibody-drug conjugates, a type of drug- biologic combination product that is assigned to CDER regardless of the PMOA of the combination product. In this case, due to factors that included \u201cthe relative significance of the safety and effectiveness questions raised by the constituent parts, particularly the highly specific molecular targeting by the antibody to a cell type, cellular component, or other marker at the site of action (as distinguished from mere alteration of systemic PK [pharmacicists]),\u201d the Agency determined that a BLA was a more appropriate pathway to evaluate this type of combination product. In certain scenarios, similar considerations might arise when determining the appropriate application type for other combination products such as those containing certain biologics (e.g., blood products and products composed of or containing live cells or microorganisms). In other cases, incorporation of a biological product component that is already licensed under section 351 of the PHS Act into the combination product is likely to be the most effective way to facilitate a substantially similar evaluation of a non-lead biological product constituent part.\n\nFurther, in determining what is needed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the combination product, FDA takes into account the questions and considerations, reflected in the statutory and regulatory provisions associated with each constituent part in its review of the combination product as a whole and its constituent parts. This includes how the constituent partsmay interact and interrelate. For example, for a device-led combination product reviewed in an appropriate device application that includes a drug constituent part (that would otherwise be reviewed in an NDA), nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology and clinical pharmacology (including pharmacokinetic) data and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) information are among the types of information that would typically be necessary. Similarly, for a combination product that is not biologic-led and includes a biological product constituent part, certain information, including regarding the identity of the biological product constituent part, and indicating compliance with donor eligibility or lot release requirements, where applicable, would typically be necessary.18 Likewise, for a combination product that is not device-led and includes a device constituent part, engineering, biocompatibility, performance data, and other design validation data would typically be necessary. Regardless of which center may have the lead and which application type may be appropriate, consistent with section 503(g) of the FD&C Act, FDA is committed to applying a consistent, risk-based approach to address similar regulatory questions, including scientific questions, similarly, utilizing relevant expertise from the lead and consulted centers.19\n\nFootnote 18: As additional examples in the case of a drug or device-led combination product that includes a biological product constituent part, commercial scale process validation data, information sufficient to enable FDA to conduct pre-approval inspections of the proposed commercial product during manufacturing operations, and information demonstrating that the applicant has knowledge of and direct control over the manufacturing process for the biological product constituent part (rather than by reference to a drug or device master file) if the biological product constituent part is not licensed for that use, typically would be necessary to include in a marketing application to support a determination that the combination product is safe and effective. Please note that the examples provided in this guidance are not an exhaustive list. Failure to provide this information may result in FDA refusing to file the marketing application.\n\nFootnote 19: The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 and subsequent statutory amendments by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act and the Cures Act directed FDA to take a least burdensome approach to medical device premarket evaluation. The least burdensome concept and Agency guidance interpreting this concept, accordingly, also apply to device constituent parts of combination products. See the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff The Least burdensome Provisions: Concept and Principles(February 2019). While the statutory least burdensome expectation does not apply to drugs or biological products, FDA is committed to the principle of avoiding unnecessary regulatory burden for all medical products including combination products.\n--------------------\nContext title: Principles of Premarket Pathways for Combination Products Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.751445293426514", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E7 Studies in Support of Special Populations- Geriatrics , What should be considered for the clinical development program to adequately characterize the safety and efficacy of a drug for a marketing application?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 10: GDUFA refers to the generic drug user fee program codified in the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 and the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017.\n\nII Background\n\nThe Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417) (Hatch-Waxman Amendments) created an abbreviated approval pathway for duplicates of a previously approved drug product in section 505(j) of the FD&C Act. An ANDA relies on the Agency's previous finding of safety and effectiveness for a reference listed drug (RLD)5 and, as a result, may be approved without submission of the same type and extent of information that is requested for a stand-alone new drug application to establish the safety and effectiveness of the proposed product.6 Section 505(j) of the FD&C Act, together with its implementing regulations, generally requires that an ANDA must contain information to demonstrate that the proposed drug product and the applicable RLD are the same with respect to active ingredient(s), dosage form, route of administration, strength, previously approved conditions of use, and, with certain exceptions, labeling.7 An ANDA must also include sufficient information (1) to demonstrate that the proposed product is bioequivalent to the RLD8 and (2) to ensure the product's identity, strength, quality, and purity. Consistent with any statutory provisions related to the exclusivity of and patents listed for the RLD, FDA must approve an ANDA unless there is insufficient evidence that these criteria are met or there is inadequate information to ensure the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug product.9\n\nFootnote 8: See section 505(j)(2)(A)(iv) and 505(j)(4)(F) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 320.21(b).\n\nFootnote 9: Section 314.127.\n\nGDUFA10 was signed into law to speed the delivery of safe and effective generic drugs to the public and reduce costs to industry. As part of the commitments under the first iteration of GDUFA, FDA agreed to meet certain obligations, including performance review goals for the review of new ANDAs. To meet these and any future performance goals as provided for in subsequent reauthorizations of GDUFA, FDA is issuing this guidance to assist ANDA applicants in improving the quality of their submissions, to increase the number of original ANDAs acknowledged for receipt upon initial submission, and to decrease the number of ANDA review cycles. FDA is committed to providing comprehensive assistance in the early stages of the application process so that an ANDA will contain all information necessary for FDA to complete its review in one review cycle.\n\nFootnote 10: GDUFA refers to the generic drug user fee program codified in the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 and the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017.\n\nIII Ctd Format\n\nThe CTD format was developed by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) in an attempt to streamline the submission requirements for Japan, the European Union, and the United States. The CTD collects quality, safety, and efficacy information into a common format that has been adopted by ICH regulatory authorities. The electronic CTD (eCTD) is the standard format for electronic regulatory submissions for ANDAs. As of May 5, 2017, ANDAs and submissions to ANDAs (which includes amendments, supplements, and reports) must be submitted to FDA electronically in eCTD format.11, 12\n\nFootnote 11: Guidance for industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format \u2014 Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specifications (Rev. 4).

This guidance, however, specifically addresses the content of the CTD for an ANDA.\n\nFootnote 12: Any record in electronic form submitted to FDA under requirements of the FD&C Act is subject to the provisions of part 11 (21 CFR part 11) unless exempted. Part 11 regulations were issued in 1997 to provide criteria to FDA for accepting electronic records, electronic signatures, and handwritten signatures executed to electronic records as equivalent to paper records and handwritten signatures on paper. See the guidance for industry Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures \u2014 Scope and Application.\n\nThe CTD is comprised of the following modules:\n\nModule 1:14 Administrative Information and Prescribing Information\n\nModule 2: Summaries\n\nModule 3: Quality\n\nModule 4: Nonclinical\n\nModule 5: Clinical\n\nThe sections that follow in this guidance provide additional detail about the information that should be submitted in the applicable modules, sections, and subsections.\n\nFootnote 14: Module 1 contains administrative information and is not considered part of the common application. Each regulatory authority that accepts the CTD uses its own Module 1. The information described for Module 1 in this guidance applies only to ANDAs submitted to the U.S. FDA. Modules 2 through 5 of the CTD are common for all regions.\n\nA. Module 1 - Administrative Information\n\n1.

The ANDA must contain: (1) the name of the RLD, which must be the same as the listed drug identified in the approved suitability petition, and RLD application number; (2) a reference to the suitability petition's FDA-assigned docket number; and (3) a copy of FDA's correspondence approving the suitability petition. The drug product approved under the first petitioned ANDA generally will be selected by FDA as the reference standard and should be used for and identified in the appropriate sections of a subsequent ANDA as the reference standard.\n\nAppendix 1 Quick Reference\n\nThis appendix summarizes the concepts discussed in this guidance. We recommend that an ANDA applicant refer to the appropriate section of the guidance for more detailed information, as needed.\n\nThe reference listed drug (RLD) for an ANDA is the drug product that the proposed generic drug is intended to duplicate and to which the ANDA applicant must refer in its ANDA. FDA designates as RLDs listed drugs approved for safety and effectiveness under section 505(c) of the FD&C Act. The Orange Book identifies which listed drugs have been designated by FDA as RLDs, including some listed drugs in the Discontinued Section of the Orange Book. In the electronic Orange Book, there is a column for RLDs. In the printed version of the Orange Book, RLDs are identified by a distinct symbol.\n\nThe reference standard selected by FDA must be used in conducting any in vivo bioequivalence study required for approval of the ANDA. The reference standard may or may not be the same listed drug as the RLD. Other comparisons of the proposed generic drug to determine whether it meets the statutory requirements for approval under section 505(j) of the FD&C Act (e.g., sameness requirements) generally must be to the RLD. The drug product selected by FDA as the reference standard generally is identified in the Orange Book. In the electronic Orange Book, there is a column for reference standards. In the printed version of the Orange Book, reference standards are identified by a distinct symbol.\n\nIf you mistakenly identify the reference standard as the RLD in your ANDA, you may submit an amendment to a pending ANDA or a supplement to an approved ANDA to correct the information. FDA considers this error to be a deficiency related to identification of the appropriate listed drug as the RLD, rather than a change in the RLD itself. The cover letter for such a submission should clearly identify that the purpose of the submission is \"Correction of RLD information.\"\n\nThe basis of submission statement in an ANDA (e.g., in section 1.12.11 of the ANDA) and in Form FDA 356h (field 20) should include the name of the RLD and the RLD application number. For a petitioned ANDA, the basis of submission statement in the ANDA (e.g., in section 1.12.11 of the ANDA) also should include a reference to the FDA-assigned docket number for the approved suitability petition and a copy of FDA's correspondence approving the suitability petition. The reference standard, if it is different from the RLD, should be identified in the appropriate sections of the ANDA (e.g., sections 1.12.11, 2.7.1, 5.2, and 5.3.1).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \\hline\n--------------------\nContext title: Referencing Approved Drug Products in ANDA Submissions Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.985306739807129"], "As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product?

[Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n--------------------\nContext: A.I.7. An applicant generally may obtain licensure of a proposed biosimilar product for fewer than all conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed. The 351(k) application must include information demonstrating that the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling submitted for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product (see section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act).\n\nFor information about the licensure of a proposed interchangeable product, see FDA's guidance for industry Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference Product.5\n\nFootnote 5: As explained in that guidance, FDA generally expects that applicants seeking to demonstrate interchangeability will submit data and information to support a showing that the proposed interchangeable product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in all of the reference product\u2019s licensed conditions of use.\n\nQ.1.8. Can a sponsor use comparative animal or clinical data with a non-U.S.-licensed product to support a demonstration that the proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n\nA.I.8. A sponsor may use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in certain studies to support a demonstration that the proposed biological product is biosimilar to the U.S.-licensed reference product. However, as a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) study, which may include pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoint(s) intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed.\n\nIf a sponsor seeks to use data from an animal study6 or a clinical study comparing its proposed biosimilar product to a non-U.S.-licensed product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. As a scientific matter, the type of bridging data needed will always include data from analytical studies(e.g., structural and functional data) that directly compare all three products (i.e., the proposed biosimilar product, the U.S.-licensed reference product, and the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product), and is likely to also include bridging clinical PK data or, when appropriate, PD data, for all three products. All three pairwise comparisons should meet the prespecified acceptance criteria for analytical and PK or PD similarity. The acceptability of such an approach will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and should be discussed in advance with the Agency. For certain complex biological products, a modified approach may be needed. A final determination about the adequacy of the scientific justification and bridge will be made during the review of the application.\n\nIssues that a sponsor may need to address to use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in a biosimilar development program include but are not limited to the following:\n\nRelevance of the design of the clinical program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity to the U.S.-licensed reference product for the condition(s) of use and patient population(s) for which licensure is sought\n\nRelationship between the license holder for the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product and BLA holder for the U.S.-licensed reference product\n\nWhether the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product was manufactured in a facility(ies) licensed and inspected by a regulatory authority that has similar scientific and regulatory standards as FDA (e.g., International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) countries)\n\nWhether the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product was licensed by a regulatory authority that has similar scientific and regulatory standards as FDA (e.g., ICH countries) and the duration and extent to which the product has been marketed\n\nScientific bridge between the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product and the U.S.-licensed reference product, including comparative physicochemical characterization, biological assays/functional assays, degradation profiles under stressed conditions, and comparative clinical PK or, when appropriate, PD data, to address the impact of any differences in formulation or primary packaging on product performance\n\nA sponsor should also address any other factors that may affect the relevance of comparative data with the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to an assessment of biosimilarity with the U.S.-licensed reference product.\n\nA sponsor may submit publicly available information regarding the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to justify the extent of comparative data needed to establish a bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. The complexity of the products, particularly with respect to higher order structure, post-translational modifications (e.g., glycosylation), and the degree of heterogeneity associated with the product may affect the considerations for the scientific justification regarding the extent of bridging data. Additional factors that FDA may consider regarding the extent of bridging data include but are not limited to the following:\n\nWhether the formulation, dosage form, and strength of the U.S.-licensed reference product and non-U.S.-licensed comparator products are the same\n\nRoute of administration of the U.S.-licensed reference product and non-U.S.-licensed comparator products\n\nDesign of the physicochemical and biological/functional assessments and the use of multiple orthogonal methods with adequate sensitivity to detect differences among the products\n\nScientific justification for the selection of the non-U.S.-licensed comparator lots used to establish the scientific bridge and how the selected lots relate to the material used in the nonclinical and clinical studies; the scientific bridge should include a sufficient number of lots of non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to adequately capture the variability in product quality attributes, and when possible, the non-U.S.-licensed comparator lots used in the nonclinical or clinical studies should be included in the assessment performed to establish the analytical bridge\n\nSponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program the adequacy of the scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of this scientific justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFor more information about whether a non-U.S.-licensed comparator can be used in studies intended to support the additional criteria required for a determination of interchangeability with the reference product, see FDA's guidance for industry Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference Product.\n\nQ.I.9.: Is a clinical study to assess the potential of the biological product to delay cardiac repolarization (a QT/QTc study) or a drug-drug interaction study generally needed for licensure of a proposed biosimilar product? [Final December 2018]\n\nA.I.9. In general, a 351(k) application for a proposed biosimilar product may rely upon the Agency's previous determination of safety, purity, and potency for the reference product, including any clinical QT/QTc interval prolongation and proarrhythmic potential and drug-drug interactions. If such studies were not required for the reference product, then these data generally would not be needed for licensure of a proposed biosimilar product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. However, if the BLA holder for the reference product has been required to conduct postmarket studies or clinical trials under section 505(o)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to assess or identify a certain risk related to a QT/QTc study or a drug-drug interaction study and those studies have not yet been completed, then FDA may impose similar postmarket requirements on the 351(k) applicant in appropriate circumstances.\n\nQ.1.10: How long and in what manner should sponsors retain reserve samples of the biological products used in comparative clinical PK and/or PD studies intended to support a 351(k) application? [Final December 2018]\n\nA.I.10.: Reserve samples establish the identity of the products tested in the actual study, allow for confirmation of the validity and reliability of the results of the study, and facilitate investigation of further follow-up questions that arise after the studies are completed. FDA recommends that the sponsor of a proposed biosimilar product retain reserve samples for at least 5 years following the date on which the 351(k) application is licensed, or, if such application is not licensed, at least 5 years following the date of completion of a comparative clinical PK and/or PD study of the reference product and the proposed biosimilar product (or other clinical study in which PK or PD samples are collected with the primary objective of assessing PK or PD similarity) that is intended to support a submission under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. Contact FDA for specific advice if an alternative approach is being considered. For a three-way PK similarity study, FDA recommends that samples of both comparator products be retained, in addition to samples of the proposed biosimilar product.\n\nFor most protein therapeutics, FDA recommends that a sponsor retain the following quantities of product and dosage units, which are expected to be sufficient for evaluation by state of the art analytical methods:\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.374131679534912", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n--------------------\nContext: Yes, with two exceptions. The first is that the FDA requirements for IRBs under 21 CFR Part 56 are slightly different with respect to membership and function. To address this issue, as described in #12 above, FDA can provide a specific waiver from the Part 56 IRB requirements, allowing an IEC that complies with good clinical practice to substitute for the IRB.4 The second exception is that the requirements for informed consent under 21 CFR Part 50 for particular clinical trials (e.g., emergency research under 21 CFR 50.24, clinical investigations involving pediatric subjects under Subpart D) are more extensive with respect to IRB responsibilities. Because these types of trials are uncommon, our experience has not revealed that this has caused a conflict; but in the event of one, we would be willing to discuss a resolution with the sponsor on a case-by-case basis. If the investigator or sponsor believes that there are other conflicting requirements, the sponsor may request a waiver from FDA from the specific requirement under 21 CFR 312.10.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n14.  Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?\n\nNo. A multinational study may include domestic sites under the IND and foreign sites not under the IND.  Investigation drug and biologics studies conducted in the U.S. must be conducted in compliance with the IND requirements contained in 21 CFR 312, which includes the requirement that investigators sign the 1572.  If a study also involves foreign clinical sites, the sponsor may choose, but is not required, to include the foreign clinical sites under the IND.  The investigators from the U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND would be required to sign the 1572.  The investigators from the foreign sites that are not included under the IND are not required to sign the 1572.\n\nIf the sponsor chooses to conduct a multinational study with U.S. and some foreign sites under the IND, and other foreign sites not under the IND, the sponsor can submit a single protocol to the IND and all sites would follow this protocol.  Alternatively, the sponsor can conduct a multinational study with one protocol for sites under the IND (U.S. sites and some foreign sites) and a different protocol(s) for foreign sites not under the IND.  If the intent is to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites, the protocols would ordinarily be very similar or identical.  The U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND must follow the protocol that was submitted to the IND.  For foreign sites that are not included under the IND, the protocol(s) does not need to be submitted to the IND.  In general, if the sponsor intends to submit the data in an application for marketing approval, we recommend that the sponsor identify the foreign sites that will not be conducted under the IND and discuss plans to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites with the appropriate FDA review division.\n\nNote, however, that 21 CFR 312.32(b) requires sponsors to promptly review information about the safety of the investigational drug obtained or otherwise received by the sponsor from any source, foreign or domestic.  Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), sponsors must also notify FDA and all participating investigators in an IND safety report of any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected.  This means that FDA and all participating investigators under the IND would be informed of such an adverse experience, even if it occurred in a foreign study not conducted under the IND.\n\n15.  How does a sponsor submit information to FDA about a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND?\n\nUnder 21 CFR 312.120, the sponsor can submit information to FDA from a foreign clinical study that was not conducted under an IND to support clinical investigations in the United States and/or marketing approval.  When submitting information about a foreign clinical study, it is helpful to clearly identify in the cover letter that the material is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120.  The submission requirements for supporting documentation can be found at 21 CFR 312.120(b).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n16. Should a new form be prepared and signed when the OMB expiration date is reached?\n\nNo. There is no need to prepare and sign a new 1572 when the OMB expiration date has been reached.\n\n17. Does FDA expect a double-sided 1572, or is a two-page document printed from the FDA website acceptable?\n\nEither is acceptable; however, FDA recommends that a two-page document be stapled so that there is no question about what form the investigator signed.\n\n18. How should the 1572 be completed?\n\nThe 1572 on FDA's website may be completed by typing the information directly into the fillable form and printing the completed form. Alternatively, it is acceptable to print the blank form from FDA's website and hand-write or type the information onto the form. Typed forms are preferable because they are usually more legible. The completed form must be signed and dated by the investigator (either by hand or using an acceptable electronic method).\n\nII. SECTION #1: NAME AND ADDRESS OF INVESTIGATOR\n\n19. How should an investigator's name appear on the 1572?\n\nSection #1 should contain the investigator's full legal name (e.g., name on the investigator's birth certificate or marriage certificate). Titles, degrees, and/or professional qualifications may follow the investigator's legal name, if desired.\n\n20. What address should be entered into Section #1?\n\nThe address where the investigator can be reached by mail or in person should be entered in Section #1 of the 1572. Usually, this corresponds to the investigator's work or business address.\n\n21. Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n\nThe term co-investigator is not defined in FDA regulations. As commonly used, the term is meant to indicate that each co-investigator is fully responsible for fulfilling all of the obligations of an investigator as identified in 21 CFR 312.60. Thus under 21 CFR 312.3(b), each co-investigator is an investigator, and as such must sign a separate 1572.\n\nIn some situations, it is preferable to have more than one investigator responsible for a clinical investigation. For example, when a study is conducted at multiple research facilities that are not in close proximity, FDA expects an investigator who has signed a 1572 to be available at each location to either personally conduct or supervise the study. This responsibility cannot be delegated to a subinvestigator.\n\nAlthough not necessary, it is acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site. For example, the conduct and supervision of a large investigation with many subjects or complicated procedures might be shared among several investigators, each of whom has signed a 1572 when the investigation is conducted under an IND. This is distinct from a subinvestigator (see #31) whose role in the clinical investigation is more limited.\n\nIII. SECTION #2: EDUCATION, TRAINING, AND EXPERIENCE THAT QUALIFY THE INVESTIGATOR AS AN EXERT IN THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION\n\n22. What is the purpose of Section #2?\n\nSection #2 requires the investigator to attach a curriculum vitae (CV) or other statement of qualifications, showing the education, training and experience that qualifies the investigator as an expert in the clinical investigation of the drug/biologic for the use under investigation. Information identified in this section and attached to the 1572 enables the sponsor to assess an investigator's qualifications.\n\n23. Does the CV or other statement of qualifications need to be updated during a clinical study?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV or other statement of qualifications to be updated during a clinical study.\n\n24. Are CVs required to be signed and dated?\n\nNo. FDA regulations do not require a CV to be signed and dated. The investigator's dated signature on the 1572 is sufficient to attest to the accuracy of the CV or other statement of qualifications submitted with the 1572.\n\nIV. SECTION #3: NAME AND ADDRESS OF ANY MEDICAL SCHOOL. HOSPITAL, OR OTHER RESEARCH FACILITY WHERE THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION(S) WILL BE CONDUCTED\n\n25. What address(es) should be entered in Section #3?\n\nThe address(es) of the location(s) where the investigation will be conducted and to where the test articles will be shipped, if different from the investigator's address of record, should be entered in Section #3.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n26. What qualifies as a research facility for Section #3?\n\nSection #3 is intended to identify facilities where study activities will be conducted and clinical data will be generated or collected. This includes facilities where subjects will be seen and study procedures performed. For example, this might include locations such as health care facilities where the test article will be administered, or where physical exams will be performed. Facilities where other important clinical investigation functions are performed may also be identified in Section #3. For example, a research laboratory where the test article is prepared, a special storage facility where the test article will be kept, or a location where tissue specimens are collected should be listed in this section.\n\n27. If an investigator sees study subjects at more than one site, should the investigator list all sites on the 1572?\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572) Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.0498483180999756", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n--------------------\nContext: To support a demonstration of interchangeability, section 351(k)(4)(A) of the PHS Act provides, among other things, that a sponsor must show that the proposed interchangeable product \"is biosimilar to the reference product.\" Where a product is first licensed as a biosimilar, that licensure may be referenced to support a showing for this statutory criterion for demonstrating interchangeability.\n\nIn addition, section 351(k)(4)(A) of the PHS Act provides that an application for an interchangeable product must include information sufficient to show that the proposed interchangeable product \"can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient.\" FDA expects that sponsors will submit data and information to support a showing that the proposed interchangeable product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in all of the reference product's licensed conditions of use.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\non the nature of the proposed interchangeable product, and not all factors will necessarily be relevant to a given scientific justification. The data and information may also include a scientific rationale for extrapolation of data and information to support a demonstration of interchangeability. Extrapolation is further described in section VI.B of this guidance.\n\nGenerally, the data and information to support a showing under the \"can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient\" standard will likely not involve additional clinical studies other than those necessary to support other elements of demonstrating interchangeability, which are described in section VI. We note that although a sponsor may seek licensure for a proposed interchangeable product for fewer than all conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed, we recommend that a sponsor seek licensure for all of the reference product's licensed conditions of use when possible.\n\nFurther, for biological products administered more than once to a patient, section 351(k)(4)(B) of the PHS Act provides that another of the criteria for FDA to make a determination of interchangeability is a finding that information in the application is sufficient to show that \"the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.\" FDA expects that applications generally will include data from a switching study or studies12 in one or more appropriate conditions of use. FDA anticipates that data and information acquired from a switching study or studies will be useful in assessing the risk, in terms of safety and diminished efficacy, of alternating or switching between the products. Considerations for the design of a switching study, including study endpoints, study design and analysis, study population, condition(s) of use, and routes of administration to be studied, are discussed in detail in section VI.A of this guidance.\n\nFootnote 12: The term switching study or studies as used throughout this guidance refers to a clinical study or studies used to determine the impact of alternating or switching between the proposed interchangeable product and the reference product.\n\nV Factors impacting the type and amount of data and information needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability\n\nThe data and information needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability, beyond that needed to demonstrate biosimilarity,13 may be dependent on and influenced by multiple factors, which are discussed in this section.\n\nA.: Product-Dependent Factors That May Impact the Data Needed to Support a Demonstration of Interchangeability\n\n1. Product Complexity and the Extent of Comparative and Functional Characterization\n\nThis section provides general, prospective considerations for evaluating the types and extent of data needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability. These considerations may affect the study design and aid in the justification of a development program for a proposed interchangeable product. Consistent with the guidance for industry Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product (April 2015),14 the Agency recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to generating data and information, which may allow the sponsor to address any uncertainty about demonstrating interchangeability that may arise at each stage of product development. At each stage, the sponsor should evaluate the extent to which there is uncertainty about the interchangeability of the proposed product with the reference product and identify a strategy to address that uncertainty.\n\nFootnote 14: We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nSection 351(k)(4)(A)(i) of the PHS Act provides that one of the criteria for FDA to make a determination of interchangeability is a finding that information in the application is sufficient to show that the proposed interchangeable product is biosimilar to the reference product. Such information would include, in part, a showing that the proposed interchangeable product meets the highly similar standard for demonstrating biosimilarity.15 The \"highly similar\" standard applies to both interchangeable and biosimilar products.\n\nFootnote 15: Section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act defines biosimilarity, in part, to mean \u201cthat the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components.\u201d\n\nThe product's degree of structural and functional complexity may influence the extent of clinical data needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability. For example, clinical data needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability of a product expected to have a single target (e.g., a receptor) may be more limited than the clinical data that may be needed for a product acting on multiple targets or less-defined biological pathways. In addition, the extent of clinical data needed may be affected by the presence of structural features that specifically impact interchangeability (e.g., features that influence patient response to one product after exposure to another product).\n\nFDA acknowledges that there is a range of comparative analytical data that may be submitted to support licensure under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.16 Data sets that include highly sensitive analytics and/or sequential analytical methods that can identify molecules with different combinations of attributes (e.g., charge variants and glycoforms), as well as a comprehensive assessment of the relationships between attributes, may provide information that reduces theuncertainty about interchangeability. These approaches could be of greater importance for more complex products because these products would have a larger number of attributes and thus a potential for greater uncertainty regarding interchangeability. Advances in analytics may allow for extended analytical characterization that affect the extent of other data and information needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability and may in certain circumstances lead to a more selective and targeted approach to clinical studies intended to support a demonstration of interchangeability.\n\nii.1.2 Product-Specific Immunogenicity Risk\n\nClinical experience with the reference product and comprehensive product risk assessments (e.g., regarding immunogenicity)17 may also affect the data and information needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability. For example, products with a documented history of inducing detrimental immune responses may require more data to support a demonstration of interchangeability than products with an extensive documented history that immunogenicity does not impact clinical outcomes.\n\nFootnote 17: Section VII.D.2 in the guidance for industry Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product (April 2015) provides a discussion on clinical immunogenicity assessment.\n\nii.1.3 Totality of Factors to Consider in Assessing the Data and Information Needed to Support a Demonstration of Interchangeability\n\nThe factors discussed in sections V.A.1 and V.A.2 of this guidance need to be considered together to inform the data and information needed to support a demonstration of interchangeability in a particular context. Consider the following illustrative examples:\n\nProduct A and its associated reference product have relatively low structural complexity and the reference product has no history of inducing severe immune responses related to immunogenicity. Product A also has a low incidence of serious adverse events related to immunogenicity, similar in nature and frequency to those observed with the reference product, as demonstrated in clinical studies conducted as part of the development program for Product A. Here, sufficiently extensive comparative analytical data supporting a demonstration that the proposed interchangeable product (Product A) is highly similar to the reference product, in addition to data derived from an appropriately designed dedicated switching or integrated study (see section VI.A), may be sufficient to support a demonstration of interchangeability.\n--------------------\nContext title: Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference Product Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.967269778251648", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n--------------------\nContext: For drugs that are already in development under another IND, a letter of authorization to that existing IND may be adequate.\n\nFor non-FDA-approved, foreign-sourced test or comparator drugs, the type of CMC information needed to ensure the quality, safety, and efficacy of drugs used in clinical trials can be discussed with the FDA before the submission of an IND (see section III.D., Other Activities in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research).\n\nii.1.4 Resources for Nonclinical Development Considerations\n\nThe Biopharmaceutical Product Development Services program provided through the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) offers a collection of nonclinical services to support the development of high-priority therapeutic candidates.12 Access to such resources may help facilitate drug development for NTDs.\n\nFootnote 12: Information on the Biopharmaceutical Product Development Services program at NIH can be found at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/labsandresources/resources/dmid/pretheraagents/biopharma/Pages/default.aspx.\n\nAppendix B Clinical Development Considerations\n\nThe demonstration of substantial evidence of safety and effectiveness of new drugs is required for approval for the treatment or prevention of disease.13 Generally, this evidence is derived from two adequate and well-controlled phase 3 trials. However, we may consider \"data from one adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation and confirmatory evidence\" to constitute substantial evidence if we determine that such data and evidence are sufficient to establish effectiveness (section 505(d) of the FD&C Act). For example, a drug already approved for another indication may need only one adequate and well-controlled trial for approval for treatment of an NTD.14\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nGiven the geographic distribution of most NTDs, we expect that most of the supporting safety and efficacy data for drug development programs for NTDs will be generated from outside the United States. FDA regulations permit the acceptance of foreign clinical studies in support of an NDA or BLA approval. Under 21 CFR 312.120, if certain conditions are met (including that the trial was conducted in accordance with good clinical practice, which necessitates review and approval by an independent ethics committee), we will accept as support for an application for marketing approval a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND. However, we strongly encourage sponsors who intend to seek FDA approval for a drug for NTDs to submit an IND, regardless of where the clinical development occurs, to provide an opportunity for the FDA to offer advice on the development program to ensure that it will be able to support a future NDA or BLA. Marketing approval of a new drug based solely on foreign clinical data is governed by 21 CFR 314.106.\n\nPhase 1 and phase 2 trials play an important role in characterizing the pharmacokinetics, preliminary safety, and early evidence of activity of a drug for the treatment of an NTD. In addition to pharmacokinetic characterization, the clinical pharmacology component of the drug development program for an NTD should also employ evaluation of relevant drug interactions, effects of renal and/or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of the drug, and potential exposure-response relationships for both safety and efficacy outcomes. We can provide advice and feedback on recommendations for trial designs when submitted as part of an IND. The information from these studies in early clinical development can help to arrive at optimal dose selection(s) for phase 3 trials. Another advantage of submitting an IND is the advice from the FDA on whether the optimal dose selection for the phase 3 trial is applicable and relevant for a dose and dosing regimen for the U.S. population.15\n\nFootnote 15: To rely solely on foreign clinical data for marketing approval, 21 CFR 314.106(b) requires, among other things, that the data be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice. Section 314.106(b) further provides that \u201cFDA will apply this policy in a flexible manner according to the nature of the drug and the data being considered.\u201d\n\nThe types of clinical trial designs for demonstration of efficacy of drugs for treatment of NTDs of the developing world are listed below (see 21 CFR 314.126(b)(2)(i) - (v)):\n\nPlacebo concurrent control. The test drug is compared with an inactive preparation designed to resemble the test drug as much as possible. A placebo-controlled trial may include additional treatment groups, such as an active treatment control or a dose-comparison control, and usually includes randomization and blinding of patients or investigators, or both. Placebo-controlled trials are appropriate in situations where there is no approved treatment for an NTD, or where the administration of placebo would not raise ethical concerns.\n\nDose-comparison concurrent control. At least two doses of the drug for which there is clinical equipoise (e.g., early phase clinical evaluations demonstrate potential clinical activity of two or more different doses) are evaluated in a clinical trial that then shows superiority of one dose over the other dose(s). A dose-comparison trial may include additional treatment groups, such as placebo control or active control. Dose-comparison trials usually include randomization and blinding of patients or investigators, or both.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNo treatment concurrent control. Where objective measurements of effectiveness are available and placebo effect is negligible, the test drug is compared with no treatment. No treatment concurrent control trials usually include randomization.\n\nActive treatment concurrent control. The test drug is compared with known effective therapy, for example, when the condition treated is such that administration of placebo or no treatment would be contrary to the interest of the patient. An active treatment trial may include additional treatment groups, however, such as a dose-comparison control. Active treatment trials usually include randomization and blinding of patients or investigators, or both. Active treatment concurrent control can be designed to show superiority of a test drug over an active control drug, or to show noninferiority. Noninferiority of the test drug and active control drug can mean that both drugs were effective or that neither was effective. Therefore, if the intent of the trial is to show noninferiority of the test and control drugs, the active control drug should have a well-characterized and reliable treatment effect over placebo.\n\nHistorical control. The results of treatment with the test drug are compared with experience historically derived from the adequately documented natural history of the disease or condition, or from the results of active treatment, in comparable patients or populations. Because historical control populations usually cannot be as well assessed with respect to pertinent variables as can concurrent control populations, historical control designs are usually reserved for special circumstances. Examples include studies of diseases with high and predictable mortality (e.g., certain malignancies) and studies in which the effect of the drug is self-evident (e.g., general anesthetics).\n\nIn general, phase 3 trials should be prospective, randomized to treatment assignment, and have treatment groups and investigators blinded to the treatment assignment (double-blinded), unless the trial design is a historical control. If there is a compelling reason that trials cannot be double-blinded, sponsors should discuss with the FDA the efforts to minimize potential biases of single-blind or open-label trial designs. The number of patients needed for enrollment into clinical trials depends on the type of clinical trial design, endpoints, and safety profile. The results of superiority trials usually are straightforward to interpret, when superiority trials are feasible. For the noninferiority trial designs, the noninferiority margin should be justified, ideally, at the point of protocol development for a clinical trial.\n\nAdaptive clinical trial designs may be appropriate to consider for clinical trials of some NTDs. Clinical trials can be designed with adaptive features that may enhance the efficiency of the trial. For example, the adaptive design might result in a shorter overall duration of the trial, a fewer number of patients enrolled, or a greater likelihood of showing an effect of the drug if one exists. Sponsors who are considering an adaptive design are encouraged to consult the draft guidance for industry Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologies for review of statistical, clinical, and regulatory aspects of this potential approach.16 We also encourage sponsors to discuss such clinical trial designs with the FDA before conduct of the trial to provide an opportunity for advice on trials with an adaptation.\n--------------------\nContext title: Neglected Tropical Diseases of the Developing World- Developing Drugs for Treatment or Prevention \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.5641080141067505", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product?

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if that approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist sponsors in deciding whether a study of marketed drugs or biological products for treating cancer falls within the exemption under SS 312.2(b)(1) (21 CFR 312.2(b)(1)) from the general requirement to submit an investigational new drug application (IND). The guidance discusses the Agency's current thinking on when studies of marketed cancer products are exempt from IND regulation based on a risk assessment. The Agency hopes that clarifying its policy will help sponsors identify which studies are exempt, thus saving them from submitting unnecessary IND applications.\n\nThis guidance revises the guidance of the same title published in September 2003. In the September 2003 version, the Agency's final statement was that it believed that most randomized studies of a size that could support a labeling supplement would likely not be exempt from IND regulation under SS 312.2(b)(1)(i), (ii). This is because they would be intended to support approval of a new indication, a significant change in the product labeling, or a significant change in advertising. Experience has shown that this interpretation was formulated too broadly and inappropriately referred to size alone. The Agency has decided to revise this guidance by removing that statement (the last sentence in section V.B). Whether a study could support a change in labeling is a complex determination, based on study design, size, and other factors.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements arecited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nGenerally, regulations in part 312 (21 CFR part 312) require sponsors who wish to study a drug or biological product in humans to submit an IND to the Agency.2 However, these regulations also provide for the exemption of some studies from the requirement to submit an IND if they meet certain criteria. Each year, many INDs for cancer drugs are submitted that contain studies that the Agency determines are exempt. This guidance is intended to help applicants identify which studies may be exempt.\n\nFootnote 2: Part 312 applies to all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) or to the licensing provisions of the Public Health Service Act (58 Stat. 632, as amended (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.)).\n\nRegulations\n\nRegulations in SS 312.2(b)(1) provide for the exemption of some studies for some drugs from IND regulations if the studies meet the following five criteria:\n\nThe study is not intended to support FDA approval of a new indication or a significant change in the product labeling.\n\nThe study is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the product.\n\nThe investigation does not involve a route of administration or dosage level or use in a patient population or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug product.\n\nThe study is conducted in compliance with institutional review board (IRB) and informed consent regulations set forth in parts 56 and 50 (21 CFR parts 56 and 50).\n\nThe study is conducted in compliance with SS 312.7 (promotion and charging for investigational drugs).\n\nRequirements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are not directly related to the specific protocol submitted, and their interpretation is similar for oncologic and nononcologic therapies. Requirement 3 is protocol related and has special meaning in the oncology therapy setting, particularly with respect to doses above the labeled dose, use with other treatments, and use in different populations.\n\nIn the preamble to the IND regulations, which published in the Federal Register on March 19, 1987, the Agency explained that the exemption was not necessarily intended to tie the investigator to the doses and routes of administration and patient population described in the approved labeling, but to permit deviations from the approved labeling to the extent that such changes are supported by the scientific literature and generally known clinical experience. The Agency recognizes that a considerable amount of professional judgment is exercised in determining whether the planned investigation significantly increases the risk associated with the use of the drug. FDA maintains that \"because the assessment of risks involved in a therapeutic procedure is an everyday part of the practice of medicine, the individual investigator should usually be able to determine the applicability of the exemption.\"3\n\nFootnote 3: New Drug, Antibiotic, and Biologic Drug Product Regulations, Federal Register, March 19, 1987, Vol. 52, Nr. 53, p. 8802.\n\n1996 Agency Cancer Initiative\n\nIn 1996, as part of the President's National Performance Review, the Agency launched its Reinventing the Regulation of Cancer Drugs initiative with the goal of accelerating the approval of and expanding patient access to cancer drugs.4 As part of this initiative, the Agency explained that many sponsor-investigators were submitting INDs for exploratory studies for so-called off-label indications for two reasons: (1) IRBs incorrectly believe an IND is required, or (2) the pharmaceutical manufacturer agrees to provide a drug free of charge, but mistakenly concludes that the FDA will view this as promotional activity. With the intent of clarifying the Agency's policy and decreasing the number of unnecessary submissions, the Agency emphasized that it would no longer accept INDs considered exempt under SS 312.2(b)(1). (See SS 312.2(b)(4).) Furthermore, FDA stated that providing a drug for study would not, in and of itself, be viewed as a promotional activity if the manufacturer or distributor provides the product for a physician-initiated, bona fide clinical investigation. The Agency explained that it is the responsibility of the investigator to determine whether an IND is necessary.\n\nFootnote 4: Reinventing the Regulation of Cancer Drugs \u2013 Accelerating Approval and Expanding Access (March 1996), CBER, Office of Communication, Training, and Manufacturer Assistance, Voice Information System at 1-800-835-4709 or 301-827-1800, document ID number 0281. Available on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cber/genadmin/reincanc.htm\n\nDespite the Agency's attempts to clarify its policy on IND exemptions, many cancer drug IND applications that the Agency determines are exempt from IND regulation are still being submitted unnecessarily. From 1997 to 1999, a majority of investigator IND submissions for marketed cancer drugs were considered exempt (204, 205, and 140 applications in 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively).\n\nIII Risk/Benefit analysis in the practice of oncology\n\nAs noted above, a critical question in determining whether a study is exempt involves criterion 3 in the exemption regulations (SS 312.2(b)(1)(iii)): The investigation may not significantly increase the risk associated with use of a drug product. The question of increased risk is determined by assessing the deviation in the planned investigation from the use described in the approved label. In oncology, modifications of labeled dosing recommendations are common and occur as part of oncologists' clinical practice. As outlined below, oncologists are familiar with evaluating the risk of off-label dosing regimens for cancer drug and biological products.\n\nTreatment with cancer drugs may be associated with significant risk from known toxicity. Because effectiveness is often related to dose, a dose close to the maximal tolerated dose is often selected for studies of cancer drugs. This same dose usually becomes the recommended dose in labeling when the new cancer drug is approved with the knowledge that the dose may be altered if it is not tolerated by a patient. Because it is not generally possible to have maximal efficacy in a population without inducing toxicity in some patients, it is not uncommon to observe severe or even lethal side effects from cancer drugs in some patients. In general, these circumstances mean that the toxicity, even potentially lethal toxicity, of cancer drugs is described in approved labeling.\n--------------------\nContext title: IND Exemptions for Studies of Lawfully Marketed Drug or Biological Products for the Treatment of Cancer Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.957828938961029", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As outlined in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n--------------------\nContext: Although FDA will not accept as support for an IND or application for marketing approval any study that does not meet the conditions of 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will examine the data from such a study because the data may have a bearing on the safe use of the product.9 Sponsors and applicants are reminded that they must submit all studies and other information as required under the applicable regulations for drugs,10 including studies that do not comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nFootnote 9: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(2); 73 Fed. Reg. at 22807.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nA sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived.11 When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with the requirements in 21 CFR 312.120 in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Under 21 CFR 312.120, FDA will accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and if FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary.12 Note that marketing approval of a new drug based solely on foreign clinical data is governed by 21 CFR 314.106.\n\nFootnote 10: See, for example, 21 CFR 314.50, 314.80, 600.80, and 601.2.\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR part 312.\n\nThe GCP requirements at 21 CFR 312.120 help protect human subjects and enhance the quality and integrity of the resulting clinical data.13 They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.14 Many of the requirements at 21 CFR 312.120 are already incorporated into the IND regulations at 21 CFR part 312, as well as 21 CFR parts 50 and 56,15 and are consistent with certain international ethical and policy standards for clinical trials (e.g., International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) \"GoodClinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline\" (ICH E6), which FDA adopted for use as guidance for industry in 1997).16\n\nFootnote 16: ICH E6 and other FDA guidance documents adopted from the ICH are available electronically at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\n1 Acceptance of Studies (21 Cfr 312.120(a))\n\nFDA regulations define GCP as \"a standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials in a way that provides assurance that the data are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects are protected.\"17\n\nFootnote 17: 21 CFR 312.120(a)(1)(i).\n\nGCP includes review and approval (or provision of a favorable opinion) by an independent ethics committee (IEC) before initiating a study, continuing review of an ongoing study by an IEC, and obtaining and documenting the freely given informed consent of the subject (or a subject's legally authorized representative, if the subject is unable to provide informed consent) before initiating a study.\n\nAs defined at 21 CFR 312.3(b), an IEC is \"a review panel that is responsible for ensuring the protection of the rights, safety, and well-being of human subjects involved in a clinical investigation, and is adequately constituted to provide assurance of that protection.\" We consider an IEC to be \"adequately constituted\" if it includes a reasonable number of members with the qualifications and experience to perform the IEC's functions. One type of IEC is an institutional review board (IRB) as defined in 21 CFR 56.102(g) and subject to the requirements of 21 CFR part 56. Another type of IEC is one that adheres to section 3.2.1 of ICH E6. Compliance with 21 CFR part 56 or ICH E6 is not required, however, for an IEC to be considered \"adequately constituted\" under 21 CFR 312.120. We have expressly allowed for flexibility in how to meet the requirements of this regulation in recognition that the organization and membership of IECs may differ among countries because of local needs.18 For more information on IEC membership, see Section 3.2.6 of this guidance document, below.\n\nFootnote 18: 73 Fed. Reg. at 22805.\n\nICH E6 defines informed consent as \"a process by which a subject voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to participate in a particular trial, after having been informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to the subject's decision to participate.\"19 Informed consent is \"documented by means of a written, signed, and dated informed consent form.\"20 In obtaining and documenting informed consent, an investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) and should adhere to principles of GCP.21 Prior to the beginning of the trial, the investigator should obtain the IEC's written approval of the informed consent form and any additional written information that will be provided to study subjects.22\n\nFootnote 19: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM073122.pdf.\n\nAppendix B Supporting Information (21 CFR 312.120(b))\n\nA sponsor or applicant submitting non-IND foreign data in support of an IND or an application for marketing approval for a drug must include a description of the actions the sponsor or applicant took to ensure that the research conformed to GCP. Because the description is not required to duplicate information already submitted in the IND or the application for marketing approval, the sponsor or applicant may indicate the location of the required information by providing cross-references (and/or hyperlinks) to relevant sections of the IND application, to relevant sections of an application for marketing approval, or to relevant sections of previously submitted materials.\n\nThe location of all information required by 21 CFR 312.120 should be clearly delineated in the submission. FDA recommends that the sponsor or applicant clearly indicate the following:\n\nwhether each clinical study was conducted at both foreign and domestic sites or only foreign sites;\n\nwhether each foreign site was under an IND or was subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120; and\n\nfor each clinical study subject to 21 CFR 312.120, where in the submission or in previously submitted materials the following information can be found: 1. each of the elements required under 21 CFR 312.120(b) (e.g., \"Information showing that the study is adequate and well controlled, 21 CFR 312.120(b)(5) -- See IND Application, Section X.1, pp. y-z\"); and 2. any waiver requests as applicable under 21 CFR 312.120(c) (e.g., \"Waiver request for certain requirements applicable to Study [X] -- see IND Application, Section X.6, pp. y-z\").\n\nClearly delineating where the required information can be found will facilitate FDA's review of the IND or marketing application by enabling Agency confirmation of the sponsor's/applicant's compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120.\n\nWithin an eCTD format of an application (for marketing approval or an IND), FDA recommends that a sponsor or applicant list the studies subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120 in Section 5.2 of Module 5. The listing can be part of an overall tabular listing or be constructed as an accompanying table and appropriately identified as such. A sponsor or applicant might also use a submission's cover letter, particularly in the case of an IND, to indicate whether the submission contains studies subject to 21 CFR 312.120. Whether in Module 5 or in a cover letter, the submission should contain page references and/or links to the respective individual full Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) for the identified studies.\n\nWithin a CSR of a study, using an ICH E3 format as an example, FDA recommends that a sponsor or applicant identify on the Title Page that the study is being submitted in accordance with 21 CFR 312.120. The Title Page should contain a reference and/or alink to a section or an appendix which specifically addresses the sponsor's compliance with 21 CFR 312.120. (In ICH E3 format, such an Appendix would be in addition to the kind of Appendices already listed in the ICH E3 Guidance, e.g. 16.5). FDA further recommends identifying specific foreign non-IND clinical sites using Appendix 16.1.4 (\"List and Description of Investigators\") in ICH E3 format or a similarly designated section.\n\nThe section or appendix specifically intended to address compliance with 21 CFR 312.120 should include a brief statement describing actions the sponsor has taken and should provide supporting information in accordance with all the required elements as listed in the regulations (see below). FDA anticipates that for each such element the sponsor would provide the necessary information or provide reference and/or links to other sections of the study report which contain the information. FDA strongly advises against duplicating information provided elsewhere in the application.\n\nThe regulation allows for flexibility in how the requirements are to be met. For example, a full CSR prepared in accordance with ICH E3 \"Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports\"23 may meet many of the requirements under 21 CFR 312.120, but adherence to ICH E3 is not required. The same holds for ICH E6: a sponsor or applicant may choose but is not required to meet many of the requirements of this rule through adherence to ICH E6. Note, however, that even if studies are submitted according to ICH E3 or E6, in some cases it may be necessary to provide additional information to FDA to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 312.120, as well as other applicable requirements in 21 CFR parts 312, 314, or 601.24\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.3168274760246277"], "Having read through CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the guidance for submission of documentation in applications for parametric release of human and veterinary drug products terminally sterilized by moist heat processes?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the guidance for submission of documentation in applications for parametric release of human and veterinary drug products terminally sterilized by moist heat processes?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry\n\nSubmission of Documentation in Applications for Parametric Release of Human and Veterinary Drug Products Terminally Sterilized by Moist Heat Processes\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Veterinary Medicine (CVM)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nFebruary 2010\n\nCMC\n\nChapter 6 Outdance for Industry\n\nSubmission of Documentation in Applications for Parametric Release of Human and Veterinary Drug Products Terminally Sterilized by Moist Heat Processes\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Communications\n\nDivision of Drug Information\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10903 New Hampshire Avenue\n\nBldg. 51, rm. 2201\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\n(Tel) 301-796-3400\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nand/or_\n\nCommunications Staff, HFV-12\n\nCenter for Veterinary Medicine\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n7519 Standish Place, Rockville, MD 20855\n\n(Tel) 240-276-9300\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustrv/default.htm\n\nand/or\n\nOffice of Communication, Outreach, and\n\nDevelopment, HFM-40\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n1401 Rockville Pike, Suite 200N, Rockville, MD 20852-1448\n\n(Tel) 800-835-4709 or 301-827-1800\n\nocod@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Veterinary Medicine (CVM)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nFebruary 2010\n\nCMC\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Pharmaceutical Science in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) in cooperation with CDER\u2019s Office of Compliance, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nSubmission of Documentation in Applications for Parametric Release of Human and Veterinary Drug Products Terminally Sterilized by Moist Heat Processes\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic.

If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nThis guidance provides recommendations to applicants on information to include in support of parametric release for sterile products2 terminally sterilized by moist heat when submitting a new drug application (NDA), abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), new animal drug application (NADA), abbreviated new animal drug application (ANADA), biologics license application (BLA), or supplement or other postmarketing report.\n\nFootnote 2: The term product includes final products that are regulated by CDER, CVM, and CBER.\n\nFootnote 3: See 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(ii)(a) or 21 CFR 514.1(b)(5)(vii)(b).\n\nCurrently, FDA requires that sterile products meet certain sterility requirements before release to the market.3.4 In many cases, the requirements for batch release are fulfilled by conducting a sterility test on finished units drawn from the batch. Parametric release is defined as a sterility assurance release program where demonstrated control of the sterilization process enables a firm to use defined critical process controls, in lieu of the sterility test, to fulfill the intent of 21 CFR 211.165(a), and 211.167(a).5 Under this strategy, market release of terminally sterilized products can be based upon meeting the defined sterilization parameters and not on performing an approved sterility test. Meeting the requirements of the parametric release process can provide greater assurance that a batch meets the sterility requirement than can be achieved with a sterility test of finished units drawn from the batch.\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 CFR 211.167(a) for drug products or 21 CFR 610.12 for biologic products. In addition, refer to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapters: (<)1(>) (Injections), (<)71(>) (Sterility), and (<)1041(>) (Biologicals). Short-lived radiopharmaceuticals, including positron emission tomography (PET) drugs, are subject to sterility testing; however, they may be released prior to completion of this test (21 CFR 211.165(a)).\n\nFootnote 5: For information on how current good manufacturing practices will be applied for products subject to parametric release that are within the scope of this guidance, see the FDA Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 460.800.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\n[150] Risk Assessment, Process Understanding, and Prior Knowledge\n\n[152] Successful parametric release systems are based on the reliability of the control strategy of the sterility assurance program. We recommend that your risk assessment focus on the risk of failure to achieve the minimum required probability of a non-sterile unit for each unit of every batch. The risk assessment should include the following:\n\n[153] Consistency of performance of the terminal sterilization cycle within the validated limits.\n\n[154] A discussion of risk to the sterility of the product relative to the following: (1) the production terminal sterilization cycle, (2) the production loading patterns, (3) the container closure system (including secondary packaging), and (4) any potential contamination risks from the environment (as appropriate). For an approved application, you should indicate any changes to the above items and provide an assessment of the risk to the sterility of the product associated with those changes. For example, although the established minimum sterilization time cannot be lowered, the maximum sterilization time can be increased if the appropriate stability data are provided to support the increase.\n\n[167] Experience with the proposed or similar product (and container closure system) and proposed or similar sterilization process, the overall risks to sterility, and the steps you have taken to assess and control these risks. For new products, prior knowledge from developmental and registration/exhibit batches may suffice.\n\n[168] A discussion of your overall prior knowledge and production and testing experience relevant to the drug product that will be subject to parametric release.\n\n[169] Documentation for Parametric Release Process\n\n[170] The following information specific to the proposed parametric release process should also be included in your submission:\n\n[171] A citation to a complete and detailed description of the current relevant terminal sterilization cycle.\n\n[172] Identification of the critical process parameters (process/cycle parameters and appropriate load monitors essential for product release) for the product(s) proposed for parametric release, including the minimum and maximum limits for these critical parameters. The critical process parameters should be within the limits that have been validated and approved for sterility assurance of the subject product(s).\n\n[173] **Acknowledgement that adherence to the critical parameters of the parametric release program will substitute for the performance of a sterility test as the primary release criterion for the product and that sterility test results from the finished product will not be used to overrule any failure to meet the acceptance criteria of the parametric release program. In the event of failure, the specific sterilizer load will be rejected by the quality control unit and will not be released unless there is a provision for reprocessing.\n\nAcknowledgement that regardless of the batch release technique used, any specimen tested according to the reference test method for sterility (e.g., compendium or FDA regulations) will meet the criteria for sterility (such as during testing for stability or postmarketing investigations).\n\nA description of the sterilization load monitor that indicates the following: (1) the type of monitor being proposed, (2) how the load monitor will be used and analyzed, (3) what functions are being measured by the monitor, and (4) the rationale for the location of the monitor. Additionally, for indirect monitors, we recommend that you include a statement justifying the classification of the indirect indicator that you are using as defined by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI 2008). In certain circumstances a Class 3 indicator may be appropriate; however, a Class 5 indicator is recommended for most situations.\n\nDocumentation of the control system to verify exposure of the load to the sterilization process.\n--------------------\nContext title: Submission of Documentation in Applications for Parametric Release of Human and Veterinary Drug Products Terminally Sterilized by Moist Heat Processes Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 7.319103240966797", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the guidance for submission of documentation in applications for parametric release of human and veterinary drug products terminally sterilized by moist heat processes?\n--------------------\nContext: orIndustry/UCM052487.pdf\n\n({}^{\\rm xi}) CVM GFI #64: Validation of Analytical Procedures: Methodology (July 1999).\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/Guidancef\n\norIndustry/UCM052379.pdf\n\n({}^{\\rm xi}) CVM GFI #93/VICH GL11(R): Impurities in New Veterinary Medicinal Products (Revised) (November 2007).\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/Guidancef\n\norIndustry/UCM052432.pdf\n\n({}^{\\rm iii}) United States Pharmacopoeia Chapter (<)661(>)Containers-Plastics.

Although this guidance does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the industry, it does represent the agency\u2019s current thinking on sterilization process validation documentation. For additional copies of this guidance, contact the Division of Communications Management, HFD-210, CDER, FDA, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857 (Phone: 301-594-1012) Send one self-addressed adhesive label to assist the office in processing your request. An electronic version of this guidance is also available via Internet via World Wide Web (WWW) (connect to the FDA Home Page at WWW.FDA.GOV/CDER and go to the \"Regulatory Guidance\" section).\n\nFOR THE SUBMISSION OF\n\nDOCUMENTATION FOR STERILIZATION PROCESS VALIDATION IN APPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN AND VETERINARY DRUG PRODUCTS\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nA. Purpose\n\nThis document is intended to provide guidance for the submission of information and data in support of the efficacy of sterilization processes in drug applications for both human and veterinary drugs. The recommendations in the guidance apply to applications for sterile drug products (new drug applications, new animal drug applications, abbreviated new drug applications, abbreviated antibiotic applications, and abbreviated new animal drug applications). These recommendations also apply to previously approved applications when supplements associated with the sterile processing of approved drugs are submitted. Information and data in support of sterility assurance may also be necessary in investigational new drug and investigational new animal drug applications.\n\nIn the FEDERAL REGISTER of October 11, 1991 (56 FR 51354), the agency published a proposed rule entitled \"Use of Aseptic Processing and Terminal Sterilization in the Preparation of Sterile Pharmaceuticalsfor Human and Veterinary Use.\" This guidance is not a substitution for or a supplement to that proposed rule. Regardless of whether the applicant uses terminal sterilization or aseptic processing to manufacture a drug product that is purported to be sterile, certain information about the validation of that process should be submitted for both of those types of sterilization.\n\nAppendix B Documenting Sterilization Process Validation\n\nThe efficacy of a given sterilization process for a specific drug product is evaluated on the basis of a series of protocols and scientific experiments designed to demonstrate that the sterilization process and associated control procedures can reproducibly deliver a sterile product. Data derived from experiments and control procedures allow conclusions to be drawn about the probability of nonsterile product units (sterility assurance level). Based on the scientific validity of the protocols and methods, as well as on the scientific validity of the results and conclusions, the agency concludes that the efficacy of the sterilization process is validated.\n\nWhether a drug product is sterilized by a terminal sterilization process or by an aseptic filling process, the efficacy of the sterilization process may be validated without the manufacture of three production batches.\n\nSterilization process validation data, however, should be generated using procedures and conditions that are fully representative and descriptive of the procedures and conditions proposed for manufacture of the product in the application.\n\nThe Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's (CDER's) and the Center for Veterinary Medicine's (CVM's) review of the validation of the sterilization process consists of a scientific evaluation of the studies submitted in the applications. This review is conducted by FDA's review staff, and is part of a cooperative effort between the review staff, compliance staff, and field investigators to ensure the overall state of control of the sterile processing of human and veterinary drug products. Information and data in support of sterility assurance may be provided directly to the application or by specific reference to a drug master file (DMF), a veterinary master file (VMF), or another application. Letters of authorization to refer to the referenced files should be included.\n\nAppendix C Remarks\n\nThis guidance is intended to provide recommendations for the types of information applicants should include in human and animal drug applications. Regulatory requirements for the submission of information and data in various applications are specified in the sections listed below:Human Drugs:\n\nInvestigational new drug applications\n\nNew drug applications\n\nAbbreviated new drug and abbreviated\n\nantibiotic drug applications\n\nSupplements to NDA's and ANDA's\n\nAnimal Drugs:\n\nInvestigational new animal drug applications\n\nNew animal drug applications\n\nSupplements to NADA's\n\n21 CFR 312.23(a)(7)\n\n21 CFR 314.50\n\n21 CFR 314.94 and 314.50\n\nSupplements to NADA's\n\n21 CFR 314.70\n\nII Information for terminal moist heat sterilization processes\n\nThe following types of information should be submitted in support of sterility assurance for products produced using terminal moist heat sterilization.

(See also sections II.B. and II.C. of this guidance.)The Autoclave Process and Performance Specifications\n\nA description of the autoclave process, including pertinent information such as cycle type (e.g., saturated steam, water immersion, and water spray), cycle parameters and performance specifications including temperature, pressure, time, and minimum and maximum (\\mathsf{F_{o}}). Identify the autoclave(s) to be used for production sterilization, including manufacturer and model.\n4. Autoclave Loading Patterns A description of representative autoclave loading patterns should be provided.\n5. Methods and Controls to Monitor Production Cycles Methods and controls used to monitor routine production cycles (e.g., thermocouples, pilot bottles, and biological indicators) should be described, including the number and location of each as well as acceptance and rejection specifications.\n6. Requalification of Production Autoclaves A description of the program for routine and unscheduled requalification of production autoclaves, including frequency, should be provided.\n7. Reprocessing A description and validation summary of any program that provides for reprocessing (e.g., additional thermal processing) of product should be provided. Please note that the stability program is also affected by additional thermal processing. For further information concerning the stability program, reference is made to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research \"Guideline for Submitting Documentation for the Stability of Human Drugs and Biologics\" and to the Center for Veterinary Medicine \"Drug Stability Guideline.\"\n8. Thermal Qualification of the Cycle\n9. Heat Distribution and Penetration Studies Heat distribution and penetration study protocols and data summaries that demonstrate the uniformity, reproducibility, and conformance to specifications of the production sterilization cycle should be provided. Results from a minimum of three consecutive, successful cycles should be provided to ensure that the results are consistent and meaningful.\n2. Thermal Monitors The number of thermal monitors used and their location in the chamber should be described. A diagram is helpful.\n3. The Effects of Loading on Thermal Input Data should be generated with minimum and maximum load to demonstrate the effects of loading on thermal input to product. Additional studies may be necessary if different fill volumes are used in the same container line. Data summaries are acceptable for these purposes. A summary should consist of, for example, high and low temperatures (range), average temperature during the dwell period, minimum and maximum (F_{0}) values, dwell time, run date and time, and identification of the autoclave(s) used. These data should have been generated from studies carried out in production autoclave(s) that will be used for sterilization of the product that is the subject of the application.\n4. Information Included in the Batch Record The batch record supplied with the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls section of the application should identify the validated processes to be used for sterilization and for depyrogenation of any container-closure components. This information can be included in the batch record by reference to the validation protocol or standard operating procedure (SOP). Validation information should be provided as described above.\n\nMicrobiological Efficacy of the Cycle Validation studies that demonstrate the efficacy (Iethality) of the production cycle should be provided. A sterility assurance of 10-6 or better should be demonstrated for any terminal sterilization process. This level of sterility assurance should be demonstrated for all parts of the drug product (including the container and closure, if applicable), which are claimed to be sterile. The specific type of study and the methods used to carry out the study (or studies) are product and process specific and may vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. In general, the following types of information and data should be provided.\n\nIdentification and Characterization of Bioburden Organisms Describe the methods and results from studies used to identify and characterize bioburden organisms. The amount and type of information supplied may be dependent on the validation strategy chosen. For example, more information may be needed for bioburden-based autoclave processes than for overkill processes. Information concerning the number, type, and resistance of bioburden organisms may be necessary, including those organisms associated with the product solution and the container and closure. It may be necessary to identify the most heat-resistant bioburden organisms.\n\nSpecifications for Bioburden Specifications (alert and action levels) for bioburden should be provided. A description should be included of the program for routinely monitoring bioburden to ensure that validated and established limits are not exceeded (e.g., frequency of analysis and methods used in bioburden screening). The methods provided should be specific.\n\nIdentification, Resistance, and Stability of Biological Indicators Information and data concerning the identification, resistance (D and Z values), and stability of biological indicators used in the biological validation of the cycle should be provided. If biological indicators are purchased from a commercial source, it may be necessary to corroborate the microbial count and resistance, and provide performance specifications.\n\nThe Resistance of the Biological Indicator Relative to That of Bioburden Studies characterizing the resistance of the biological indicator relative to that of bioburden may be necessary. Resistance in or on the product (i.e., in the product solution, or on the surface of container or closure parts or interfaces) should be determined as necessary. If spore carriers are used (e.g., spore strips), the resistance of spores on the carrier relative to that of directly inoculated product should be determined, if necessary.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]\n\nunits that have been exposed to the maximum sterilization cycle(s). If a product is exposed to more than one process, then exposure to the maximum cycle of all processes should be incorporated into the study design.\n3. Multiple Barriers Each barrier that separates areas of the drug product claimed to be sterile should be separately evaluated and validated.\n4. The Sensitivity of the Test The sensitivity of the experimental method used for container-closure integrity testing should be specified and provided.\n5. Integrity Over the Product Shelf Life Microbial integrity of the container-closure system should be demonstrated over the shelf life of the product. (See section V.A. of this guidance.)\n\nF. Bacterial Endotoxins Test and Method The bacterial endotoxins test used for the product should be described. The description should include qualification of the laboratory, inhibition and enhancement testing and results, determination of noninhibitory concentration and maximum valid dilution. For further information see the agency guidance entitled \"Guideline on Validation of the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Test As An End-Product Endotoxin Test for Human And Animal Parenteral Drugs, Biological Products, and Medical Devices.\"\n6. Sterility Testing Methods and Release Criteria Sterility test methods should be described and should include the protocol for the selection of representative units during production. When test methods differ significantly from compendial test methods, a demonstration of the equivalency to the compendial method should be provided. Testing performed within barrier systems should be described, and information concerning validation of the barrier system may be necessary.\n\nH. Evidence of Formal, Written ProceduresSection 211.113(b) of the Code of Federal Regulations requires that written procedures, designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile, be established and followed. Such procedures should include validation of any sterilization process. Therefore, evidence should be provided that there are formal, written procedures describing the elements listed above and that these procedures are followed. Such evidence may consist of SOP's, listing of SOP's, and protocols submitted as part of these elements.\n\n3 Other Terminal Sterilization Processes\n--------------------\nContext title: Submission Documentation for Sterilization Process Validation in Applications for Human and Veterinary Drug Products Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.4998397827148438", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the guidance for submission of documentation in applications for parametric release of human and veterinary drug products terminally sterilized by moist heat processes?\n--------------------\nContext: 4.3.8 Environmental and Personnel Monitoring\n\nEnvironmental monitoring is crucial to maintaining aseptic conditions. We recommend that microbiological testing of aseptic workstations be performed during sterility testing and critical aseptic manipulation. Methods can include using swabs or contact plates for surfaces and settling plates or dynamic air samplers for air quality.\n\n4.3.9 Parametric Release of Terminally Sterilized Products\n\nParametric release of a terminally sterilized PET drug product may be appropriate if conducted in accordance with the conditions stated in the product's approved application.\n\nProcess Verification and Computer Control\n\nSection 212.50(f)(1) states that for PET drug production in which every batch undergoes full finished-product testing to ensure the PET drug meets all specifications (e.g., FDG F 18), process verification is not required.\n\nSection 212.50(f)(2) requires that when the results of the production of an entire batch of a PET drug are not fully verified through finished-product testing or when only the initial sub-batch in a series is tested, the PET drug producer must demonstrate that the process for producing the PET drug is reproducible and is capable of producing a drug product that meets the predetermined acceptance criteria. Process verification activities and results must be documented.\n\nDocumentation must include the date and signature of the individual(s) performing the verification, the monitoring and control methods and data, and the major equipment qualified. The determination not to conduct process verification for a PET drug should be supported by scientific rationale and data.\n\n1 Process Verification Under $ 212.50(f)(2)\n\nFor a PET drug production facility that has an established history of PET drug production, the process verification can be accomplished using historical batch records, provided that there is adequate accumulated data to support a conclusion that the current process yields batches meeting predetermined acceptance criteria. We recommend that a comprehensive review of accumulated production, testing, and control data be conducted according to a written protocol defining the acceptable conditions. The accumulated data should verify that the process used was consistent and should document all changes to and failures of the process.\n\nWe recommend that new processes or significant changes to existing processes be shown to reliably produce PET drugs meeting the predetermined acceptance criteria before any batches are distributed. This verification should be conducted according to a written protocol and generally include at least three consecutive acceptable production runs.\n\nBecause of the unique characteristics of PET drug production, a PET producer may decide to evaluate the reliability of a new process or a significant change to an existing process to produce a PET drug by meeting the predetermined acceptance criteria concurrently with the distribution of the batch, provided that this approach is consistent with 21 CFR 314.70 and is set forth in the product's approved application. Such a decision should be justified in writing, subjected to quality assurance procedures, and performed according to a written protocol. Each batch should be processed in strict adherence to the written procedures, fully tested (except sterility testing), and found to comply with all procedural and quality test requirements prior to final release.\n\n2 Computer Control\n\nSynthesis of some PET drugs can be executed under automated or computer control. We recommend that the operation of the computer program be verified before first use todemonstrate that the program is suitable for its intended purposes and is capable of producing results that meet the predetermined acceptance criteria. We also recommend that subsequent changes or upgrades made to the computer program be documented and the process demonstrated to be capable of producing a PET drug that meets the predetermined acceptance criteria. PET drug production facilities can rely on a certification by the software or system vendor that the specified software was verified under its operating conditions.\n\n9 Laboratory Controls\n\nRegulatory Requirements\n\nSection 212.60 requires the establishment and implementation of procedures for testing components, in-process materials, and finished PET drug products. All necessary tests of materials and products must be documented. Each laboratory must have sampling and testing procedures designed to ensure that components, drug product containers and closures, in-process materials, and PET drug products conform to appropriate standards. Analytical methods and test equipment must be suitable for their intended uses. Reagents, solutions, and supplies used in testing procedures must be adequately controlled. The preventive maintenance, calibration, and procedures to make sure that the equipment is functioning properly must be documented. A complete record of all tests related to the production of a PET drug must be kept to ensure compliance with established specifications and standards, including examinations and assays, as follows:\n\nA suitable identification of the sample.\n\nA description of each method used in the testing of the sample, a record of all calculations performed in connection with each test, and a statement of the weight or measurement of the sample used for each test.\n\nA complete record of all data (including graphs, charts, and spectra), e.g., a print-out of the chromatogram with the calculated amounts of each component analyzed by the test.\n\nA statement of results of the tests and their relation to acceptance criteria.\n\nThe initials or signature of the analyst and the date of the test.\n\nLaboratory Controls\n\nUnder SS 212.60, a PET drug production facility must have written test procedures that describe how to conduct each test of finished products and, where applicable, of components and in-process materials. Appropriate testing procedures must be established to ensure that PET drugs conform to appropriate standards, including established standards (e.g., relevant USP monographs) of identity, strength, quality, and purity. Analytical tests must be suitable for their intended purpose and must be sufficiently sensitive, specific, reproducible, and accurate).\n\nWe recommend that any new analytical test method be validated, through documented data, to show that it will consistently yield results that accurately reflect the quality characteristics of the product tested. The FDA and USP have published information for determining the appropriate analytical parameters (e.g., accuracy, precision, linearity, ruggedness) that should be used to validate a new method (see ICH Q2A Text on Validation of Analytical Procedures and USP General Chapter (<)1225(>)Validation of Compendial Methods).\n\nIf a USP analytical test method is used, a PET drug producer should verify that the method works under the actual conditions of use.\n\nMost analyses use reference standards. We recommend that PET drug production facilities establish the reference standards identified in the analytical procedure or SOP. When a primary reference standard is obtained from an officially recognized source (e.g., USP), the material usually does not need further testing if it is stored under conditions consistent with the supplier's recommendations. However, where an official standard is not available or if a PET drug production facility establishes its own reference standard, we recommend that data to fully confirm the material's identity and purity be established and documented. Documentation such as reference spectra or other supporting data to prove the identity and purity of the reference standard may be available from the supplier.\n\nUnder SS 212.60(f), equipment must be routinely calibrated and maintained according to the established written procedures (see section VI). We recommend that PET drug production facilities verify that the equipment is in good working condition at the time the samples are analyzed. We also recommend that prior to each day of use of the HPLC and GC, a system suitability test using reference standards be conducted to verify that the resolution and reproducibility of the chromatographic system are adequate for the analysis to be done.\n\nWe recommend that any reagent or solution prepared on-site be adequately controlled (including temperature control, if applicable) and properly labeled with respect to identity, composition, and expiration date.\n\nRaw test data (such as chromatograms, spectra, and printouts) and any calculations performed can be documented and become part of the batch production and control record. Records should have information such as the source of the test material, a description of the appearance of the material, the amount used, test and acceptance criteria, and an entry for data and interpretation of results. Laboratory controls should be followed and documented at the time of performance.\n\nContents Are Only Recommendations\n\nWe recommend that deviation from written procedures be documented and justified. Any out-of-specification results obtained should be investigated and documented.\n\nX Stability Testing\n\nRegulatory Requirements\n\nSection 212.61 requires the establishment of a written stability testing program for each PET drug product. This program must be used to establish suitable storage conditions as well as expiration dates and times.\n\nGuidance on Stability\n--------------------\nContext title: PET Drugs--Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP); Small Entity Compliance Guide \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.2071358561515808", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , What is the guidance for submission of documentation in applications for parametric release of human and veterinary drug products terminally sterilized by moist heat processes?\n--------------------\nContext: 4.3.8 Environmental and Personnel Monitoring\n\nEnvironmental monitoring is crucial to maintaining aseptic conditions. We recommend that microbiological testing of aseptic workstations be performed during sterility testing and critical aseptic manipulation. Methods can include using swabs or contact plates for surfaces and settling plates or dynamic air samplers for air quality.\n\n4.3.9 Parametric Release of Terminally Sterilized Products\n\nParametric release of a terminally sterilized PET drug product may be appropriate if conducted in accordance with the conditions stated in the product's approved application.\n\nProcess Verification and Computer Control\n\nSection 212.50(f)(1) states that for PET drug production in which every batch undergoes full finished-product testing to ensure the PET drug meets all specifications (e.g., FDG F 18), process verification is not required.\n\nSection 212.50(f)(2) requires that when the results of the production of an entire batch of a PET drug are not fully verified through finished-product testing or when only the initial sub-batch in a series is tested, the PET drug producer must demonstrate that the process for producing the PET drug is reproducible and is capable of producing a drug product that meets the predetermined acceptance criteria. Process verification activities and results must be documented.\n\nDocumentation must include the date and signature of the individual(s) performing the verification, the monitoring and control methods and data, and the major equipment qualified. The determination not to conduct process verification for a PET drug should be supported by scientific rationale and data.\n\n1 Process Verification Under $ 212.50(f)(2)\n\nFor a PET drug production facility that has an established history of PET drug production, the process verification can be accomplished using historical batch records, provided that there is adequate accumulated data to support a conclusion that the current process yields batches meeting predetermined acceptance criteria. We recommend that a comprehensive review of accumulated production, testing, and control data be conducted according to a written protocol defining the acceptable conditions. The accumulated data should verify that the process used was consistent and should document all changes to and failures of the process.\n\nWe recommend that new processes or significant changes to existing processes be shown to reliably produce PET drugs meeting the predetermined acceptance criteria before any batches are distributed. This verification should be conducted according to a written protocol and generally include at least three consecutive acceptable production runs.\n\nBecause of the unique characteristics of PET drug production, a PET producer may decide to evaluate the reliability of a new process or a significant change to an existing process to produce a PET drug by meeting the predetermined acceptance criteria concurrently with the distribution of the batch, provided that this approach is consistent with 21 CFR 314.70 and is set forth in the product's approved application. Such a decision should be justified in writing, subjected to quality assurance procedures, and performed according to a written protocol. Each batch should be processed in strict adherence to the written procedures, fully tested (except sterility testing), and found to comply with all procedural and quality test requirements prior to final release.\n\n2 Computer Control\n\nSynthesis of some PET drugs can be executed under automated or computer control. We recommend that the operation of the computer program be verified before first use todemonstrate that the program is suitable for its intended purposes and is capable of producing results that meet the predetermined acceptance criteria. We also recommend that subsequent changes or upgrades made to the computer program be documented and the process demonstrated to be capable of producing a PET drug that meets the predetermined acceptance criteria. PET drug production facilities can rely on a certification by the software or system vendor that the specified software was verified under its operating conditions.\n\n9 Laboratory Controls\n\nRegulatory Requirements\n\nSection 212.60 requires the establishment and implementation of procedures for testing components, in-process materials, and finished PET drug products. All necessary tests of materials and products must be documented. Each laboratory must have sampling and testing procedures designed to ensure that components, drug product containers and closures, in-process materials, and PET drug products conform to appropriate standards. Analytical methods and test equipment must be suitable for their intended uses. Reagents, solutions, and supplies used in testing procedures must be adequately controlled. The preventive maintenance, calibration, and procedures to make sure that the equipment is functioning properly must be documented. A complete record of all tests related to the production of a PET drug must be kept to ensure compliance with established specifications and standards, including examinations and assays, as follows:\n\nA suitable identification of the sample.\n\nA description of each method used in the testing of the sample, a record of all calculations performed in connection with each test, and a statement of the weight or measurement of the sample used for each test.\n\nA complete record of all data (including graphs, charts, and spectra), e.g., a print-out of the chromatogram with the calculated amounts of each component analyzed by the test.\n\nA statement of results of the tests and their relation to acceptance criteria.\n\nThe initials or signature of the analyst and the date of the test.\n\nLaboratory Controls\n\nUnder SS 212.60, a PET drug production facility must have written test procedures that describe how to conduct each test of finished products and, where applicable, of components and in-process materials.

The PMA includes sections containing, among other things, technical data, non-clinical laboratory studies, and clinical investigations.28 Before approving or denying a PMA, the appropriate FDA advisory committee29 may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide FDA with the committee's recommendation on whether FDA should approve the submission.30\n\nFootnote 25: Class III devices are devices (1) for which there is insufficient information to determine that general controls and special controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, and (2) which are purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury (see section 513(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act).\n\n2.2.2 De Novo Classification Requests\n\nDevices of a new type that FDA has not previously classified or reclassified based on the criteria in section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act are automatically classified into class III by operation of section 513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, and may be classified into class I or class II under the De Novo classification process.\n\nIf a sponsor believes its product is appropriate for classification into class I31 or class II,32 it may submit a request for De Novo classification.33 If the sponsor demonstrates that the criteria in section 513(a)(1)(A) or (B) of the FD&C Act are met, FDA grants the request for De Novo classification and issues a written order classifying the specific product and product type in class I or class II. If the product is classified as class II, it is granted marketing authorization subject to general controls, as well as identified special controls which provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.34 Such a product may serve as a legally marketed (predicate)35 product for future 510(k) submissions. If the product cannot be classified as class I or II, the De Novo request is declined and the product remains in class III and subject to PMA approval.\n\nFootnote 31: Class I products are subject to a set of regulatory authorities called general controls (see section 513(a)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act). General controls include, but are not limited to, provisions that relate to establishment registration and listing, premarket notification, prohibitions against adulteration and misbranding, records and reports, and good manufacturing practices.\n\nFootnote 32: Class II products are products for which general controls, by themselves, are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the product, and for which there is sufficient information to establish special controls necessary to provide such assurance (see section 513(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act). Special controls are product type-specific and may include promulgation of performance standards, requirements for postmarket surveillance, patient registries, labeling, and performance testing and clinical/non-clinical data.\n\nFootnote 33: See section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 860, subpart D (86 FR 54826, October 5, 2021). See also the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff De Novo Classification Process (Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation)(October 2021).\n\nFootnote 34: Such special controls will generally be established through consultation and alignment with the non-lead center.\n\nFootnote 35: A legally marketed (predicate) device to which a new device may be compared for a determination regarding substantial equivalence is a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, or a device which has been reclassified from class III to class II or I, or a device which has been found to be substantially equivalent through the 510(k) premarket notification process (see 21 CFR 807.92(a)(3)).\n\nFootnote 36: See sections 513(a)(1)(B), 513(f)(1), 513(i), and 515(a)(2) of the FD&C Act; S.

To be class II by being within the same type as the product that was the subject of the De Novo, future products must be found substantially equivalent and comply with general controls and applicable special controls for the product type; a failure to comply with special controls will cause the product to be class III and subject to PMA approval.36\n\nFootnote 36: See sections 513(a)(1)(B), 513(f)(1), 513(i), and 515(a)(2) of the FD&C Act; S. REP. NO. 105-43 at 35 (1997).\n\nA sponsor may request De Novo classification without submitting a 510(k) first; FDA may decline to undertake such request if FDA identifies a predicate product that could provide a reasonable basis for review of substantial equivalence, or if FDA determines either that the product submitted is not of low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls to mitigate the risks cannot be developed.37 Among other considerations, understanding of the biological product or drug constituent parts, including limitations of such understanding, need to be considered when determining the suitability of the De Novo pathway for such device-led combination products. Because certain products present unique concerns (such as, for certain biological products,38 considerations associated with infectious disease transmission and challenges associated with ensuring reproducibility of such biological products), management of such concerns should be considered in determining the suitability of the De Novo pathway.\n\nSee annex for illustrative examples on how these principles can be applied.\n\niii.1.3 Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions\n\nThe 510(k) review standard (substantial equivalence of a new product to a predicate product) differs from the PMA and De Novo review standards. The 510(k) review standard is comparative, whereas the PMA and De Novo review standards rely on an independent demonstration of safety and effectiveness. Nonetheless, the principles of safety and effectiveness underlie the substantial equivalence determination in every 510(k) review.\n\nThe standard for a determination of substantial equivalence in a 510(k) review is set out in section 513(i) of the FD&C Act. A product is substantially equivalent to a predicate product if it:\n\nhas the same intended use as the predicate product; and\n\nhas the same technological characteristics as the predicate product;\n\nor\n\nhas the same intended use as the predicate product;\n\nhas different technological characteristics39; and\n\nthe information submitted to FDA, including appropriate clinical or scientific data if deemed necessary, demonstrates that the product:\n\nFootnote 39: Different technological characteristics are defined as \u201csignificant change in the materials, design, energy source, or other features\u201d from the predicate. Section 513(i)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 807.100(b)(2)(ii)(A).\n\ndoes not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate product; and\n\ndemonstrates that the product is as safe and effective as the predicate product.40\n\nFootnote 40: See section 513(i)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act; 21 CFR 807.100(b). See also the guidance for industry and Food and Drug Administration staff The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications [510(k)].\n\nFDA considers the product's relative safety and effectiveness in the substantial equivalence determination, and safety and effectiveness considerations are also critical to the Agency's evaluation of compliance with any applicable special controls, all of which FDA has determined to be necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the product type.\n\nThe following products cannot be cleared in a 510(k) submission:\n\nProduct with a new intended use as compared to the predicate product\n\nProduct with different technological characteristics than the predicate product if such differences raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate product.41\n\nFootnote 41: Ibid.\n\nGenerally, a device that is not combined with a drug or biological product constituent part could not be successfully used as a predicate for a 510(k) for a device-led combination product. This is because the addition of the drug or biological product constituent part would likely result in a new intended use and/or constitute a different technological characteristic that raises different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate. In addition, a product with a different active ingredient from a predicate would differ significantly in features such as design and materials, which would likely raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as well.42\n\nFootnote 42: In certain instances, it may be possible for special controls to specify multiple specific active ingredients or an active ingredient class, provided general and special controls are sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the product.\n--------------------\nContext title: Principles of Premarket Pathways for Combination Products Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.8952479362487793", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAnnual Reports for Approved\n\nPremarket Approval Applications\n\n(PMA)\n\nGuidance for Industry and Food\n\nand Drug Administration Staff\n\nDocument issued on December 16, 2019.\n\nDocument originally issued on February 10, 2014.\n\nFor questions regarding the use or interpretation of this guidance document in the review of annual reports for premarket approval applications (PMA), please contact ORP: Office of Regulatory Programs/Division of Regulatory Programs 1: Submission Support at 301-796-5640.\n\nFor questions regarding the application of this guidance to devices regulated by the Center for\n\nBiologicals Evaluation and Research (CBER), contact CBER's Office of Communication, Outreach\n\nand Development (OCOD) at 1-800- 835-4709 or 240-402-8010, or by email at occod@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nPreface\n\nPublic Comment\n\nYou may submit electronic comments and suggestions at any time for Agency consideration to http://www.regulations.gov.

FDA believes that data and information gathered in the postmarket setting are critical to our continued confidence in the safety and effectiveness of the marketed device. Annual reports are one of the important tools that FDA relies on to gather information about the device in its post-approval setting.\n\nAnnual reports contain a variety of information, including information about manufacturing changes, design changes, and labeling changes that were made during the preceding year for the PMA product. This guidance recommends that this and other information be analyzed and presented in annual reports in a way that will be most useful to both the applicant and FDA. For example, the guidance recommends that the applicant describe in detail the rationale for changes made to the device, including, for example, whether the changes were the result of device improvement/enhancement, product complaints, or adverse events. This explanation will give FDA a more complete picture of the post-market safety profile of the device. The guidance also recommends that the applicant include a summary of all changes that were made to the device during the reporting period, including listing all supplements submitted during the reporting period and, if approved, their approval date. Having the information submitted in this way will help ensure that limited Agency resources are devoted to assessing meaningful information rather than requiring FDA to sift through vast amounts of data that have not been systematically reviewed by the firm.\n\nAnnual reports that contain clear descriptions and meaningful information are an important tool for the Agency and the industry to assure postmarket safety and protect the public. When applicants prepare and provide to FDA in annual reports the type of analysis this guidance describes, industry and FDA are better positioned to recognize and address possible safety issues.\n\nRegulatory Background\n\nIn PMA approval orders, FDA requires that PMA applicants submit post-approval periodic reports (e.g., annual reports at intervals of 1 year (unless otherwise specified) from the date of approval of the original PMA) to FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 814.82(a)(7) and 814.84(b). Section 814.84(b) describes the information required to be included in periodic reports.\n\nUnless FDA specifies otherwise, a periodic report must:\n\nIdentify changes described in 21 CFR 814.39(a) and changes required to be reported to FDA under 21 CFR 814.39(b); and\n\nContain a summary and bibliography of the following information not previously submitted as part of the PMA:1. Unpublished reports of data from any clinical investigations or nonclinical laboratory studies involving the device or related devices and known to or that reasonably should be known to the applicant. ii. Reports in the scientific literature concerning the device and known to or that reasonably should be known to the applicant.\n\nIf, after reviewing the summary and bibliography, FDA concludes that the Agency needs a copy of the unpublished or published reports, FDA will notify the applicant that copies of such reports shall be submitted.\n\nThe PMA applicant is primarily responsible for determining whether changes to the device design, labeling, or manufacturing processes impact safety or effectiveness and, thus, require a PMA Supplement or 30-Day Notice. This guidance is not intended to define when a PMA applicant should submit a new original PMA or any type of PMA Supplement. For that type of guidance, please refer to the FDA guidance, \"Modifications to Devices Subject to\n\nPremarket Approval (PMA) - The PMA Supplement Decision-Making Process.\"1\n\nFootnote 1: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/modifications-devices-subject-premarket-approval-pma-pma-supplement-decision-making-process\n\nPMA applicants are also subject to other reporting requirements. In accordance with 21 CFR 814.84(a), the applicant must comply with Medical Device Reporting (MDR) requirements, 21 CFR Part 803, and any applicable requirements in other regulations or by order approving the device, including Post-Approval Study Reports if FDA has imposed continuing evaluation (post-approval study) requirements on the device in the PMA approval order, 21 CFR 814.82(a)(2).\n\nFDA believes that the types of information described in this guidance and the types of review, summary, and analyses we are recommending should be readily available to applicants because they currently collect this information and conduct these analyses as part of their compliance with the quality system regulations (21 CFR Part 820). For example, design controls already require the type of look back and assessment that we are suggesting be part of the annual report (21 CFR 820.30).\n\nIII. Scope\n\nIn the PMA approval orders, we typically specify that PMA applicants submit a report one (1) year from the date of approval of the original PMA and annually thereafter. Therefore, the periodic report is usually referred to as an \"annual report.\" There may be circumstances, however, where FDA specifies more frequent periodic reports that provide all of the same information that is reported annually. This guidance addresses FDA's expectations concerning annual and other periodic reports. This guidance addresses but does not describe in detail Post-Approval Study reports (see Section VI).\n\nIV Contents of an Annual Report\n\nA complete annual report (in an acceptable eCopy format)2 should include all of the information described below. The eCopy must be accompanied by a single paper copy of your signed cover letter.\n\nFootnote 2: Please refer to the FDA guidance, \u201ceCopy Program for Medical Device Submissions\u201d (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/ecopy-program-medical-device-submissions), for additional information on the eCopy program.\n\nCover Letter for an Annual Report\n\nFDA recommends that the applicant include a cover letter for the PMA annual report. The cover letter should include:\n\nPMA Number\n\nDevice Name (including device family name or model names and numbers)\n\nCompany Name\n\nDate of Report\n\nReporting Period (i.e., the dates the reporting period begins and ends)\n\nIdentification of the Changes Made During the Reporting Period\n\nFor changes that are the subject of an approved or pending PMA Supplement or 30-Day Notice submitted in the reporting year, we recommend that the applicant identify the document number assigned by FDA and status of the document (e.g., approved with approval date, or pending).\n\nCertain changes related to the device documentation or manufacturing process documentation, such as rewording for clarification, translating from one language to another, correcting typographical errors, and moving component characteristics from a notation in an engineering drawing to a different document, such as an Standard Operating Procedure, generally do not need to be reported in the annual report (21 CFR 814.39(b)).

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nAppendix I Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this guidance document is to provide industry and FDA staff with information regarding the premarket approval application (PMA) modular review program and to outline the procedures for submitting or reviewing a modular PMA.\n\nThis guidance supersedes and replaces the documents entitled, \"A Modular Approach to PMA Review,\" dated January 29, 1998, and \"Guidance for the Medical Device Industry on PMA Shell Development and Modular Review,\" issued on November 6, 1998 (hereinafter referred to as the 1998 Guidances).\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nAppendix II Background\n\nIn a traditional PMA, the applicant submits all PMA data, as outlined in 21 CFR 814.20, at the same time, regardless of when testing is completed. FDA begins its review only upon receipt of all the required information In 1998, however, as part of CDRH's reengineering effort, FDA issued the above mentioned guidances. In these documents, FDA described a new policy whereby applicants could submit \"Modular PMAs.\" The goal of FDA's 1998 Guidances was to increase the efficiency of the PMA review process by allowing applicants to submit discrete sections (modules) of the PMA to FDA for review soon after completing the testing and analysis.\n\nFDA intends the modular review approach to provide a mechanism by which applicants may submit preclinical data and manufacturing information for review while still collecting, compiling, and analyzing the clinical data. Therefore, a modular PMA is a compilation of sections or \"modules\" submitted at different times that together become a complete application. Additionally, the modular approach allows the applicant to potentially resolve any deficiencies noted by FDA earlier in the review process than would occur with a traditional PMA application.\n\nOn October 26, 2003, the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUMFA), Pub lic Law 107-250 was enacted. Section 209 of MDUFMA amended the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the act) to codify the modular review approach.1 In recognition that the agency would need to issue updated guidance to reflect the new statutory provision n, FDA requested comments on its modular PMA review program. On February 4, 2003, FDA published a Federal Register notice entitled, \"Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, Establishment of a Public Docket (68 FR 5643)(hereinafter referred to as the MDUFMA Docket). In addition, FDA issued a guidance entitled, \"Assessing User Fees: PMA Supplement Definitions, Modular PMA Fees, BLA and Efficacy Supplement Definitions, Bundling Multiple Devices in a Single Application, and Fees for Combination Products.\"2 In the guidance, FDA asked for comments on the various topics discussed in the document, including modular review of PMAs.\n\nFootnote 1: Section 515(c) of the act, as amended by section 209 of MDUFMA.\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance was issued on February 25, 2003 and can be found at www.fda.gov/cdrh/mdufma/guidance/1201.html (hereinafter referred to as the Assessing User Fees guidance.)\n\nSince 1998, FDA has gained considerable experience with modular PMA submissions. Based on FDA's experience prior to the enactment of MDUFMA and comments submitted to the MDUFMA Docket, FDA is issuing this guidance to replace the 1998 Guidances. These changes include:\n\nclarifying that modular review should be limited to original PMAs (i.e., modular review is not ordinarily appropriate for PMA supplements)\n\nmodifying the procedures for preparing and submitting a modular PMA\n\nexplaining the significance of timing for submission of the modules\n\nrevising the sample shell and specifying the expected content of the modules\n\nsuggesting limitations to the total number of modules that should be submitted.\n\nThe agency expects these changes to: 1) help clarify which PMAs are appropriate for modular review, 2) simplify submission procedures, and 3) improve the efficiency of FDA's review. Additionally, we have added guidance addressing user fee payment procedures for modular PMAs.\n\nThe Least Burdensome Approach\n--------------------\nContext title: Premarket Approval Application Modular Review Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.24974533915519714", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFDA and Industry Actions on\n\nPremarket Approval Applications\n\n(PMAs): Effect on FDA Review\n\nClock and Goals\n\nGuidance for Industry and\n\nFood and Drug Administration Staff\n\nDocument issued on October 3, 2022.\n\nDocument originally issued on October 8, 2003.\n\nThis document supersedes FDA and Industry Actions on Premarket Approval Applications (PMAs): Effect on FDA Review Clock and Goals\n\nissued October 2, 2017.\n\nFor questions about this document regarding CDRH-regulated devices, contact the Office of Regulatory Programs/Division of Submission Support/PMA, HDE, Q-Submission, and Device Tracking Lifecycle Team at 301-796-5640, or by email at\n\n(\\underline{\\text{\\small{OPEQSubmissionSupport}}})_a_fda.hhs.gov.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 20221 (MDUFA V), amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) to authorize FDA to collect user fees for the review of certain premarket submissions received on or after October 1, 2022, including premarket approval applications (PMAs). The additional funds obtained from user fees will enable FDA, with the cooperation of industry, to improve the device review process to meet certain performance goals and implement improvements for the medical device review process.\n\nFootnote 1: See Title II of the FDA User Fee Reauthorization Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-180).\n\nPerformance goals were negotiated and agreed to under MDUFA V for PMAs received in FY 2023-2027. These performance goals and process improvements are outlined in the letter from the Secretary of Health and Human Services to Congress2 (MDUFA V Commitment Letter) and are further described below.\n\nFootnote 2: See 168 CONG. REC. S5194-S5203 (daily ed. September 28, 2022) (Food and Drug Administration User Fee Reauthorization). The MDUFA V Commitment Letter is also available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/media/158308/download.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII. Scope\n\nThis guidance document describes:\n\nthe different FDA actions that may be taken on premarket approval applications (PMAs);\n\n2027); and\n\nthe different industry actions that may be taken on PMAs.\n\nIII. FDA Actions\n\nThe PMA regulation outlines the various actions FDA may take on an original PMA or PMA supplement during the course of our review.3 For original PMAs, panel-track supplements, and 180-day supplements,4 the following responses are considered FDA actions:\n\nFootnote 3: See 21 CFR Part 814, Subpart C.\n\nFootnote 4: For more detailed information, see FDA\u2019s guidance document, \u201cUser Fees and Refunds for Premarket Approval Applications and Device Biologics Licences Applications,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/user-fees-and-refunds-premarket-approval-applications-and-device-biologics-license-applications or the guidance document entitled, \u201cModifications to Devices Subject to Premarket Approval (PMA) - The PMA Supplement Decision-Making Process,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/modifications-devices-subject-premarket-approval-pma-pma-supplement-decision-making-process.\n\napproval order;\n\napprovable letter;\n\nmajor deficiency letter;\n\nnot approvable letter; and\n\ndenial order.\n\nFor real-time supplements, all of the above responses apply with the exception of a major deficiency letter.\n\nFurthermore, of these FDA actions, all but a major deficiency letter are a \"MDUFA decision\" under FDA's commitment letters and are measured against a MDUFA IV/V goal. These FDA actions are described below.\n\nAppendix A Approval Order\n\nFDA will issue an approval order (letter) informing the applicant that the PMA is approved and that the applicant may begin commercial distribution of the device in accordance with any prescribed conditions of approval after we have completed our review and:\n\nnone of the reasons listed in 21 CFR 814.45 for denying approval applies;\n\nthere is reasonable assurance the device is safe and effective (using the criteria provided in 21 CFR 860.7) for its intended use as prescribed in the product labeling; and\n\nthe device manufacturing facilities, methods, and controls were found to be in compliance with the Quality System regulation (21 CFR Part 820).\n\nAn approval order shuts off the review clock, marks the end of FDA review, and is considered a final action.\n\nAppendix B Approvable Letter\n\nFDA will issue an approvable letter informing the applicant that we have completed our review of the application and determined that there needs to be:\n\nresolution of minor deficiencies,5 which are identified in the approvable letter (21CFR 814.44(e)); and/or Footnote 5: Minor deficiencies may include, for example, clarifications of previously submitted information, revisions to the labeling, and revisions/development of a post approval study protocol.\n\ncompletion of an FDA inspection that finds the manufacturing facilities, methods, and controls in compliance with the Quality System (QS) regulation, 21 CFR Part 820, and, if applicable, verifies records pertinent to the PMA as per 21 CFR 814.44(e)(1)(iii). When this is the case, the approvable letter states that the device is \"approvable pending GMP inspection.\"\n\nWhen FDA issues an approvable letter pending resolution of minor deficiencies, we stop the review clock and place the application on hold. When FDA receives a complete response to an approvable letter, we will resume the clock with a new FDA response timeframe to reach a final decision. FDA will issue a decision within 60 calendar days of the sponsor's response to the approvable letter, as resources permit, but not to the detriment of meeting the quantitative review timelines and statutory obligations.\n\nWhen FDA issues an approvable pending GMP inspection letter, we stop the review clock. Once FDA determines that the device manufacturing facilities, methods, and controls arefound to be in compliance with the Quality System regulation, 21 CFR part 820, we will issue an approval order.\n\nAppendix C Major Deficiency Letter\n\nFDA will issue a major deficiency letter6 informing the applicant that the PMA lacks significant information necessary for FDA to complete our review and requests the applicant to amend the application to provide the necessary information regarding the device (21 CFR 814.37(b)), such as:\n\nFootnote 6: For additional information about deficiencies, see FDA\u2019s guidance document, \u201cDeveloping and Responding to Deficiencies in Accordance with the Least Burdensome Provisions,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/developing-and-responding-deficiencies-accordance-least-burdensome-provisions.\n\na detailed re-analysis of previously submitted data (e.g., alternative statistical method);\n\nadditional test data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the device (e.g., electromagnetic compatibility, electrical safety, biocompatibility, reliability, software, labeling, animal testing, sensitivity and specificity in a certain population);\n\nscientific rationale for test data critical to determining reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device provided in the submission; or\n\nnew validation data and analyses (e.g., due to device modifications made during the course of the PMA review).\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA and Industry Actions on Premarket Approval Applications (PMAs)- Effect on FDA Review Clock and Goals Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.4345399737358093", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: In requesting additional information with respect to a premarket approval application (PMA), \"the Secretary shall consider the least burdensome appropriate means necessary to demonstrate a reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness.\"6 Footnote 5: Section 515(c)(5)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\n\"[T]he Secretary shall consider the role of postmarket information in determining the least burdensome means of demonstrating a reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness.\"7 Footnote 7: Section 515(c)(5)(C) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe term \"necessary\" in the least burdensome provisions means the \"minimum required information\" that would support a determination of substantial equivalence or a reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness.8 Footnote 8: Sections 513(a)(3)(D)(iii), 513(i)(1)(D)(ii), and 515(c)(5)(B) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe least burdensome provisions do not change the standards for premarket approval or substantial equivalence.9 Footnote 9: Sections 513(a)(3)(D)(iv), 513(i)(1)(D)(iii), and 515(c)(5)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFDA issued least burdensome guidance documents after the enactment of FDAMA. \"Suggested Format for Developing and Responding to Deficiencies in Accordance with the Least Burdensome Provisions of FDAMA\" (\"Deficiencies Guidance\") was issued on November 2, 2000. In that guidance document, FDA recommended that its staff use a specific format for requests for additional information needed to make a decision on a medical device marketing submission (often called \"deficiencies\" or \"deficiency letters\") to be in accordance with least burdensome principles. This format was intended to directly connect FDA requests to applicable statutory and regulatory criteria for a decision and optimize the time and effort of both industry and FDA. That guidance document also included a recommended format for industry responses to FDA deficiencies.\n\nWith the enactment of the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017 (Public Law 115-52, SSSS 201-210) (MDUFA IV), FDA committed to updating the Deficiencies Guidance. Developing and Responding to Deficiencies in Accordance with the Least Burdensome Provisions was issued on September 29, 2017.10 The Deficiencies Guidance was updated to recommend that all deficiency letters include a statement regarding the basis for each deficiency and provides details regarding supervisory review, major/minor deficiencies, additional considerations, and prioritization of deficiencies.\n\nFootnote 10: https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM073680.\n\n\"The Least Burdensome Provisions of the FDA Modernization Act of 1997: Concept and Principles\" was issued on October 4, 2002 (\"2002 Least Burdensome Guidance\"). The guidance stated that, while the least burdensome provisions from FDAMA applied to PMA and 510(k) submissions, FDA believed that least burdensome principles should be implemented for all medical device premarket regulatory activities. The document also defined the term \"least burdensome\" and included suggested approaches for industry and FDA staff to use least burdensome principles in PMA and 510(k) review, including focusing on the statutory and regulatory criteria for marketing authorization. The guidance also described general applications of least burdensome approaches to activities such as postmarket controls, and recommendations for how the Agency should communicate requests for additional information to industry.\n\nThis guidance document replaces the 2002 Least Burdensome Guidance. The statutory updates in FDASIA and the Cures Act clarified the original least burdensome provisions and further recognized the role of postmarket activities as they relate to premarket decisions. FDA believes,as a matter of policy, that least burdensome principles should be consistently and widely applied to all medical device regulatory activities in the premarket and postmarket settings to remove or reduce unnecessary burdens so that patients can have earlier and continued access to high quality, safe and effective devices. The Agency is applying tools in our implementation of these principles, such as regular internal training on least burdensome principles.\n\nThis guidance, therefore, reflects FDA's belief that least burdensome principles should be applied throughout the medical device total product lifecycle. The least burdensome concept remains the same in that the principles are based on sound science, the intent of the law, the use of alternative approaches, and the efficient use of resources to effectively address regulatory issues. We have provided contemporary examples for both premarket and postmarket settings to demonstrate approaches that FDA and industry can take to ensure that least burdensome principles are implemented for all device-related applications and interactions with FDA.\n\nIII. Scope\n\nThe least burdensome concept and this guidance apply to all products that meet the statutory definition of a device,11 including device constituent parts of combination products. The policy in this guidance applies to all activities (including premarket and postmarket actions) pertaining to the regulation of medical devices. The policy in this guidance applies, but is not limited, to:\n\nFootnote 11: Section 201(h) of the FD&C Act.\n\nPremarket submissions, including premarket approval applications (PMAs), premarket notifications (510(k) submissions), De Novo classification requests, humanitarian device exemption (HDE) applications, and investigational device exemption (IDE) applications\n\nClinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Waiver by Applications\n\nAdditional Information and Major Deficiency Letters\n\nQ-Submissions, including Pre-Submissions\n\nInformal or interactive inquiries regarding device development\n\nPanel review and recommendations\n\nPostmarket surveillance, including Medical Device Reports (MDRs) and Post-Approval Studies\n\nReclassifications and 510(k) exemptions\n\nGuidance documents and their application\n\nCompliance-related interactions* Regulation development\n\nIV Guiding Principles\n\nFDA defines least burdensome to be the minimum amount of information necessary to adequately address a relevant regulatory question or issue through the most efficient manner at the right time (e.g., need to know versus nice to know). Our least burdensome definition and principles do not change the applicable statutory and regulatory standards, such as the device approval or clearance standards, nor the applicable requirements, including premarket submission content requirements and the requirement for valid scientific evidence.12\n\nFootnote 12: Sections 513(i) and 515 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR Part 807 Subpart E, Parts 812 and 814, and 860.7(c).\n\nNotwithstanding references to what industry should do, our guiding principles explain FDA's commitments for least burdensome device review. FDA intends to, and industry should, apply the following guiding principles when taking a least burdensome approach to a particular question or issue at any point in the total product lifecycle:\n\nFDA intends to request the minimum information necessary to adequately address the regulatory question or issue at hand.\n\nIndustry should submit material, including premarket submissions, to FDA that are least burdensome for FDA to review. * Industry should submit well-organized, clear, and concise information. * Industry should not submit information unrelated to the regulatory decision to FDA. * Industry should reference applicable FDA guidance documents where FDA recommendations were considered.\n\nFDA intends to use the most efficient means to resolve regulatory questions and issues. * FDA intends to use all reasonable measures to streamline processes and policies, as well as render regulatory decisions within appropriate timeframes, such as MDUFA performance goals. * FDA intends to routinely use both formal and informal interactive approaches, whenever possible, to resolve questions and issues. * FDA intends to, and industry should, use reasonable, tailored approaches that have been adapted to individual circumstances and needs to address regulatory questions and issues. * FDA intends to take appropriate consideration of the time and resource implications of its requests.\n\nThe right information should be provided at the right time (e.g., just-in-time data collection) to address the right questions. * FDA intends to, and industry should, consider the use of postmarket data collection to reduce premarket data collection whenever appropriate and feasible.\n\nRegulatory approaches should be designed to fit the technology, taking into account its unique innovation cycles, evidence generation needs, and timely patient access.\n\nFDA intends to leverage data from other countries and decisions by, or on behalf of, other national medical device regulatory authorities to the extent appropriate and feasible.\n\nFDA intends to apply least burdensome principles in international medical device convergence and harmonization efforts. * FDA intends to actively engage in the development, recognition, and use of voluntary consensus standards published by international and other standards development organizations.\n\nProviding excellent customer service is critical to successfully applying least burdensome principles. FDA strives for clear and concise communication of its requests, expectations, processes, policies, and decisions, as well as the rationale behind them. Industry can help us apply least burdensome principles by providing FDA with clear and concise requests, premarket submissions, and responses, along with their rationales. Excellent customer service and open lines of communication between FDA and its customers will help to provide regulatory outcomes that best serve patients.\n\nV Applications of Least Burdensome Principles\n--------------------\nContext title: The Least Burdensome Provisions- Concept and Principles Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.48346734046936035", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a premarket approval (PMA) application?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Modifications to Devices Subject to Premarket Approval (PMA) - The PMA Supplement Decision-Making Process\n\nDocument Issued on: December 11, 2008\n\nFor questions regarding the use or interpretation of this guidance in the review of PMAs and PDPs, please contact the Nicole L.

You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance document. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance document.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance document has been developed to provide the underlying principles and examples to establish a clear and consistent way to approach the decision-making process you follow to determine the type of regulatory submission, if any, that may be required when you modify your lawfully marketed PMA device.\n\nThis guidance applies to class III devices that are subject to premarket approval application (PMA) requirements of section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) (21 U.S.C. 360e). This guidance provides the criteria for industry and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) staff to use in determining the type of PMA submission (i.e., traditional PMAs, panel track supplements, 180-day supplements, real-time supplements, Special PMA Supplements-Changes Being Effected, 30-day notices, manufacturing site change supplements, or periodic reports) that you should submit to FDA when you modify the design or labeling of your PMA device; its manufacturing process; or the location of manufacturing, processing, or packaging. The guidance also provides examples of various types of device modifications, describes the types of testing that were performed to support the safety and effectiveness for each device modification, and the type of PMA submission that was submitted. It does not address how to test a specific device to determine the effects of modifications.\n\nThis guidance applies to PMAs reviewed by CDRH and CBER. This guidance also applies if you modify your PMA device in response to a recall or field corrective action to assure the continued safety and/or effectiveness of the device.\n\nThis guidance is not intended to replace existing, device-specific guidance or other guidance documents related to the PMA program.1\n\n2.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance document, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nThe Least Burdensome Approach\n\nWe believe we should consider the least burdensome approach in all areas of medical device regulation. This guidance reflects our careful review of the relevant scientific and legal requirements and what we believe is the least burdensome way for you to comply with those requirements. However, if you believe that an alternative approach would be less burdensome, please contact us so we can consider your point of view. You may send your written comments to the contact person listed in the preface to this guidance or to the CDRH Ombudsman. Comprehensive information on CDRH's Ombudsman, including contact information, can be found on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ombudsman/.\n\n3 Background\n\nThe \"PMA regulation\" (21 CFR Part 814) sets forth general criteria for determining when you must submit a PMA supplement or a 30-day notice for a device modification or manufacturing change (21 CFR 814.39). Subpart B \"Premarket Approval Application\" of the PMA regulation in Part 814 describes PMA amendments and supplements. Subpart E -\"Post Approval Requirements\" describes requirements for continuing evaluation (post-approval studies), periodic reporting, and other requirements related to the continued reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of an approved PMA device. The Act defines different types of PMA supplements that are used to request approval of a change to a device that has an approved PMA (see section 737(4) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 379i(4)) for definitions of 180-day supplements, real-time supplements, panel-track supplements). These definitions form the basis for the recommendations provided in this guidance document.\n\nThe draft version of this guidance document, which was issued on March 9, 2007, was the result of an extensive effort by a working group consisting of regulatory and scientific experts from CDRH and CBER. That March 2007 draft guidance replaced the August 6, 1998 draft guidance entitled, Modifications To Devices Subject to Premarket Approval - The PMA Supplement Decision Making Process[2] Comments by the industry on the August 1998 draft and comments we received at subsequent meetings on this issue were considered by FDA during the development of the March 2007 draft guidance document.\n\nIn response to the comment period for the March 2007 draft guidance, FDA received the following five general categories of comments from industry. Each category of comment, below, is followed by FDA's response.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIndustry requested clearer interpretation of the PMA regulation as to when a supplement is necessary (i.e., when a change to a device impacts or could impact safety and/or effectiveness). Our response to this is included in Sections III and IV below.\n\nIndustry requested a detailed flowchart that would identify the type of supplement to be submitted based on any specific change for any device. FDA understands that there is a general desire among PMA applicants for such a detailed flowchart or easy-to-use paradigm. However, FDA believes the complexity and variability of class III devices makes it unfeasible to develop such a flowchart.\n\nIndustry requested specific definitions for some terms, such as \"substantial clinical data,\" \"significant change,\" and \"limited confirmatory clinical data.\" Where possible, FDA provided additional clarity for some terminology. Again, because of the complexity and variability of class III devices, we do not believe it is feasible to provide detailed definitions for certain terms and instead use examples to help illustrate the meaning of these terms.\n\nIndustry requested that the guidance address 30-day supplements (21 CFR 814.39(e)). However, FDA has chosen not to include 30-day supplements within the scope of the guidance document, in part, because we have not identified cases for which this provision can be effectively applied.\n\nIndustry requested the addition of examples to illustrate the various supplement types as well as periodic reports. While industry provided a number of examples, many such examples did not contain sufficient details for inclusion in this guidance document. However, examples that provided further clarification on the underlying principles were added. In addition, the periodic report section was significantly increased in detail and includes examples.\n\nIII General Requirements for When a PMA Supplement is Needed\n\nExamples of the types of modifications that require a PMA supplement (21 CFR 814.39(a)), if such changes affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n--------------------\nContext title: Modifications to Devices Subject to Premarket Approval (PMA) - The PMA Supplement Decision-Making Process Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.7911882996559143"], "Guideline title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations  Does FDA have guidelines for animal bedding?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations  Does FDA have guidelines for animal bedding?\n--------------------\nContext: The investigational drug also should be as close as practicable to the to-be-marketed drug; any differences should be discussed with the review division before studies are initiated.\n\nAppendix C Types of Animal Care Interventions\n\nAs used in this guidance, animal care interventions in animal studies are divided into three categories based on the rationale for their use: (1) intervention as part of adequate veterinary care, (2) intervention as supportive care to mimic the human clinical scenario, and (3) intervention to permit the manifestation of the disease or condition of interest for the purpose of model development. These categories of interventions are discussed individually in Appendix B. The potential effects of the interventions on the animal (e.g., toxicity, effects on the immune system) and on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of the investigational drug should be considered in the design and interpretation of each study. In addition, protocols for the adequate and well-controlled efficacy studies should include plans for addressing the impact of potential differences in care among animals.\n\nAppendix D The Study Report\n\nFDA expects that complete, final study reports will be submitted for the Animal Rule-specific studies. Complete study reports should include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nThe prospectively designed protocol (including the statistical analysis plan), all protocol amendments, and a description of all protocol deviations\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nDetailed descriptions of the elements of the study design, including the characterization of the animals used in the study,52 information on the formulations and administration of the investigational drug and controls; and information on the characterization, preparation, and delivery of the challenge agent\n\nFootnote 52: The individual animal information should include, when appropriate, species; strains and substrains (when applicable); breed (when applicable); age; sex; body weight; vendor source; origin of the animal (to the extent known); procedures for identification and individual animal identification; physiological status (e.g., adult, juvenile, lactating, and pregnant); data collected during routine husbandy pre- and post-protocol assignment, including pre-study health screen, health records, and medications or therapies administered; and an adequate description of housing and husbandry conditions. For individual animal tracking purposes, a table that cross-references the unique animal identification number for the study, treatment allocation, fate or disposition, and chain of custody should be submitted. For each animal assigned more than one identification number during life, the table also should include reference to all other identification numbers (e.g., a unique animal number assigned by the source).\n* A comprehensive description of study procedures\n* The results53 of each parameter or variable evaluated at each time point in the study and any unscheduled medical intervention\n* The final audited54 study report that includes analyses and interpretation of the study data and explanation of any deviations from the agreed-upon plan for data quality and integrity\n\nFootnote 54: These results should include group summary tabulations, line listings of the results for each individual animal, copies of the individual animal case report forms (all veterinary medical records), and any other primary data necessary for the reconstruction of key analyses and evaluation of the study report.\n\nPreliminary plans for collection, organization, format, and level of detail of study data should be discussed with the review division before conducting these studies. Sponsors are encouraged to submit prototype versions of the study datasets prior to finalization of datasets.\n\nAppendix E Submission of the Study Report and Data\n\nThe submission of study data in a standardized electronic format supports data analysis and review and has therefore been encouraged by FDA. Section 1136 of FDASIA55 requires that nonclinical and clinical study data be submitted electronically to FDA in a format specified by guidance. FDA's guidance for industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format -- Standardized Study Data56 specifies that electronic submissions must be in a format that FDA can process, review, and archive and describes the requirements, including the types ofsubmissions to which these requirements apply57 and timetables for the implementation. For studies initiated prior to the requirement date specified in the timetables, sponsors are strongly encouraged to submit study data in a standardized electronic format. Sponsors should consider the implementation of data standards and seek FDA feedback as early as possible during animal model and drug development, so that the data standards are included in the design, conduct, and analysis of studies.58\n\nFootnote 57: An IND for a drug or biological product intended to progress to an NDA or BLA, respectively, is considered to be a commercial IND and, therefore, is subject to these requirements.\n\nFootnote 58: Information is available through FDA\u2019s Web page, Study Data Standards Resources, available at http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StudyDataStandards/default.htm.\n\nThe Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) is the standard format for regulatory submissions to CBER and CDER.59 The eCTD does not provide a specific location for the natural history or model characterization studies conducted in animals and for the adequate and well-controlled animal efficacy studies. For consistency, it is recommended that these studies be submitted to Module 4 (Nonclinical Study Reports), section 4.2.1.1 (Primary Pharmacodynamics). This recommendation does not determine the disciplines of the primary reviewers for the studies; that decision is the purview of the FDA review division.\n\nFootnote 59: See FDA\u2019s guidance for industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format \u2013 Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specifications (Revision 3).\n\nV Essential elements of an animal model\n\nThe selection of an animal model for an efficacy study should be based on its adequacy as a model of key elements of the human disease or condition and its suitability with regard to the investigational drug. Section V.1 describes the elements related to the disease or condition induced by the etiologic or challenge agent.60 It is the sponsor's responsibility to provide, to the fullest extent possible, a documented summary of the etiologic agent-induced human disease or condition and a detailed discussion that delineates how these data support selection of the proposed animal model. Evidence supporting the relevance of an animal model to a human disease or condition can be obtained from various sources61 that provide adequate documentation of study quality.62 For example, data from literature or historical studies may support the use of an animal model when the reports include a level of detail that is sufficient to assess the appropriateness of the animal model. The source, organization, format, and level of detail of the available study data should be discussed with the review division before submitting the data.\n\nFootnote 60: As used in this guidance, the term etiologic agent refers to the substance causing the disease or condition in humans. The term challenge agent refers to the substance used to cause the disease or condition in the animal studies.\n\nFootnote 61: Comparable to the sources of clinical data described in 21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(iv).\n\nFootnote 62: Comparable to the discussion of the documentation of the quality of evidence described in FDA\u2019s guidance for industry Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products.\nSection V.B describes elements related to the investigational drug and the selection of an effective dose in humans. The sponsor should provide justification of the suitability of each model based on the investigational drug's mechanism of action, dosage form, and route of administration, and the method proposed to extrapolate from the animal data to select a dose and regimen in humans. Issues related to animal model development for one or more investigational drugs that are to be developed for use in combination or concurrently are beyond the scope of this guidance and should be discussed with the review division.\n\nThe following essential elements should be considered in the development and/or the selection of an animal model.63 Any element not achievable for an etiologic or challenge agent or drug under investigation should be discussed with FDA.\n\nFootnote 63: See section IX for the associated Checklist of Essential Elements of an Animal Model.\n\nA. Elements Related to the Etiologic or Challenge Agent-Induced Disease or Condition\n\n1. Characteristics of the Etiologic or Challenge Agent That Influence the Disease or Condition\n\nThe characteristics of the specific etiologic or challenge agent that influence the disease or condition under study include its pathophysiological mechanisms of toxicity or virulence, the route of exposure, and the dose and quantification of exposure. These characteristics are discussed below.\n\na. The Challenge Agent\n--------------------\nContext title: Product Development Under the Animal Rule \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.0636050701141357", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations  Does FDA have guidelines for animal bedding?\n--------------------\nContext: IV Animal Studies - General Expectations\n\nThe general expectations discussed in this section apply to the Animal Rule-specific studies, i.e., the natural history studies that define the animal model in which efficacy will be tested, the adequate and well-controlled animal efficacy studies intended to provide the primary evidence of effectiveness to support approval,44 and the PK and/or pharmacodynamic (PD) studies in animals used to select a dose and regimen in humans. Specific recommendations for natural history studies are discussed in Appendix C. Specific recommendations on design considerations for the adequate and well-controlled efficacy studies in animals are discussed in section VI and section X, with additional information for preventive vaccines and cellular and gene therapies in section VII. Specific recommendations for the PK and/or PD studies used to select a dose and regimen for humans are discussed in section V.B.2.\n\nFootnote 44: See 21 CFR 314.610(a) for drugs and 21 CFR 601.91(a) for biological products.\n\nAnimals Used in Investigations\n\nFor the Animal Rule-specific studies, the animals should be research naive. Any prior research experience, even as a control animal, has the potential to cause stress and alter an animal's physiological responses. The number of animals should be determined to ensure scientifically valid results. Well-designed experiments use a sufficient number of animals to achieve the scientific objective, include the necessary control groups, and incorporate appropriate statistical analyses. FDA expects adequate representation of both sexes in these studies. The male/female composition of the study groups should be justified.\n\nAppropriately designed protocols generally control for age, body weight, current health status, and the physical environment of the test animals. When defining the animal characteristics for the development of animal models and the subsequent efficacy studies using those models, sponsors should discuss with FDA the applicability of the animal models and the results obtained from the efficacy studies to the diverse human population.\n\nAppropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria for the acceptance of the animals into the study should be prespecified and discussed with FDA before initiating the studies. The information that should be provided for the characterization of individual animals used in the investigation is described in section IV.D.\n\nStudy Conduct\n\nThe adequate and well-controlled animal efficacy studies and the PK and/or PD studies in animals used to select a dose and regimen in humans should be conducted in a manner that ensures data quality and integrity, as would be expected for the studies in humans submitted to establish effectiveness and any other studies needed to support the labeling of a drug approved under a traditional regulatory pathway. There are no regulations that specifically address data quality and integrity issues for Animal Rule-specific studies.45 The GLP regulations46 were developed as a quality system for nonclinical safety studies. Nonetheless, these regulations provide a framework (e.g., definitions, procedures, roles and responsibilities, and controls) for the conduct of nonclinical studies, and FDA considers them to be a well-established and relevant system for ensuring data quality and integrity for the adequate and well-controlled animal efficacy studies and the PK and/or PD studies in animals used to select a dose and regimen in humans. FDA, therefore, recommends the use of the GLP regulations, to the extent practicable, to ensure the quality and integrity of data from these studies.47\n\nFootnote 45: In issuing the Animal Rule, FDA stated that \u201c... studies subject to this rule must be conducted in accordance with preexisting requirements under the good laboratory practices (21 CFR part 58) regulations...\u201d (67 FR 37988 at 37989, May 31, 2002). The good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations, however, were developed as a quality system for nonclinical safety studies. This section describes FDA\u2019s current expectations.\n\nFootnote 46: See 21 CFR part 58.\n\nThere may be justifiable limitations in the ability to apply the GLP regulations when conducting these studies, especially for those using challenge agents that require high containment facilities. Before initiating these studies, sponsors should identify aspects of the studies anticipated to be a challenge with regard to the GLP regulations and propose methods for adapting the studies to ensure the quality and integrity of the resulting data. Sponsors should seek concurrence from FDA on the data quality and integrity plan before the studies are initiated.\n\nThe adequate and well-controlled animal efficacy studies and the PK and/or PD studies in animals used to select a dose and regimen in humans serve as the basis for a regulatory action (e.g., approval) under the Animal Rule. Thus, FDA has the authority to inspect these studies prior to taking an action. Inspections will be conducted to verify the quality and integrity of the raw data, supporting documentation, facilities, equipment, and the results submitted to FDA in the final report. Quality includes, but is not limited to, whether the study was conducted in accordance with the protocol, standard operating procedures, and applicable standards of research. Integrity includes, but is not limited to, the assurance that the raw data and documentation are consistent with reported results. FDA will verify that study personnel followed the agreed-upon data quality and integrity plan. Inspectional observations will be shared with the inspected entity and evaluated by the review division to determine the impact of the observations on the acceptability of the data to support drug approval.\n\nAnimals must comply with applicable laws and regulations as prescribed by the Animal Welfare Act48 and the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.49 All studies should comply with general principles for the care and use of animals in biomedical research (see Appendix A). Sponsors should ensure that adequate safety and security provisions are in place for all studies when needed. For example, for select agents and toxins, sponsors must adhere to the regulations found under 42 CFR part 73, and when applicable, sponsors should comply with standards on the use of biosafety level (BSL) laboratory facilities.50\n\nFootnote 48: See 7 U.S.C. 2131 et seq.\n\nFootnote 49: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, \u201cPublic Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals,\u201d Revised 2015, available at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/PHSPolicyLabAnimals.pdf, accessed on October 16, 2015.\n\nFootnote 50: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Institutes of Health, 2010, Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, 5({}^{\\mathrm{th}}) Edition, Atlanta, GA: CDC.\n\nThe investigational drug also should be as close as practicable to the to-be-marketed drug; any differences should be discussed with the review division before studies are initiated.\n\nAppendix C Types of Animal Care Interventions\n\nAs used in this guidance, animal care interventions in animal studies are divided into three categories based on the rationale for their use: (1) intervention as part of adequate veterinary care, (2) intervention as supportive care to mimic the human clinical scenario, and (3) intervention to permit the manifestation of the disease or condition of interest for the purpose of model development.

Format for Carcinogenicity Study DataGUIDELINE FOR THE FORMMT AND CONTENT\n\nOF THE\n\nNRCLINICAL PHARMOLOGY/TOXICOLOGY SECTION\n\nOF AN APPLICATION\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis guideline describes an acceptable format for organizing and\n\npresenting the pharmacology and toxicology data required under 21 CFR\n\n314.50(d)(2), and any related data, in the nonclinical section of the\n\napplication. These recommendations pertain only to organization of\n\nexisting data. This guideline is not intended to affect documentation\n\nrequired by the Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) reporting regulations\n\nunder 21 CFR 58.185, nor does it describe the specific study requirements\n\nfor particular therapeutic uses or regimens: these are addressed in other\n\nguidelines.\n\nThis guideline is issued under 21 CFR 10.90. An applicant may, but is\n\nnot required to, rely upon the guideline in preparing the Nonclinical\n\nPharmacology/Toxicology section of an application. When a different\n\napproach is chosen, the applicant is encouraged to discuss the matter in\n\nadvance with FDA to prevent the expenditure of money and effort on\n\npreparing a submission that may be determined to be unacceptable.\n\nThe agency recognizes that most or all of the nonclinical data submitted to an application will have been developed over several years and submitted intermittently to an investigational drug application (IND). We recommend the reorganization of the studies to the extent feasible, for submission to an application, even though the formats of all individual studies cannot always easily be made to conform in all details to these guideline recommendations. We anticipate that this guideline will also shape future IND submissions so that relatively little revision will be needed for the application other than to rearrange study order.\n\nI. GENERAL PRINCIPLES\n\nThe following are general principles that apply to the submission of all pharmacology and toxicology studies regardless of the characteristics of a particular study.\n\nA. Editorial Considerations\n\nThe entire submission should receive careful editorial, as well as scientific, review. It should be proof-read to assure that all pages are in consecutive order and are distinctly copied and otherwise readable.\n\nB. Abbreviations\n\nStandard abbreviations acceptable to a refereed U.S.\n\npharmacology/toxicology journal, such as Toxicology and AppliedPharmacology, should be used wherever possible. All other abbreviations should be identified at the beginning of each section in which they are used or in footnotes to tables and graphs.\n\nC. Availability of Data\n\nFormat recommendations in this guideline address typical circumstances of data review. However, it is not possible to anticipate all further analyses that may require display of certain data in a different format.\n\nData should therefore be kept available by the sponsor, properly edited and quality controlled, so that the reviewer may be rapidly supplied with requested data in the form needed. This data base should document all relevant observations for each animal (e.g., toxic signs, clinical pathology, tumor palpation, sacrifice or death, necropsy results, etc., and the dates of these events). Errors detected after submission should be brought to the attention of the FDA reviewer and tabulated separately.\n\nD. Tables and Graphs\n\nWell-constructed tables are fundamental to the reporting and evaluation of pharmacological and toxicological data. All tables should be clearly identified and captioned in English, with symbols keyed to a footnote or conveniently\naccessible reference page.\n\nWhere possible, summary tables should permit comparison of\n\nselected results from all dosage groups and relevant\n\ncontrols on the same page. Separate tables may be used for\n\nmales and females if direct comparison between the two\n\nsexes is not crucial.\n\nFor each multidose study, comprehensive data tables should\n\npresent the data in order of increasing dosage within each\n\nsex, males preceding females (See I.F. and I.H.).\n\nGraphs should supplement, not replace, data tables. They\n\nshould be of a quality acceptable to a refereed U.S.\n\nscientific journal.\n\nE. Drug Identification\n\nWhen compared in tables or discussions with numbered\n\ncongeners or metabolites, the drug's code number should be\n\nhighlighted by underlining or other prominent marker.\n\nMetabolites or reference compounds referred to by code\n\nnumber should be identified by chemical name or structure\n\nin a conveniently accessible, nearby location.\n\nBatch or lot numbers should be included where appropriate\n\nor needed for comparative review.\n\nF. Animals\n\nWhere more than one animal species is used in a particular\n\ntype of test or study, these data should be reported or\n\ntabulated in the following relative order, males preceding\n\nfemales:\n\nMouse\n\nRat\n\nHanner\n\nOther rodent(s)\n\nRabbit\n\nDog\n\nMonkey\n\nOther non-rodent mammal(s)\n\nNon-mammals\n\nData for typical adult animals should precede that for\n\ninfant, geriatric, or disease-model animals if comparative\n\nstudies are done in one or more of the latter groups. Age\n\nand weight ranges should be indicated.\n\nStrains and animal suppliers should be specified for each\n\nstudy.\n\nG. Route and Mode of Administration\n\nStudies for each species within each type of study should\n\nfirst represent the intended route of human use, followed\n\nby data for other routes in the following relative order:\n\nOral\n\nIntravenous\n\nIntramuscular\n\nInterperitoneal\n\nSubcutaneous\n\nInhalation\n\nTopical\n\nOther in vivo\n\nIn vitro\n\nH. Doses\n\nMultidose data should be displayed from the lowest to the\n\nhighest dose.\n\nWithin each multigroup study, results should similarly be\n\npresented in all tables in order of increasing dosage:\n\nUntreated control\n\nVehicle control\n\nLow dose\n\nMiddle dose(s)\n\nHigh dose\n\nPositive or comparative control(s)\n\nDose should preferably be based on the active moiety\n\ncomponent if the drug is a salt or other dissociable\n\nderivative. In any case, it should be clearly stated that\n\nwhether the calculation of dose is based on the active moiety component or on the entire drug substance, and the calculation should be consistent for all studies.\n\nDrug doses should be expressed on a body weight basis (e.g., mg/kg, mg/kg), except when there is a specific reason to express doses in some other way, e.g., on a body surface basis (mg/m2) or as plasma or serum concentration.\n\nWhen the drug is administered in diet or drinking water, the daily dose, calculated periodically from actual body weight and food or water consumption data, should be included in the report as the dose range per sex for each group at the beginning and end of the study and at intervals throughout a chronic study. Designated or average group doses may be used in tables for brevity. Doses should not be expressed solely as concentration in food or drinking water.\n\nI. Determinations\n\nAll biological tests, laboratory determinations and statistical methods should be described in the study report or properly referenced to a methods appendix or literature citation.\n\nUnits for each determination should be specified in the results. Where appropriate, the variability or group mean values should be shown by approximately labeled standard errors, standard derivations or confidence limits.\n\nStudies with a radioactive drug should indicate the molecular location of the radioisotope and its specific activity.\n\nJ. Study Reports\n\nReports of studies related to safety should contain GLP statements required by 314.50(d)(2)(v) and 21 CFR Part 58.\n\nNew studies or final reports not previously submitted to an IND or a previous marketing application submission should be so identified.\n\nWhen appropriate, study reports should include description of pre-study conditioning, the method of assignment of animals to control and test groups, the basis for dose selection, pertinent information about animal husbandry, and pathologic diagnosis procedures (e.g., group review, blinding, etc.).\n\nK. Published Literature\n\nPertinent published methods or data should be appended to\n\nthe appropriate study report sections or subsections.\n\nReferences to published reports otherwise submitted to the\n\napplication should be so identified.\n\nWhen published literature is used to replace or augment\n--------------------\nContext title: Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.409029006958008", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations  Does FDA have guidelines for animal bedding?\n--------------------\nContext: Appendix A Information to include in an expanded access submission\n\nFDA regulations at 21 CFR 312.305(b)(1) states that an expanded access submission is required for each category of expanded access, and that submission may be a new IND or a protocol amendment to an existing IND. The items listed below must be included in the expanded access submission for a PET drug, and its mailing cover must be plainly marked \"EXPANDED ACCESS SUBMISSION\" (SS 312.305(b)). Expanded access submission for PET drugs should be mailed to the IND mailing address previously identified in section V.B. FDA's review is greatly facilitated by sponsors providing a title and number for reference purposes. The submission must contain:\n\nA cover sheet (completed Form FDA 1571).\n\nThe following information, which typically may be contained in a protocol:\n\nThe rationale for the intended use of the drug, including a list of available diagnostic options that would ordinarily be tried before resorting to the investigational drug or an explanation of why the use of the investigational drug is preferable to the use of available diagnostic options.56 Footnote 56: See 21 CFR 312.305(b)(2)(iii).\n\nThe criteria for patient selection or, for an individual patient, a description of the patient's disease or condition, including recent medical history and previous treatments of the disease or condition.57 Footnote 58: See 21 CFR 312.305(b)(2)(iii).\n\nThe method of administration of the drug, dose, radiation-absorbed dose, and any plan for repeat administration.58 Footnote 59: See 21 CFR 312.305(b)(2)(vi).\n\nClinical procedures, laboratory tests, or other monitoring necessary to evaluate the effects of the drug and minimize its risks.59 Footnote 59: See 21 CFR 312.305(b)(2)(vi).\n\nThe facility where the drug will be produced.60 Footnote 60: See 21 CFR 312.305(b)(2)(vi).\n\nChemistry, manufacturing, and controls information adequate to ensure the proper identification, quality, purity, and strength of the investigational drug.61 Footnote 61: See 21 CFR 312.305(b)(2)(vi).\n\nPharmacology and toxicology information adequate to conclude that the drug is reasonably safe at the dose and duration proposed for expanded access use.62 Footnote 62: See 21 CFR 312.305(b)(2)(vi).\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nInformation to support a finding that:\n\nThe patient or patients to be treated have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose or monitor the disease or condition.63 Footnote 63: See 21 CFR 312.305(a).\n\nThe potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the diagnostic use and those potential risks are not unreasonable in the context of the disease or condition to be evaluated.64 Footnote 65: See 21 CFR 312.305(a)(2).\n\nProvision of the investigational drug for the requested use will not interfere with the initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the expanded access use or otherwise compromise the potential development of the expanded access use.65\n\nIf the Expanded Access Submission is for an individual patient, the following additional information must be supplied:\n\nInformation demonstrating that the physician determined that the probable risk to the person from the investigational drug is not greater than the probable risk from the disease or condition.66 Footnote 66: See 21 CFR 312.310(a)(1).\n\nInformation to support a finding that the patient cannot obtain the drug under another IND or protocol.67\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 312.315(c).\n\nIf the Expanded Access Submission is for an intermediate-size population (i.e., for more than one patient, but for a smaller population than the large populations typical of treatment INDs or protocols), the following additional information must be supplied:\n\nState whether or not the investigational drug is under development for marketing approval. If the drug is not being developed, describe the reasons for lack of development, and the circumstances under which the drug could be developed. If the drug is under development, describe why the proposed access patients are unable to participate in a clinical trial of the drug, and circumstances under which the sponsor would conduct a clinical trial in those patients. For example, identify whether the trials are closed to enrollment or the trial sites are geographically inaccessible.68* Provide at least preliminary clinical evidence of the effectiveness of the drug or of a plausible pharmacologic effect of the drug to make expanded access use a reasonable diagnostic option in the anticipated patient population.[69]\n\nDescribe the patient population to be treated, including the planned size of the patient population.[70]\n\nAppendix B Criteria for evaluating a request to charge and submission\n\nWhen considering submission of a Request to Charge IND submission, the sponsor should first determine whether the request involves charging within a clinical trial or charging for expanded access to the investigational drug for treatment use. If the charging is for expanded access, then the sponsor should identify which of the three categories is applicable to the access program, as follows:\n\nIndividual patient\n\nIntermediate-size population\n\nTreatment IND or Treatment Protocol\n\nFor requests to charge for all types of expanded access, a sponsor must provide reasonable assurance that charging will not interfere with developing the drug for marketing.71 To obtain authorization to charge under a Treatment IND or Treatment Protocol access program, that assurance must include specific information.72 For example, the sponsor must provide evidence of sufficient enrollment in any ongoing clinical trial(s) needed for marketing approval to reasonably assure FDA that the trial(s) will be successfully completed as planned (21 CFR 312.8). In general, we anticipate that few, if any, sponsors will submit a Request to Charge under a Treatment IND or Treatment Protocol for an investigational PET drug, and we do not address this topic further in this guidance. Please refer to SS 312.8 for additional information.\n\nFootnote 71: 21 CFR 312.8(c)(1).\n\nFootnote 72: 21 CFR 312.8(b)(1)(ii).\n\nListed below is the information that must be submitted in a request to charge for a PET drug in a clinical trial or in an intermediate-size expanded access program.\n\nCharging in a clinical trial: 1. Provide evidence that the drug has a potential clinical benefit that, if demonstrated in the clinical investigations, would provide a significant advantage over available products in the diagnosis of a disease or condition.73\n\nDemonstrate that the data to be obtained from the clinical trial would be essential to establishing that the drug is effective or safe for the purpose of obtaining initial approval of a drug or would support a significant change in the labeling of an approved drug (e.g., new indication, inclusion of comparative safety information).74 Footnote 74: 21 CFR 312.8(b)(ii).\n\nDemonstrate that the clinical trial could not be conducted without charging because the cost of the drug is extraordinary to the sponsor. The cost may be extraordinary because of manufacturing complexity, scarcity of a natural resource, the large quantity of drug\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:28]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:29]\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigational New Drug Applications for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Drugs \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.418617248535156", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations  Does FDA have guidelines for animal bedding?\n--------------------\nContext: IX Checklist of Essential Elements of an Animal Model\n\nThe following checklist provides a list of data elements (and the corresponding sections within this guidance) for consideration when developing an animal model.

For such procedures, the following practices should be observed, unless there is compelling scientific reason precluding such practices: 1. Appropriate sedation, analgesia, or anesthesia should be used during and/or following procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress. 2. Humane endpoints that do not jeopardize the scientific objectives of the study should be established to prevent animals from suffering unrelieved pain or distress.107 Humane endpoints are the earliest indicators of severe distress, severe pain, suffering or impending death observed in an experimental animal.108 Predetermined humane endpoints are used to develop objective euthanasia\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:48]\n\nPublic Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals115\n\nU.S. Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research and Training116 Footnote 115: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, \u201cPublic Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals,\u201d Revised 2015, available at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/PHSPolicyLabAnimals.pdf, accessed on October 16, 2015.\n\nAVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals, 2013 edition17\n\nRecognition and Alleviation of Pain in Laboratory Animals118\n\nAppendix B Types of animal care interventions\n\nAs described in this guidance, animal care interventions incorporated into animal studies are divided into three categories based on the rationale for their use: (1) intervention as part of adequate veterinary care, (2) intervention as supportive care to mimic the human clinical scenario, and (3) intervention to permit the manifestation of the disease or condition for the purpose of model development. These categories of interventions are discussed here:\n\nIntervention as part of adequate veterinary care: Animal studies must comply with applicable laws and regulations as prescribed by the Animal Welfare Act119 and the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.120 In addition, all studies should comply with general principles for the care and use of animals in biomedical research (see Appendix A for details). Compliance with these laws and general principles ensures that adequate veterinary care is provided, such that animals experiencing more than momentary or slight pain or distress are provided relief through appropriate analgesia, treatment, or, when prospectively defined criteria are met, euthanasia. Exceptions to this standard are permitted only when scientifically justified and approved by the IACUC. The standards for adequate veterinary care also include treatment of unexpected events, such as injury or the development of an unrelated disease. An example of an intervention that is considered part of adequate veterinary care is the administration of analgesics in a study assessing the effects of an investigational drug on vesicular-induced effects on the skin.\n\nFootnote 119: See 7 U.S.C. 2131 et seq.\n\nIntervention as supportive care to mimic the human clinical scenario: Supportive care, as defined in this document, is needed only to mimic, to the extent possible, the human clinical scenario. In general, it is relevant only for efficacy studies designed to support treatment of the disease or condition and the natural history studies on which the animal model is based. Animal supportive care can range from minimal intervention (particularly in the case of small rodents) to comprehensive medical support; however, it is not necessarily equal to patient care in a human clinical setting and in many cases may be significantly less intensive. The ability to provide certain types of supportive care can be species dependent (e.g., the ability to provide blood transfusions in a nonhuman primate model versus a rodent model). When included in an animal efficacy study, supportive care ideally should reflect the intended conditions of use of the investigational drug. It also should reflect the intended types of medical intervention and the timing of the availability of medical intervention expected in the human clinical or incident setting. The anticipated supportive care should be adapted, as appropriate, from the standard of human clinical practice to the animal species used, such as modifying the doses, route of administration, or the specific medical products administered.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Product Development Under the Animal Rule\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.12525749206543"], "Upon checking the information in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where can I submit written comments?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where can I submit written comments?\n--------------------\nContext: Submit Comments\n\nSubmit Comments Online (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-1997-D-0056)\n\nYou can submit online or written comments on any guidance at any time (see 21 CFR 10.115(g)(5))\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll written comments should be identified with this document's docket number: FDA-1997-D-0056\n\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-1997-D-0056).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Label Warning Statements for Iron-Containing Supplements and Drugs \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.137066602706909", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where can I submit written comments?\n--------------------\nContext: Submit Comments\n\nSubmit Comments Online (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2009-D-0260)\n\nYou can submit online or written comments on any guidance at any time (see 21 CFR 10.115(g)(5))\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll written comments should be identified with this document's docket number: FDA-2009-D-0260\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2009-D-0260).\n\nSearch for FDA\n\nGuidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Submitting a Report for Multiple Facilities to the Reportable Food Electronic Portal (Spanish Translation) \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.9874136447906494", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where can I submit written comments?\n--------------------\nContext: Submit Comments\n\nSubmit Comments Online (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2009-D-0260)\n\nYou can submit online or written comments on any guidance at any time (see 21 CFR 10.115(g)(5))\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll written comments should be identified with this document's docket number: FDA-2009-D-0260\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2009-D-0260).\n\n(\\copyright) Search for FDA\n\nGuidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Submitting a Report for Multiple Facilities to the Reportable Food Electronic Portal (French Translation) \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.93217134475708", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Where can I submit written comments?\n--------------------\nContext: Submit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\nhttps://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) -

[Moved to Final from Draft September 2021]\n\nA.I.24.: When an applicant is seeking licensure for an indication for which the reference product has unexpired orphan exclusivity, an applicant should submit data and information to support approval of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product for this indication.18 For example, an applicant may submit data and information intended to provide sufficient scientific justification for extrapolation to support approval of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product for one or more indications, including an indication(s) for which the reference product has unexpired orphan exclusivity. In reviewing such information under section 351(k), FDA will not approve the proposed product for the protected indication(s).19\n\nFootnote 19: See License for Fewer than All Conditions of Use Guidance for information about timing of submissions for supplements seeking licensure for indications protected by unexpired exclusivity. This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nII Provisions Related to Requirement to Submit a Bla for a \"Biological Product\"\n\nThis question and its answer have been withdrawn. For information on the definition of \"protein\" in section 351(i)(1) of the PHS Act, see Final Rule on Definition of the Term \"Biological Product\" (85 FR 10057, February 21, 2020) and 21 CFR 600.3(h)(6). [\\ast\\ast\\ast\\ast]\n\nHow is \"product class\" defined for purposes of determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period? [Final April 2015]\n\nFor purposes of section 7002(e)(2) of the ACA, a proposed biological product will be considered to be in the same product class as a protein product previously approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2010, if both products are homologous to the same gene-coded sequence (e.g., the INS gene for insulin and insulin glargine) with allowance for additional novel flanking sequences (including sequences from other genes). Products with discrete changes in gene-coded sequence or discrete changes in post-translational modifications may be in the same product class as the previously approved product even if the result may be a change in product PK.\n\nFor naturally derived protein products that do not have identified sequences linked to specific genes and that were approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2010, a proposed biological product is in the same product class as the naturally derived protein product if both products share a primary biological activity (e.g., the 4-number Enzyme Commission code for enzyme activity).\n\nHowever, for any protein product (whether naturally derived or otherwise), if the difference between the proposed product and the protein product previously approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act alters a biological target or effect, the products are not in the same product class for purposes of section 7002(e)(2) of the ACA.\n\nQ.II.3: What type of marketing application should be submitted for a proposed antibody-drug conjugate? [Final December 2018]\n\nA.II.3. A BLA should be submitted for a proposed monoclonal antibody that is linked to a drug (antibody-drug conjugate). FDA considers an antibody-drug conjugate to be a combination product composed of a biological product constituent part and a drug constituent part (see 21 CFR 3.2(e)(1); 70 FR 49848, 49857-49858 (August 25, 2005)).\n\nCDER is the FDA center assigned to regulate antibody-drug conjugates, irrespective of whether the biological product constituent part or the drug constituent part is determined to have the primary mode of action. For more information, see section 503(g) of the FD&C Act; see also, e.g., Transfer of Therapeutic Biological Products to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (June 30, 2003), available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/JurisdictionalInformation/ucm136265.htm; Intercenter Agreement Between the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (October 31, 1991), available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/CombinationProducts/JurisdictionalInformation/ucm121179.htm.\n\nTo enhance regulatory clarity and promote consistency, CDER considered several factors to determine the appropriate marketing application type for antibody-drug conjugates, including the relative significance of the safety and effectiveness questions raised by the constituent parts, particularly the highly specific molecular targeting by the antibody to a cell type, cellular compartment, or other marker at the site of action (as distinguished from mere alteration of systemic PK).\n\nIn light of such factors, CDER considers submission of a BLA under section 351 of the PHS Act to provide the more appropriate application type for antibody-drug conjugates.\n\nSponsors seeking to submit a BLA for a proposed antibody-drug conjugate may contact CDER's Office of New Drugs at 301-796-0700 for further information.\n\nIII Exclusivity\n\nCan an applicant include in its 351(a) BLA submission a request for reference product exclusivity under section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act? [Final December 2018]\n\nYes. An applicant may include in its BLA submission a request for reference product exclusivity under section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act, and FDA will consider the applicant's assertions regarding the eligibility of its proposed product for exclusivity. For more information, see FDA's draft guidance for industry Reference Product Exclusivity for Biological Products Filed Under Section 351(a) of the PHS Act.20 The draft guidance describes the types of information that reference product sponsors should provide to facilitate FDA's determination of the date of first licensure for their products. Footnote 20: This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nHow can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n\nThe FDA's Orphan Drug Product designation database is available to search for orphan drug designations and/or approvals. The database is updated monthly (see https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/index.cfm). FDA will not approve a subsequent application for the same drug for the same indication during the 7-year period of orphan exclusivity, except as otherwise provided in the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 316.\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.63975191116333", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: A.I.7. An applicant generally may obtain licensure of a proposed biosimilar product for fewer than all conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed. The 351(k) application must include information demonstrating that the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling submitted for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product (see section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the PHS Act).\n\nFor information about the licensure of a proposed interchangeable product, see FDA's guidance for industry Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference Product.5\n\nFootnote 5: As explained in that guidance, FDA generally expects that applicants seeking to demonstrate interchangeability will submit data and information to support a showing that the proposed interchangeable product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in all of the reference product\u2019s licensed conditions of use.\n\nQ.1.8. Can a sponsor use comparative animal or clinical data with a non-U.S.-licensed product to support a demonstration that the proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n\nA.I.8. A sponsor may use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in certain studies to support a demonstration that the proposed biological product is biosimilar to the U.S.-licensed reference product. However, as a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) study, which may include pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoint(s) intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed.\n\nIf a sponsor seeks to use data from an animal study6 or a clinical study comparing its proposed biosimilar product to a non-U.S.-licensed product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. As a scientific matter, the type of bridging data needed will always include data from analytical studies(e.g., structural and functional data) that directly compare all three products (i.e., the proposed biosimilar product, the U.S.-licensed reference product, and the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product), and is likely to also include bridging clinical PK data or, when appropriate, PD data, for all three products. All three pairwise comparisons should meet the prespecified acceptance criteria for analytical and PK or PD similarity. The acceptability of such an approach will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and should be discussed in advance with the Agency. For certain complex biological products, a modified approach may be needed. A final determination about the adequacy of the scientific justification and bridge will be made during the review of the application.\n\nIssues that a sponsor may need to address to use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in a biosimilar development program include but are not limited to the following:\n\nRelevance of the design of the clinical program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity to the U.S.-licensed reference product for the condition(s) of use and patient population(s) for which licensure is sought\n\nRelationship between the license holder for the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product and BLA holder for the U.S.-licensed reference product\n\nWhether the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product was manufactured in a facility(ies) licensed and inspected by a regulatory authority that has similar scientific and regulatory standards as FDA (e.g., International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) countries)\n\nWhether the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product was licensed by a regulatory authority that has similar scientific and regulatory standards as FDA (e.g., ICH countries) and the duration and extent to which the product has been marketed\n\nScientific bridge between the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product and the U.S.-licensed reference product, including comparative physicochemical characterization, biological assays/functional assays, degradation profiles under stressed conditions, and comparative clinical PK or, when appropriate, PD data, to address the impact of any differences in formulation or primary packaging on product performance\n\nA sponsor should also address any other factors that may affect the relevance of comparative data with the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to an assessment of biosimilarity with the U.S.-licensed reference product.\n\nA sponsor may submit publicly available information regarding the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to justify the extent of comparative data needed to establish a bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. The complexity of the products, particularly with respect to higher order structure, post-translational modifications (e.g., glycosylation), and the degree of heterogeneity associated with the product may affect the considerations for the scientific justification regarding the extent of bridging data. Additional factors that FDA may consider regarding the extent of bridging data include but are not limited to the following:\n\nWhether the formulation, dosage form, and strength of the U.S.-licensed reference product and non-U.S.-licensed comparator products are the same\n\nRoute of administration of the U.S.-licensed reference product and non-U.S.-licensed comparator products\n\nDesign of the physicochemical and biological/functional assessments and the use of multiple orthogonal methods with adequate sensitivity to detect differences among the products\n\nScientific justification for the selection of the non-U.S.-licensed comparator lots used to establish the scientific bridge and how the selected lots relate to the material used in the nonclinical and clinical studies; the scientific bridge should include a sufficient number of lots of non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to adequately capture the variability in product quality attributes, and when possible, the non-U.S.-licensed comparator lots used in the nonclinical or clinical studies should be included in the assessment performed to establish the analytical bridge\n\nSponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program the adequacy of the scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of this scientific justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFor more information about whether a non-U.S.-licensed comparator can be used in studies intended to support the additional criteria required for a determination of interchangeability with the reference product, see FDA's guidance for industry Considerations in Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference Product.\n\nQ.I.9.: Is a clinical study to assess the potential of the biological product to delay cardiac repolarization (a QT/QTc study) or a drug-drug interaction study generally needed for licensure of a proposed biosimilar product? [Final December 2018]\n\nA.I.9. In general, a 351(k) application for a proposed biosimilar product may rely upon the Agency's previous determination of safety, purity, and potency for the reference product, including any clinical QT/QTc interval prolongation and proarrhythmic potential and drug-drug interactions. If such studies were not required for the reference product, then these data generally would not be needed for licensure of a proposed biosimilar product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. However, if the BLA holder for the reference product has been required to conduct postmarket studies or clinical trials under section 505(o)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to assess or identify a certain risk related to a QT/QTc study or a drug-drug interaction study and those studies have not yet been completed, then FDA may impose similar postmarket requirements on the 351(k) applicant in appropriate circumstances.\n\nQ.1.10: How long and in what manner should sponsors retain reserve samples of the biological products used in comparative clinical PK and/or PD studies intended to support a 351(k) application? [Final December 2018]\n\nA.I.10.: Reserve samples establish the identity of the products tested in the actual study, allow for confirmation of the validity and reliability of the results of the study, and facilitate investigation of further follow-up questions that arise after the studies are completed. FDA recommends that the sponsor of a proposed biosimilar product retain reserve samples for at least 5 years following the date on which the 351(k) application is licensed, or, if such application is not licensed, at least 5 years following the date of completion of a comparative clinical PK and/or PD study of the reference product and the proposed biosimilar product (or other clinical study in which PK or PD samples are collected with the primary objective of assessing PK or PD similarity) that is intended to support a submission under section 351(k) of the PHS Act. Contact FDA for specific advice if an alternative approach is being considered. For a three-way PK similarity study, FDA recommends that samples of both comparator products be retained, in addition to samples of the proposed biosimilar product.\n\nFor most protein therapeutics, FDA recommends that a sponsor retain the following quantities of product and dosage units, which are expected to be sufficient for evaluation by state of the art analytical methods:\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.5892609357833862", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: Appendix A Approaches to Product Identification\n\nIn biosimilar product labeling, the approach to product identification depends on the context of the information being presented. FDA acknowledges that there will be variations on the general concepts outlined in this section because the approach to product identification will depend on the specific statements. The illustrative examples in this section use a fictional reference product JUNEXANT (replicamab-hyxf) and a fictional biosimilar product NEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen use of the biosimilar product name is recommended:\n\nThe biosimilar product name should be used in labeling text that is specific to the biosimilar product or that refers solely to the biosimilar product. If a biosimilar product has a proprietary name, the proprietary name (e.g., NEXSYMEO) should be used in the appropriate sections. However, if a proprietary name is not available, or if referring to the drug substance (as discussed below), the biosimilar product's proper name (e.g., replicamab-cznm) should be used.13\n\nFootnote 13: The proper name is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (see section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)).\n\nThe biosimilar product's proprietary name (or, if a proprietary name is not available, the biosimilar product's proper name) should be used in circumstances such as the following:\n\nIn sections where the information described is specific to the biosimilar product -- This includes, but is not limited to, the following sections: INDICATIONS AND USAGE, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, DESCRIPTION, and HOW SUPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING.\n\nFor directive statements and recommendations for preventing, monitoring, managing, or mitigating risks (e.g., \"Discontinue NEXSYMEO in patients with [adverse reaction]\") -- Such statements are typically included in, but are not limited to, the BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, and DRUG INTERACTIONS sections.\n\nThe biosimilar product's proper name should be used when referring to the drug substance. An example would be to use the biosimilar product's proper name in the DESCRIPTION section.\n\nWhen use of the reference product name is recommended:\n\nWhen clinical studies or data derived from studies with the reference product are described in biosimilar product labeling, the reference product's proper name (e.g., replicamab-hjsf) should be used. This information would typically be included in sections such as, but not limited to, ADVERSE REACTIONS (Clinical Trials Experience subsection) and CLINICAL STUDIES.\n\nWhen use of the core name is recommended:14\n\nFootnote 14: Two examples of a core name are filgrastim and epoetin alfa. The proper name for biological products will include a distinguishing suffix composed of four lowercase letters attached to the core name with a hyphen.\n\nThe overall risk-benefit profile of the reference product is relevant to the biosimilar product, even if a particular serious adverse reaction or other risk included in the reference product labeling may not have been reported with the biosimilar product at the time of licensure. In labeling sections where the risk applies to both the biosimilar product and the reference product (e.g., BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, Warnings and PRECAUTIONS, ADVERSE REACTIONS (Postmarketing Experience subsection)), it would be appropriate to use the core name of the reference product followed by the word \"products\" (e.g., replicamab products) to convey, for instance, that a risk or other information necessary for the safe use of the product applies to both the biosimilar product and the reference product (see section IV.B of this guidance).\n\nFor example, in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline\nReference Product Labeling & Biosimilar Product Labeling \\ \\hline Treatment with JUNEXANT increases & Treatment with replicamab products \\ the risk of serious infections involving & increases the risk of serious infections \\ various organ systems and sites that may & involving various organ systems and sites \\ lead to hospitalization or death. & that may lead to hospitalization or death. \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n4. When use of more than one product name is recommended:\n\nThere may be text appropriately based on the reference product labeling where more than one of these product identification approaches should be used to convey information accurately.\n\nTherefore, all text in biosimilar product labeling, even sections that have been based on reference product labeling, should be carefully evaluated for the most appropriate product identification approach. In some cases, such as the following example, more than two of the approaches may be used:\n\nReplicamab products can cause hepatotoxicity and acute hepatic failure. In clinical trials of replicamab-hjxf, 10% of patients developed elevated ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of normal and 5% progressed to acute hepatic failure. Evaluate serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin at baseline and monthly during treatment with NEXSYMEO...\n\nApproaches to Content Presentation\n\nThe labeling for the biosimilar product should be specific to the conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)) sought for the biosimilar product and should be consistent with language previously approved for the reference product for those conditions of use.\n\nWhen a biosimilar product applicant obtains licensure for fewer than all conditions of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)) for which the reference product is licensed, certain text in the reference product labeling related to condition(s) of use for the reference product that are not licensed for the biosimilar product would generally not be included in the biosimilar product labeling.15 However, in certain circumstances it may be necessary to include information in the biosimilar product labeling relating to an indication(s) for which the biosimilar product is not licensed, in order to help ensure safe use (e.g., when safety information in the reference product labeling is related to use of the product and is not specific to a particular licensed indication(s) or when information specific to only the biosimilar product's indication(s) cannot be easily extracted).16 Such text should be written in a manner that does not imply that the biosimilar product is licensed for a reference product indication(s) or use(s) that has not been licensed for the biosimilar product. In these circumstances, specific sections of labeling that could be affected include BOXED WARNING, CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, ADVERSE REACTIONS, DRUG INTERACTIONS, and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS.\n\nFootnote 16: See also 21 CFR 201.57(c)(6)(i).\n\nFor example, for sections such as WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS, the reference product labeling may pool and categorize events from all the reference product clinical trials for all the indications for which the reference product is licensed. In cases where the biosimilar product applicant is not seeking licensure for all the indications for which the reference product is licensed, the pooled data described in the reference product labeling should be included in the biosimilar product labeling in a manner that is not indication-specific. However, any text that refers to an indication for which the biosimilar product applicant is not currently seeking licensure and is included to ensure safe use of the biosimilar product should be revised to avoid an implication that the biosimilar has been licensed for that indication(s).\n\nApproaches to Specific Sections of Biosimilar Product Labeling\n\nHIGHLIGHTS OF PRESCRIBING INFORMATION (Highlights) a. Initial U.S. approval\n\nThe initial U.S. approval in the Highlights section is the year that the biosimilar product is licensed.\n\nb. Biosimilarity statement\n\nFDA recommends including a statement, placed on the line immediately beneath the initial U.S. approval in the Highlights section, that the product is biosimilar to the reference product. It should read as follows:\n\n[BIOSIMIIAR PRODUCT'S PROPRIETARY NAME (biosimilar product's proper name)] is biosimilar* to [REFERENCE PRODUCT'S PROPRIETARY NAME (reference product's proper name)].\n\nThe asterisk should appear as a footnote symbol inserted after the word \"biosimilar.\"For example, for the fictitious product NEXSYMEO, the statement should read as follows:\n\nNEXSYMEO (replicamab-cznm) is biosimilar* to JUNEXANT (replicamab-hjxf).\n\nThe footnote should appear at the end of the Highlights section (but above the Revision Date) and state the following:\n\nBiosimilar means that the biological product is approved based on data demonstrating that it is highly similar to an FDA-approved biological product, known as a reference product, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product. Biosimilarity of [BIOSIMILAR PRODUCT'S PROPRIETARY NAME] has been demonstrated for the condition(s) of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)), strength(s), dosage form(s), and route(s) of administration described in its Full Prescribing Information.\n\n2 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\n\nInformation in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section should be specific to the licensed indications for the biosimilar product and should be consistent with information previously approved for the reference product. The biosimilar product labeling should include text from the reference product labeling regarding any Limitations of Use relevant to the biosimilar product's indication(s) (see section IV.B of this guidance for recommendations regarding text that refers to an indication for which licensure has not been sought by the biosimilar product applicant).\n\n3 ADVERSE REACTIONS, Immunogenicity\n--------------------\nContext title: Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.32982203364372253", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: An application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that \"the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product\" based upon data derived from:11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(3) of the PHS Act.\n\nAnalytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;\n\nAnimal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and\n\nA clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.\n\nThe Agency has the discretion to determine that an element described above is unnecessary in a 351(k) application.12 FDA advises sponsors intending to develop biosimilar products to meet with FDA to present their product development plans and establish a schedule of milestones that will serve as landmarks for future discussions with the Agency. FDA anticipates that early discussions with FDA about product development plans and about approaches to providing adequate scientific justifications will facilitate biosimilar development.13\n\nFootnote 12: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See the draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants for a detailed discussion. When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\n4 Complexities of Protein Products\n\nA sponsor should consider the complexities of protein products and related scientific issues when designing a development program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.\n\nNature of Protein Products and Related Scientific Considerations\n\nUnlike small molecule drugs, whose structure can usually be completely defined and entirely reproduced, proteins are typically more complex and are unlikely to be shown to be structurally identical to a reference product. Many potential differences in protein structure can arise. Because even minor structural differences (including certain changes in glycosylation patterns) can significantly affect a protein's safety and/or effectiveness, it is important to evaluate these differences.\n\nIn general, proteins can differ in at least three ways: (1) primary amino acid sequence; (2) modification to amino acids, such as sugar moieties (glycosylation) or other side chains; and (3) higher order structure (protein folding and protein-protein interactions). Modifications to amino acids may lead to heterogeneity and can be difficult to control. Protein modifications and higher order structure can be affected by formulation and environmental conditions, including light, temperature, moisture, packaging materials, container closure systems, and delivery device materials. Additionally, process- as well as product-related impurities may increase the likelihood and/or the severity of an immune response to a protein product, and certain excipients may limit the ability to characterize the protein product.\n\nAdvances in analytical sciences enable some protein products to be extensively characterized with respect to their physicochemical and biological properties, such as higher order structures and functional characteristics. These analytical methodologies have increasingly improved the ability to identify and characterize not only the drug substance of a protein product but also excipients and product- and process-related impurities.\n\nDespite such significant improvements in analytical techniques, however, current analytical methodology may not be able to detect all relevant structural and functional differences between two protein products. In addition, there may be incomplete understanding of the relationship between a product's structural attributes and its clinical performance. Thus, as set forth in the PHS Act, data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies are required to demonstrate biosimilarity unless FDA determines an element unnecessary.14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nManufacturing Process Considerations\n\nDifferent manufacturing processes may alter a protein product in a way that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the product. For example, differences in biological systems used to manufacture a protein product may cause different posttranslational modifications, which in turn may affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the product. Thus, when the manufacturing process for a marketed protein product is changed, the application holder must assess the effects of the change and demonstrate--through appropriate analytical testing, functional assays, and/or in some cases animal and/or clinical studies--that the change does not have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they relate to the safety oreffectiveness of the product.15 The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process (ICH Q5E) describes scientific principles in the comparability assessment for manufacturing changes.\n\nFootnote 15: See 21 CFR 601.12 and 21 CFR 314.70 for regulatory requirements for changes (including manufacturing changes) made to a licensed biologics license application (BLA) and an approved NDA, respectively.\n\nDemonstrating that a proposed product is biosimilar to a reference product typically will be more complex than assessing the comparability of a product before and after manufacturing changes made by the same manufacturer. This is because a manufacturer that modifies its own manufacturing process has extensive knowledge and information about the product and the existing process, including established controls and acceptance parameters. By contrast, the manufacturer of a proposed product is likely to have a different manufacturing process (e.g., different cell line, raw materials, equipment, processes, process controls, and acceptance criteria) from that of the reference product and no direct knowledge of the manufacturing process for the reference product. Therefore, even though some of the scientific principles described in ICH Q5E may also apply in the demonstration of biosimilarity, in general, FDA anticipates that more data and information will be needed to establish biosimilarity than would be needed to establish that a manufacturer's post-manufacturing change product is comparable to the pre-manufacturing change product.\n\nV U.S.-LICENSED Reference Product and Other Comparators\n\nTo obtain licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act, a sponsor must demonstrate that the proposed product is biosimilar to a single reference product that previously has been licensed by FDA.16 In general, a sponsor needs to provide information to demonstrate biosimilarity based on data directly comparing the proposed product with the reference product. As a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical PK study and, if appropriate, at least one PD study, intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity for purposes of section 351(k) of the PHS Act must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed. However, a sponsor may seek to use data derived from animal or clinical studies comparing a proposed product with a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act. In such a case, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.17 Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program their plans to provide an adequate scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of such justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFootnote 16: Sections 7002(a)(2) and (b)(3) of the Affordable Care Act, adding sections 351(k), 351(i)(2), and 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act.\n\nVI Approaches to developing and assessing evidence to demonstrate biosimilarity\n\nFDA recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to develop the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity. FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence provided by a sponsor when the Agency evaluates the sponsor's demonstration of biosimilarity, consistent with a longstanding Agency approach to evaluating scientific evidence.18\n\nFootnote 18: See footnote 4.\n\nUsing a Stepwise Approach to Demonstrate Biosimilarity\n--------------------\nContext title: Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.6615872383117676", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsors may request advice from FDA regarding proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product development programs that identify a biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as the intended reference product. A sponsor will be able to submit a 351(k) BLA that references the biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as its reference product after the NDA for the biological product is deemed to be a 351(a) BLA.\n\nQ19. Can an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a \"deemed\" 351(a) BLA seek a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act to another biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act?\n\nAny person (including an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a \"deemed\" 351(a) BLA) may seek to establish the biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product to another biological product licensed or deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. FDA intends to work with applicants to address scientific or regulatory issues that may arise in the context of these 351(k) development programs, and to provide additional procedural information. Any sponsor or applicant may contact the relevant review division within the Office of New Drugs in FDA's CDER to request advice on a 351(k) development program.\n\nD. Transition of Biological Products from the Orange Book to the Purple Book\n\nQ20. Will any therapeutic equivalence evaluations for biological products previously listed in the Orange Book be reflected in the Purple Book?\n\nNo, the Purple Book does not include therapeutic equivalence evaluations as reflected in the Orange Book. The Purple Book identifies, among other things, whether a biological product licensed under section 351(k) of the PHS Act has been determined by FDA to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product.\n\nE. Designation of Proper Name\n\nQ21. What will be the proper name for a biological product that has be en approved in an NDA that is deemed to be a BLA?\n\nThe (proper\\,name) is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)). FDA does not intend to apply the nonproprietary naming convention (in which the proper name is composed of a core name and a four-letter distinguishing suffix) to biological products that are the subject of an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act that is deemed to be a license under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. This is consistent with what was previously communicated in FDA's draft guidance for industry (Nonproprietary\\,Naming) of Biological Products: Update_ (March 2019).20\n\nIV Compliance Policy for Requirements Related to Labeling\n\nTo minimize possible disruption to the distribution of biological products that are the subject of the transition provision and to minimize burden on holders of deemed BLAs, FDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA with labeling that does not conform to certain labeling requirements for BLAs until March 23, 2025, provided that all other applicable labeling requirements are met. The compliance policy set forth in this guidance would apply only as described below.\n\nFDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA and that are introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce between March 23, 2020, and March 22, 2025, where the package is not marked with:\n\nThe proper name of the biological product contained in the package (provided that the current packaging is plainly marked with the established name of the biological product);\n\nThe name and address of the manufacturer of the biological product (provided that the current packaging is plainly marked with the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor as required in 21 CFR 201.1);\n\nThe applicable license number; or\n\nOther information required by 21 CFR 610.60 through 610.64, for which there is not a corresponding requirement under 21 CFR 201.1.\n\nFDA also generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA and that are introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce between March 23, 2020, and March 22, 2025, where the content and format of labeling required by 21 CFR 201.56, 201.57, 201.80, and/or 208.20, as applicable, does not include the following information:\n\nThe proper name of the biological product, including any appropriate descriptors (provided that the current labeling uses the established name of the biological product);\n\nThe name and address of the manufacturer of the biological product (provided that the current labeling includes the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor as required by 21 CFR 201.1);\n\nThe applicable license number; or\n\nFor biological products with approved labeling in the format described by 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57 (PLR format), the year of Initial U.S. Approval of the new biological product (provided that the current labeling includes the year of Initial U.S. Approval of the new molecular entity).\n\nFDA notes that the timing of BLA-specific revisions to the prescribing information should be coordinated with the corresponding revisions to the container labels, carton labeling, and any FDA-approved patient labeling for the biological product to ensure consistency among the different types of product labeling.\n\nIf the holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product has an administratively converted supplement that includes proposed revisions to product labeling or submits a supplement that includes proposed revisions to product labeling before March 22, 2025 (i.e., the end of the compliance period), and the required BLA-specific labeling revisions to container labels, carton labeling, and prescribing information referenced in this guidance have not already been addressed, such revisions would need to be addressed before the supplement could be approved (see, e.g., 21 CFR 610.60). A changes-being-effected (CBE-0) supplement may be submitted prior to submission of a prior approval supplement that includes the BLA-specific labeling revisions. However, the prior approval supplement would need to be approved before or concurrent with approval of the CBE-0 supplement. Under this approach, holders of deemed BLAs may coordinate BLA-specific labeling updates with their plans for other proposed revisions to product labeling.\n\nAfter FDA approval of a supplement for the BLA-specific labeling revisions, FDA understands that application holders may need to wait to implement these labeling revisions until their next printing of the labels and labeling. Accordingly, to enable such application holders to exhaust existing inventory, FDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA where FDA has already approved a supplement that includes the BLA-specific labeling revisions but the labels and labeling do not include the BLA-specific labeling revisions prior to March 22, 2025.\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.9039722084999084", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry  How can a prospective biosimilar applicant determine whether there is unexpired orphan exclusivity for an indication for which the reference product is licensed?\n--------------------\nContext: Consequently, in appropriate cases, FDA may take additional steps within its authority to assure that pediatric use information is included in biological product labeling.12 Such actions may include invoking the \"marketed drugs\" provision under PREA, in certain circumstances, to require sponsors to conduct pediatric assessments, or take other appropriate steps, to support pediatric labeling for both the biosimilar product and the reference product.13\n\nFootnote 13: See section 505B(b) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIf a biosimilar applicant believes that none of the situations described above apply to its proposed product, the applicant should contact FDA for further information.\n\nQ.I.17: When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n\n[Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n\nA.I.17. Section 505B(e) of the FD&C Act requires applicants subject to PREA to submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP) before the date on which the applicant\n\nsubmits the required assessments or investigation, and no later than 60 calendar days after the date of an end-of-phase 2 (EOP2) meeting or at such other time as agreed upon by FDA and the applicant. FDA has issued guidance on the PSP\n\nprocess, including the timing of PSP submission.14\n\nFootnote 14: See the guidance for industry Pediatric Study Plans: Content of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans (July 2020).\n\nSections 505B(e)(2)(C) and 505B(e)(3) of the FD&C Act set forth a process for reaching agreement between an applicant and FDA on an initial PSP that generally lasts up to 210 days. Given the potential length of this process, and in the absence of an EOP2 meeting for a proposed biosimilar product, FDA\n\nrecommends that if a sponsor has not already initiated a comparative clinical study intended to address the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I)(cc) of the PHS Act, the sponsor should submit an initial PSP as soon as feasible, but no later than 210 days before initiating such a study. This is intended to provide adequate time to reach agreement with FDA on the initial PSP before the study is initiated. Depending on the details of the clinical program, it may be appropriate to submit an initial PSP earlier in development. FDA encourages the sponsor to meet with FDA to discuss the details of the planned development program before submission of the initial PSP.\n\nFor additional information on submission of the PSP, including a PSP template, please refer to:\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResource\n\ns/ucm049867.htm. After the initial PSP is submitted, FDA and the sponsor work to reach timely agreement on the plan; this process is set forth in section\n\n505B(e)(2)-(3) of the FD&C Act. FDA does not formally grant or deny a request for a waiver or deferral in response to the initial PSP.\n\nQ.I.18: For biological products intended to be injected, how can an applicant demonstrate that its proposed biosimilar product has the same dosage form as the reference product? [Final December 2018]\n\nA.I.18. Under section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the PHS Act, an applicant must demonstrate that the \"dosage form\" of the proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product is the same as that of the reference product. For purposes of implementing this statutory provision, FDA considers the dosage form to be the physical manifestation containing the active and inactive ingredients that delivers a dose of the drug product. In the context of proposed biosimilar products intended to be injected, FDA considers, for example, \"injection\" (e.g., a solution) to be a different dosage form from \"for injection\" (e.g., a lyophilized powder). Thus, if the dosage form of the reference product is \"injection,\" an applicant could not obtain licensure of a proposed biosimilar product with a dosage form of \"for injection\" even if the applicant demonstrated that the proposed biosimilar product, when constituted or reconstituted, could meet the other requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product.\n\nFor purposes of section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the PHS Act, FDA also considers emulsions and suspensions of products intended to be injected to be distinct dosage forms. Liposomes, lipid complexes, and products with extended-release characteristics present special scenarios due to their unique composition, and prospective applicants seeking further information should contact FDA.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that this interpretation regarding the same dosage form is for purposes of section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the PHS Act only. For example, this interpretation should not be cited by applicants seeking approval of a new drug application under section 505(c) of the FD&C Act, approval of an abbreviated new drug application under section 505(j) of the FD&C Act, or licensure of a BLA under section 351(a) of the PHS Act for purposes of determining whether separate applications should be submitted and assessed separate fees for different dosage forms.\n\nQ.I.19: If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n\nA.I.19. A sponsor may submit a single IND application for a development program that is intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act and includes use of a non-U.S.-licensed product. The sponsor should submit information supporting the proposed clinical investigation with the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product under the IND application. This scenario may occur, for example, if a sponsor seeks to use data from a clinical study comparingits proposed biosimilar product to a non-U.S.-licensed product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act, and proposes to conduct a clinical PK study, with PD data, as appropriate, in the United States with all three products (i.e., the proposed biosimilar product, the U.S.-licensed reference product, and the non-U.S.-licensed product) to support establishment of a bridge between all three products and scientific justification for the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity to the U.S.-licensed reference product.\n\nA non-U.S.-licensed comparator product is considered an investigational new drug in the United States, and thus would require an IND application for importation and use in the United States (see 21 CFR 312.110(a)). If a sponsor intends to conduct a clinical investigation in the United States using a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product, the IND requirements in 21 CFR part 312 also would apply to this product (see, e.g., 21 CFR 312.2).\n\nWith respect to chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) information, a sponsor should submit to the IND application as much of the CMC information required by 21 CFR 312.23(a)(7) as is available. However, FDA recognizes that a sponsor may not be able to obtain all of the CMC information required by 21 CFR 312.23(a)(7) for a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product for which it is not the manufacturer. In these circumstances, the sponsor can request in an IND submission that FDA waive the regulatory requirements related to CMC information on the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product (21 CFR 312.10). The waiver request must include at least one of the following:\n\nAn explanation why compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.23(a)(7) is unnecessary or cannot be achieved\n\nInformation that will satisfy the purpose of the requirement by helping to ensure that the investigational new drug will have the proper identity, strength, quality, and purity\n\nOther information justifying a waiver15 Footnote 15: See 21 CFR 312.10(a).\n\nInformation that is relevant to whether the investigational new drug will have the proper identity, strength, quality, and purity may include, for example, information indicating whether the investigational new drug has been licensed by a regulatory authority that has similar scientific and regulatory standards as FDA (e.g., ICH countries). This should include, to the greatest extent possible, summary approval information and current product labeling made public by the foreign regulatory authority. In addition, a sponsor should also provide information on the conditions and containers that will be used to transport the drug product to the U.S. clinical site(s) and information on the relabeling and repackaging operations that will be used to relabel the drug product vials for investigational use. This should include information on how exposure of the product to light and temperature conditions outside of the recommended storage conditions will be prevented. A risk assessment on the impact the relabeling operations may have on drug product stability should also be included.\n\nThe sponsor should consult with the appropriate FDA review division regarding the CMC information necessary to support the proposed clinical study.\n\nAs would be applicable to all investigational new drugs, FDA reminds sponsors that the investigator brochure (IB) for studies to be conducted under the IND application should be carefully prepared to ensure that it is not misleading, erroneous, or materially incomplete, which can be a basis for a clinical hold (see 21 CFR 312.42(b)(1)(iii) and (b)(2)(i)). For example, the term reference product should be used in the IB only to refer to the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which the proposed product is evaluated for purposes of submitting a 351(k) application.\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.623486280441284"], "Having read through Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What are intermediate-sized packages?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What are intermediate-sized packages?\n--------------------\nContext: VIIILG How Do These New Formatting Rules Affect the Percentage Juice Declaration?\n\nFigure 16: Simplified Format Label (101.9(f))\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWith the changes to some type size requirements on the Nutrition Facts label, it is permissible if the percentage juice declaration for foods purporting to be beverages that contain fruit or vegetable juice is smaller in height than the declaration of \"Serving size,\" \"Calories,\" and the numerical value for \"Calories,\" in addition to already being permitted to be smaller in height than the brand name, product name, logo, universal product code, and \"Nutrition Facts\" heading (21 CFR 101.30(e)(2)).\n\n4.2.3 VIII.H Are There Specific Formatting Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels?\n\nInformation other than the title, headings, and footnotes must be in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Column headings (e.g., \"Amount Per Serving\" and \"% Daily Value\") and footnotes (e.g., \"Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet\") must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Because many dietary supplement products may contribute a negligible amount of calories, we do not require information about calories to be displayed in a larger type size or highlighted on Supplement Facts labels (81 FR 33742 at 33939).\n\nFor small packages which have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, all information within the nutrition label must be in type size no smaller than 4.5 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(i)).\n\nIntermediate-sized packages, which have from 12 to 40 square inches of surface area available to bear labeling, have different type size requirements. All information within the nutrition label must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)). However, type size no smaller than 4.5 point may be used on packages that have less than 20 square inches available for labeling and more than eight dietary ingredients to be listed (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)). Similarly, type size no smaller than 4.5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches available for labeling and more than 16 dietary ingredients to be listed (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii)).\n\nThe footnote stating that the \"Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet\" is required if the percent DV is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, protein, or added sugars (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D)). On labels of products represented or purported to be for use by children 1 through 3 years of age, the footnote statement must read: \"Percent Daily Values are based on a 1,000 calorie diet\" if the % Daily Value is declared for total fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, protein, or added sugars (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D)).\n\nIf there is inadequate space to list the required information vertically, the list may be split. The list to the right must be set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the dietary ingredients and percent DV information given to the left (21 CFR 101.36(e)(12)). The column headings are also repeated (21 CFR 101.36(e)(12)). Figure 17 reflects this label formatting.\n\nIX When Must I Comply with the Rule?\n\nIf you have $10 million or more in annual food sales, your compliance date is January 1, 2020.

The title, \"Supplement Facts,\" must be larger than all other print in the panel and, unless impractical, must be set full width of the panel. The title and all headings must be bolded to distinguish them from other information.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n36. How must I present the information in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nYou must present all information using the following:\n\na. A single easy-to-read type style;\n\nb. All black or one color type, printed on a white or neutral contrasting background, whenever practical;3. Upper- and lowercase letters, except that you may use all uppercase lettering on small packages (i.e., packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches); d. At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text); and e. Letters that do not touch.\n37. What are the type size requirements for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nExcept as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must set information other than the title, headings, and footnotes in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. You also must use a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label for the title \"Supplement Facts.\" You may set the column headings and footnotes in type no smaller than 6 point type. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nMust I use hairlines in the Supplement Facts panel?\n\nExcept for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must use a hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text to separate each dietary ingredient from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it. FDA has provided an exception for certain packages with space constraints. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nHow closely must I follow the \"Examples of graphic enhancements used by the FDA\" in appendix B to Part 101?\n\nYou are not required to follow Appendix B to Part 101. Appendix B and its specifications are a model, which FDA has suggested in the interest of uniformity of presentation. For example, 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(i) requires the use of an \"easy-to-read\" type style, not specifically Helvetica type, as suggested in Appendix B.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)(9)\n\nHow do I provide nutrition labeling when my product contains two or more packets of supplements (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening)?\n\nYou may present the information for each packet (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening) in an individual nutrition label or you may use an aggregate nutrition label. For two packets, this would consist of five columns. List all of the dietary ingredients in the first column. List the amounts and percents of the morning packet in the second and third columns and similar information for the evening packet in the fourth and fifth columns (see the illustration of aggregate nutrition labeling in 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iii)).\n\nCompliance\n\nWhat kind of samples will FDA collect to determine compliance with 21 CFR 101.36?\n\nFDA will collect a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller. FDA will randomly select these packages.\n\nWhat if it is not technically feasible for me to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements?\n\nFDA may permit you to use an alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9). If your firm needs such special allowances, you must make your request in writing to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(f)(2)\n\nMust dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?\n\nFor dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value.\n\nExemptions\n\nWhat are the circumstances in which my dietary supplement products would be exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements? Your dietary supplement product is not required to have a \"Supplement Facts\" panel if: a. Your firm is a small business that has not more than $50,000 gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers or not more than $500,000 per year from total sales in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1); b. You sell less than 100,000 units of the product annually, your firm has fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(2) andyou file an annual notification with FDA as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(18)(iv); or c. You ship the product in bulk form, do not distribute it to consumers in such form, and you supply it for use in the manufacture of other dietary supplements in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(3). The two exemptions for small businesses and low-volume products (a. and b. above) are available to you only if your products' labels bear no claims or other nutrition information.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(h)(1) - (3)\n\nSpecial Labeling Provisions\n\nWhat are small packages?\n\nSmall packages are those packages having less than 12 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)\n\nWhat is the telephone provision for small packages?\n\nIn lieu of a \"Supplement Facts\" panel, you may print labels for small packages with a telephone number or address that consumers can use to obtain nutrition information. You may use a telephone number or an address in place of the \"Supplement Facts\" panel only if you place no claims or other nutrition information on the product label.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size that I may use for small packages?\n\nYou may use a type size no smaller than 4-5 point for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of small packages.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(i)\n\nMay I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small package?\n\nYes. You may use a tabular format on small packages. You also may present \"Supplement Facts\" information in a linear (i.e., string) fashion if the label will not accommodate the \"Supplement Facts\" panel in a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j) (13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display.)\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n\nWhat are intermediate-sized packages?\n\nIntermediate-sized packages are those packages having from 12 to 40 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(ii)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size for intermediate-sized packages?The \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of intermediate-sized packages must use type size no smaller than 6 point, except that type no smaller than 4-5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches that list more than 16 dietary ingredients. Also, 4-5 point type may be used on packages with less than 20 square inches that list more than 8 dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the type size used in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an inner container may be as small as needed to accommodate all required information if the \"Supplement Facts\" on the outer container meets these type size requirements.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv)\n51. May I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an intermediate-sized package? You may use a tabular format on an intermediate-sized package if the package shape or size cannot accommodate vertical columns. You may use a linear format if the label will not accommodate a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n52. May I abbreviate on the labels of intermediate- sized packages? You may use the abbreviations in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel for small and intermediate-sized packages, e.g, \"Serv size\" for \"Serving Size\" and \"Servings\" for \"Servings Per Container.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B)\n53. Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

Are there special requirements that I must follow for the labeling of dietary supplements for children? Yes. On products for children less than 2 years of age, other than infant formula, you must not declare calories from fat, calories from saturated fat, saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and cholesterol. Also, on products for children less than 4 years of age, you may not include % DVs for total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, vitamin K, selenium, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, or potassium.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:17]\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV. Nutrition Labeling \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.2228356897830963", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What are intermediate-sized packages?\n--------------------\nContext: Figure 8: Tabular Display\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:28]\n\n11.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe third modification is the use of abbreviations, as listed in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B). We now allow for the following additional abbreviations on labels for small and intermediate-sized packages: \"vitamin\" may be abbreviated as \"Vit.,\" \"potassium\" may be abbreviated as \"Potas.,\" and \"Includes\" may be abbreviated as \"Incl.\" These abbreviations will further conserve label space. In addition, we allow the abbreviations of \"Total carb.\" and \"Incl.\" to be used on dual-column display labels (see section VIII.D).\n\n3.3 What Type Size Must be Used for the Declaration of Calories on the Tabular or Linear Displays for Small or Intermediate-Sized Packages?\n\nThe numeric value for \"Calories\" must be in a type size no smaller than 14 point, and the word \"Calories\" must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n3.4 How Do the Declarations of Serving Size and Servings Per Container on the Tabular or Linear Displays for Small or Intermediate-Sized Packages Differ from the Standard Label Version?\n\nThe \" -- servings per container\" declaration immediately follows the \"Nutrition Facts\" heading, as in the standard label version; however, it must be in a type size no smaller than 9 point on the tabular or linear display for small packages (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i)). If a linear display is used, then the actual number of servings (i.e., \"Servings\" as shown in Fig 10) may be listed instead of the servings per container declaration.\n\nThe declaration of \"Serving size,\" which follows below the \" -- servings per container\" or \"servings\" declaration, is to be highlighted in bold or extra bold and in a type size no smaller than 9 point on the tabular or linear display for small or intermediate-sized packages. See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n11.3.5 Is the \"% Daily Value*\" Footnote Required on Foods in Small and Intermediate-Sized Packages?\n\nFor products in small and intermediate-sized packages that qualify for the use of the tabular or linear format as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) and (2), there is no longer a requirement to place an asterisk, followed by the statement \"Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet,\" at the bottom of the label if the footnote corresponding to \"% Daily Value\" is omitted. If \"Daily Value\" is not spelled out in the heading, then an asterisk can be placed at the bottom of the label followed by the statement \"% DV = % Daily Value\" in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). See Figures 9 and 10.\n\n3.6 VIII.D How Do I Comply with the Nutrition Labeling Formatting Requirements when Dual Column Labeling is Required or Provided Voluntarily?\n\nDual column labeling is required under certain conditions, and can be used in other situations. In the Federal Register of March 2, 2018 (83 FR 9003), we announced the availability of a separate Small Entity Compliance Guide entitled \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That CanReasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments: Guidance for Industry,\" which, among other topics, discusses a new requirement regarding the use of dual-column labeling (Ref. [9]). In the Federal Register of December 31, 2019 (84 FR 72230), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Sizes-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics.\" This final guidance also discusses formatting issues for dual-column labeling (Ref. [10]).\n\nRegarding specific formatting for dual column labeling, the final rule updates certain requirements. Directly following the serving size declarations, each column of nutrition information must contain a heading that accurately describes why a dual column is being utilized. For example, a product may provide nutrition information for two different RDI groups, like in Figure 11 below. A product may also provide nutrition information for two different forms of the same food (e.g., \"Per 1/4 cup mix\" and \"Per prepared portion\"), as in Figure 12 below (21 CFR 101.9(e)). The quantitative information by weight and percent DV must be presented for each column, and the columns are to be separated by vertical lines (21 CFR 101.9(e)(3)). Nutrient information for vitamins and minerals must be separated from the information on other nutrients by a bar and be arrayed vertically in the required order (21 CFR 101.9(e)(4)). Note that the \"Amount per serving\" statement is not required for the dual column formats (21 CFR 101.9(d)(4)). See Figures 11 through 15 (see also 21 CFR 101.9(e)(5) and (e)(6)(i)).\n\nFigure 11: Dual Column Display for 2 different RDI Groups (101.9(e)(5))\n\nFigure 12: Dual Columns, Two Forms of the Same Food (101.9(e)(5))\n\nFigure 13: Dual Column Display, Per Serving and Per Container (101.9(e)(6)(i))\n\nFigure 15 shows the use of dual columns in a tabular display format for products. As mentioned above, \"Calories\" must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point, and the numeric amount for \"Calories\" must be in a type size no smaller than 22 point (21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii)). \"Serving size\" declaration must be in a type size no smaller than 9 point; however, the \" - servings per container\" declaration must be in a type size no smaller than 10 point, as with the standard label version (21 CFR 101.9(d)(3)(i) and (ii)). \"Amount per serving\" is not required (21 CFR 101.9(d)(4)).\n\nVIIILE When Can the Simplified Format Be Used?\n\nYou can use the simplified format when a food product contains insignificant amounts of eight or more of the following: Calories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium (21 CFR 101.9(f)). For foods intended for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age, you can use the simplified format when a food product contains insignificant amounts of six or more of the following: Calories, total fat, sodium, total\n\nFigure 14: Dual Column Display, Per Serving and Per Unit (101.9(e)(6)(i))\n\nFigure 15: Tabular Dual Column Display (101.9(e)(6)(ii))\n\ncarbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, or potassium (21 CFR 101.9(f)). The definition of \"insignificant amount\" has not changed.\n\nThe footnote requirement which states, \"Not a significant source of (\\underline{\\ })\" (listing the name(s) of any nutrients listed in this paragraph that are present in insignificant amounts) still exists (21 CFR 101.9(f)(4)). While the full \"% Daily Value\" footnote (see 21 CFR 101.9(d)(9)) is not required for the simplified format, the column header \"% Daily Value\" can be abbreviated as \"% DV.\" If this abbreviation is used, then an asterisk must be placed at the end of the abbreviation and the corresponding footnote must read, \"% DV = % Daily Value\" (21 CFR 101.9(f)(5)). No footnote is required if \"Daily Value\" is spelled out in the column header (21 CFR 101.9(f)(5)). Figure 16 displays an example of a simplified format label.\n\nVIIILF Are Foods in Small Packages with a Total Surface Area Available to Bear Labeling of Less than 12 Square Inches Exempt from the Nutrition Facts Labeling Requirements?\n\nNot always. Foods in small packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches are not exempt from bearing a Nutrition Facts label if a nutrition claim or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising (21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)) is used or as outlined for covered vending machine food (see 21 CFR 101.8(c)). However, as previously allowed, if your product qualifies for and uses the exemption (i.e., claims or other nutrition information are not presented on the label or in labeling or advertising), then you must list an address or telephone number that a consumer can use to obtain the required nutrition information (21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)(A)).\n\nVIIILG How Do These New Formatting Rules Affect the Percentage Juice Declaration?\n\nFigure 16: Simplified Format Label (101.9(f))\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWith the changes to some type size requirements on the Nutrition Facts label, it is permissible if the percentage juice declaration for foods purporting to be beverages that contain fruit or vegetable juice is smaller in height than the declaration of \"Serving size,\" \"Calories,\" and the numerical value for \"Calories,\" in addition to already being permitted to be smaller in height than the brand name, product name, logo, universal product code, and \"Nutrition Facts\" heading (21 CFR 101.30(e)(2)).\n\n4.2.3 VIII.H Are There Specific Formatting Requirements for Supplement Facts Labels?\n\nInformation other than the title, headings, and footnotes must be in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Column headings (e.g., \"Amount Per Serving\" and \"% Daily Value\") and footnotes (e.g., \"Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet\") must be in a type size no smaller than 6 point (21 CFR 101.36(e)). Because many dietary supplement products may contribute a negligible amount of calories, we do not require information about calories to be displayed in a larger type size or highlighted on Supplement Facts labels (81 FR 33742 at 33939).\n\nFor small packages which have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, all information within the nutrition label must be in type size no smaller than 4.5 point (21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(i)).\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.873632550239563", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What are intermediate-sized packages?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFood Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments: Guidance for Industry Small Entity Compliance Guide\n\nAdditional copies are available from: Office of Nutrition and Food Labeling Nutrition Programs Staff, HFS-830 Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Food and Drug Administration 5001 Campus Drive College Park, MD 20740 (Tel) 240-402-1450 http://www.fda.gov/FoodGuidances\n\nYou may submit electronic or written comments regarding this guidance at any time.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the\n\npublic. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable\n\nstatutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible\n\nfor this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016 (81 FR 34000), we published a final rule pertaining to serving sizes for food. The final rule amends the definition of a single-serving container,\n\nrequires dual-column labeling for certain containers, updates the tables of Reference Amounts\n\nCustomarily Consumed (reference amounts, or RACCs), and amends the serving size for breath mints. The rule became effective on July 26, 2016. We have prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28). This guidance document restates in plain language the legal requirements set forth in the rule, and is intended to help small entities comply with the rule established in 21 CFR 101.9 and 101.12.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in our guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nIn the remainder of this guidance, \"you\" and \"I\" refer to food manufacturers that are subject to the rule. Many answers in this guidance are followed by citations to show where a specific requirement can be found in either the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) or Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nII Who Is Subject to the Rule?\n\nDoes the Rule Apply to Food Manufacturers?\n\nYou are subject to the rule if you manufacture food that is subject to our nutrition labeling requirements.\n\nHow Does FDA Define \"Serving Size\"?\n\nA serving size is the amount of food customarily consumed (i.e., typically eaten) in one sitting for that food (section 403(q)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act).\n\nServing sizes are determined from the RACCs established in 21 CFR 101.12(b) and the procedures described in 21 CFR 101.9(b). A serving size should be written in a common household measure (e.g., cup, tablespoon, piece, slice, fraction (e.g., 1/4 pizza), ounce (oz), fluid ounce (fl oz), or other common household equipment used to package food products (e.g., jar, tray)) as defined under 21 CFR 101.9(b)(5).\n\nHow Does the Rule Define Single-Serving Container?\n\nA single-serving container is a product that is packaged and sold individually and contains less than 200 percent of the applicable reference amount for that product (21 CFR 101.9(b)(6)). The entire content of a single-serving container must be labeled as one serving (21 CFR 101.9(b)(6)). The final rule removed a preexisting exception from this labeling requirement that applied to certain products for which the RACC was 100 g or mL or larger. Under the final rule, regardless of the size of the RACC, all products that are packaged and sold individually and contain less than 200 percent of the applicable reference amount for that product must be labeled as a single-serving container (21 CFR 101.9(b)(6)). However, if the product is more than 150 percent and less than 200 percent of the applicable RACC, the manufacturer may voluntarily provide an additional on the Nutrition Facts label, to the left of the column that provides nutrition information per container (i.e., per serving). The voluntary column would list the quantitative amounts and the percent Daily Value (DV) per common household measure that most closely approximates the RACC (21 CFR 101.9(b)(6)).\n\nWhat Are the Requirements for Dual-Column Labeling?\n\nFDA regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(a)(1), require that the labeling of packaged foods provide certain nutrition information in a specified format (i.e., the Nutrition Facts label). While most packaged foods provided a single column of nutrition information under preexisting regulations, the final rule requires that a second column of nutrition information be placed on products that are packaged and sold individually and that contain at least 200 percent and up to and including 300 percent of the applicable reference amount for that product, unless an exemption applies (21 CFR 101.9(b)(12)(i)). The second column is part of the Nutrition Facts label and must list the nutrition information for the entire package (21 CFR 101.9(b)(12)(i)). The first nutrition column must list the nutrition information per serving (21 CFR 101.9(b)(12)(i)). See Figure 1. Unless an exemption applies, dual-column labeling requirements also apply for products in discrete units--regardless of whether they are packaged and sold individually--where the discrete unit contains at least 200 percent and up to and including 300 percent of the reference amount (21 CFR 101.9(b)(2)(i)(D)). For these products, the second column that is part of the Nutrition Facts label must list the nutrition information for the discrete unit (21 CFR 101.9(b)(2)(i)(D)).\n\nWhat Products Are Not Required to Provide Dual-Column Labeling?\n--------------------\nContext title: Food Labeling- Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.053055763244629", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What are intermediate-sized packages?\n--------------------\nContext: Products in the general food supply that contain insignificant amounts of eight or more of calories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium are eligible to provide a simplified declaration of nutrition information (21 CFR 101.9(f)). Products that qualify for the simplified declaration that bear nutrition claims are required to bear the statement \"Not a significant source of ____\" (with the blank filled in with the name(s) of any nutrient(s) identified in 21 CFR 101.9(f) that are present in insignificant amounts) and included at the bottom of the nutrition label). However, some products are sold in small packages (e.g., certain sugar-free chewing gums) for which the package size may render it impracticable for the label to display a substantial amount of information. Under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9), when \"circumstance[s] make it impracticable for firms to comply\" with Nutrition Facts labeling requirements, \"FDA may permit alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions to deal with the situation.\"\n\nGiven the small package size of certain products and the potentially long statement that would be required if the label had to identify each nutrient that is present in insignificant amounts (see 21 CFR 101.9(f)), we consider 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9) to permit an alternative means of compliance with respect to the nutrition labeling for certain products sold in small packages for which the addition of such statement would be impracticable. In lieu of providing the \"Not a significant source of ____\" statement as required in 21 CFR 101.9(f)(4), we recommend that the label for such packages bear a statement such as \"Not a significant source of other nutrients\" at the bottom of the simplified Nutrition Facts label on such products sold in small packages.\n\nWhat are the requirements relating to multiunit retail food packages?\n\nWe recognize that many retail food products contain multiple, individually packaged items within the larger container (i.e., multiunit retail food packages). FDA's labeling requirements provide flexibility for such products, and manufacturers of such products generally have two options. The individual units within the multiunit retail food packages may be \"packaged and sold individually,\" meaning that each individually packaged item bears a Nutrition Facts label (81 FR 34000 at 34005). Note that, when individual units are packaged and sold individually, the Nutrition Facts label must still be visible at point of sale (see 21 CFR 101.9(h)). FDA regulations provide different requirements for unit containers in a multiunit retail food package when the individual unit containers are securely enclosed within and not intended to be separated from the retail package under conditions of retail sale and each unit container is labeled with the statement \"This Unit Not Labeled For Retail Sale\" or \"This Unit Not Labeled for Individual Sale\" in type size not less than 1/16-inch in height, except that this statement shall not be required when the inner unit containers bear no labeling at all (see 21 CFR 101.9(j)(15)(iii)). When this option is used, the multiunit retail food package must bear nutrition information in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9.\n\nCan Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels be placed on the bottom of a food package?\n\nGenerally not. The bottom of the package (such as the bottom of boxes, cans, and bottles, which generally cannot be viewed by the consumer at the point of sale) is not a permissible location for a Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels, unless it is visible during normal retail display and consumer handling (as with some frozen food packages or containers of mints and gum). The Nutrition Facts or Supplement Facts labels must be placed either on the principal display panel or on the information panel (21 CFR 101.2(b)). The \"principal display panel\" means the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale (21 CFR 101.1). The \"information panel\" means the part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the principal display panel as observed by an individual facing the principal display panel, subject to a few exceptions (see 21 CFR 101.2(a)).\n\nWill the increase in RACCs for certain beverages, combined with recent changes to daily values (DVs) and the mandatory declaration of potassium--as updated in the Nutrition Facts label final rule--require products such as coffee, tea, and bottled water to bear mandatory nutrition labeling when such products were previously exempt under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(4)?\n\nNo. As explained in the serving size final rule, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to mandatory nutrition labeling on any products currently on the market, or that come on the market in the future, that would have been exempt under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(4) before the effective date of the serving size final rule, until such time as we have the opportunity to consider this issue in a future rulemaking (81 FR 34000 at 34026-34027). Examples of such products include coffee beans (whole or ground), tea leaves, commitment-type dehydrated vegetables, flavor extracts, food colors, and certain bottled water products.\n\nDoes FDA have recommendations or requirements relating to how nutrition information should be formatted if I use the tabular display for small packages as provided in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)? Specifically, are there limitations on the number of columns I can use in the tabular display?\n\nManufacturers using the tabular display must comply with all applicable requirements in 21 CFR 101.9. With respect to specific requirements that could impact the display of nutrition information using the tabular format, we note that 21 CFR 101.9 includes requirements for which nutrients must be indented under other nutrients (e.g., under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)(A), \"Soluble fiber content shall be indented under dietary fiber\"). Attempting to divide the required nutrition information into more than two columns could result in a violation of such formatting requirements. We recommend that manufacturers follow the sample tabular display for small packages provided in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii), which uses two columns of nutrition information.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion, Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed, Serving Size-Related Issues, Dual-Column Labeling, and Miscellaneous Topics \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.8105692863464355"], "Taking into account the content of S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section 3.5 of ICH S9 states that data to support a rationale for the combination should be provided prior to starting the clinical study.

(3.6)\n--------------------\nContext: If a product already has been shown to be safe and effective as part of a combination treatment regimen for a given type of cancer, then a single, adequate and well-controlled study providing evidence of safety and effectiveness when the product is administered as part of a different combination or as monotherapy in the same clinical setting may be sufficient to support the addition of a new combination regimen or a new monotherapy dosing regimen to product labeling.\n\nSimilarly, if a product already has been shown to be safe and effective when administered alone in the treatment of a given type of cancer, then a single, adequate and well-controlled study controlled study providing evidence of safety and effectiveness of the product when administered together with other products that have established safety and effectiveness in treatment of that condition may be sufficient to support the addition of the new combination dosing regimen to product labeling.\n\nIf the safety/toxicity profile of a product has been well established in prior studies, the safety data needed to support additional clinical indications for the product may be limited, provided that there are no significant changes in the product's dosing regimen, in concurrent therapies, or in the patient populations to be treated that would require additional safety data.\n\nDepending on the data previously submitted to FDA in prior marketing applications and on the degree of similarity between the patient populations evaluated in prior applications and the patient populations included in the proposed new uses for the product (including use of concomitant medications), applications for new uses of a product often do not require additional data concerning pharmacokinetics (PK); concomitant medications and possible drug-drug interactions; or evaluation of product safety as a function of age, gender, race, or co-existing diseases.\n\nAll of these examples are intended to illustrate in a general way the quantity and types of data that should be provided to support typical labeling changes. However, the specific data needs may vary substantially from case to case, depending on what is already known about the product and the specific cancer indications under study. Sponsors are strongly encouraged to consult with the Agency for specific advice on the design of research programs intended to support new product labeling before proceeding with such programs.\n\nAppendix B Alternative Sources of Clinical Study Data\n\nAlthough clinical studies conducted by pharmaceutical companies generally are carefully monitored, are subjected to quality control audits, and can achieve very high quality, alternative approaches, such as those described below, also may provide reliable data to support the effectiveness and safety of a product in cancer treatment. For example, most of the data pertaining to the adjuvant therapy of breast and bowel cancers have come from studies that were performed independently of pharmaceutical companies (see Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products). Listed below are some examples of alternative approaches to data gathering.\n\nData, including individual patient data, study reports, and statistical analyses may be obtained from experienced, independent cancer clinical trials organizations that have well-established and publicly available procedures for research data management, monitoring, and auditing, and a track record of high-quality research (e.g., U.S. National Cancer Institute-sponsored cooperative cancer research groups or other highly credible organizations that have no commercial interest in study outcomes). Such data can be submitted to FDA without additional data collection, auditing, or analyses by a pharmaceutical company submitting a supplemental marketing application as long as (1) the clinical trials organization can provide the data necessary for FDA to examine and verify the data and analyses that support all major study findings (e.g., stratification and randomization data, and tumor measurements in studies that use objective response rate as a primary efficacy variable) and (2) the clinical trials organization is willing to work with FDA to resolve any issues that may arise during FDA review.\n\nAlthough these organizations usually do not carry out the monthly on-site monitoring that is often performed in company-sponsored studies, they do have established audit procedures. FDA has had extensive experience in the review of data and analyses from such independent organizations during the past several years and has found the data and the analyses generally to be highly credible and reliable.\n\nIn situations where several reports of controlled studies from multiple centers, published in adequate detail in peer-reviewed journals, provide consistent support for the effectiveness and safety of a product in a cancer indication, such reports may form the primary basis for establishing the safety and effectiveness of a product in a cancer indication. The centers and investigators generating these data should have substantial experience in clinical cancer investigations and no commercial interest in the study outcomes.\n\nIn most cases, unless numerous published confirmatory reports are available, such literature reports should be supplemented by selected additional information (e.g., copies of study protocols, computer databases giving relevant baseline and outcome information, and/or case records of individual patients reported as having critical efficacy or safety findings). These types of additional information are often readily obtainable for recently conducted studies and may substantially enhance the usefulness of a study in supporting product labeling. A single published report supplemented by such additional information may be persuasive.\n\nThe general request for this additional information is based on prior experiences where, following review of study records, FDA has sometimes been unable to confirm major findings of published studies (including multicenter studies published in high-quality, peer-reviewed journals).\n\nFDA initiatives to encourage supplemental application submissions for products used in cancer treatment\n\nTreatment of many forms of cancer is in continuous and sometimes rapid evolution due to the efforts of many researchers in private, academic, and government sectors. After a product receives initial marketing approval, it will be used in a variety of settings, especially where available treatments prove unsatisfactory. Product labeling, therefore, may not include the very latest information about promising new uses for products. In many cases, early promise is not borne out by subsequent definitive studies. It is important, however, for the labeling of products used in cancer treatment to include information on all scientifically proven uses. FDA has made a number of efforts to enhance the quality of labeling for products currently approved for use in cancer treatment. Consistent with the Modernization Act, additional efforts are planned:\n\nA. Encourage Recommendations to the Agency\n\nFDA will consider recommendations from any source regarding promising new cancer treatment indications for currently marketed products that should be examined for possible inclusion in labeling. Recommendations for new uses for drugs or biologics, respectively, can be submitted to:\n\nDivision of Oncology Drug Products (HFD-150)\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research, FDA\n\n5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857\n\nor\n\nOncology Branch, Division of Clinical Trials Design and Analysis (HFM-573)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research, FDA\n\n1401 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852.\n\nB. Provide Community Outreach\n\nIn the past, FDA has surveyed private, academic, and professional groups involved in cancer research and treatment for their views regarding appropriate uses of products in cancer treatment not described in current product labeling. Where appropriate, FDA has met with commercial sponsors of marketed products and has encouraged the submission of supplemental marketing applications.\n\nAs specified in the Modernization Act, FDA will continue its outreach efforts to survey major groups in the cancer research and treatment community (including professional societies, cancer patient and research advocacy organizations, other government agencies, and other interested groups and individuals) for their views regarding new cancer treatment indications that should be examined for possible inclusion in labeling for currently marketed products. These groups and individuals will be asked to identify published and unpublished studies that may support a supplemental application. They will be asked to collaborate with FDA to encourage sponsors (1) to prepare supplemental applications in cases where definitive studies have been completed or [2] to conduct further research that may be needed to provide support for a supplemental application that is suggested by preliminary research findings.\n\nThe Agency will contact the commercial sponsor(s) of a promising product and encourage the sponsor(s) to evaluate the available data and, if the data appear adequate, to submit a supplemental marketing application.\n\nHelp Identify Promising New Uses\n\nFDA will institute a program to encourage Agency professional staff to review regularly the labeling of each product used in cancer treatment with the goal of identifying uses or dosing regimens that appear to be well supported by the results of clinical studies, but are not yet included in labeling. Although the magnitude of this effort will depend on workload and availability of staff, FDA will endeavor to conduct such reviews of labeling of 10 to 20 percent of marketed cancer treatment products each year.\n\nSupport Sponsors in Application Development\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Approval of New Cancer Treatment Uses for Marketed Drug and Biological Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.29395049810409546", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section 3.5 of ICH S9 states that data to support a rationale for the combination should be provided prior to starting the clinical study.

Detailed discussion of experimental design (i.e., choice of species, dose and dosing frequency justifications, etc.) is outside the scope of this guidance. However, dosages should be appropriate to address any identified cause for concern or to provide exposure margins that are clinically relevant (e.g., when conducting a study with two early stage agents). & Because of the potential complexity of performing and interpreting a combination toxicity study with more than two entities, it is generally more practical for initial studies to evaluate combinations of no more than two entities.

(3.6)\n--------------------\nContext: V Clinical Codevelopment\n\nThis section provides a general roadmap and guiding principles for concurrent clinical development of two or more new investigational drugs to be used in combination. It includes recommendations for characterizing the clinical safety and effectiveness of the combination and, to the extent needed or possible, the individual drugs in the combination.\n\nNote: The appropriate review division should be consulted on the specifics of a given clinical development program.\n\nEarly Human Studies (Phase 1)\n\nThe main objectives of early studies in humans are to characterize the safety and pharmacokinetics of both the individual new investigational drugs and the combination and to provide data to support appropriate dosing for the combination in phase 2 testing.\n\nv.1.1 Safety of the Individual New Investigational Drugs\n\nWhenever possible, the safety profile of each individual new investigational drug should be characterized in phase 1 studies in the same manner as would be done for the development of a single drug, including determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the nature of the dose limiting toxicity (DLT), and pharmacokinetic parameters. If there is a useful measure (e.g., biomarker) of pharmacologic activity, it will also be important to determine dose-response for that measure. If testing in healthy volunteers is not possible (e.g., if nonclinical data suggest a drug may be genotoxic or otherwise unacceptable for studies in healthy volunteers), the safety profile of the individual drugs should be evaluated in patients with the disease of interest. These safety data will guide decisions in later studies about starting doses, dose escalation increments, and final dose selection.\n\nIf it is not possible to characterize the safety of the individual new investigational drugs in humans (e.g., where drug toxicity prevents use of healthy volunteers and even short duration monotherapy would be unethical in patients with the disease of interest), the sponsor should conduct nonclinical studies of the combination to support initial dosing of the combination in humans. The nonclinical data for the combination should include pharmacokinetic (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and toxicokinetic data and appropriate biomarker/target interaction data, if relevant.\n\nv.1.2 Safety and Dosing of the Combination\n\nFor initial human effectiveness studies of the combination, the combination starting dose, dosing escalation intervals, and doses to be used in dose-response studies should be determined primarily from the phase 1 safety data for the individual new investigational drugs, if available. If phase 1 safety data for the individual drugs are unavailable, nonclinical data for the combination may be needed to determine the initial combination dose in humans (see previous section). Phase 1 safety studies of the combination may also be important in some cases becauseof the potential for additive toxicity. One study design that could be used is sequential testing in which subjects get drug A, then drug B, then A and B together.\n\nClinical Pharmacology\n\nThe sponsor should conduct the same clinical pharmacology studies for each of the individual new investigational drugs in the combination as would be done if the drugs were being developed separately -- including assessment of bioavailability, characterization of pharmacokinetics, and mass balance. Studies to evaluate the effects of intrinsic (such as renal impairment and hepatic impairment) and extrinsic (such as food effect and drug interactions) factors on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and exposure-response could be conducted either with the individual drugs or the combination. The role of pharmacogenomics should be investigated and incorporated into the combination drug development plan to identify potential sources of pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic variability.\n\nThe evaluation of drug interaction potential should follow the same sequence as is used in other development programs; results of in vitro drug metabolism and drug transporter studies would inform the need for in vivo drug interaction studies.\n\nIf feasible, dose-response should be evaluated for each individual new investigational drug in the combination. The results of such studies should be used to determine doses at which to further explore the combination. If the individual new investigational drugs cannot be administered alone, various doses of each drug administered in combination should be assessed. If one drug has no activity or minimal activity when used alone, dose-response should be assessed when the individual drugs are administered in combination using a number of different doses of both the active drug and the inactive drug. A similar approach should be used to evaluate dose-response where each drug in the combination has minimal activity when used alone.\n\nResponse should also be evaluated with respect to systemic drug concentration to provide insight into efficacy and safety as a function of drug exposure. Concentration-response assessments should be done in phase 2 and phase 3 trials. In phase 3 trials, use of more than one dose of each of the drugs in the combination should be considered to increase exposure ranges and further assess dose-response.\n\nProof of Concept Studies (Phase 2)\n\nIn general, phase 2 testing should accomplish the following for a given combination:\n\nFurther demonstrate the contribution of each individual new investigational drug in the combination to the extent possible and needed (i.e., to the extent not sufficiently established by existing data);\n\nProvide evidence of the effectiveness of the combination; and\n\nOptimize the dose or doses of the combination for phase 3 trials.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe amount and types of clinical data needed and appropriate study designs will vary depending on the nature of the combination being developed, the disease or condition the combination is intended to treat, and other factors. A factorial study designed to assess the effects attributable to each drug in the combination is generally the preferred design to support combination use. However, there may be circumstances in which it would be inappropriate to use one or more of the drugs in the combination as monotherapy in studies of the disease or condition of interest, or it would only be possible to administer the individual drugs in the combination as monotherapy for short durations. In these circumstances, a factorial design will have limited utility.\n\nThe following scenarios illustrate possible phase 2 study designs for combinations of two new investigational drugs in different situations. Scenario 1 includes a discussion of a standard factorial design as well as an adaptive factorial design that could be used if there is uncertainty about using the individual drugs as monotherapy. Scenario 2 describes an alternative design that may be useful when the drugs in the combination cannot be administered as monotherapy. Scenario 3 describes a design that might be used when one drug in the combination has minimal or no activity and is intended primarily to enhance the activity of the other drug.\n\nScenario 1: Each new investigational drug alone has activity and they can be administered separately\n\nIf in vitro studies, in vivo animal models, or phase 1 or other early clinical studies indicate that each new investigational drug has some activity, but the combination appears to have greater activity, and rapid development of resistance is not a concern, a four-arm, phase 2 trial in the disease or condition of interest comparing the combination to each drug alone and to placebo or standard of care (SOC) (AB v. A v. B v. SOC or placebo8) should be used to demonstrate the contribution of the individual drugs to the combination and proof of concept. If SOC is a known effective therapy (not solely palliative), a study design in which each of the arms is added to SOC could be used (AB + SOC v. A + SOC v. B + SOC v. placebo + SOC).\n\nFootnote 8: Note that in this scenario the placebo arm is intended to show the effect size compared to no treatment, not to show the contribution of each drug.\n\nAn adaptive trial design9 with the same four treatment arms might also be used where appropriate, initially using the treatment arms described above and terminating the single-drug arms early if it becomes clear that the single agents have much less activity than the combination. Such a design may demonstrate the contribution of each drug to the activity of the combination without exposing the large number of patients typically required for phase 3 trials to therapeutic products with inadequate activity. When determining whether to terminate monotherapy treatment arms early, it may be necessary to use endpoints that provide evidence of treatment effect more readily than endpoints that would be used in confirmatory phase 3 trials to minimize the amount of time subjects may be exposed to a low activity drug. For example, it may be preferable to use viralload, response rate, or a persuasive pharmacodynamic or other biomarker rather than survival or cure rate.\n\nScenario 2: The individual new investigational drugs in the combination cannot be administered separately\n--------------------\nContext title: Codevelopment of Two or More New Investigational Drugs for Use in Combination \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.1825979948043823", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section 3.5 of ICH S9 states that data to support a rationale for the combination should be provided prior to starting the clinical study.

In the refractory cancer setting, for example, where therapies with meaningful benefit are unavailable, nonrandomized studies showing that a new treatment provides a significant objective response rate with tolerable treatment toxicity may be adequate to support approval under the accelerated approval regulations. In this setting, objective response rates are considered a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit; evidence to confirm that clinical benefit can be obtained after approval. In those cases where durable complete responses can be attained, nonrandomized studies showing a significant rate of durable complete responses can be persuasive evidence of effectiveness (not requiring further confirmation).\n\nIn cases where an existing therapy offers benefit, partial response rate alone would not usually be a basis for approval. In such cases, concurrently controlled randomized studies with clinical endpoints (e.g., survival and/or symptomatic benefit) would generally be needed.\n\nIn the adjuvant setting, where all known tumor has been effectively treated (e.g., by surgical removal) and many or most patients may enjoy long-term survival without a recurrence even if they receive no further therapy, risks of serious treatment toxicities are much less acceptable and relatively large randomized studies are typically necessary to assess the benefits and risks of a new treatment.\n\nAs indicated in Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products, the additional clinical data needed to support a new use of an already-marketed product may be less extensive than the clinical data needed for an initial approval (which would generally consist of independent substantiation of a finding in more than one controlled trial), since existing controlled trial data may provide significant support for the new use. Listed below are examples illustrating the types and quantity of clinical data that may be adequate to establish the effectiveness and safety of a product in a new cancer indication.3\n\nFootnote 3: In each example, it is assumed that clinical trials are adequately designed and well conducted, that trial outcomes are favorable, and that data from other studies do not contradict the observed favorable results. In some settings, trials that do not include a concurrent, randomized control group may still be adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, with external groups serving as control. Conversely, clinical trials that include a concurrent control group may not always constitute adequate and well-controlled trials (e.g., if there are serious deficiencies in the design or conduct of a study or the selected control group is not appropriate).\n\nFootnote 4: In this document approval may indicate either conventional approval or accelerated approval, depending on the specific cancer indication under study, study endpoints, and the details of the study findings.\n\nIf a product already has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of patients with a given type of cancer, a single, adequate and well-controlled, multicenter study demonstrating acceptable safety and effectiveness in another form of cancer that is known to have a generally similar pattern of responsiveness to chemotherapy may support labeling for that additional form of cancer. For example, if a product is currently approved for use in the treatment of advanced squamous carcinomas of the head and neck and approval is sought for use in treatment of another advanced aerodigestive squamous carcinoma (e.g., squamous lung cancer or esophageal cancer), a single, adequate and well-controlled, multicenter study may be sufficient.4\n\nFootnote 5: This reflects the current FDA CDER/CBER guidance for industry, Content and Format for Pediatric Use Supplements. See also final rule, 59 Federal Register 64240, December 13, 1994.\n\nSimilarly, with an advanced, refractory-stage solid tumor, if a product already has been shown to be safe and effective in treating patients, a single, adequate and well-controlled, multicenter study in patients with another type of advanced, refractory-stage solid tumor (with appropriate endpoints, depending on the benefits that have been demonstrated with other available therapies) may be sufficient to support approval for treating this additional type of refractory-stage solid tumor.\n\nIf a product already has been shown to be safe and effective in treating a given type of cancer in adults, then the additional data needed to establish safety and effectiveness of the product in children with that same type of cancer may be limited. If the effects of the drug and the type of cancer under study appear to be biologically similar in children and adults and the proposed use in children is in a setting where known curative treatments are unavailable, a single study demonstrating the safety of the product in children (typically with pharmacokinetic data that can be compared with pharmacokinetic findings of previous studies in adults and including response rate observations) will usually be sufficient.5 In disease settings where established curative treatments are available for children, however, a randomized, controlled trial of ethically and scientifically appropriate design (with a survival and/or time to progression endpoint, depending on the exact circumstances) would usually be necessary before a new treatment can be labeled for use as an alternative to the established curative treatments.\n\nFor certain products used to ameliorate an adverse effect of a cancer treatment, there is often a concern that the product could also significantly reduce the effectiveness of the treatment. When such a product has been shown to ameliorate adverse treatment effects without significantly compromising the effectiveness of treatment for patients with one specific type of cancer, it would usually be labeled for use only in that type of cancer. Expanded claims for use in other settings would depend on whether there were specific concerns that the product might not alleviate toxicity or might significantly reduce treatment effectiveness in other cancer treatment settings. If there were such concerns, a single, additional, adequate and well-controlled, multicenter study showing that the product can similarly reduce adverse treatment effects in patients with a second type of cancer without significantly reducing the effectiveness of cancer treatment would usually be sufficient to support labeling of the product for use to ameliorate adverse treatment effects in all similar palliative settings. However, it would not support use in settings where treatment is known to be potentially curative or is associated with a substantial survival benefit. In those settings, where preservation of effectiveness is especially important, additional studies to verify preservation of treatment effectiveness would usually be needed.\n\nNew dosing regimens (including changes in the range of doses administered for approved indications and changes in the schedule of administration) can lead to improved effectiveness, tolerance, or convenience. A single, adequate and well-controlled study demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of the product when administered for an approved indication using a different dosing regimen will generally be sufficient to support the addition of the new dosing regimen to product labeling.\n\nIf a product already has been shown to be safe and effective for treatment of patients with a given type of cancer in advanced, refractory stages, support for a claim at an earlier stage of the same type of cancer may be provided by a single, adequate and well-controlled, multicenter study demonstrating effectiveness and safety. For example, for a product that is already approved for use in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer or breast cancer after failure of first-line treatment, a single, randomized, controlled trial of the product in first-line treatment (with a survival endpoint or possibly a carefully assessed time to disease progression endpoint) could be sufficient to support approval for first-line treatment of the same condition.\n\nIf a product already has been shown to be safe and effective as part of a combination treatment regimen for a given type of cancer, then a single, adequate and well-controlled study providing evidence of safety and effectiveness when the product is administered as part of a different combination or as monotherapy in the same clinical setting may be sufficient to support the addition of a new combination regimen or a new monotherapy dosing regimen to product labeling.\n\nSimilarly, if a product already has been shown to be safe and effective when administered alone in the treatment of a given type of cancer, then a single, adequate and well-controlled study controlled study providing evidence of safety and effectiveness of the product when administered together with other products that have established safety and effectiveness in treatment of that condition may be sufficient to support the addition of the new combination dosing regimen to product labeling.\n\nIf the safety/toxicity profile of a product has been well established in prior studies, the safety data needed to support additional clinical indications for the product may be limited, provided that there are no significant changes in the product's dosing regimen, in concurrent therapies, or in the patient populations to be treated that would require additional safety data.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Approval of New Cancer Treatment Uses for Marketed Drug and Biological Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.643904447555542", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section 3.5 of ICH S9 states that data to support a rationale for the combination should be provided prior to starting the clinical study. What are \"data to support a rationale for the combination study\"? (3.6)\n--------------------\nContext: For combinations of an early stage entity(ies) with clinical experience with a late stage entity(ies), for which there is no significant toxicological concern, combination toxicity studies are not recommended to support clinical proof-of-concept studies of up to one months' duration. The clinical study of the combination should not be longer than the clinical experience of the individual entities. Later stage or longer duration clinical studies should be supported by a nonclinical combination toxicity study.\n\nFor combinations of two early stage entities, nonclinical combination toxicity studies are recommended to support clinical trials.\n\nProvided complete nonclinical development programs are being conducted on the individual entities and a nonclinical combination toxicity study is warranted to support combination clinical trials, the duration of the combination study should be equivalent to that of the clinical trial, up to a maximum duration of 90 days. A 90-day combination toxicity study would also support marketing. A combination toxicity study of shorter duration can also support marketing, depending on the duration of the intended clinical use.\n\nThe design of the nonclinical studies recommended to characterize the combination will depend on the pharmacological, toxicological and PK profiles of the individual entities, the treatment indication(s), the intended patient population, and the available clinical data.\n\nCombination nonclinical studies should generally be limited to a single relevant species. If unexpected toxicity is identified, additional testing can be appropriate.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen complete nonclinical development programs are not conducted on the individual entities, then a complete nonclinical toxicology program with the combination only can be appropriate, provided that the individual agents are only intended for use in combination.\n\nCombination genotoxicity, safety pharmacology, or carcinogenicity studies generally are not recommended to support clinical trials or marketing if the individual agents have been tested according to current standards. In those cases where the patient population includes WOCBP and studies with the individual agent(s) have shown findings indicative of embryo-fetal risk, combination studies are not recommended as a potential human developmental hazard has already been identified. If nonclinical embryo-fetal studies have indicated that neither agent poses a potential human developmental risk, combination studies are not recommended unless concerns exist, based on the properties of individual components, that their combination could give rise to a hazard for humans. In circumstances when the individual agents have been tested in embryo-fetal studies but embryo-fetal studies of the drug combination are warranted, the study(ies) of the combination should be available to support the marketing application.\n\nXviii. Continuing efforts to improve harmonization (18)\n\nIt is recognized that significant advances in harmonization of the timing of nonclinical safety studies for the conduct of human clinical trials for pharmaceuticals have already been achieved and are detailed in this guidance. However, differences remain in a few areas. Regulators and industry will continue to consider these differences and work towards further improving the drug development process.\n\nXix Endnotes (19)\n\nNote 1: In this document, exposure generally means group mean AUC. In some circumstances (e.g., if the compound or compound class is known to produce acute functional cardiovascular changes or central nervous system-related clinical signs), it might be appropriate to base the exposure margin on group mean Cmax values rather than AUC.\n\nNote 2: An assessment of male and female fertility by thorough standard histopathological examination on the testis and ovary in a repeated-dose toxicity study (generally rodent) of at least 2-week duration is considered to be as sensitive as fertility studies in detecting toxic effects on male and female reproductive organs (Refs. 3, 15, 16).\n\nNote 3: Highly effective methods of birth control are defined as those, alone or in combination, that result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1 percent per year) when used consistently and correctly. For subjects using a hormonal contraceptive method, information regarding the product under evaluation and its potential effect on the contraceptive should be addressed.\n\nNote 4: A preliminary embryo-fetal study useful for this purpose is one with adequate dose levels; that includes assessment of fetal survival, body weight, and external and visceral examinations; that uses a minimum of six dams per group; and that has dams treated over the period of organogenesis. This preliminary nonclinical study should be conducted under high-quality scientific standards with data collection records readily available or under GLP conditions.\n\nNote 5: The pregnancy rate of women initially attempting to become pregnant is (\\sim)17 percent per menstrual cycle. Pregnancy rates estimated from phase 3 studies conducted in WOCBP were observed to be (<)0.1 percent per menstrual cycle. During these studies, subjects were encouraged to avoid pregnancy and measures were instituted to prevent pregnancy. Survey information from earlier phase 2 studies suggests that the pregnancy rates were lower than in phase 3 studies but the extent of further reduction could not be estimated due to the limited number of women enrolled. Based on the above phase 3 experience, phase 2 trials enrolling 150 WOCBP for 3 months are estimated to result in significantly less than 0.5 pregnancies per pharmaceutical under development.\n\nNote 6: Testing for photocarcinogenicity in rodents using currently available models (e.g., hairless rodent) is not considered useful in support of pharmaceutical development and generally is not recommended. If the phototoxicity assessment suggests a potential photocarcinogenic risk and an appropriate assay becomes available, the study should usually be completed before marketing and the results should be considered in the human risk assessment.\n\nReferences (20)\n\n[1] ICH S6 Safety Studies for Biotechnological Products\n\n[2] ICH E8 General Considerations for Clinical Trials\n\n[3] ICH S5(R2) Detection of Toxicity to Reproduction for Medicinal Products and Toxicity to Male Fertility\n\n[4] ICH S1C(R2) Dose Selection for Carcinogenicity Studies of Pharmaceuticals\n\n[5] ICH S7A Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human Pharmaceuticals\n\n[6] ICH S7B Nonclinical Evaluation of QT Interval Prolongation\n\n[7] ICH S3A Toxicokinetics: The Assessment of Systemic Exposure in Toxicity Studies\n\n[8] National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research.

What are \"data to support a rationale for the combination study\"? (3.6)\n--------------------\nContext: Depending on the duration of the proposed therapy, the FDA recommends that a sponsor conduct a bridging study of up to 90 days with the combination in the most appropriate species. Studies of shorter duration could be appropriate for shorter clinical studies or for nonchronic indications, per ICH M3. There may be cases, however, where studies in a second species may be appropriate. Because the drug ratio may change during drug development, it is important to design the toxicity studies to provide adequate margins of safety for future clinical studies. For combinations, the FDA recommends that the exposure to the drugs/biologics be at ratios that are relevant to the intended clinical use.\n\nSometimes one of the drugs proposed for the combination will be much more toxic in animals than in humans, such that animals cannot tolerate the combination at doses that produce exposure relevant to the anticipated clinical exposure (e.g., some NSAIDs and antibiotics). In those cases, nonclinical studies of the combination could be conducted at a dose giving less exposure than that achieved with the recommended clinical dose of the more toxic drug product, provided that a serious dose-limiting toxicity is achieved in the animals.\n\nReproductive and Developmental Toxicology\n\nEmbryo-fetal development studies on the NME are recommended, as are fertility and other reproduction studies, by the ICH. Studies to evaluate the reproductive toxicity of the combination are not generally needed. Embryo-fetal development studies of the combination should be conducted unless the marketed drug substance or the NME is already known to have significant risk for developmental toxicity (e.g., the marketed drug has been assigned a pregnancy category \"D\" or \"X\"). If combination studies are needed, a single study could be conducted in the most appropriate species, based on what is known about the individual drugs or biologics. If a significant risk is only identified for a particular trimester of pregnancy, such as ACE inhibitors during the third trimester, studies to evaluate the effects of exposure to the NME or the combination during other trimesters may be needed.\n\nAnimal Models of Efficacy\n\nAnimal models of efficacy are not generally needed. However, valuable data may be obtained from studying the combination in appropriate animal models of efficacy, if they are available and considered relevant. For example, there are situations in which one drug has been shown to alter the efficacy of the second drug. This information may be important if one or more of the drugs in the combination is for a serious or life-threatening indication. Identifying such an interaction permits an informed choice of dose of each product in the combination and an optimal schedule for the proposed clinical trial.\n\nFurther Studies\n\nThe FDA recommends that a sponsor address any important data gaps for the marketed product or products that may be relevant for the proposed indication. After evaluating the available data on the individual drug products and the data on the bridging study of up to 90 days on the combination, a determination will be made on whether it is appropriate to conduct additional studies to address potential drug/biologic interactions. If a drug interaction is identified in the bridging study (synergistic effects) and the mechanism (e.g., PK, PD, or overlapping toxicity) is not apparent, then the FDA urges sponsors to consider studies to understand the nature of the interaction. The possible mechanisms of drug interaction listed in section II.A would also apply to combinations of one or more previously marketed drugs/biologics and an NME. Other than the general toxicology bridging study of up to 90 days and studies on embryo-fetal development, additional studies on the combination generally will not be needed.\n\nIV Nonclinical Studies for a Combination of Two or More Drugs or Biologics when All Are New Molecular Entities (FIGURE C)\n\nGeneral Toxicology Studies\n\nThe FDA generally recommends that the sponsor conduct nonclinical studies on each NME to evaluate the safety of a combination of NMEs. Sponsors are encouraged to conduct the standard battery of nonclinical studies (i.e., genetic toxicology, pharmacology, safety pharmacology, PK/ADME, general toxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, carcinogenicity) on each NME, according to the timing as described in ICH M3, and according to ICH S6 for nonclinical development of biologic products. Depending on the duration of the proposed therapy, a bridging study of up to 90 days (for chronic indications) should be conducted with the combination in the most appropriate species if the NMEs were evaluated as separate entities (which is preferred) and not as a combination. There may be cases, however, where studies in a second species may be appropriate. If the two drugs or biologics are proposed to be marketed together only, then it is possible that it may be sufficient to conduct toxicology studies only on the combination. However, nonclinical studies conducted on each NME alone can be invaluable should it become important to alter the clinical regimen from what is initially proposed or studied.\n\nBecause the drug ratio may change during drug development, it is important to design the toxicity studies to provide adequate margins of safety for future clinical studies. The FDA recommends that the drugs or biologics be tested at doses that produce exposure ratios that are relevant (i.e., somewhat similar) to the intended clinical use, when feasible.\n\nSometimes one of the drugs proposed for the combination will be much more toxic in animals than in humans, such that animals cannot tolerate the combination at doses that produce exposure relevant to the anticipated clinical exposure (e.g., some NSAIDs and antibiotics). In those cases, nonclinical studies of the combination might be conducted at a dose giving less exposure than that achieved with the recommended clinical dose of the more toxic drug, provided that a serious dose-limiting toxicity is achieved in the animals at the highest dose.\n\nAppendix B Animal Models of Efficacy\n\nAnimal models of efficacy are not generally needed. However, valuable data may be obtained from studying the combination in appropriate animal models of efficacy, if they are available and considered relevant. For example, there are situations in which one drug has been shown to alter the efficacy of the second drug. This information is especially important if one or more of the drugs or biologics in the combination is for a serious or life-threatening indication. Identifying such an interaction permits an informed choice of dose of each product in the combination and an optimal schedule for the proposed clinical trial.\n\nSafety Pharmacology\n\nThe FDA strongly recommends that sponsors assess the effects of drugs/biologics on a variety of organ systems before dosing in humans. Combination safety pharmacology studies of a particular organ system (e.g., cardiac, respiratory, CNS) may be valuable in many situations, such as when both drugs target the same organ system, a toxicity is associated with a class of compounds (e.g., QT prolongation), or the intended patient population is compromised (e.g., renal impairment). Sometimes when the molecular target is known, effects of the combination can be predicted.\n\nAppendix D PK/ADME and Toxicokinetics\n\nThe FDA recommends that sponsors conduct combination PK/ADME studies to assess the potential for a PK interaction between the drugs/biologics. These data are valuable for supporting the safety profile and guiding the drug/biologic development process. The FDA further recommends that PK/ADME combination studies (e.g., in vitro drug metabolism studies) be conducted early in drug development. The FDA encourages sponsors to evaluate serum protein binding and to monitor plasma concentrations of each drug in the toxicology studies. It may be possible to collect PK data as part of the toxicology studies instead of in a separate study.\n\nGenetic Toxicology\n\nGenetic toxicology studies are not needed for biologic or drug/biologic combinations. Assessing the genotoxic potential of a drug/drug combination is generally not necessary, provided that adequate studies of the individual drug substances have been conducted. For the in vitro assays, genotoxic potential is routinely tested in the absence and presence of metabolic activation. Therefore, testing drugs in combination in these assays would not likely provide additional information to assays testing each drug alone, particularly if any potential interaction is expected to be from effects on hepatic metabolism.\n\nSpecial Toxicology\n\nThe FDA may recommend that a sponsor conduct special toxicology studies, such as local tolerance studies, with the NME as well as with the combination in a particular therapeutic area relevant to the proposed use. The Agency may also recommend that targeted toxicity studies be conducted, depending upon the nature of toxicities seen in animals and humans with the drug products or drug class.\n\nReproductive and Developmental Toxicology\n--------------------\nContext title: Nonclinical Safety Evaluation of Drug or Biologic Combinations \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.3814311027526855"], "After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?\n--------------------\nContext: IV SCOPE OF GUIDANCE\n\nThis guidance is intended to help manufacturers and repackagers understand and satisfy the requirements of section 582(b)(2) and (e)(2) of the FD&C Act, respectively, to affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product that they intend to introduce in a transaction into commerce. The recommendations in this guidance are intended to assist manufacturers and repackagers in developing standardized formats for the human- and machine-readable information that is contained in the product identifier. The requirements set forth in the DSCSA do not change the linear barcode requirements under 21 CFR 201.25.\n\nV Product Identifiers under the DSCSA\n\nAs noted in Section II of this guidance, a product identifier is defined under section 581(14) of the FD&C Act as a standardized graphic that includes the product's standardized numerical identifier (composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number), lot number, and expiration date, in both human- and machine-readable formats. The machine-readable format must be on a data carrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization.10 The product identifier data is specifically required under section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act to be in a \"2-dimensional data matrix barcode\" for packages and in a \"linear or 2-dimensional data matrix barcode\" for homogenous cases, which can be verified using \"human-readable or machine-readable methods.\"11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 581(14) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act. As described in section 582(a)(9)(A), FDA may decide in the future to allow the use of other technologies for data instead of, or in addition to, the 2-dimensional data matrix barcode or linear barcode.\n\nUnder section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act, manufacturers are required to \"affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce\" beginning no later than November 27, 2017. Under section 582(e)(2) of the FD&C Act, repackagers are required to \"affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction in commerce\" beginning no later than November 27, 2018. Therefore, each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce must include the NDC, unique serial number, lot number, and expiration date in both human- and machine-readable formats.\n\nVI Compliance Policy for Product Identifier Requirements\n\nIn the guidance titled \"Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Compliance Policy,\" FDA stated that it did not intend to take enforcement action against manufacturers who did not, prior to November 27, 2018, affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction intocommerce as required by section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.12 As the time frame described in this compliance policy has since ended, it no longer represents the Agency's thinking in terms of enforcement policy.\n\nFootnote 12: See guidance for industry Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy (September 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance web page at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nVII Products that are subject to the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA\n\nThe product identifier requirements of section 582(b)(2)(A) and (e)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act apply to packages and homogenous cases of product intended to be introduced into commerce via a transaction.13 A \"product\" under section 581(13) of the FD&C Act is a \"prescription drug in finished dosage form for administration to a patient without substantial further manufacturing.\"\n\nFootnote 13: There are exemptions to the definition of \u201ctransaction\u201d (see section 581(24)(B) of the FD&C Act).\n\nThe following prescription drug products are excluded from the definition of a \"product\" under the DSCSA, and thus are not subject to the product identifier requirements:14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 581(13) of the FD&C Act, defining \u201cproduct.\u201d\n\nblood or blood components intended for transfusion\n\ncertain radioactive drugs or radioactive biological products15\n\nimaging drugs\n\ncertain intravenous products16\n\nFootnote 15: Radioactive drugs and radioactive biological products excepted from the definition of \u201cproduct\u201d under the DSCSA are defined in 21 CFR 600.3(ee) and regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or by a state, pursuant to an agreement with such Commission under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2021).\n\nhave noted that the following rule is not applicable to the FD&C Act.\n\nhave noted that the following rule is not applicable to the FD&C Act.\n\ndrug compounds compounded in compliance with sections 503A or 503B of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353a or 353b).\n\nVIII Linear Barcode Requirements Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nConsidering the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA, manufacturers and repackagers have asked FDA whether some of their products are still required under 21 CFR 201.25 to include a linear barcode. The linear barcode requirements were established for different purposes than the DSCSA requirements and apply to additional FDA-regulated products and packaging in some instances, and are still in effect. In the Federal Register of February 26, 2004 (69 FR 9120), FDA published a final rule requiring certain human drug and biological product labels to have a linear barcode that contains, at a minimum, the drug's NDC number (SS 201.25).18 Manufacturers, repackers (also known as \"repackagers\"), relabelers, and private label distributors of human prescription drug products, biological products, and over-the-counter (OTC) drug products dispensed pursuant to an order and commonly used in hospitals, are subject to the linear barcode requirement. The linear barcode must appear on the drug's label as defined by section 201(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(k)). FDA has interpreted that requirement to mean the linear barcode should be on the outside container or wrapper, as well as on the immediate container unless the barcode is readily visible and machine-readable through the outside container or wrapper.19\n\nFootnote 18: See 69 FR 9120 at 9140 (Feb. 26, 2004), https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2004-02-26/pdf/04-4249.pdf.\n\nAs stated in the preamble to the final rule:\n\nBar codes can help reduce or detect potential medication errors by enabling health care professionals to check whether they are giving the right drug via the right dose and right route of administration to the right patient at the right time.20\n\nFootnote 20: Id. at 9120.\n\nThe preamble contemplated that linear barcodes, the use of scanning equipment, and computerized databases would be part of a system that could help reduce the number of medication errors that occur in hospitals and other health care settings.21\n\nFootnote 21: Id. at 9120.\n\nManufacturers, repackers, relabelers, and private label distributors of drug products who are subject to the establishment registration and drug listing requirements in section 510 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360) are responsible for placing the appropriate barcode on the product.22 The following prescription drug products, however, are exempted under SS 201.25 from the linear barcode requirements:\n\nFootnote 22: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products.

Product Identifier is defined in section 581(14) and includes the product\u2019s standardized numerical identifier, which is composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number (see section 581(20)).\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(b)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 20: See section 582(b)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nProduct Tracing and Verification\n\nUnder section 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act, trading partners are required to provide the subsequent purchaser with product tracing information22 for each transaction23 involving a DSCSA-covered MMA product. For example, if the manufacturer transfers ownership of a DSCSA-covered MMA product to a wholesale distributor, the wholesale distributor generally shall not accept ownership of a product unless the manufacturer has, prior to or at the time of the transaction, provided the transaction history, transaction information, and a transaction statement for the product.24\n\nFootnote 21: See FDA Guidance for Industry Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (Sept. 2018). This guidance and other guidance documents on the DSCSA are available on FDA\u2019s website at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nFootnote 22: For purposes of this guidance, the term product tracing information refers to the transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statement defined in section 581(26), (25), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nTrading partners also are required to have verification systems in place for the DSCSA-covered MMA products to comply with the requirements under section 582(b)(4), (c)(4), (d)(4), and (e)(4) of the FD&C Act. These requirements include steps to handle suspect and illegitimate product.25\n\nFootnote 23: Suspect product is defined in section 581(21), and illegitimate product is defined in section 581(8), of the FD&C Act.\n\nVIII. Importation of MMA Products\n\nThis section sets forth recommendations intended to assist importers of MMA products by facilitating an efficient and effective admissibility review. Following the procedures in this section will also assist FDA in determining that the importation is authorized and not, for example, a counterfeit.\n\nImportant Entries for MMA Products\n\nTo help FDA verify that a shipment that purports to contain an MMA product is one in which the manufacturer26 has, in fact, authorized the drug to be marketed in the United States and has caused the drug to be labeled to be marketed in the United States, we strongly encourage the filing of an electronic entry in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). If a manufacturer plans to use or authorize another process for making entry of an MMA product other than ACE, such as a paper entry, we strongly encourage the manufacturer to inform FDA in advance. FDA's view is that international mail is not appropriate for the importation of MMA products.\n\nFootnote 26: As noted in footnote 5, above, for purposes of this guidance, the manufacturer is the NDA or BLA holder for the MMA product.\n\nACE is currently the sole Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system authorized by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to process electronic entry and entry summary filings for FDA-regulated products. Submitting complete, accurate information in ACE facilitates effective and efficient admissibility review by FDA. FDA regulations set forth the required data elements that must be submitted in an electronic entry in ACE, or any other EDI system authorized by CBP, for any entry that includes FDA-regulated products (21 CFR Part 1, Subpart D).27\n\nFootnote 27: FDA published its final rule, \u201cSubmission of Food and Drug Administration Import Data in the Automated Commercial Environment,\u201d on November 29, 2016 (81 FR 85854), and the rule was effective December 29, 2016.\n\nAt the time of filing entry in ACE, a filer must submit, among other elements, a Drug Listing Number, which is currently the NDC for drugs, including biological products and combination products, regulated by CDER (21 CFR 1.74). For drugs, biological products and combination products, regulated by CBER, the Drug Listing Number is not required. Although not required, FDA strongly encourages filers to submit the Drug Listing Number for CBER-regulated MMA products in ACE at the time of entry because this information will assist FDA's initial screening and further review of the entry, which can significantly increase the likelihood that the entry line will receive an automated \"May Proceed\" from FDA.\n\nManufacturer Authorization for MMA Products\n\nAs stated above, section 801(d)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act provides that, with limited exceptions:\n\n[N]o drug that is subject to section 503(b)(1) [of the FD&C Act] may be imported into the United States for commercial use if such drug is manufactured outside the United States, unless the manufacturer has authorized the drug to be marketed in the United States and has caused the drug to be labeled to be marketed in the United States.\n\nUnder this provision, any shipment of a purported MMA product that is offered for importation would be subject to refusal unless the manufacturer has authorized the MMA product to be marketed in the United States. It is essential that FDA be provided the information needed to confirm that each shipment of a purported MMA product offered for importation has been authorized for marketing in the United States by the manufacturer. To help ensure that a particular shipment is authorized, and to help mitigate the potential for counterfeiting, the manufacturer should provide information that is sufficient for FDA to verify that each shipmentof an MMA product has, in fact, been authorized by the manufacturer to be marketed in the United States. This information is described in the following paragraph.\n\nFDA strongly encourages manufacturers to submit a report via the Electronic Submissions Gateway (ESG) (or to an alternative transmission point identified by FDA) notifying the Agency of the importation of an MMA product 10 business days in advance of the first import entry of an MMA product covered by the report, which will facilitate FDA's timely admissibility review when the MMA product is offered for import. This report should include: the MMA product name, dosage form, and quantity of the MMA product; the name, address, and telephone number of the authorized importer; and any temporal or other limitations the manufacturer has placed on the authorized importation. For example, a report could authorize multiple shipments of an MMA product for a specified period of time. An updated report should be timely submitted by the manufacturer each time there is a change to the material information in the report; this updated report would be submitted before any additional imports affected by the changes are entered into ACE. Manufacturers who choose to submit this report must do so electronically in Portable Document Format (PDF) using the Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) format and the ESG (or to an alternative transmission point identified by FDA).28 The report should be referenced and placed in Module 1. For further information regarding eCTD, please refer to FDA's website at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/Electr\n\nonicSubmissions/ucm153574.htm.\n\nFootnote 28: FDA Guidance for Industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format \u2014 Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specifications (Jan. 2019).

The provisions implemented by FDA include, but are not limited to, provisions related to adulteration and misbranding, and requirements related to adverse event reporting (or postmarketing safety reporting for combination products under 21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B), recalls, and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAppendix A: Dear Healthcare Provider Letter\n\nDear Healthcare Provider\n\nMonth Year\n\nIMPORTED PRODUCT FOLLOWING PROCEDURES IN: \"Importation of Certain FDA-\n\nApproved Human Prescription Drugs, Including Biological Products, and Combination Products\n\nunder Section 801(d)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act: Guidance for\n\nIndustry\" - MODEL LETTER\n\nSubject: Importation of TRADENAME (nonproprietary name for drugs/proper name for\n\nbiological products) (NDC #1, NDC #2): Availability of an FDA-approved prescription drug/biological product/combination product that was originally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and authorized for sale in that foreign country.\n\nDear Health Care Provider:\n\nThe purpose of this letter is to inform you that TRADENAME (NDC #1, NDC #2), an FDA-\n\napproved prescription drug(s)/biological product(s)/combination product(s) that was/were\n\noriginally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and authorized for sale in that foreign\n\ncountry, will be available in the United States.

Although third-party logistics providers are also considered trading partners under section 581(23)(B) of the FD&C Act, they are not subject to the same product tracing requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nThe Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public Law 113-54) was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier, authorized trading partner, and verification requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers, and dispensersto facilitate the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act is prohibited under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nOne requirement of the verification scheme outlined in the DSCSA is the verification of saleable returned product. Under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act, wholesale distributors must have systems in place that will enable them to verify the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, on each sealed homogeneous case of saleable returned product, or, if such product is not in a sealed homogeneous case, on each package of saleable returned product. A saleable returned product may not be further distributed until the product identifier is verified.13 The product should be handled as suspect product if the product identifier is not successfully verified (i.e., it should be quarantined and investigated).14. 15 FDA published the 2019 Compliance Policy on September 24, 2019, announcing a 1-year delay in enforcement against wholesale distributors who do not verify the product identifier of saleable returned product prior to further distributing such product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 14: See Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs (October 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIn addition, section 582 of the FD&C Act requires certain trading partners (manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers) to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and a transaction statement when engaging in transactions involving certain prescription drugs.16({}^{,})17 A transaction statement must include a statement that the entity transferring ownership in a transaction had systems and processes in place to comply with verification requirements under section 582 of the FD&C Act.18 In the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA acknowledged that wholesale distributors may not have systems in place by November 27, 2019, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, the 2019 Compliance Policy indicated FDA's intent to take no enforcement action prior to November 27, 2020, against a wholesale distributor that provided a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor did not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(c)(4)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act details how wholesale distributors must handle suspect product.\n\nFootnote 17: Transaction, transaction history, transaction information, and transaction statement are defined under sections 581(24), (25), (26), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582 also includes requirements for dispensers to verify product identifiers when investigating suspect or illegitimate product. Specifically, section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act provides that, effective November 27, 2020, dispensers must verify \"the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, of at least 3 packages or 10 percent of such suspect product, whichever is greater, or all packages, if there are fewer than 3, corresponds with the product identifier for such product [in the dispenser's possession or control]\".19 Section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act requires dispensers to verify product as described in 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act when they have received a notification of illegitimate product from FDA or a trading partner.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIII Compliance Policy for Wholesale Distributor Verification of Saleable Returned Product\n\nAfter publishing the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA has received comments and feedback from wholesale distributors, as well as other trading partners and stakeholders, expressing additional concern with industry-wide readiness for implementation of the verification of saleable returned product requirement for wholesale distributors. Stakeholders have explained that the primary factors FDA considered when issuing the 2019 Compliance Policy still exist: (1) the very large volume of saleable returned products requiring verification; (2) the need to refine and test verification systems during actual production using real-time volumes of saleable returned product rather than simply in pilots; and (3) the complexities of building an interoperable, electronic system with the capabilities to timely and efficiently verify the large volume of saleable returned products amid immature technologies.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some wholesale distributors may still need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, when the delay in enforcement set forth in the 2019 Compliance Policy expires, before they can begin verifying returned products prior to resale or other further distribution as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act in an efficient, secure, and timely manner. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against wholesale distributors who do not verify a product identifier prior to resale or other further distribution of a package or sealed homogenous case of product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAdditionally, FDA recognizes that wholesale distributors may still not have systems in place by November 27, 2020, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, prior to November 27, 2023, FDA does not intend to take action against a wholesale distributor for providing a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor does not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.20\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPolicy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (September 2018), addresses such returns.28_\n\nFootnote 28: For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page.\n\nIV Compliance Policy for the Dispenser Verification Requirements\n\nIn the years since the passage of the DSCSA, FDA has received comments and feedback from dispensers expressing concern with readiness for implementation of certain requirements under section 582(d) of the FD&C Act, including the verification requirements addressed in this compliance policy. Specifically, dispensers have described challenges with implementation of these provisions in the DSCSA due to the time necessary to develop technologies and processes that would support a robust verification system.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some dispensers may need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, before they can begin to verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect and illegitimate products as described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect product as required by section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act. In addition, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify, as required by section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act, the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of product that is the subject of an illegitimate product notification by FDA or a trading partner.\n--------------------\nContext title: Wholesale Distributor Verification Requirement for Saleable Returned Drug Product and Dispenser Verification Requirements When Investigating a Suspect or Illegitimate Product\u2014Compliance Policies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.3508355617523193", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?\n--------------------\nContext: Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA)\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nProceduralProduct Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act -\n\nCompliance Policy\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are availablefrom:\n\nOffice of Communications, Division of Drug Information\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10001 New Hampshire Ave., Hillandale Bldg., 4({}^{\\text{th}}) Floor\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 855-543-3784 or 301-796-3400; Fax: 301-431-6353\n\nEmail: druginfo@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/Drug/GuidanceComplianceRegulatorInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nand/or\n\nOffice of Communication, Outreach and Development\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 71, Room 3128\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 800-835-4709 or 240-402-8010\n\nEmail: (ocod)@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatorInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nOffice of Regulatory Affairs (ORA)\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nProcedural\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nI.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes FDA's compliance policy with regard to a requirement related to product identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. Specifically, this guidance addresses the requirement in section 582(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360eee-1(b)(2)) that manufacturers \"affix or imprint a product identifier2 to each package3 and homogenous case4 of a product5 intended to be introduced in a transaction6 into commerce\" beginning not later than November 27, 2017.7\n\nFootnote 2: Product identifier is defined in section 581(14) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee(14)) as a standardized graphic that includes, in both human-readable formand on a machine-readable datacarrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization, the standardized numerical identifier, lot number, and expiration date of the product.\n\nFootnote 3: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 4: Homogeneous case is defined in section 581(7) of the FD&C Act. The terms \u201chomogeneous\u201d and \u201chomogenous\u201d are used interchangeably throughout the DSCSA. FDA has chosen to use only the term \u201chomogenous\u201d throughout this guidance.\n\nFootnote 5: Product is defined in section 581(13) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 6: Transaction is defined in section 581(24) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 7: See section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe compliance policy set forth in this guidance applies only to the requirement regarding product identifiers described above. In brief, FDA does not intend to take action against manufacturers who do not affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product before November 27, 2018. This represents a one year delay in enforcement of the requirement for manufacturers to affix or imprint product identifiers.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances  means that something  is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe Drug Supply  Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public  Law 113-54)  was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier,  authorized trading partner, and verification  requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors,  repackagers, and dispensers  to facilitate  the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution  supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 is prohibited  under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nAn important  requirement of the product tracing scheme outlined  in the DSCSA is the product identifier.  Section 582 requires that each package and homogenous  case of product in the pharmaceutical distribution  supply chain bear a product identifier  in both a human-readable  form and on a machine-readable  data carrier. The product identifier includes  the product's standardized  numerical identifier,8 lot number, and expiration  date. Manufacturers are required  to begin affixing  or imprinting  a product identifier  to each package and homogenous  case of a product intended to be introduced  in a transaction into commerce no later than November 27, 2017. Repackagers are required to do the same no later than November 27, 2018.9\n\nFootnote 8: Standardized numerical identifier is defined in section 581(20) of the FD&C Act as a set of numbers or characters used to uniquely identify each package or homo genus case that is composed of the National Drug Code that corresponds to the specific product (including the particular package configuration) combined with a unique alphanumeric serial number of up to 20 characters.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 582(e)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSince product packaged by a manufacturer during  the one year delay in enforcement of the product identifier requirement is also subject to the policy  set forth in the final guidance Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (grandfathering policy),  trading partners should  read that final  guidance to understand how to treat such product for the purposes of the product identifier  and verification requirements.10\n\nFootnote 10: Final guidance for industry Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier.

For example, although a carton of 10 individual product units may be sold to a dispenser, manufacturers and repackagers may want to apply a product identifier to each of the 10 product units in the carton if it is reasonably foreseeable that a wholesale distributor might sell individual product units to a dispenser. See Section IX.E of this guidance for examples of potential individual saleable units and a discussion of the applicable barcode requirements. Also, see Section IX.C for additional regulatory requirements that may apply when determining whether to affix or imprint a product identifier to a product unit.\n\nDo manufacturer and repackager activities related to affixing or imprinting the product identifier need to comply with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP)?\n\nYes, the CGMP requirements under 21 CFR parts 210 and 211 apply to the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of a drug product, including packaging and labeling operations, testing, and quality control of drugs.\n\nCan manufacturers and repackagers request a waiver, exemption, or exception from the DSCSA requirement to include a product identifier?\n\nYes. FDA has authority under section 582(a)(3) of the FD&C Act to grant a waiver, exception, or exemption for products and transactions from certain requirements in section 582. Manufacturers and repackagers should use the processes set forth in FDA's draft guidance for industry Waivers, Exceptions, and Exemptions from the Requirements of Section 582 of the _Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to make a request.37 This guidance also describes what information should be included with the request.\n\nFootnote 37: Draft guidance for industry Waivers, Exceptions, and Exemptions from the Requirements of Section 582 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (May 2018). When finalized, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nDo the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA apply to prescription drugs marketed without FDA approval?\n\nYes. The DSCSA establishes requirements for \"products,\" which as defined under section 581(13) of the FD&C Act are generally prescription drugs in a finished dosage form for administration to patients without substantial further manufacturing. \"Prescription drugs\" in the DSCSA refer to drugs for human use,38 which meet the requirements of section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)), independent of approval status.\n\nFootnote 38: See section 581(12) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFor prescription drugs that are marketed without FDA approval, is the manufacturer required to submit the product identifier as part of its product labeling during registration and listing?\n\nYes. FDA interprets the definition of \"labeling\" in section 201(m) of the FD&C Act to include the product identifier. Accordingly, as part of registration and listing under 21 CFR part 207, a manufacturer of any prescription drug for commercial distribution39 must submit a copy of all current labeling as specified under SS 207.49(a)(15)(i), independent of approval status.\n\nFootnote 39: Commercial distribution is defined in 21 CFR 207.1.\n\nSubmission of Label Changes Under the DSCSA\n\nHow should manufacturers or repackagers submit a package label change to FDA that is solely for incorporating the product identifier of an already approved prescription drug?40\n\nFootnote 40: For purposes of this guidance, the term drug includes biological drug products that are licensed by CDER and CBER.\n\nApplicants who submit annual reports should be aware of product identifier changes made by manufacturers and repackagers in the supply chain. Under section 582(a)(8) of the FD&C Act, a change made to the drug package label solely to incorporate the product identifier may be submitted in an applicant's annual report41 in accordance with 21 CFR 314.70(d). Under SS 314.70(d), the applicant must document certain changes in the next annual report in accordance with SS 314.81(b)(2).42 Under SS 314.81(b)(2)(i), the annual report must contain a brief summary of significant new information from the previous year that might affect the safety, effectiveness, or labeling of the drug product.\n\nFootnote 41: For purposes of this guidance, the term establishment, as used in section 582(a)(8) of the FD&C Act, refers to the applicant.\n\nA table of contents may be included in the annual report which indicates the inclusion of the labeling change for incorporating the product identifier on products.\n\nIn certain instances, it may be appropriate to submit a labeling change in a Prior Approval Supplement (PAS) or in a Changes Being Effected supplement instead of in an annual report.43\n\nFootnote 43: For further information, consult the guidance for industry Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA (April 2004).\n\nIs a manufacturer or repackager required to submit to FDA information encoded in the product identifier for each package and homogenous case of product?\n\nIn general, the information encoded in each product identifier for packages and homogenous cases is not required to be submitted to FDA. However, FDA may request information from a manufacturer or repackager in the event of a recall or to investigate a suspect or illegitimate product. In this circumstance, the manufacturer or repackager must provide the applicable transaction information,44 which includes the NDC number and lot number, as well as the transaction history and transaction statement for the product.45\n\nFootnote 44: See section 582(b)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act for manufacturer requirement; section 582(e)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act for repackager requirement.\n\nAlso, FDA may request information from a manufacturer or repackager to verify a product identifier if FDA has made the determination that a suspect product is in the possession or control of such manufacturer or repackager. In this circumstance, the manufacturer or repackager must provide relevant information46 in response that FDA can use to determine whether the product identifier affixed to or imprinted on a package or homogenous case corresponds to the standardized numerical identifier47 or lot number and expiration date assigned to the product by the manufacturer or repackager.\n\nFootnote 45: Transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statement are defined in section 581(26), (25), and (27) of the FD&C Act, respectively.\n\nFootnote 46: See section 582(b)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act for manufacturer requirement; section 582(e)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act for repackager requirement.\n\nCan a manufacturer submit a placeholder when submitting initial or updated product labeling as part of an application or supplemental application (i.e., New Drug Application [NDA], Abbreviated New Drug Application [ANDA], or Biologics License Application [BLA]) to reflect its commitment to affix or imprint the product identifier on its product?\n\nYes. CDER and CBER will accept the submission of a drug product label that contains a placeholder when submitting initial or updated product labeling as part of an application or supplemental application (i.e., NDA, ANDA, or BLA) in lieu of an image of the final product identifier that the manufacturer intends to use at the time of drug manufacturing. The placeholder should be represented on the initial or updated product labeling submission as a blank space with labels to sufficiently describe what information will be placed in that space at the time the product is manufactured (e.g., \"lot number\" and \"expiration date\") (see Question and Answer #4 above for examples of how to label each element of information).\n\nThe Product Identifier Requirement of the DSCSA and the Linear Barcode Requirement Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nIs my product package required to have both a linear barcode and a 2D data matrix barcode?\n\nIt depends. There will be instances when a product package is required to have both a linear barcode, pursuant to SS 201.25, and a 2D data matrix barcode, pursuant to the DSCSA. For a product for which a manufacturer, under the DSCSA, has identified the smallest individual saleable unit intended for ultimate sale to a dispenser--which is a \"package\" under FD&C Act section 581(11)--the package would generally require a 2D data matrix barcode to comply with the DSCSA48 in addition to the requisite linear barcode under SS 201.25. See Section E of this guidance for examples of when a 2D data matrix barcode may not be required.\n\nFootnote 48: See FD&C Act sections 582(b)(2)(A) and 582(a)(9).\n\nWith the enactment of the DSCSA, is the guidance for industry \"Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers\" (August 2011) still applicable for the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25?\n\nYes. The guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers remains applicable to the linear barcode rule under SS 201.25 unless or until such time the guidance is revised, replaced, or withdrawn. This guidance should be consulted for questions specific to the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.49\n\nFootnote 49: See guidance for industry Bar Code Label Requirements Questions and Answers (August 2011), available at https://www.fda.gov/files/vaccines%2C%20blood%20%26%20biologies/published/Guidance-for-Industry\u2013Bar-Code-Label-Requirements.pdf).\n--------------------\nContext title: Product Identifiers under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.3506312072277069", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: After reviewing Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a product identifier under the DSCSA?\n--------------------\nContext: Industry Letter\n\nGuidance for Industry: Letter Regarding Point of Purchase Food Labeling\n\nOCTOBER 2009\n\nFinal\n\nDocket Number:\n\nEDA:2020: D-1921 (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA:2020: D-1921)\n\nIssued by:\n\n(/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-letter-regarding-point-purchase-food-labeling)\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nDear Industry:\n\nPoint of purchase labeling including Front of Package (FOP) labeling is voluntary information that is intended to convey to consumers the nutritional attributes of a food. Point of purchase labeling often includes symbols that are typically linked to a set of nutritional criteria developed by food manufacturers, grocery stores, trade organizations, and health organizations. Two major categories of FOP symbol systems are \"summary\" and \"nutrient-specific\" systems. The summary symbols use logos, numerical scores, or graphic schemes to communicate the overall nutritional quality of a food product to consumers and facilitate comparisons between products based on the food's nutritional quality.\n\nNutrient-specific symbols provide quantitative, evaluative, or both kinds of information on selected nutrients in a product without comparing the product's overall nutritional quality to that of its counterparts.\n\nAlthough all symbol programs intend to indicate that the food products with their symbol are healthful choices, each symbol program has different nutritional criteria. The selected nutrients and the nutrient levels required for eligibility vary among the different symbol programs in use. FDA recognizes that point of purchase labeling can be a way of promoting informed food choices and helping consumers construct healthier diets in accordance with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. FOP or shelf labeling that provides consumers with readily accessible information about a product's nutritional profile, in a manner that is consistent with and linked to the required Nutrition Facts panel, responds to today's marketplace realities and can be part of the education and outreach consumers need to understand and act on nutrition information at the point of purchase.\n\nHowever, FDA's research has found that with FOP labeling, people are less likely to check the Nutrition Facts label on the information panel of foods (usually, the back or side of the package). It is thus essential that both the criteria and symbols used in front-of-package and shelf-labeling systems benutritionally sound, well-designed to help consumers make informed and healthy food choices, and not be false or misleading. The agency is currently analyzing FOP labels that appear to be misleading. The agency is also looking for symbols that either expressly or by implication are nutrient content claims. We are assessing the criteria established by food manufacturers for such symbols and comparing them to our regulatory criteria.\n\nIt is important to note that nutrition-related FOP and shelf labeling, while currently voluntary, is subject to the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that prohibit false or misleading claims and restrict nutrient content claims to those defined in FDA regulations. Therefore, FOP and shelf labeling that is used in a manner that is false or misleading misbrands the products it accompanies. Similarly, a food that bears FOP or shelf labeling with a nutrient content claim that does not comply with the regulatory criteria for the claim as defined in Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR):101.13.(http://ecfr.goaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?\n\nc=ecfr&sid=85465e8ec3ea789fe4cdhd5250e0957&rgn=div8&view=text&node=21:2.0.1.1.2.1.9&idno=21) and Subpart D of Part 101(http://ecfr.goaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?\n\nc=ecfr&sid=bogc127a7a0ad4a70b16d47b187316f86&rgn=div6&view=text&node=21:2.0.1.1.2.4&idno=21). is misbranded. We will consider enforcement actions against clear violations of these established labeling requirements.\n\nFDA is also developing a proposed regulation that would define the nutritional criteria that would have to be met by manufacturers making broad FOP or shelf label claims concerning the nutritional quality of a food, whether the claim is made in text or in symbols. FDA's intent is to provide standardized, science-based criteria on which FOP nutrition labeling must be based.\n\nWe also intend to continue to improve our understanding of how consumers view and use such labels. Research suggests that the proliferation of divergent FOP approaches is likely to be confusing to consumers and ultimately counter-productive. We want to work with the food industry - retailers and manufacturers alike - as well as nutrition and design experts and the Institute of Medicine, to develop an optimal, common approach to nutrition-related FOP and shelf labeling that all Americans can trust and use to build better diets and improve their health.\n\nThe recent experience with FOP labeling in the United Kingdom demonstrates the potential of voluntary initiatives to provide consumers helpful FOP labeling. In that instance, the government set certain criteria for the use of such labeling, and retailers took the initiative to implement FOP labeling in their stores. The agency wants to explore the potential of that approach. If voluntary action by the food industry does not result in a common, credible approach to FOP and shelf labeling, we will consider using our regulatory tools toward that end. This effort will include research to assess through consumer studies the likely effects of FOP symbols on information search behavior related to the Nutrition Facts label, which in turn can affect consumer understanding of the full nutrition profile of a product. The foundation of that approach should be a common set of mandatory nutritional criteria that consumers can rely on when they view FOP labels, even if no one symbol is ultimately selected as superior.\n\nAccurate food labeling information can assist consumers in making healthy nutritional choices. FDA intends to monitor and evaluate the various FOP labeling systems and their effect on consumers' food choices and perceptions. FDA recommends that manufacturers and distributors of food products that include FOP labeling ensure that the label statements are consistent with FDA laws and regulations. FDA will proceed with enforcement action against products that bear FOP labeling that are explicit or implied nutrient content claims and that are not consistent with current nutrient content claim requirements. FDA will also proceed with enforcement action where such FOP labeling or labeling systems are used in a manner that is false or misleading. FDA intends to work in collaboration with our sister public health agencies and the Department of Agriculture, which has authority over the labeling of meat and poultry, to pursue these efforts on FOP labeling. We will base our initiative on sound consumer research to ensure that we move toward an approach that will help consumers in selecting a healthy diet.\n\nSincerely,\n\n/S/\n\nBarbara O.

A brief description of these types of studies follows. Please refer to the FDA Information Sheet Guidance \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies\" for more detailed information about SR and NSR device studies, the importance of the IRB's review, the regulatory requirements for these studies, and examples of devices in each category.\n\nA. Significant t Risk Device Studies\n\nA significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. (21 CFR 812.3(m))\n\nSponsors of investigational SR device studies are required to get an approved IDE from FDA before starting their study. 21 CFR 812.20 (FDA gives each IDE a number - for example #GXX0000, where XX denotes the year of the submission). Sponsors and clinical investigators of these studies must comply with the regulations at 21 CFR Part 812, \"Investigational Device Exemptions.\"\n\nIf FDA disapproves an IDE, FDA's letter will describe the reasons for the disapproval. If the sponsor submits an IDE amendment satisfactorily addressing the issues in FDA's letter, the agency sends an IDE approval letter to the sponsor. In accordance with the regulations at Part 812, the study may not start until both FDA and the IRB have given their approval.\n\nNote: A conditional approval letter from FDA allows the study to begin if the study is approved by the IRB, but requires the sponsor to provide additional clarifying information in order to obtain full approval for the study.\n\nIRBs do not have to make the SR or NSR determination if FDA has already made the risk determination. Most often, clinical investigators submit SR device investigations for IRB review after the study has already received IDE approval from FDA. IRBs may ensure that SR device investigations have an FDA-approved IDE by asking the clinical investigator to request from the sponsor a copy of FDA's IDE approval letter.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAn IRB may be asked to review an SR device study before the sponsor receives FDA approval of an IDE submission. Under this circumstance, IRBs should be aware that because it is possible that FDA may not approve the IDE or may request significant changes to the research protocol, the IRB may need to re-evaluate the study after FDA reviews the application. If an IRB approves the significant risk device study before FDA approves the IDE, there may be more of a risk that clinical investigators will mistakenly enroll subjects before the study should be started (i.e, before FDA approves the IDE.)\n\nNon-Significant Risk Device Studies\n\nAn NSR device is an investigational device that does not meet the definition of a significant risk device. If an IRB finds that an investigational medical device study poses a NSR, the sponsor does not need to submit an IDE to FDA before starting the study. If the IRB determines that the proposed study is an NSR study, the IRB may proceed to review the study under 21 CFR 56.109 and 21 CFR 56.111. FDA considers an NSR device study to have an approved IDE after IRB approval and when sponsors meet the abbreviated requirements at 21 CFR 812.2(b). Consequently, in most cases, FDA is not aware of non-significant risk device studies.\n\nAs stated above, if FDA has already made the risk determination, the IRB does not need to duplicate this effort. If, however, FDA has not made the risk determination or the IRB disagrees with the NSR determination made by a sponsor, then the IRB must notify the investigator and, where appropriate, the sponsor, that the study involves a significant risk device (21 CFR 812.66). If a sponsor or an IRB needs help in making the SR/NSR determination, it may ask for a written determination from FDA.3\n\nFootnote 3: See the guidance memorandum entitled, \u201cProcedures for Handling Inquiries Regarding the Need for an Investigational Device Exemptions Application for Research Involving Medical Devices\u201d at www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/blue-ide-d01-1.html\n\nThe IRB should consider the following in determining whether a device study poses a SR or NSR:\n\nthe sponsor's description of why the study is not SR\n\nwhether the proposed NSR research study meets the definition of \"significant risk\" (see above)\n\nthe proposed use of the device as well as any protocol related procedures and tests, not just the device (test article) alone. (This process is different from the IRB review process found at 21 CFR 56.111(a)(2)).)\n\nadditional information from the sponsor, if needed.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.3.1 C. Exempt Studies\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 812.2(b), sponsors and investigators of certain studies are exempt from the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812, with the exception of SS812.119 (disqualification of a clinical investigator). Examples of exempt studies are consumer preference testing, testing of a device modification, or testing of two or more devices in commercial distribution if the testing does not collect safety or effectiveness data, or put subjects at risk.4\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 CFR 812.2(c)(4).\n\nStudies of an already cleared medical device in which the device is used or investigated in accordance with the indications in the cleared labeling are exempt from Part 812.5 Note: Studies of a cleared device for a new use must comply with the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations. Similarly, studies of a PMA approved device are exempt from the IDE requirements if the device is being studied for the indications in the approved labeling.\n\nFootnote 5: See 21 CFR 812.2(c)(1) and (2).\n\nIn addition, diagnostic device studies (e.g., in vitro diagnostic studies) are exempt from the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812 under certain circumstances. The study is exempt as long as the sponsor complies with the requirements at 21 CFR 809.10(c) for labeling, and if the testing: (i) is noninvasive; (ii) does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents significant risk; (iii) does not by design or intention introduce energy into a subject; and (iv) is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure. 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3).\n\n3.2 Are IDE exempt studies subject to the requirements for informed consent and IRB review and approval under Parts 50 and 56?\n\nIf an exempt study is being conducted to collect data to support either a clinical investigation or a marketing application, then the study must comply with 21 CFR Part 50 and should comply with 21 CFR Part 56. 21 CFR 50.1(a), 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 56.101(a), 21 CFR 56.103.\n\n3.3.3 Does FDA require IRB review and approval of off-label use of a legally marketed device?\n\nNo, when a physician uses a legally marketed device outside its labeling to treat a patient and no research is being done, IRB review is not required. Note: Although not required by FDA, an IRB may still decide on its own initiative to review such use. Yes, when the off-label use of a legally marketed device is part of a research study collecting safety and effectiveness data involving human subjects, IRB review and approval is required (21 CFR 812.2(a)).\n\nFor additional information on the off-label use of devices, see the FDA Information Sheet guidance, \" 'Off-label' and Investigational Use of Marketed Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices.\"6\n\nFootnote 6: This guidance can be found at: www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/offlabel.html\n\nMust an IRB review a study conducted after submission of a (510(k)) to FDA but prior to FDA's decision on that submission?\n\nYes. During FDA's review of the premarket notification submission, the device remains an investigational product. Therefore, the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations apply. The device may not be distributed, except for investigational use, unless FDA clears the device for marketing.\n\n16 Can a physician use an unapproved device in an emergency?\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Devices Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.7779570817947388", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFactors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations for Medical Device Investigational Device Exemptions\n\nGuidance for Investigational Device Exemption Sponsors, Sponsor- Investigators and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n\nDocument issued on January 13, 2017.\n\nThis guidance will have a 60 day implementation period.\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on June 18, 2015.\n\nFor questions about this document regarding CDRH-regulated devices, contact the Office of Device Evaluation, Office of the Director, Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) Staff at 301-796-5640.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA is committed to improving U.S. patient access to new devices by strengthening and streamlining the clinical trial enterprise so that medical device clinical trials are conducted in the U.S. in an efficient and cost-effective manner, while maintaining appropriate patient and research participant protections.\n\nThe purpose of this guidance is to provide greater clarity for FDA staff and investigational device exemption (IDE) sponsors and sponsor-investigators1 regarding the principal factors that FDA considers when assessing the benefits and risks of IDE applications for human clinical studies.\n\nConsistent with applicable laws and regulations, FDA may disapprove an IDE application if, among other reasons, \"[t]here is reason to believe that the risks to the subjects are not outweighed by the anticipated benefits to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained.\"2 In many cases, the Agency believes that effective risk management, including the application of risk controls, which includes risk mitigation measures, can result in a favorable IDE benefit-risk determination.\n\nFDA recognizes that in assessing risks and anticipated benefits, the medical device total product lifecycle should be considered, and that earlier stages of device development and investigational clinical study are typically associated with greater uncertainty (i.e., a lower level of evidence). A primary goal of this guidance is to clarify the factors that FDA considers when assessing risks and anticipated benefits as significant contributors to the decision to approve IDE studies, and how uncertainty may be offset by a variety of risk mitigation measures which can ensure appropriate patient and research participant protections in investigational research settings. For proposed IDE studies, at earlier stages of device development, FDA considers appropriate mitigation measures for anticipated possible risks and unanticipated risks, whereas in later stages, FDA considers whether risk mitigation measures focus on the most probable risks.\n\nFootnote 2: 21 CFR 812.30(b)(4).\n\nAnother important goal of this guidance is to characterize benefits in the context of investigational research, which includes direct benefits to the subject and benefits to others (to the extent there are indirect benefits to subjects such as knowledge to be gained from the study or information that may contribute to developing a treatment).\n\nAs with the benefit-risk framework for evaluating marketing applications, FDA assessment of benefits and risks for an IDE application takes into account the contextual setting in which the study is being proposed, including but not limited to characterization of the disease or condition being treated or diagnosed, the availability of and risks associated with alternative treatments or diagnostics. When available, information characterizing subject tolerance for risk and their perspective on benefit may provide useful context during this assessment. See for more information FDA Guidance, Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications (http://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm517504.pdf).\n\nFDA believes use of this benefit-risk framework will facilitate the incorporation of evidence and knowledge from different domains--clinical, nonclinical, and patient--to support a comprehensive, balanced decision-making approach. FDA envisions this will facilitate a common understanding between FDA and sponsors/sponsor-investigators by highlighting which factors are critical in the benefit-risk assessment for a specific application, and clearly explaining how these factors influence FDA's decisions. This guidance document will also help improve the predictability, consistency, and transparency of the review process for IDE applications.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this one, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance documents means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Scope\n\nThis guidance document explains the principal factors that FDA considers when assessing benefits and risks of original IDE applications, IDE amendments and IDE supplements for human clinical investigations of certain medical devices to determine safety and effectiveness. The approach discussed in this guidance is applicable to studies subject to the IDE requirements in 21 CFR part 812, including postmarket studies. In general, IDE applications are required for clinical investigations of significant risk devices to determine safety and effectiveness.3 This guidance applies to both diagnostic and therapeutic devices. This guidance is not intended to provide recommendations regarding device-specific data or study requirements.\n\nFootnote 3: 21 CFR 812.2 and 20.\n\n3 Informed Consent and IDE Decisions\n\nThe purpose of the IDE regulations, as set forth in Title 21 CFR part 812, is to encourage, to the extent consistent with the protection of public health and safety and with ethical standards, the discovery and development of useful devices intended for human use, and to maintain optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of this purpose.4 Title 21 CFR part 812 applies to all clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness with some exceptions, as described in 21 CFR 812.2(c).\n\nFootnote 4: 21 CFR 812.1.\n\nFDA approval of an IDE application prior to study initiation is typically required for a clinical investigation conducted in the U.S. of a significant risk device that is not approved or cleared for the indication being studied.5 As defined in 21 CFR 812.3(m), a significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nFootnote 5: See section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 812.2(b) for conditions under which an IDE application is required prior to study initiation.\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations for Medical Device Investigational Device Exemptions Guidance for Investigational Device Exemption Sponsors, Sponsor-Investigators and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.7972300052642822", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: If a clinical study is needed to demonstrate substantial equivalence, i.e., conducted prior to obtaining 510(k) clearance of the device, the study should generally be conducted under the Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) regulation, 21 CFR 812. Generally, we believe PTA balloon catheters and specialty catheters addressed by this guidance document are significant risk devices subject to all requirements of 21 CFR part 812. Please see the FDA guidance, \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies.\"13 In addition to the requirements of 21 CFR part 812, sponsors of such trials must comply with the regulations governing institutional review boards (21 CFR part 56) and informed consent (21 CFR part 50). When data from clinical investigations conducted outside the United States are submitted to FDA for PTA and specialty catheters, the requirements of 21 CFR 812.28 may apply.14 21 CFR 812.28 outlines the conditions for FDA acceptance of clinical data from investigations conducted outside the US when submitted to support premarket submissions. For more information, see the FDA guidance, \"Acceptance of Clinical Data to Support Medical Device Applications and Submissions: Frequently Asked Questions.\"15\n\nFootnote 13: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/significant-risk-and-nonsignificant-risk-medical-device-studies\n\nFootnote 14: Applies to data from clinical investigations that began on or after February 21, 2019 and are submitted to support a premarket submission, including IDEs, PMAs, and 510(k)s.\n\nFootnote 15: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/acceptance-clinical-data-support-medical-device-applications-and-submissions-frequently-asked\n\nFootnote 16: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-real-world-evidence-support-regulatory-decision-making-medical-devices\n\nIn some cases, \"real-world data\" (RWD) may be used to support expansion of the indication for a device for which 510(k) clearance has already been obtained. Whether the collection of RWD for a legally-marketed device requires an IDE depends on the particular facts of the situation. Specifically, if a cleared device is being used in the normal course of medical practice, an IDE would likely not be required. For additional information regarding this topic, please refer to the FDA Guidance entitled \"Use of Real-World Evidence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Medical Devices.\"16\n\nFootnote 16: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/use-real-world-evidence-support-regulatory-decision-making-medical-devices\n\nAppendix J Labeling\n\nThe regulatory submission must include proposed labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy the requirements of 21 CFR 807.87(e) for premarket notifications. Labeling for PTA balloon catheters and specialty balloons should include all applicable information, including indications, contraindications, warnings, product information, a summary of the clinical data (if applicable), and directions for use.\n\nAs prescription devices, PTA balloon and specialty catheters are exempt from having adequate directions for lay use under section 502(f)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) as long as the conditions in 21 CFR 801.109 are met. For instance, labeling must include adequate information for practitioner use of the device, including indications, effects, routes, methods, frequency and duration of administration (e.g., infusion time, inflation duration), and any relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects and precautions (21 CFR 801.109(d)).\n\nAppendix K Modifications\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3), a device change or modification \"that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device\" or represents \"a major change or modification in the intended use of the device\" requires a new 510(k).17 The changes or modifications listed below are examples of changes that may require submission of a new 510(k). Note that this list is not exhaustive but provides examples of modifications that are likely to require submission of a new 510(k). For additional details, please see FDA guidance \"Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device.\"18\n\nFootnote 17: Section 3308 of the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, Title III of Division FF of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328 (\u201cFDORA\u201d), enacted on December 29, 2022, added section 515C \u201cPredetermined Change Control Plans for Devices\u201d to the FD&C Act (section 515C). Under section 515C, FDA can approve or clear a predetermined change control plan (PCCP) for a device that describes planned changes that may be made to the device and that would otherwise require a supplemental premarket approval application or premarket notification. For example, section 515C provides that a supplemental premarket approval application (section 515C(a)) or a premarket notification (section 515C(b)) is not required for a change to a device if the change is consistent with a PCCP that is approved or cleared by FDA. Section 515C also provides that FDA may require that a PCCP include labeling for safe and effective use of a device as such device changes pursuant to such plan, notification requirements if the device does not function as intended pursuant to such plan, and performance requirements for changes made under the plan. If you are interested in proposing a PCCP in your marketing submission, we encourage you to submit a Pre-Submission to engage in further discussion with CDRH.

Additionally, the test results should fall within the acceptance criteria previously found to be acceptable.\n--------------------\nContext title: Peripheral Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) and Specialty Catheters - Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.628494143486023", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 3: 21 CFR 812.2 and 20.\n\n3 Informed Consent and IDE Decisions\n\nThe purpose of the IDE regulations, as set forth in Title 21 CFR part 812, is to encourage, to the extent consistent with the protection of public health and safety and with ethical standards, the discovery and development of useful devices intended for human use, and to maintain optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of this purpose.4 Title 21 CFR part 812 applies to all clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness with some exceptions, as described in 21 CFR 812.2(c).\n\nFootnote 4: 21 CFR 812.1.\n\nFDA approval of an IDE application prior to study initiation is typically required for a clinical investigation conducted in the U.S. of a significant risk device that is not approved or cleared for the indication being studied.5 As defined in 21 CFR 812.3(m), a significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nFootnote 5: See section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 812.2(b) for conditions under which an IDE application is required prior to study initiation.\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAn approved IDE application exempts the study spons from certain provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (such as certain requirements for a marketing submission and good manufacturing practice). However, IDE studies must comply with the applicable requirements set forth in 21 CFR part 812, including requirements for informed consent under 21 CFR part 50, labeling of devices for investigational use only, study monitoring, records and reporting, and approval by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with 21 CFR part 56.6\n\nFootnote 6: Section 520(g)(3) of the FD&C Act.\n\nii.1.4 Informed Consent\n\nA key tenet of FDA's IDE benefit-risk framework is appropriate protection of human subjects and a key principle of human subject protection in clinical investigations is the informed consent process.7 This process goes beyond obtaining a signature on an informed consent form. The informed consent process provides the prospective subject or his or her legally authorized representative with adequate information about the study, including pertinent information about the investigational device, its risks and benefits, alternatives, and what is expected of the subject in order to participate in the study (e.g., study visits, procedures, maintaining subject diaries).8\n\nFootnote 7: See generally, 21 CFR part 50.\n\nThe subject or his or her legally authorized representative must be given sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate in the clinical study under circumstances that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.9\n\nFootnote 8: See 21 CFR 50.25.\n\nAn informed consent process should allow an individual to decide to accept potential risks associated with a study in exchange for the potential for anticipated benefits to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained. The informed consent process allows individuals to exercise their personal tolerance of risks as weighed against other factors, including the reasonably expected benefits and the alternatives to the study.\n\nThe informed consent process ensures that each individual makes a determination about study participation after being informed of the study, including the risks and benefits of study participation, and, if applicable, the possibility of receiving no direct benefit. The informed consent regulations in 21 CFR part 50 describe the informed consent aspects of human subject protection in clinical investigations subject to FDA regulations. For example 21 CFR 50.20, states the following:\n\n_\"Except as provided in 50.23 and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.\"_In addition, 21 CFR 50.25(a)(2) states that the informed consent must include \"a description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject.\"\n\nRegulatory Standard for IDE Decisions\n\nUnder section 520(g)(4)(B) of the FD&C Act, an IDE application may only be disapproved if FDA finds that the investigation does not conform to the procedures and conditions prescribed under regulations. The purpose of the IDE process is \"to encourage, to the extent consistent with the protection of the public health and safety and with ethical standards, the discovery and development of useful devices intended for human use and to that end to maintain optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of that purpose.\"10\n\nFDA's decision-making process for IDE applications was modified with the passage of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) of 2012 (Pub. L. No. 112-144). Section 601 of FDASIA amended Section 520(g) of the FD&C Act to specify certain situations in which FDA cannot disapprove an IDE application. Section 520(g)(4)(C) of the FD&C Act states that, consistent with section 520(g)(1), FDA shall not disapprove an IDE application because:\n\nFootnote 10: Section 520(g)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nthe investigation may not support a substantial equivalence or de novo classification determination or approval of the device;\n\nthe investigation may not meet a requirement, including a data requirement, relating to the approval or clearance of a device; or\n\nan additional or different investigation may be necessary to support clearance or approval of the device.\n\nConsidering the above criteria, when the objective of a proposed study is to support a marketing submission, the sponsor may benefit from learning whether there are protocol modifications that FDA believes are needed for the study to adequately support product approval or clearance. FDA intends to convey such considerations to the sponsor to provide greater clarity and predictability. For more information, see the FDA Guidance, FDA Decisions for Investigational Device\n\nExemption (IDE) Clinical Investigations,\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocumen\n\nts/ucm279107.pdf), issued August 19, 2014 (hereinafter, FDA Decisions for IDE Guidance).\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 812.30(b), FDA may disapprove or withdraw approval of an IDE application for any of the following reasons:\n\n(1) There has been a failure to comply with any requirement of this part or the act, any other applicable regulation or statute, or any condition of approval imposed by an IRB or FDA.\n\n(2) The application or a report contains an untrue statement of a material fact, or omits material information required by this part.__(3) The sponsor fails to respond to a request for additional information within the time prescribed by FDA.\n\n(4) There is reason to believe that the risks to the subjects are not outweighed by the anticipated benefits to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained [emphasis added], or informed consent is inadequate, or the investigation is scientifically unsound, or there is reason to believe that the device as used is ineffective.\n\n(5) It is otherwise unreasonable to begin or to continue the investigation owing to the way in which the device is used or the inadequacy of:\n\n(i) The report of prior investigations or the investigational plan;\n\n(ii) The methods, facilities, and controls used for the manufacturing, processing, packaging, storage, and, where appropriate, installation of the device; or\n\n(iii) Monitoring and review of the investigation.\n\nConsistent with this regulation, FDA will generally disapprove an IDE application if potential risks of the proposed study are not justified, or if data provided are insufficient to adequately characterize the safety profile of the device such that, based on the data contained in the IDE application, human clinical investigation is not considered reasonable.\n\nThis guidance document provides greater clarity regarding regulatory assessment of:\n\nrisks and benefits associated with clinical investigational device use proposed in IDE applications;11 and\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR 812.30(b)(4).\n\ninadequacy or uncertainty regarding the clinical or nonclinical data from prior investigations, the proposed study, the manufacturing, transport and storage of a device, or monitoring oversight of the proposed study.12\n\nFootnote 12: 21 CFR 812.30(b)(5).\n\nTypes of IDE Decisions\n\nFDA regulations13 provide for three major categories of decision on an IDE application - approval, approval with conditions, and disapproval.\n\nFootnote 13: 21 CFR 812.30(a).\n\nIf FDA approves an IDE application the sponsor may begin subject enrollment upon receipt of IRB approval and in accordance with the limits described in FDA's decision letter, including the maximum numbers of U.S. subjects and investigational sites. See FDA Decisions for IDE Guidance, page 6.\n--------------------\nContext title: Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations for Medical Device Investigational Device Exemptions Guidance for Investigational Device Exemption Sponsors, Sponsor-Investigators and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.5448423624038696", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Guideline title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff What are non-significant risk (NSR) device studies?\n--------------------\nContext: The sponsor must advise its clinical investigators about the SR status and obtain their agreement to comply with the applicable regulations governing such studies (i.e., 21 CFR Parts, 50, 56, 812) (See 21 CFR 812.43(c)(4)(i)). Sponsors should provide the IDE number and/or a copy of the IDE approval letter to the IRB when requested.\n\nSponsors may send their SR device study to an IRB for review before the IDE application is approved by FDA. However, FDA cautions that an SR device study may not begin until FDA approves the IDE.\n\nV What Are the IRB's responsibilities when it receives a device study for review?\n\nIRBs should have standard operating procedures that explain how the IRB makes SR and NSR determinations and that the decision should be documented. FDA considers this determination to be part of the IRB's responsibilities for conducting its initial review of a study. (See 21 CFR 56.108)\n\nIRBs should make the SR or NSR determination about a study by reviewing relevant information at a convened meeting. This information includes the description of the device, reports of prior investigations conducted with the device, the proposed investigational plan, and subject selection criteria. The sponsor should provide the IRB with a risk assessment and the rationale used in making its SR or NSR determination.\n\nAn IRB may agree or disagree with the sponsor's initial NSR assessment.\n\nIf the IRB determines the study is NSR, the IRB may approve the study using the criteria at 21 CFR 56.111. The study may begin without submission of an IDE application to FDA.\n\nIf the IRB disagrees with the sponsor's NSR assessment and decides the study is SR, the IRB must tell the clinical investigator, and where appropriate, the sponsor. (See 21 CFR 812.66)* An IRB may approve the study as an SR device study, but the study may not begin until FDA approves the sponsor's IDE application.\n\nTo facilitate the IRB's review of the study, an IRB may ask the sponsor for proof (i.e., a copy of FDA's approval or conditional approval letter) that an SR study has an FDA-approved IDE application.\n\nThe IRB should document its SR/NSR determination in the IRB meeting minutes.\n\nVI What Should Irbs Consider When Making the SR and Nsr Determination?\n\nWhat is the basis for the risk determination? The risk determination is based on the proposed use of a device in an investigation, and not on the device alone.\n\nWhat is the nature of harm that may result from use of the device? SR studies are those that present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. See the question \"What is a Significant Risk Device Study?\" for further information.\n\nWill the subject need to undergo an additional procedure as part of the investigational study, for example, a surgical procedure? IRBs should consider the potential harm the procedure could cause as well as the potential harm caused by the device. Several examples follow:\n\nThe study of a change to a commercially available pacemaker (e.g., new leads, battery pack, or software) poses an SR because the device is used to support or sustain human life and it presents a potential for serious harm to the subjects. This is true even though the changed pacemaker may potentially pose less risk, or only slightly greater risk, in comparison to the commercially available model.\n\nThe study of an extended wear contact lens is SR because wearing the lens continuously overnight while sleeping presents a potential for injuries not normally seen with daily wear lenses, which are NSR.\n\nAn investigational study of a sensor pad to find out if the device can detect the electrical activity of the spinal cord may be NSR, if the study of the sensor pad takes place at the same time as the planned surgical repair of the spinal cord, if all the following are true: - repair of the spinal cord would occur anyway;the sensor pad does not present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject (for example, placing the pad would not prolong or interfere with the operation); - the sensor pad is not implanted; - the pad is not of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease.\n\nVII How does an IRB document the SR or NSR determination?\n\nThe IRB should write its decision in the meeting minutes. The minutes should describe the IRB's reason for its SR or NSR determination and may also include the documentation used to establish the IDE status for the study. For an SR determination, such documentation may include, for example, a copy of the IDE approval or conditional approval letter from FDA. For an NSR determination, the documentation may include FDA's NSR determination where the agency has made the determination. FDA will issue an NSR letter upon written request.\n\nVIII What should an IRB do for device studies that are exempt from the requirements of the ide regulations (21 CFR 812.2(c))?\n\nFor studies that are exempt from the IDE regulations, the IRB does not need to decide whether the study poses a significant risk or nonsignificant risk. However, the IRB must still review the study in accordance with the IRB regulations before the investigation may begin.\n\nIRBs should understand distinctions between certain important concepts that are frequently confused:\n\nDifference between NSR and Minimal Risk Determinations\n\nIRBs should not confuse their responsibility to make an SR/NSR determination for a device study with the concept of \"minimal risk.\" \"Minimal Risk\" is a term used in the IRB regulations in part to identify certain studies that IRBs may approve through an expedited review procedure. For a device study to be eligible for expedited review, it must be an NSR study AND present no more than minimal risk to the subject. (See 21 CFR 56.110)\n\nDifference Between SR/NSR Determinations and Approval Decisions\n\nIRBs should not confuse their responsibility to review and approve research for conduct at a clinical site with the SR/NSR determination. IRBs make the SR/NSR determination before the IRB conducts its review of the study under Part 56. The judgment about whether a study poses a significant risk or nonsignificant risk is based on the significance of the potential harm that may result from participation in the study, including the use of the device; whereas the IRB's decision to approve a study for implementation is based on the study's risk-benefit assessment.\n\n6 What Are Fda's Responsibilities?\n\nAs discussed, FDA is the final arbiter in deciding whether a device study poses a significant or nonsignificant risk. It should be noted, however, that FDA generally only sees those studies that sponsors submit to the agency or those studies for which an IRB or clinical investigator asks for FDA's opinion.\n\nIf FDA disagrees with an IRB's NSR decision and determines that the study poses a significant risk, the sponsor may not begin their study until FDA approves an IDE. (See 21 CFR 812.42)\n\nIf a sponsor submits an IDE to FDA because the sponsor presumed it to be an SR study, and FDA determines that the device study poses a nonsignificant risk, FDA will tell the sponsor in writing. The study may then be reviewed by the IRB as an NSR study.\n\n7 Examples of Nsr and Sr Devices\n\nThe following examples may help sponsors and IRBs in making SR and NSR determinations. The list includes many commonly studied medical devices. Inclusion of a device in the NSR list is not a final determination because the evaluation of risk must reflect the proposed use of a device in a study.\n\nNonsignificant Risk Devices\n\nCaries Removal Solution\n\nContact Lens Solutions intended for use directly in the eye (e.g., lubricating/rewetting solutions) using active ingredients or preservation systems with a history of prior ophthalmic/contact lens use or generally recognized as safe for ophthalmic use\n\nConventional Gastroenterology and Urology Endoscopes and/or Accessories\n\nConventional General Hospital Catheters (long-term percutaneous, implanted, subcutaneous and intravascular)\n\nConventional Implantable Vascular Access Devices (Ports)\n\nConventional Laparoscopes, Culdoscopes, and Hysteroscopes\n\nDaily Wear Contact Lenses and Associated Lens Care Products not intended for use directly in the eye (e.g., cleaners; disinfecting, rinsing and storage solutions)\n\nDental Filling Materials, Cushions or Pads made from traditional materials and designs\n\nDenture Repair Kits and Realigners\n\nDigital Mammography* Electroencephalography (e.g., new recording and analysis methods, enhanced diagnostic capabilities, measuring depth of anesthesia if anesthetic administration is not based on device output)\n\nExternally Worn Monitors for Insulin Reactions\n\nFunctional Non-Invasive Electrical Neuromuscular Stimulators\n\nGeneral Biliary Catheters\n\nGeneral Urological Catheters (e.g., Foley and diagnostic catheters) for short term use ((<28) days)\n\nJaundice Monitors for Infants\n\nLow Power Lasers for treatment of pain\n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Devices within FDA specified parameters\n\nManual Image Guided Surgery\n\nMenstrual Pads (Cotton or Rayon, only)\n\nMenstrual Tampons (Cotton or Rayon, only)\n\nNonimplantable Electrical Incontinence Devices\n\nNonimplantable Male Reproductive Aids with no components that enter the vagina\n\nOb/Gyn Diagnostic Ultrasound within FDA approved parameters\n\nPartial Ossicular Replacement Prosthesis (PORP)\n\nTotal Ossicular Replacement Prosthesis (TORP)\n\nTranscutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation (TENS) Devices for treatment of pain (except for chest pain/angina)\n\nUreteral Stents\n\nUrethral Occlusion Device for less than 14 days\n\nWound Dressings, excluding absorbable hemostatic devices and dressings (also excluding Interactive Wound and Burn Dressings that aid or are intended to aid in the healing process)\n\nB.

If an IDE application is approved or approved with conditions, the sponsor may begin subject enrollment, up to the number of subjects and investigational sites specified in FDA's decision letter, upon receipt of Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, which may occur prior to FDA approval.\n\nFootnote 6: As discussed in Section 5, enrollment for an IDE application that is Approved or Approved with Conditions may in some cases be limited to a portion of the total expected enrollment (i.e., \u201cStaged Approval\u201d) while certain outstanding questions are answered concurrently with enrollment in the clinical investigation.\n\nFootnote 7: FDA has traditionally referred to IDE approvals that have conditions as \u201cConditional Approvals.\u201d FDA believes that the term \u201cApproval with Conditions\u201d is more appropriate because the term conveys that the IDE has been approved and may begin without awaiting further FDA review.\n\nFootnote 8: 21 CFR 812.3(n): Sponsor means a person who initiates, but who does not actually conduct, the investigation, that is, the investigational device is administered, dispensed, or used under the immediate direction of another individual. A person other than an individual that uses one or more of its own employees to conduct an investigation that it has initiated is a sponsor, not a sponsor-investigator, and the employees are investigators.\n\nFootnote 9: The term \u201capproval\u201d in this document and in FDA\u2019s communications means approval without conditions.\n\nIf FDA does not have outstanding issues that must be addressed to support the study of the subject cohort under the proposed investigational plan, the IDE will be approved without conditions.10 Alternatively, if FDA has identified issues that must be addressed in a timely manner but do not preclude initiation of subject enrollment in the clinical investigation, the IDE will be approved with conditions. In the case of approval with conditions, approval is granted and study enrollment may begin immediately provided that, within 45 days from the date of FDA's decision letter,11 the sponsor submits information addressing the issues identified in FDA's letter. Examples of the types of issues that may be identified in an approval with conditions letter are discussed later in this document. In certain instances, resolution of outstanding issues may be necessary before initiation of subject enrollment. In these instances, the IDE will be disapproved, meaning that the sponsor may not initiate enrollment in the clinical investigation until the sponsor responds to the issues identified in FDA's letter and receives an approval or approval with conditions letter.\n\nFootnote 10: The remainder of this document references 45 days as the specified timeframe. Sponsors may also request an extension of this timeframe that should include a justification for why the extension is needed and will not impact study integrity or subject protection.\n\n3 IDE Approval\n\nIf FDA approves an IDE application, the sponsor may begin subject enrollment upon receipt of IRB approval12 and in accordance with the limits described in FDA's decision letter, includingthe maximum numbers of U.S. subjects and investigational sites. An IDE application is approved if FDA has determined that: the sponsor has provided sufficient data to support initiation of a human clinical study; no subject protection concerns preclude initiation of the investigation; and no additional conditions must be met.\n\nFootnote 11: The authors of this paper are also referred to as FDA.\n\nIn some cases, FDA may determine that an outstanding issue remains that can be addressed with data that will be gathered concurrently with the enrollment of a portion of study subjects (i.e., staged approval, see Section 5). FDA may also inform the sponsor of recommended modifications to the study design that FDA believes will improve the study and may be necessary to enable the study to support a future marketing application (i.e., study design considerations) as well as other issues that FDA believes should be considered in preparing for a marketing application or a future clinical investigation (i.e., future considerations). These types of feedback are discussed in Section 7 of this document.\n\n4 IDE Approval with Conditions\n\nIf FDA approves an IDE application with conditions, the sponsor may begin subject enrollment upon receipt of IRB approval and in accordance with the limits described in FDA's decision letter, including the maximum numbers of U.S. subjects and investigational sites, and must submit information addressing the issues identified as conditions of approval in FDA's letter within 45 days. An IDE application is approved with conditions if FDA has determined that: the sponsor has provided sufficient data to support initiation of subject enrollment in a human clinical study; no subject protection concerns preclude initiation of subject enrollment; but additional conditions must be met to address certain outstanding issues. Previously known as \"conditional approval,\" the phrase \"approval with conditions\" is now used to convey that the outstanding issues do not raise concerns that preclude FDA from granting approval for initiation of subject enrollment in the clinical investigation. Therefore, resolution of those issues is not required prior to initiation of subject enrollment in the study, except for certain issues related to the informed consent document. If FDA identifies issues with an informed consent document, FDA's letter will specifically state that they must be addressed before enrollment begins in order to ensure that informed consent is obtained in accordance with 21 CFR Part 50 - Protection of Human Subjects.12 Outstanding issues that may lead to approval with conditions include:\n\nFootnote 12: Informed consent issues identified in an approval with conditions letter must be corrected before enrolling subjects, but can be reviewed by FDA after study enrollment begins.\n\nRequests for additional information or data involving non-clinical testing issues that do not need to be resolved prior to initiation of subject enrollment;\n\nLate-stage follow-up procedures and assessments that relate to the care of study subjects but, because they occur late in the study, can likely be addressed in response to FDA's letter prior to subjects' reaching that point in the study;\n\nMinor issues related to the informed consent document that must be corrected before initiation of subject enrollment but FDA can review after implementation;\n\nOther minor clarifications, corrections, or modifications (not related to study design) that do not need to be resolved prior to initiation of subject enrollment.\n\n3.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe sponsor must submit an amendment13 to the IDE to respond to the issues raised in FDA's approval with conditions letter within 45 days unless the sponsor has requested and FDA has granted an extension.14 For each issue identified in FDA's letter, an acceptable response provides the specific information or modification(s) FDA requested. In some cases, the sponsor may choose to provide a scientifically valid alternative to FDA's request or a scientifically valid rationale for why the information or modification(s) is not needed. FDA will inform the sponsor of its decision within 30 days from the date of receipt of the amendment. During this time, the sponsor may continue to conduct the study. If FDA determines that the issues have been adequately resolved, it will grant approval. However, if any issues remain, FDA may again grant approval with conditions and will communicate those remaining outstanding issues to the sponsor by letter. In this case, the sponsor may continue to enroll subjects in the study provided that, within 45 days, the sponsor responds to the remaining issues identified in FDA's letter. If the sponsor's response to FDA's questions raises concerns regarding subject safety, or the sponsor does not respond, FDA may take appropriate regulatory actions to protect study subjects, including placing a clinical hold15 on the study. If the study is placed on hold, no additional subjects may be enrolled, and previously enrolled study subjects should receive appropriate monitoring and treatment for their safety.\n\nFootnote 13: Beginning August 19, 2013, all submissions that respond to deficiencies from an approval with conditions or disapproval letter are designated as \u201cIDE amendments\u201d. Prior to this date, responses to approval with conditions letters were designated as \u201cIDE supplements\u201d.\n\nFootnote 14: In general, FDA will not issue an approval with conditions for issues that the agency believes will require longer than 45 days to address. If FDA identifies such issues but determines that they should not preclude initiation of subject enrollment in a study, FDA may issue a staged approval, as discussed in Section 5.\n\nFootnote 15: Section 606 of FDASIA amended section 520(g) of the FD&C Act by adding authority to place a study on \u201cclinical hold\u201d when, among other reasons established by regulation, the device involved represents an unreasonable risk to the safety of the persons who are the subjects of the clinical investigation.\n\n5 Staged Approval or Staged Approval with Conditions\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.140404224395752"], "Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: Part II Program Implementation\n\nObjectives\n\nTo evaluate an electronic product manufacturer's quality control and testing program for its ability to document and ensure product compliance with applicable performance standards and radiation safety.\n\nTo identify electronic products which fail to comply with the requirements of applicable performance standards\n\nTo obtain correction of deficient quality control and testing programs and noncompliant products identified by initiating appropriate administrative/regulatory action.\n\nTo provide guidance to manufacturers regarding compliance with the laws and regulations administered by FDA.\n\nProgram Management instructions\n\nPlanning Instructions 1. Only individuals trained in EPRC requirements should perform these inspections and field tests. Contact CDRH at RadHealth(r)fda.hhs.gov (see the CDRH management directory for specific staff contacts: https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDRH/CDRHOffices/ucm127854.htm) should the need for expertise, not otherwise available in the ORA Division, become apparent. At the discretion of CDRH and the ORA Division, radiological health specialists or a CDRH SME (subject matter expert) may accompany a medical device investigator to conduct joint EPRC/medical device inspections. If an individual has training in both EPRC and medical device inspections, a single individual may conduct both portions of the inspection. 2. Workplans should include ORA Division inspections and known CDRH assignments. The establishment inventory and guidance from CDRH should be used to assist in determining inspection and field test locations.\n\nPre-announcement of Inspections If the inspection is intended to cover medical device Quality System regulation (e.g. sunlamp devices), the inspection must be pre-announced according to medical device inspection procedure. Otherwise, pre-announcement of EPRC inspections conducted under EPRC compliance program is not mandatory, although it is recommended to facilitate the inspection. Pre-announcement ensures the firm is producing electronic products for the US market on the day of inspection, gives the firm time to collect all necessary procedures and records, and ensures appropriate individuals are available during the inspection. Section 537 of the Act permits inspection of any manufacturer for good cause, grounds for which may include introduction of any noncompliant product into US commerce, failure to comply withEPRC reporting requirements, or for purposes of suspected problems with a manufacturer's quality control and testing program and product conformance with performance standards. Inspections of manufacturers of electronic products that are also medical devices must be pre-announced unless the inspection is considered a for-cause inspection (See section 702 of the FDA Reauthorization Act).\n\nPre-announcement of Field Tests Unless there is a basis for no pre-announcement of field tests, schedule an appointment with the electronic product's user prior to the field test. Tell the user that the purpose of the visit is to conduct a survey of an electronic product to determine compliance with FDA's Federal radiation safety performance standards. Request that persons familiar with the operation of the electronic product to be tested be available to assist in the operation of the equipment.\n\nInspections and Field Test Priorities Planned inspections and field testing of electronic product manufacturers should be prioritized using the following criteria: 1. Manufacturers and products posing a potential risk to public health or with great public health impact. High-risk products may be identified by additional product-specific guidance provided in Attachments B - E, direction provided from CDRH, level of radiation emissions accessible to the public or volume of products on the US market. 2. Manufacturers or products with known compliance problems discovered through field testing, report review, complaints or other reason. 3. New manufacturers or user facilities (e.g. retail tanning salons) that have not yet been inspected and /or the products introduced by those manufacturers. 4. Products incorporating technology new to the US market or a major change in existing product and/or the manufacturers introducing those new products.\n\nInvestigator Safety Field personnel may require personal radiation monitors, such as thermal luminescent dosimeter badges, when performing tests under this program. Dosimeters must be worn when performing inspections of cabinet x-ray manufacturers, cabinet x-ray field tests, and other products that can emit x-radiation. These monitors are available from the Winchester Engineering and Analytical Center (WEAC) Radiation Safety Officer. Part VI of this program contains the contacts for WEAC.\n\nPart III - INSPECTIONAL\n\nINSPECTIONAL STRATEGY\n\nThe purpose of electronic product manufacturer inspections is to evaluate the firm's quality control and testing program to ensure product compliance with applicable performance standards and radiation safety. The inspection should also verify that EPRC requirements for reporting and record keeping are met by the firm.\n\nElectronic Product Radiation Control Inspection\n\nItems to cover a. The firm's product(s) comply with the requirements of the applicable specific performance standard and the general performance standard to the extent that: 1. The product has required performance features, labels, and instructions for operation, maintenance and service. 2. Review the manufacturer's justification for its measurement procedures. Include in your evaluation justification for use of the procedure, acceptance criteria for its tests, instrument choice, and calibration. If there are concerns, collect and submit relevant documented procedures and test results for further review. 3. The product emissions are properly characterized. Witness the measurements performed by the manufacturer. Confirm they are made according to the manufacturer's procedures. Assess if the procedures appear to be adequate to ensure compliance with performance standards. Also verify results are recorded appropriately. 4. The brochures, catalogs, websites, and other promotional material contain any required warnings or label reproductions if required by the applicable specific performance standard. 2. The firm has procedures and documents for control of the manufacturing process appropriate to the product type and production volume including: 1. Stock and inventory control 2. Bills of materials 3. Controlled drawings and procedures that are authenticated and current 4. Incoming inspection, criteria for acceptance/rejection, disposition of rejected parts, and segregation of accepted from rejected parts 5. Finished goods storage and inventory 3. The firm has quality control and testing procedures and records to cover: 1. In-production tests to verify product compliance during production 2. Final test and inspection of finished products 3. Maintenance and calibration of test equipment 4. Submission of required reports such as product and annual reports, accidental radiation occurrence (ARO) reports, and notification of non-compliance or defect reports. For electronic products that are also medical devices, the firm'sprocedure should include instructions and criteria for submitting ARO vs. medical device reports (MDR). Please note that an ARO may be required when a MDR is not required, for example when service personnel are exposed to radiation. Additionally, be aware that while the Quality Systems regulations requires a procedure for evaluating MDRs, there is no such requirement for ARO evaluations. 21 CFR 1002.20 simply requires that when the manufacturer determines there was such an event, it must be reported to FDA. d. The firm maintains records required by the electronic product radiation control regulations: 1. Distribution to purchasers or distributors 2. Radiation safety related communications, complaints, and inquiries 3. Real or alleged injuries and any subsequent investigation 4. Remedial actions taken for reports of non-compliant products, products with defects, radiation safety complaints, or injuries 5. Reports submitted to CDRH Specific product inspection and field test checklists or forms, if available, are included in ATTACHENTS B - E. These checklists should be used in conjunction with the above guidance to record inspection and test observations.\n\nRecords to collect 1. Organization chart identifying key individuals responsible for product design, manufacturing and quality control 2. Testing procedures and where possible photographic evidence showing that testing does not ensure product safety or compliance with applicable standards 3. Samples of all labels, as practicable 4. Manuals, in part or whole, that fail to contain required materials 5. Brochures and catalogs that fail to contain required warning or label reproductions 6. Distribution records for any violative products 7. Document evaluation justifications for use of the procedure, acceptance criteria for its tests, instrument choice, and calibration, if there are concerns. Note: Please see IOM section 5.3.8 - Records Obtained, for additional information and for collecting electronic records.\n\nForeign inspections All foreign inspections should be conducted using this guide, and any special instructions contained in the inspection assignment. The failure of any foreign manufacturer to comply with these requirements may result in it being added to an Import Alert and be subject to detention without physical exam (DWPE) upon attempted entry into the U.S. FDA's Import Alerts - such as 95-01 (sunlamp products), 95-04 (laser pointers, laser gunsights, laser light shows, and similar products), and 95-05 (electronic products) - are listed at:https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html\n--------------------\nContext title: CPGM 7386.001\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -8.879386901855469", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 25: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/general-principles-software-validation.\n\n4 Definitions\n\nThe following terms are used for the purposes of this guidance:\n\nDevice Software Function - Software function that meets the device definition in section 201(h) of the FD&C Act. As discussed above, the term \"function\" is a distinct purpose of the product, which could be the intended use or a subset of the intended use of the product.\n\n3.2.2 Off-the-Shelf (OTS) Software26 -\n\nA generally available software component used by a device manufacturer for which the manufacturer cannot claim complete software life cycle control (e.g., operating system, printer/display libraries).\n\nFootnote 26: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/shelf-software-use-medical-devices.\n\nSerious Injury27 - An injury or illness that:\n\nFootnote 27: Serious injury as defined in 21 CFR 803.3(w).\n\n1) Is life threatening,\n\nFootnote 28: Serious injury as defined in 21 CFR 803.3(w).\n\n2) Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure, or\n\nFootnote 29: Serious injury as defined in 21 CFR 803.3(w).\n\n3) Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure. Permanent is defined as irreversible impairment or damage to a body structure or function, excluding trivial impairment or damage.\n\nSoftware Verification and Software Validation - This guidance uses the terms \"software verification\" and \"software validation,\" which are described in further detail below.\n\nFor the purposes of this guidance, software verification is confirmation by objective evidence that the output of a particular phase of development meets all the input requirements for that phase. Software verification involves evaluating the consistency, completeness, and correctness of the software and its supporting documentation, as it is being developed, and provides support for a subsequent conclusion that software is validated. Software testing is one of several verification activities intended to confirm that the software development output meets its input requirements. Other verification activities include source code evaluations (e.g., code inspections and walkthroughs), document inspections, design reviews, technical evaluations (e.g., software architecture, software detailed design, etc.) and traceability analyses (e.g., software requirements specification to software design specification (and vice versa), source code to software design specification (and vice versa), and test cases to source code and to software design specification). For example, the input and output of the design phase are known as Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and Software Design Specification (SDS), respectively. In this case, software verification would involve confirming by objective evidence (e.g., reviews, traceability analysis) that the software design as documented in the SDS (i.e., output) correctly and completely implements all the requirements of the SRS (i.e., input).\n\nFor the purposes of this guidance, software validation refers to establishing, by objective evidence, that the software specifications conform to user needs and intended uses, and that the particular requirements implemented through software can be consistently fulfilled. Software validation is a part of design validation of the finished device. It involves checking for proper operation of the software in its actual or simulated use environment, including integration into the final device where appropriate. Software validation is highly dependent upon comprehensive software testing and otherverification tasks previously completed at each stage of the software development life cycle. Planning, requirements, traceability, testing, risk assessment, design reviews, change management, and many other aspects of good software engineering are important activities that together help to support a conclusion that software is validated.\n\nThe above descriptions of software verification and software validation are consistent with FDA's thinking as described in the guidance \"General Principles of Software Validation.\"\n\nV. Documentation Level\n\nThe recommended documentation for a premarket submission depends on the device's risk to a patient, a user of a device, or others in the environment of use. FDA intends to take a risk-based approach to help determine the device's Documentation Level, which is either Basic or Enhanced. The purpose of the Documentation Level is to help identify the minimum amount of information that would support a premarket submission that includes device software functions.\n\nThe Documentation Level of a device is based on the risks of its device software function(s) in the context of the device's intended use,28 such that the documentation level reflects the device as a whole.\n\nFootnote 28: See 21 CFR 801.4 (\u201c...[I]ntended uses...refer to the objective intent of the persons legally responsible for the labeling of an article. The intent may be shown by such persons\u2019 expressions, the design or composition of the article, or by the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the article.\u201d).\n\nFor the purpose of this guidance:\n\nEnhanced Documentation should be provided for any premarket submission that includes device software function(s) where a failure or flaw of any device software function(s) could present a hazardous situation with a probable29 risk of death or serious injury,30 either to a patient, user of the device, or others in the environment of use. These risks should be assessed prior to implementation of risk control measures. Sponsors should consider the risks in the context of the device's intended use (e.g., impacts to safety, treatment, and/or diagnosis), and other relevant considerations.\n\nFootnote 29: The term \u201cprobable\u201d is intended to exclude the consideration of purely hypothetical risks.\n\nFootnote 30: See 21 CFR 803.3(w).\n\nBasic Documentation should be provided for any premarket submission that includes device software function(s) where Enhanced Documentation does not apply.\n\nWhen determining the Documentation Level, sponsors should consider all known or foreseeable software hazards and hazardous situations associated with the device, including those resulting from reasonably foreseeable misuse, whether intentional or unintentional, prior to the implementation of risk control measures. This also includes the likelihood that device functionality is intentionally or unintentionally compromised by inadequate device cybersecurity.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIt is the sponsor's responsibility to proactively and comprehensively consider risks as part of the device's risk assessment.31\n\nFootnote 31: For information on risk assessment refer to Section VI.C of this guidance.\n\nWhile devices within the scope of this guidance should be individually assessed to determine the appropriate Documentation levels, there are certain categories of devices for which we recommend that Enhanced Documentation be provided in a premarket submission. Specifically, we recommend that Enhanced Documentation should be provided in a premarket submission for devices intended to test blood donations for transfusion-transmitted infections, devices used to determine blood donor and recipient compatibility, automated blood cell separator devices intended for collection of blood and blood components for transfusion or further manufacturing use, and blood establishment computer software (BECS).32\n\nFootnote 32: See Appendix A for rationale on enhanced documentation level for BECS.\n\nThere are other categories of device for which we generally recommend Enhanced Documentation be provided in a premarket submission. FDA believes that given the nature of these products and their intended uses, these products may have unique risks that require further documentation to ensure that FDA is able to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the device. These include devices that are a constituent part of a combination product (i.e., drug/device, biologic/device, or drug/device/biologic)33 and Class III devices. In the course of evaluating the appropriate Documentation Level for a device that is a constituent part of a combination product or a Class III device, a sponsor may determine that an Enhanced Documentation level does not apply. In such cases, the sponsor should provide an appropriately detailed rationale as to why Basic Documentation instead of Enhanced Documentation is appropriate for the premarket submission. As previously discussed, during the course of submission review, FDA may request additional information if needed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the device.\n\nFootnote 33: 21 CFR 3.2(e).\n\nSponsors may submit a Pre-Submission to obtain FDA feedback about a device's Documentation Level and recommended documentation prior to a premarket submission, as described in the guidance \"Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program.\"34 For additional information on how to engage with a particular Center with regard to a combination product, including best practices for doing so, please see the final guidance \"Requesting FDA Feedback on Combination Products.\"35\n\nFootnote 34: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.\n\nFootnote 35: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requesting-fda-feedback-combination-products.\n\nFor additional information and examples of devices that demonstrate the implementation of the Documentation Level risk-based approach, please refer to Appendix A of this guidance.\n\nVI Recommended Documentation\n--------------------\nContext title: Content of Premarket Submissions for Device Software Functions Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -8.972061157226562", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: General Principles of Software Validation; Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n\nDocument issued on: January 11, 2002\n\nThis document supersedes the draft document, \"General Principles of Software Validation, Version 1.1, dated June 9, 1997.\n\nU.S. Department Of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nPreface\n\nPublic Comment\n\nComments and suggestions may be submitted at any time for Agency consideration to Dockets Management Branch, Division of Management Systems and Policy, Office of Human Resources and Management Services, Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Room 1061, (HFA-305), Rockville, MD, 20852.

It represents the Agency's current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.\n\nSection 1 Purpose\n\nThis guidance outlines general validation principles that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers to be applicable to the validation of medical device software or the validation of software used to design, develop, or manufacture medical devices. This final guidance document, Version 2.0, supersedes the draft document, General Principles of Software Validation, Version 1.1, dated June 9, 1997.\n\nSection 2 Scope\n\nThis guidance describes how certain provisions of the medical device Quality System regulation apply to software and the agency's current approach to evaluating a software validation system. For example, this document lists elements that are acceptable to the FDA for the validation of software; however, it does not list all of the activities and tasks that must, in all instances, be used to comply with the law.\n\nThe scope of this guidance is somewhat broader than the scope of validation in the strictest definition of that term. Planning, verification, testing, traceability, configuration management, and many other aspects of good software engineering discussed in this guidance are important activities that together help to support a final conclusion that software is validated.\n\nThis guidance recommends an integration of software life cycle management and risk management activities. Based on the intended use and the safety risk associated with the software to be developed, the software developer should determine the specific approach, the combination of techniques to be used, and the level of effort to be applied. While this guidance does not recommend any specific life cycle model or any specific technique or method, it does recommend that software validation and verification activities be conducted throughout the entire software life cycle.\n\nWhere the software is developed by someone other than the device manufacturer (e.g., off-the-shelf software) the software developer may not be directly responsible for compliance with FDA regulations.\n\nIn that case, the party with regulatory responsibility (i.e., the device manufacturer) needs to assess the adequacy of the off-the-shelf software developer's activities and determine what additional efforts are needed to establish that the software is validated for the device manufacturer's intended use.\n\nApplicability\n\nThis guidance applies to:\n\nSoftware used as a component, part, or accessory of a medical device;\n\nSoftware that is itself a medical device (e.g., blood establishment software);\n\nSoftware used in the production of a device (e.g., programmable logic controllers in manufacturing equipment); and\n\nSoftware used in implementation of the device manufacturer's quality system (e.g., software that records and maintains the device history record).\n\nThis document is based on generally recognized software validation principles and, therefore, can be applied to any software. For FDA purposes, this guidance applies to any software related to a regulated medical device, as defined by Section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and by current FDA software and regulatory policy. This document does not specifically identify which software is or is not regulated.\n\nAudience\n\nThis guidance provides useful information and recommendations to the following individuals:\n\nPersons subject to the medical device Quality System regulation\n\nPersons responsible for the design, development, or production of medical device software\n\nPersons responsible for the design, development, production, or procurement of automated tools used for the design, development, or manufacture of medical devices or software tools used to implement the quality system itself\n\nFDA Investigators\n\nFDA Compliance Officers\n\nFDA Scientific Reviewers\n\nThe Least burdensome Approach\n\nWe believe we should consider the least burdensome approach in all areas of medical device regulation. This guidance reflects our careful review of the relevant scientific and legal requirements and what we believe is the least burdensome way for you to comply with those requirements.

Of those software related recalls, 192 (or 79%) were caused by software defects that were introduced when changes were made to the software after its initial production and distribution. Software validation and other related good software engineering practices discussed in this guidance are a principal means of avoiding such defects and resultant recalls.\n\nSoftware validation is a requirement of the Quality System regulation, which was published in the Federal Register on October 7, 1996 and took effect on June 1, 1997. (See Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 820, and 61 Federal Register (FR) 52602, respectively.) Validation requirements apply to software used as components in medical devices, to software that is itself a medical device, and to software used in production of the device or in implementation of the device manufacturer's quality system.\n\nUnless specifically exempted in a classification regulation, any medical device software product developed after June 1, 1997, regardless of its device class, is subject to applicable design control provisions. (See of 21 CFR 8820.30.) This requirement includes the completion of current development projects, all new development projects, and all changes made to existing medical device software. Specific requirements for validation of device software are found in 21 CFR 8820.30(g). Other design controls, such as planning, input, verification, and reviews, are required for medical device software. (See 21 CFR 8820.30.) The corresponding documented results from these activities can provide additional support for a conclusion that medical device software is validated.\n\nAny software used to automate any part of the device production process or any part of the quality system must be validated for its intended use, as required by 21 CFR 8820.70(i). This requirement applies to any software used to automate device design, testing, component acceptance, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, complaint handling, or to automate any other aspect of the quality system.\n\nIn addition, computer systems used to create, modify, and maintain electronic records and to manage electronic signatures are also subject to the validation requirements. (See 21 CFR 811.10(a).) Such computer systems must be validated to ensure accuracy, reliability, consistent intended performance, and the ability to discern invalid or altered records.\n--------------------\nContext title: General Principles of Software Validation Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -9.46190357208252", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: Clinical Decision Support Software Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff Document issued on September 28, 2022.\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on September 27, 2019.\n\nFor questions about this document regarding CDRH-regulated devices, contact the Division of Digital Health via email at DigitalHealth@fda.hhs.gov.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff\n\nor Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has long regulated software that meets the definition of a device in section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), including software that is intended to provide decision support for the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, cure, or mitigation of diseases or other conditions (often referred to as clinical decision support software). This guidance clarifies the scope of FDA's oversight of clinical decision support software intended for health care professionals (HCPs) as devices.1 Not all clinical decision support software used in healthcare settings are devices and therefore subject to FDA oversight as a device.\n\nFDA recognizes that the term \"clinical decision support\" or \"CDS\" is used broadly and in different ways, depending on the context.2 In the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) Health IT Report of 2014, CDS is described as a variety of tools including, but not limited to: computerized alerts and reminders for providers and patients; clinical guidelines; condition-specific order sets; focused patient data reports and summaries; documentation templates; diagnostic support; and contextually relevant reference information.3 For the purposes of this guidance, the term \"Non-Device CDS\" is used to refer to decision support software functions that do not meet the definition of device in section 201(h) of the FD&C Act. In accordance with section 201(h) of the FD&C Act, FDA uses criteria from section 520(o) of the FD&C Act, which was added to the FD&C Act by the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act), to determine if a software function is Non-Device CDS (see Section III). Certain CDS software functions do not meet the criteria in section 520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act and are therefore device functions. Furthermore, some multiple function device products may include both Non-Device CDS software functions and device software functions (CDS or otherwise). In such situations, FDA would use the approach outlined in FDA's guidance Multiple Function Device Products: Policy and Considerations,4 when assessing the safety and effectiveness of the device software function, consistent with section 520(o)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 4: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/multiple-function-device-products-policy-and-considerations.\n\nThe purpose of this guidance is to describe FDA's regulatory approach to CDS software functions. The Agency's approach reflects changes to the FD&C Act made by the Cures Act, which amended section 520 and excludes certain software functions from the device definition. The focus of this guidance is to clarify the types of CDS software functions that are excluded from the definition of device by the criteria in section 520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act. This guidance further clarifies that FDA's existing digital health policies continue to apply to software functions that meet the definition of a device, including those that are intended for use by patients or caregivers.5 For example, some decision support software functions may be identified in other guidance documents as software functions for which, based on our current understanding of the risks of these software functions, FDA does not intend at this time to enforce compliance with applicable device requirements of the FD&C Act, including, but not limited to, premarket clearance and approval requirements.\n\nFootnote 5: FDA intends to be consistent with existing policies, including the following guidance documents: Policy for Device Software Functions and Mobile Medical Applications (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/policy-device-software-functions-and-mobile-medical-applications), Software as a Medical Device (SaMD): Clinical Evaluation (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/software-medical-device-samd-clinical-evaluation), Medical Device Data Systems, Medical Image Storage Devices, and Medical Image Communications Devices (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/medical-device-data-systems-medical-image-storage-devices-and-medical-image-communications-devices), and General Wellness: Policy for Low Risk Devices (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/general-wellness-policy-low-risk-devices).\n\nThis guidance provides many examples of how FDA intends to consider different kinds of software functions, including Non-Device CDS software functions and device software functions.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\nSection 3060(a) of the Cures Act amended the FD&C Act to add section 520(o) of the FD&C Act, which excludes certain software functions from the definition of device in section 201(h) of the FD&C Act. Certain CDS software functions are excluded from the definition of device by section 520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act if the software functions meet all of the following four criteria:\n\n(1) not intended to acquire, process, or analyze a medical image or a signal from an in vitro diagnostic device or a pattern or signal from a signal acquisition system (section 520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act);\n\n(2) intended for the purpose of displaying, analyzing, or printing medical information about a patient or other medical information (such as peer-reviewed clinical studies and clinical practice guidelines) (section 520(o)(1)(E)(i) of the FD&C Act);\n\n(3) intended for the purpose of supporting or providing recommendations to a health care professional about prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a disease or condition (section 520(o)(1)(E)(ii) of the FD&C Act); and\n\n(4) intended for the purpose of enabling such health care professional to independently review the basis for such recommendations that such software presents so that it is not the intent that such health care professional rely primarily on any of such recommendations to make a clinical diagnosis or treatment decision regarding an individual patient (section 520(o)(1)(E)(iii) of the FD&C Act).6\n--------------------\nContext title: Clinical Decision Support Software Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -9.469795227050781", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nReview and Update of Device Establishment Inspection Processes and Standards\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nDocument issued on June 29, 2020.\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on March 29, 2019.\n\nFor questions about this document contact the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) Office of Strategic Planning and Operational Policy (OSPOP) at ORAPolicyStaffs@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nU.S. FOOD & DRUG ADMINISTATION\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nOffice of Regulatory Affairs\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nPreface\n\nPublic Comment\n\nYou may submit electronic comments and suggestions at any time for Agency consideration to https://www.regulations.gov.

You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to comply with section 702(b)(2) of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA) (Public Law 115-52), which directs FDA to issue guidance that specifies how the Agency will implement uniform processes and standards1 that are applicable to inspections (other than for-cause)2 of foreign and domestic device establishments.3 FDA updated processes and standards as needed to address the new provisions in section 704(h)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) that were added by FDARA section 702(a) and to establish a standard timeframe for inspections. This guidance also describes standardized methods of communication during the inspection process and identifies practices for investigators and device establishments to facilitate the continuity of inspections of such establishments.\n\nFootnote 1: As used in this guidance, the term \u201cstandards\u201d refers to \u201ca level of quality or attainment\u201d and does not refer to a \u201cvoluntary consensus standard\u201d as described in Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-119 at https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/revised_circular_a-119_as_of_01-22-2016.pdf.\n\nFootnote 2: Section 704(h)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) applies to \u201cinspections other than for-cause inspections\u201d only. Therefore, as used in this guidance, \u201cinspection\u201d does not include for-cause inspections. The inspections within the scope of this guidance are conducted in accordance with a risk-based schedule pursuant to section 510(h)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 3: The uniform processes and standards in this guidance apply to inspections of device establishments required to be registered with the Secretary, including but not limited to establishments required to register under 21 CFR 607.80 and 21 CFR 1271.1(b)(2).\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nOn August 18, 2017, FDARA was signed into law. Among other things, FDARA added section 704(h)(1) to the FD&C Act. This provision requires FDA to review processes and standards applicable to inspections of domestic and foreign device establishments and update such processes and standards, as necessary, through the adoption of uniform processes and standards applicable to such inspections. Section 704(h)(1) of the FD&C Act specifies that the updated uniform processes and standards will describe how FDA should, among other things, pre-announce inspections of device establishments within a reasonable time before the inspection begins, provide a reasonable estimated timeframe for inspections, and ensure regular communication with the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the establishment during inspections.\n\nSection 702(b) of FDARA instructs FDA to issue this guidance to describe how it is implementing section 704(h)(1) of the FD&C Act, provide for standardized methods of communication when communication is required under 704(h)(1), establish a standard timeframe for inspections, and identify practices for investigators and device establishments to facilitate the continuity of inspections of such establishments.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nPursuant to section 704(h)(1) of the FD&C Act, as added by FDARA, FDA reviewed the processes and standards applicable to inspections of foreign and domestic device establishments that were in place as of August 18, 2017. The review encompassed FDA guidances, manuals, programs, and internal standard operating procedures related to device establishment inspections. As a result of this review, FDA identified uniform processes and standards and drafted revisions to update procedural documents, including the Investigations Operations Manual and training materials, where necessary, to align with these processes and standards.\n\nFDA believes that uniformity in investigators' approaches to inspections, both before and during, may inform firms' preparation for the inspection and set baseline communication and timing expectations for each party. The processes and standards identified below should facilitate practices that encourage continuity within an inspection and consistency across inspections. Section 704(h)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act allows FDA to establish exceptions to the updated processes and standards, as appropriate.\n\nPre-announcement Notice and Communication\n\nFDA intends to make reasonable efforts to make contact with the firm to preannounce the inspection. Under the uniform processes and standards, an investigator notifies the owner, operator, or agent in charge of a device establishment by telephone before their facility undergoes an inspection. While FDA intends to seek acknowledgement of the pre-announcement notification from the firm, FDA believes the firm's failure to acknowledge the notification should not be a reason to delay the start of an inspection. Under the statute, this notification will be provided within a reasonable time before the inspection is scheduled to occur. For domestic inspections, the pre-announcement should be no less than five calendar days in advance of the inspection. The pre-announcement for foreign inspections is generally more than five calendar days due to the requirements of particular country clearances. For both domestic and foreign inspections, the notification should include information about the type and nature of the inspection, such as whether the inspection is scheduled as surveillance or pre-approval.\n\nUpdated processes specify that during pre-announcement, investigators should communicate with the firm regarding the planned timeframe and duration of the inspection, to include appropriate working hours during which the inspection is likely to take place. To the extent possible, FDA should also provide advance notice of some records that may be requested during the inspection (e.g., certain procedures and any associated records).\n\nUnder 704(h)(1) of the FD&C Act, FDA retains authority to conduct unannounced, for-cause inspections.\n\nStandard Inspection Timeframe\n\nFDA standards for reasonable estimated timeframes of inspections generally range from 3 to 6 continuous business days. These standards are based on the type of surveillance inspection (abbreviated or comprehensive) and the extent of coverage needed for a pre-approval inspection. The estimated duration for each inspection should be shared with the firm at the time of pre-announcement. Inspection duration is impacted by factors such as the complexities of the firm's operations, availability of knowledgeable staff, and the nature of observed deficiencies.\n--------------------\nContext title: Review and Update of Device Establishment Inspection Processes and Standards Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -9.470766067504883", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , To what extent are computer programs to be documented as SOPs?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nContent of Premarket Submissions for Device Software Functions\n\nGuidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n\nDocument issued on June 14, 2023.\n\nThe draft of this document was issued on November 4, 2021.\n\nThis document supersedes Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices, May 2005.\n\nFor questions about this document regarding CDRH-regulated devices, contact the Digital Health Center of Excellence at digitalhealth@fda.hhs.gov.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance document is intended to provide information regarding the recommended documentation for premarket submissions for FDA's evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of device software functions, which are software functions that meet the definition of a device under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).1 This document replaces FDA's Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices issued on May 11, 2005, and updates FDA's thinking related to the documentation FDA recommends sponsors include for the review of device software functions in premarket submissions.\n\nFootnote 1: The term \u201cdevice\u201d is defined in 201(h)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act to include an \u201cinstrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or accessory, which is...intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man... or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man...\u201d and \u201cdoes not include software functions excluded pursuant to section 520(o)\u201d of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe recommendations in this guidance are intended to facilitate FDA's premarket review. This guidance describes information that would be typically generated and documented2 during software development, verification, and validation. The least burdensome approach was applied to identify the minimum amount of information that, based on our experience, would generally be needed to support a premarket submission for a device that uses software. During premarket review, FDA may request additional information that is needed to evaluate the submission. For example, in order to demonstrate a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for devicesthat use software, documentation related to the requirements of the Quality System Regulation (QSR) (21 CFR Part 820) is often a necessary part of the premarket submission. As part of QSR design controls, a manufacturer must \"establish and maintain procedures for validating the device design,\" which \"shall include software validation and risk analysis, where appropriate\" (21 CFR 820.30(g)).\n\nThe documentation recommended in this guidance is based on FDA's experience evaluating the safety and effectiveness of device software. However, sponsors may use alternative approaches and provide different documentation so long as their approach and documentation satisfy premarket submission requirements in applicable statutory provisions and regulations. For the current edition(s) of the FDA-recognized consensus standard(s) referenced in this document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database.3 For more information regarding use of consensus standards in regulatory submissions, please refer to the FDA guidance titled Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices4 and Standards Development and the Use of Standards in Regulatory Submissions Reviewed in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.5\n\nFootnote 3: Available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm.\n\nFootnote 4: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/appropriate-use-voluntary-consensus-standards-premarket-submissions-medical-devices.\n\nFootnote 5: Available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/standards-development-and-use-standards-regulatory-submissions-reviewed-center-biologics-evaluation.\n\nAs stated above, this guidance identifies the software information FDA considers to generally be necessary to support a premarket submission. The recommendations in this guidance are also intended to facilitate FDA's premarket review. FDA anticipates that the Agency and industry will need up to 60 days after the publication of this guidance to operationalize the recommendations discussed. However, CDRH intends to review any such information if submitted at any time.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nThe purpose of this guidance is to describe FDA's thinking on the recommended documentation sponsors should include in premarket submissions for FDA's evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of device software functions. This thinking recognizes recent changes to the FD&C Act made by the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act), which amended section 520 of the FD&C Act and excludes certain software functions from the device definition. It also considers the rapidly evolving nature of digital health and recent FDA-recognized consensus standards related to software.

A brief description of these types of studies follows. Please refer to the FDA Information Sheet Guidance \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies\" for more detailed information about SR and NSR device studies, the importance of the IRB's review, the regulatory requirements for these studies, and examples of devices in each category.\n\nA. Significant t Risk Device Studies\n\nA significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. (21 CFR 812.3(m))\n\nSponsors of investigational SR device studies are required to get an approved IDE from FDA before starting their study. 21 CFR 812.20 (FDA gives each IDE a number - for example #GXX0000, where XX denotes the year of the submission). Sponsors and clinical investigators of these studies must comply with the regulations at 21 CFR Part 812, \"Investigational Device Exemptions.\"\n\nIf FDA disapproves an IDE, FDA's letter will describe the reasons for the disapproval. If the sponsor submits an IDE amendment satisfactorily addressing the issues in FDA's letter, the agency sends an IDE approval letter to the sponsor. In accordance with the regulations at Part 812, the study may not start until both FDA and the IRB have given their approval.\n\nNote: A conditional approval letter from FDA allows the study to begin if the study is approved by the IRB, but requires the sponsor to provide additional clarifying information in order to obtain full approval for the study.\n\nIRBs do not have to make the SR or NSR determination if FDA has already made the risk determination. Most often, clinical investigators submit SR device investigations for IRB review after the study has already received IDE approval from FDA. IRBs may ensure that SR device investigations have an FDA-approved IDE by asking the clinical investigator to request from the sponsor a copy of FDA's IDE approval letter.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAn IRB may be asked to review an SR device study before the sponsor receives FDA approval of an IDE submission. Under this circumstance, IRBs should be aware that because it is possible that FDA may not approve the IDE or may request significant changes to the research protocol, the IRB may need to re-evaluate the study after FDA reviews the application. If an IRB approves the significant risk device study before FDA approves the IDE, there may be more of a risk that clinical investigators will mistakenly enroll subjects before the study should be started (i.e, before FDA approves the IDE.)\n\nNon-Significant Risk Device Studies\n\nAn NSR device is an investigational device that does not meet the definition of a significant risk device. If an IRB finds that an investigational medical device study poses a NSR, the sponsor does not need to submit an IDE to FDA before starting the study. If the IRB determines that the proposed study is an NSR study, the IRB may proceed to review the study under 21 CFR 56.109 and 21 CFR 56.111. FDA considers an NSR device study to have an approved IDE after IRB approval and when sponsors meet the abbreviated requirements at 21 CFR 812.2(b). Consequently, in most cases, FDA is not aware of non-significant risk device studies.\n\nAs stated above, if FDA has already made the risk determination, the IRB does not need to duplicate this effort. If, however, FDA has not made the risk determination or the IRB disagrees with the NSR determination made by a sponsor, then the IRB must notify the investigator and, where appropriate, the sponsor, that the study involves a significant risk device (21 CFR 812.66). If a sponsor or an IRB needs help in making the SR/NSR determination, it may ask for a written determination from FDA.3\n\nFootnote 3: See the guidance memorandum entitled, \u201cProcedures for Handling Inquiries Regarding the Need for an Investigational Device Exemptions Application for Research Involving Medical Devices\u201d at www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/blue-ide-d01-1.html\n\nThe IRB should consider the following in determining whether a device study poses a SR or NSR:\n\nthe sponsor's description of why the study is not SR\n\nwhether the proposed NSR research study meets the definition of \"significant risk\" (see above)\n\nthe proposed use of the device as well as any protocol related procedures and tests, not just the device (test article) alone. (This process is different from the IRB review process found at 21 CFR 56.111(a)(2)).)\n\nadditional information from the sponsor, if needed.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n3.3.1 C. Exempt Studies\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 812.2(b), sponsors and investigators of certain studies are exempt from the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812, with the exception of SS812.119 (disqualification of a clinical investigator). Examples of exempt studies are consumer preference testing, testing of a device modification, or testing of two or more devices in commercial distribution if the testing does not collect safety or effectiveness data, or put subjects at risk.4\n\nFootnote 4: See 21 CFR 812.2(c)(4).\n\nStudies of an already cleared medical device in which the device is used or investigated in accordance with the indications in the cleared labeling are exempt from Part 812.5 Note: Studies of a cleared device for a new use must comply with the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations. Similarly, studies of a PMA approved device are exempt from the IDE requirements if the device is being studied for the indications in the approved labeling.\n\nFootnote 5: See 21 CFR 812.2(c)(1) and (2).\n\nIn addition, diagnostic device studies (e.g., in vitro diagnostic studies) are exempt from the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812 under certain circumstances. The study is exempt as long as the sponsor complies with the requirements at 21 CFR 809.10(c) for labeling, and if the testing: (i) is noninvasive; (ii) does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents significant risk; (iii) does not by design or intention introduce energy into a subject; and (iv) is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure. 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3).\n\n3.2 Are IDE exempt studies subject to the requirements for informed consent and IRB review and approval under Parts 50 and 56?\n\nIf an exempt study is being conducted to collect data to support either a clinical investigation or a marketing application, then the study must comply with 21 CFR Part 50 and should comply with 21 CFR Part 56. 21 CFR 50.1(a), 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 56.101(a), 21 CFR 56.103.\n\n3.3.3 Does FDA require IRB review and approval of off-label use of a legally marketed device?\n\nNo, when a physician uses a legally marketed device outside its labeling to treat a patient and no research is being done, IRB review is not required. Note: Although not required by FDA, an IRB may still decide on its own initiative to review such use. Yes, when the off-label use of a legally marketed device is part of a research study collecting safety and effectiveness data involving human subjects, IRB review and approval is required (21 CFR 812.2(a)).\n\nFor additional information on the off-label use of devices, see the FDA Information Sheet guidance, \" 'Off-label' and Investigational Use of Marketed Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices.\"6\n\nFootnote 6: This guidance can be found at: www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/offlabel.html\n\nMust an IRB review a study conducted after submission of a (510(k)) to FDA but prior to FDA's decision on that submission?\n\nYes. During FDA's review of the premarket notification submission, the device remains an investigational product. Therefore, the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations apply. The device may not be distributed, except for investigational use, unless FDA clears the device for marketing.\n\n16 Can a physician use an unapproved device in an emergency?\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Devices Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.1117215156555176", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: 2 IDE Decisions\n\nFDA's regulations4 provide for three FDA actions on IDE applications:\n\nFootnote 4: 21 CFR 812.30.\n\nApproval5* Approval with Conditions6\n\nDisapproval\n\nFDA must inform the sponsor7 or sponsor-investigator8 of its decision, or must notify the sponsor that the investigation may not begin, within 30 days from the date of receipt of the IDE application, or the IDE application will be deemed approved. If an IDE application is approved or approved with conditions, the sponsor may begin subject enrollment, up to the number of subjects and investigational sites specified in FDA's decision letter, upon receipt of Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, which may occur prior to FDA approval.\n\nFootnote 6: As discussed in Section 5, enrollment for an IDE application that is Approved or Approved with Conditions may in some cases be limited to a portion of the total expected enrollment (i.e., \u201cStaged Approval\u201d) while certain outstanding questions are answered concurrently with enrollment in the clinical investigation.\n\nFootnote 7: FDA has traditionally referred to IDE approvals that have conditions as \u201cConditional Approvals.\u201d FDA believes that the term \u201cApproval with Conditions\u201d is more appropriate because the term conveys that the IDE has been approved and may begin without awaiting further FDA review.\n\nFootnote 8: 21 CFR 812.3(n): Sponsor means a person who initiates, but who does not actually conduct, the investigation, that is, the investigational device is administered, dispensed, or used under the immediate direction of another individual. A person other than an individual that uses one or more of its own employees to conduct an investigation that it has initiated is a sponsor, not a sponsor-investigator, and the employees are investigators.\n\nFootnote 9: The term \u201capproval\u201d in this document and in FDA\u2019s communications means approval without conditions.\n\nIf FDA does not have outstanding issues that must be addressed to support the study of the subject cohort under the proposed investigational plan, the IDE will be approved without conditions.10 Alternatively, if FDA has identified issues that must be addressed in a timely manner but do not preclude initiation of subject enrollment in the clinical investigation, the IDE will be approved with conditions. In the case of approval with conditions, approval is granted and study enrollment may begin immediately provided that, within 45 days from the date of FDA's decision letter,11 the sponsor submits information addressing the issues identified in FDA's letter. Examples of the types of issues that may be identified in an approval with conditions letter are discussed later in this document. In certain instances, resolution of outstanding issues may be necessary before initiation of subject enrollment. In these instances, the IDE will be disapproved, meaning that the sponsor may not initiate enrollment in the clinical investigation until the sponsor responds to the issues identified in FDA's letter and receives an approval or approval with conditions letter.\n\nFootnote 10: The remainder of this document references 45 days as the specified timeframe. Sponsors may also request an extension of this timeframe that should include a justification for why the extension is needed and will not impact study integrity or subject protection.\n\n3 IDE Approval\n\nIf FDA approves an IDE application, the sponsor may begin subject enrollment upon receipt of IRB approval12 and in accordance with the limits described in FDA's decision letter, includingthe maximum numbers of U.S. subjects and investigational sites. An IDE application is approved if FDA has determined that: the sponsor has provided sufficient data to support initiation of a human clinical study; no subject protection concerns preclude initiation of the investigation; and no additional conditions must be met.\n\nFootnote 11: The authors of this paper are also referred to as FDA.\n\nIn some cases, FDA may determine that an outstanding issue remains that can be addressed with data that will be gathered concurrently with the enrollment of a portion of study subjects (i.e., staged approval, see Section 5). FDA may also inform the sponsor of recommended modifications to the study design that FDA believes will improve the study and may be necessary to enable the study to support a future marketing application (i.e., study design considerations) as well as other issues that FDA believes should be considered in preparing for a marketing application or a future clinical investigation (i.e., future considerations). These types of feedback are discussed in Section 7 of this document.\n\n4 IDE Approval with Conditions\n\nIf FDA approves an IDE application with conditions, the sponsor may begin subject enrollment upon receipt of IRB approval and in accordance with the limits described in FDA's decision letter, including the maximum numbers of U.S. subjects and investigational sites, and must submit information addressing the issues identified as conditions of approval in FDA's letter within 45 days. An IDE application is approved with conditions if FDA has determined that: the sponsor has provided sufficient data to support initiation of subject enrollment in a human clinical study; no subject protection concerns preclude initiation of subject enrollment; but additional conditions must be met to address certain outstanding issues. Previously known as \"conditional approval,\" the phrase \"approval with conditions\" is now used to convey that the outstanding issues do not raise concerns that preclude FDA from granting approval for initiation of subject enrollment in the clinical investigation. Therefore, resolution of those issues is not required prior to initiation of subject enrollment in the study, except for certain issues related to the informed consent document. If FDA identifies issues with an informed consent document, FDA's letter will specifically state that they must be addressed before enrollment begins in order to ensure that informed consent is obtained in accordance with 21 CFR Part 50 - Protection of Human Subjects.12 Outstanding issues that may lead to approval with conditions include:\n\nFootnote 12: Informed consent issues identified in an approval with conditions letter must be corrected before enrolling subjects, but can be reviewed by FDA after study enrollment begins.\n\nRequests for additional information or data involving non-clinical testing issues that do not need to be resolved prior to initiation of subject enrollment;\n\nLate-stage follow-up procedures and assessments that relate to the care of study subjects but, because they occur late in the study, can likely be addressed in response to FDA's letter prior to subjects' reaching that point in the study;\n\nMinor issues related to the informed consent document that must be corrected before initiation of subject enrollment but FDA can review after implementation;\n\nOther minor clarifications, corrections, or modifications (not related to study design) that do not need to be resolved prior to initiation of subject enrollment.\n\n3.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe sponsor must submit an amendment13 to the IDE to respond to the issues raised in FDA's approval with conditions letter within 45 days unless the sponsor has requested and FDA has granted an extension.14 For each issue identified in FDA's letter, an acceptable response provides the specific information or modification(s) FDA requested. In some cases, the sponsor may choose to provide a scientifically valid alternative to FDA's request or a scientifically valid rationale for why the information or modification(s) is not needed. FDA will inform the sponsor of its decision within 30 days from the date of receipt of the amendment. During this time, the sponsor may continue to conduct the study. If FDA determines that the issues have been adequately resolved, it will grant approval. However, if any issues remain, FDA may again grant approval with conditions and will communicate those remaining outstanding issues to the sponsor by letter. In this case, the sponsor may continue to enroll subjects in the study provided that, within 45 days, the sponsor responds to the remaining issues identified in FDA's letter. If the sponsor's response to FDA's questions raises concerns regarding subject safety, or the sponsor does not respond, FDA may take appropriate regulatory actions to protect study subjects, including placing a clinical hold15 on the study. If the study is placed on hold, no additional subjects may be enrolled, and previously enrolled study subjects should receive appropriate monitoring and treatment for their safety.\n\nFootnote 13: Beginning August 19, 2013, all submissions that respond to deficiencies from an approval with conditions or disapproval letter are designated as \u201cIDE amendments\u201d. Prior to this date, responses to approval with conditions letters were designated as \u201cIDE supplements\u201d.\n\nFootnote 14: In general, FDA will not issue an approval with conditions for issues that the agency believes will require longer than 45 days to address. If FDA identifies such issues but determines that they should not preclude initiation of subject enrollment in a study, FDA may issue a staged approval, as discussed in Section 5.\n\nFootnote 15: Section 606 of FDASIA amended section 520(g) of the FD&C Act by adding authority to place a study on \u201cclinical hold\u201d when, among other reasons established by regulation, the device involved represents an unreasonable risk to the safety of the persons who are the subjects of the clinical investigation.\n\n5 Staged Approval or Staged Approval with Conditions\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.127899646759033", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 3: 21 CFR 812.2 and 20.\n\n3 Informed Consent and IDE Decisions\n\nThe purpose of the IDE regulations, as set forth in Title 21 CFR part 812, is to encourage, to the extent consistent with the protection of public health and safety and with ethical standards, the discovery and development of useful devices intended for human use, and to maintain optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of this purpose.4 Title 21 CFR part 812 applies to all clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness with some exceptions, as described in 21 CFR 812.2(c).\n\nFootnote 4: 21 CFR 812.1.\n\nFDA approval of an IDE application prior to study initiation is typically required for a clinical investigation conducted in the U.S. of a significant risk device that is not approved or cleared for the indication being studied.5 As defined in 21 CFR 812.3(m), a significant risk device means an investigational device that:\n\nFootnote 5: See section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 812.2(b) for conditions under which an IDE application is required prior to study initiation.\n\nIs intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;\n\nIs for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or\n\nOtherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAn approved IDE application exempts the study spons from certain provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (such as certain requirements for a marketing submission and good manufacturing practice). However, IDE studies must comply with the applicable requirements set forth in 21 CFR part 812, including requirements for informed consent under 21 CFR part 50, labeling of devices for investigational use only, study monitoring, records and reporting, and approval by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with 21 CFR part 56.6\n\nFootnote 6: Section 520(g)(3) of the FD&C Act.\n\nii.1.4 Informed Consent\n\nA key tenet of FDA's IDE benefit-risk framework is appropriate protection of human subjects and a key principle of human subject protection in clinical investigations is the informed consent process.7 This process goes beyond obtaining a signature on an informed consent form. The informed consent process provides the prospective subject or his or her legally authorized representative with adequate information about the study, including pertinent information about the investigational device, its risks and benefits, alternatives, and what is expected of the subject in order to participate in the study (e.g., study visits, procedures, maintaining subject diaries).8\n\nFootnote 7: See generally, 21 CFR part 50.\n\nThe subject or his or her legally authorized representative must be given sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate in the clinical study under circumstances that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.9\n\nFootnote 8: See 21 CFR 50.25.\n\nAn informed consent process should allow an individual to decide to accept potential risks associated with a study in exchange for the potential for anticipated benefits to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained. The informed consent process allows individuals to exercise their personal tolerance of risks as weighed against other factors, including the reasonably expected benefits and the alternatives to the study.\n\nThe informed consent process ensures that each individual makes a determination about study participation after being informed of the study, including the risks and benefits of study participation, and, if applicable, the possibility of receiving no direct benefit. The informed consent regulations in 21 CFR part 50 describe the informed consent aspects of human subject protection in clinical investigations subject to FDA regulations. For example 21 CFR 50.20, states the following:\n\n_\"Except as provided in 50.23 and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.\"_In addition, 21 CFR 50.25(a)(2) states that the informed consent must include \"a description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject.\"\n\nRegulatory Standard for IDE Decisions\n\nUnder section 520(g)(4)(B) of the FD&C Act, an IDE application may only be disapproved if FDA finds that the investigation does not conform to the procedures and conditions prescribed under regulations. The purpose of the IDE process is \"to encourage, to the extent consistent with the protection of the public health and safety and with ethical standards, the discovery and development of useful devices intended for human use and to that end to maintain optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of that purpose.\"10\n\nFDA's decision-making process for IDE applications was modified with the passage of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) of 2012 (Pub. L. No. 112-144). Section 601 of FDASIA amended Section 520(g) of the FD&C Act to specify certain situations in which FDA cannot disapprove an IDE application. Section 520(g)(4)(C) of the FD&C Act states that, consistent with section 520(g)(1), FDA shall not disapprove an IDE application because:\n\nFootnote 10: Section 520(g)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nthe investigation may not support a substantial equivalence or de novo classification determination or approval of the device;\n\nthe investigation may not meet a requirement, including a data requirement, relating to the approval or clearance of a device; or\n\nan additional or different investigation may be necessary to support clearance or approval of the device.\n\nConsidering the above criteria, when the objective of a proposed study is to support a marketing submission, the sponsor may benefit from learning whether there are protocol modifications that FDA believes are needed for the study to adequately support product approval or clearance. FDA intends to convey such considerations to the sponsor to provide greater clarity and predictability. For more information, see the FDA Guidance, FDA Decisions for Investigational Device\n\nExemption (IDE) Clinical Investigations,\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocumen\n\nts/ucm279107.pdf), issued August 19, 2014 (hereinafter, FDA Decisions for IDE Guidance).\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 812.30(b), FDA may disapprove or withdraw approval of an IDE application for any of the following reasons:\n\n(1) There has been a failure to comply with any requirement of this part or the act, any other applicable regulation or statute, or any condition of approval imposed by an IRB or FDA.\n\n(2) The application or a report contains an untrue statement of a material fact, or omits material information required by this part.__(3) The sponsor fails to respond to a request for additional information within the time prescribed by FDA.\n\n(4) There is reason to believe that the risks to the subjects are not outweighed by the anticipated benefits to the subjects and the importance of the knowledge to be gained [emphasis added], or informed consent is inadequate, or the investigation is scientifically unsound, or there is reason to believe that the device as used is ineffective.\n\n(5) It is otherwise unreasonable to begin or to continue the investigation owing to the way in which the device is used or the inadequacy of:\n\n(i) The report of prior investigations or the investigational plan;\n\n(ii) The methods, facilities, and controls used for the manufacturing, processing, packaging, storage, and, where appropriate, installation of the device; or\n\n(iii) Monitoring and review of the investigation.\n\nConsistent with this regulation, FDA will generally disapprove an IDE application if potential risks of the proposed study are not justified, or if data provided are insufficient to adequately characterize the safety profile of the device such that, based on the data contained in the IDE application, human clinical investigation is not considered reasonable.\n\nThis guidance document provides greater clarity regarding regulatory assessment of:\n\nrisks and benefits associated with clinical investigational device use proposed in IDE applications;11 and\n\nFootnote 11: 21 CFR 812.30(b)(4).\n\ninadequacy or uncertainty regarding the clinical or nonclinical data from prior investigations, the proposed study, the manufacturing, transport and storage of a device, or monitoring oversight of the proposed study.12\n\nFootnote 12: 21 CFR 812.30(b)(5).\n\nTypes of IDE Decisions\n\nFDA regulations13 provide for three major categories of decision on an IDE application - approval, approval with conditions, and disapproval.\n\nFootnote 13: 21 CFR 812.30(a).\n\nIf FDA approves an IDE application the sponsor may begin subject enrollment upon receipt of IRB approval and in accordance with the limits described in FDA's decision letter, including the maximum numbers of U.S. subjects and investigational sites.

See FDA Decisions for IDE Guidance, page 10.\n\nWhere appropriate, FDA may allow additional flexibility in how outstanding issues can be addressed (i.e., future considerations, study design considerations, contingent approval, staged approval), to allow clinical investigations to commence without unnecessary delay, while ensuring that human subjects are adequately protected.14 For discussion of contingent approval, see FDA Guidance, Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) for Early Feasibility Medical Device Clinical Studies, Including Certain First in Human (FIH) Studies (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocumen ts/ucm279103.pdf), issued October 1, 2013 (hereinafter, FDA Early Feasibility Guidance).\n\nIn some cases, FDA may grant staged approval or staged approval with conditions for a portion of the planned study cohort or grant a limited number of subjects enrolled while outstanding questions that may affect the benefit-risk profile for the proposed IDE study are addressed. See FDA Decisions for IDE Guidance for more information on staged approvals, page 8.15 Staged approval permits the clinical investigation to begin in a timely manner while maintaining appropriate subject protections. Without this mitigation measure, the benefit-risk profile of the proposed investigation may not support study initiation.\n\nFootnote 14: See FDA Decisions for IDE Guidance\n\nFDA may grant approval with conditions when there are outstanding issues that do not raise concerns that preclude initiation of the proposed clinical investigation, provided that the sponsor addresses the recommended modifications to the study. Resolution of these issues is not required prior to initiation of study subject enrollment, with exception of issues related to the informed consent document, which must be addressed before enrollment begins, in accordance with 21 CFR part 50 - Protection of Human Subjects.\n\nInitial IDE application approval decisions reflect the benefit-risk profile of the proposed investigation at the time of FDA's assessment. Changes in approval status (e.g., from disapproval to approval) may be appropriate as new information becomes available which:\n\nchanges the understanding of risks and benefits or their associated level of uncertainty;\n\nchanges confidence in risk control or mitigation measures (refer to Appendix D); or\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nchanges the disease or clinical diagnostic/treatment landscape in a manner which alters the benefit-risk profile of the IDE device relative to alternatives.\n\nIf necessary, FDA may take appropriate regulatory actions to protect study subjects, including placing a clinical hold on the study. FDA can place a study on \"clinical hold\" when, taking into consideration the factors in section 520(g)(8) of the FD&C Act, the device involved represents an unreasonable risk to the safety of the persons who are the subjects of the clinical investigation. If the study is placed on hold, no additional subjects may be enrolled.\n\nStudy Design Considerations\n\nAlthough FDA will not disapprove an IDE because the investigational plan for a pivotal study may not support approval or clearance of a marketing submission in accordance with section 520(g)(4)(C) of the FD&C Act, study design has a direct bearing on the knowledge that can be gained from that study. A poorly designed study may produce evidence which leads to false conclusions that have significant negative public health implications. A poorly designed study could produce data, which are inconclusive or difficult to interpret and thereby limit the degree to which useful knowledge is generated from the study.\n\nIn contrast, well-designed studies are more likely to produce important knowledge about a device or disease. FDA believes it is most efficient, and consistent with least-burdensome principles, to encourage the conduct of studies which are designed to meet stated objectives. FDA may inform the sponsor of recommended modifications to the study design - Study Design Considerations (SDCs)16- that FDA believes will improve the quality of the information and knowledge generated by the study which the sponsor is encouraged but not required to address.\n\nFootnote 16: See FDA Decisions for IDE Guidance\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviccregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm279107.pdf) for more information on the topic of SDCs.\n\nIV. IDE APPLICATION ASSESSMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF A DEVICE DEVELOPMENT Pathway\n\nStages of Device Development\n\nWhen making IDE benefit-risk assessments, FDA considers: 1) the stage of development of the device, 2) the maturity of the proposed technology, and 3) the availability of non-clinical testing to complement or replace the need for clinical testing.\n\nFDA's Early Feasibility Guidance (page 6) defines the following device study types:\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFirst in Human (FIH): A first in human study is a type of study in which a device for a specific indication is evaluated for the first time in human subjects.\n\nEarly Feasibility: An early feasibility study is a limited clinical investigation of a device early in development, typically before the device design has been finalized, for a specific indication (e.g. innovative device for a new or established intended use, marketed device for a novel clinical application).\n\nTraditional Feasibility: A traditional feasibility study is a clinical investigation that is commonly used to capture preliminary safety and effectiveness information on a near-final or final device design to adequately plan an appropriate pivotal study.\n\nPivotal Study: A pivotal study is a clinical investigation designed to collect definitive evidence of the safety and effectiveness of a device for a specified intended use, typically in a statistically justified number of subjects.\n\nIn some cases, IDE studies may also be designed for investigation of marketed products. For example, an IDE study may be conducted to expand the indications for use or update the device labeling.\n--------------------\nContext title: Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations for Medical Device Investigational Device Exemptions Guidance for Investigational Device Exemption Sponsors, Sponsor-Investigators and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.24525785446167", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 13: See section 513(i)(1)(D)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(i)(1)(D)(i)).\n\nFootnote 14: Section 515(c)(5) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(c)(5)).\n\nFootnote 15: Section 513(i)(1)(D)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(i)(1)(D)(ii)).\n\nIn conducting premarket review of a medical device, FDA requests information that is necessary to make a determination of whether the statutory standards for marketing authorization are met in accordance with the least burdensome principle. Based on the least burdensome principle, the term \"necessary\" means that FDA considers \"the minimum required information that would support\" (1) \"a determination by [FDA] that an application provides reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device\"14 or (2) \"a determination of substantial equivalence between a new device and a predicate device.\"15Footnote 15: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidan\n\nFootnote 16: See Section 520(g) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360j(g)) and 21 CFR 812.2.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAdditional information related to how FDA intends to apply the least burdensome provisions is available in the following FDA guidances (\"Least Burdensome Guidances\") that discuss the principles with which the recommendations discussed in this guidance are consistent:\n\nThe Least Burdensome Provisions: Concept and Principles; Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, dated February 5, 2019, available at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidan\n\nDeveloping and Responding to Deficiencies in Accordance with the Least Burdensome Provisions; Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, dated September 29, 2017, available at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidan\n\nce/GuidanceDocuments/ucm073680.pdf.\n\nAvailable Premarket Pathways\n\nThe appropriate premarket submission pathway for a given medical device is determined by the risks associated with the device type as well as the level of regulatory controls necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. The available submission pathways (e.g., premarket notification (510(k)), De Novo classification (De Novo) request, Premarket Approval (PMA) Application, or Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE)) are briefly discussed in sections III.B.1-4 of this guidance.\n\nWhen clinical evidence is necessary to support marketing authorization of a medical device, an investigational device exemption (IDE) may be necessary.16 An IDE allows the investigational device to be used in a clinical study in the United States in order to collect safety and effectiveness data. An approved IDE permits a device to be shipped lawfully for the purpose of conducting investigations of the device. FDA has published numerous guidance documents related to IDEs, which can be found at: https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYour\n\nFootnote 16: Valid scientific evidence is defined as \u201cevidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience with a marketed device, from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device under its conditions of use.\u201d (21 CFR 860.7(c)(2)).\n\nThe Device/InvestigationalDeviceExemptionIDE/ucm162453.htm.\n\nAlthough a manufacturer or sponsor may submit any form of evidence to FDA in an attempt to substantiate the safety and effectiveness of a device, the Agency relies upon only valid scientific evidence17 to determine whether there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective. After considering the nature of the device and the rules in 21 CFR 860.7, the Commissioner will determine whether the evidence submitted or otherwise available to the Commissioner is valid scientific evidence for the purpose of determining the safety or effectiveness of a particular device and whether the available evidence, when taken as a whole, is adequate to support a determination that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its conditions of use.18\n\nFootnote 18: 21 CFR 860.7(c)(1).\n\n1 Premarket Notification (510(k))\n\nIf FDA has previously cleared through a 510(k) or granted a De Novo request for another device of the same type (i.e., a legally-marketed predicate device),19 as a new device, a 510(k) is typically the appropriate pathway for the new device.20 Additional information on the 510(k) Program can be found in the guidance document entitled \"The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications [510(k)]; Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,\" dated July 28, 2014, available at https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm284443.pdf.\n\nFootnote 19: Under 21 CFR 807.92(a)(3), a legally marketed predicate is a device that: (1) was legally marketed in the United States prior to May 28, 1976 (preamendments device) and for which a PMA is not required; or (2) has been reclassified from Class III to II or I; or (iii) has been found substantially equivalent (SE) though the 510(k) process.\n\nFootnote 20: See section 510(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360(k)), and 21 CFR Part 807 Subpart E.\n\nFootnote 21: Section 513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(f)(1)).\n\nFootnote 22: FDA may decline to undertake a De Novo request if the conditions set forth in section 513(f)(2)(A)(iv) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(f)(2)(A)(iv)) are met.\n\n2 De Novo Classification Request\n\nDevices of a new type that FDA has not previously classified based on the criteria at section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(a)(1)) are 'automatically' or'statutorily' classified into Class III.21 However, if the device appears, based on what is known about the device, to meet the statutory standards for classification into Class I or II under section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act, (i.e., general controls or general and special controls would provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device), the device may be eligible for De Novo classification.22 If the requester demonstrates that the device meets the statutory standards for classification into Class I or II under section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act, i.e., that general controls, or a combination of general controls and special controls, are sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, FDA will grant the De Novo request and issue a written order classifying the specific device and device type in Class I or Class II.\n\nFootnote 21: Section 513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(f)(1)).\n\nAdditional information on the De Novo Program can be found in the guidance document entitled \"De Novo Classification Process (Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation); Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,\"\n\ndated October 30, 2017, available at\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Gui\n\ndanceDocuments/ucm080197.pdf.\n\n3 Premarket Approval Application\n\nPremarket approval (PMA) is required before most Class III devices can be marketed.23 A PMA application must demonstrate a \"reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness\" by \"weighing any probable benefit to health from the use of the device against any probable risk of injury or illness from such use,\" among other relevant factors.24 To aid in this process, PMA applicants submit valid scientific evidence, including one or more clinical investigations where appropriate, which FDA reviews to determine whether \"the device will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling of the device.\"25\n\nFootnote 23: See section 513(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(a)(1)(C)).\n\nFootnote 24: See sections 513(a)(2), 515(d)(1)(A), and 515(d)(2)(A)-(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(a)(2), 360c(d)(1)(A) and (d)(2)(A)-(B)); see also 21 CFR 860.7(b), (d), and (e).\n\nFootnote 25: Section 513(a)(3)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(a)(3)(A)).\n\nFor information regarding PMAs, see FDA's guidance entitled \"Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications,\" dated August 24, 2016.

Available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulation andguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm313368.pdf.\n\n4 Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE)\n\nAn HDE provides a regulatory path for devices that are intended to benefit patients with rare diseases or conditions. To be eligible for an HDE, a device must first be designated as a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD).26 Additional information about the HUD designation process can be found in the draft guidance document entitled \"Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Program; Draft Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,\" dated June 13, 2018,\"27 available at https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm389275.pdf.\n--------------------\nContext title: Evaluation of Devices Used with Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapies Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.745684802532196", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: With reference to FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What statute and regulations apply to medical device clinical investigations?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 16: See 60 Fed. Reg. at 63589.\n\nDevices under Investigational Device Exemption (IDE)\n\n10.1 I'm a US manufacturer of a device that has been cleared or approved for marketing in the US, and is also being studied under an approved IDE. What are the requirements for reporting an event involving the investigational use of the marketed device?\n\nIf a device is legally marketed in the US and is also under an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) [21 CFR part 812], any adverse events that involve the investigational use of the marketed device are subject to reporting under both the IDE regulation and the MDR regulation. An individual who manufactures devices intended for use in humans solely for this person's use in research, that are not for sale, and who may be subject to alternative reporting requirements under the IDE regulations is exempt from MDR reporting requirements [21 CFR 803.19(a)(2)]. However, there is no exception to MDR reportable events under 21 CFR part 803 for devices that are marketed lawfully in the US and that are also used under an IDE. Further, there is no exception to unanticipated adverse device effect reporting under 21 CFR part 812 for \"unanticipated adverse device effects\"17 associated with marketed devices that may be used as a control. Thus, certain events may be reportable under both IDE and MDR regulations.\n\nFootnote 17: See 21 CFR 812.3(s) for definition of \u201cunanticipated adverse device effect.\u201d\n\nForeign Events\n\n11.1 Does the MDR regulation apply to devices that are legally exported by US manufacturers to foreign locations if the device is not cleared or approved for marketing in the US?\n\nIf you manufacture a device that is exported under section 801(e) or 802 of the FD&C Act, you are subject to the MDR regulation as a manufacturer [21 CFR 803.1]. Failure to submit required reports is a prohibited act [section 301(q) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(q)]. Therefore, manufacturers exporting devices under section 801(e) or 802 of the FD&C Act are required to comply with 21 CFR part 803, including the requirements for written MDR procedures [21 CFR 803.17], MDR files or records [21 CFR 803.18], and MDR reporting requirements [21 CFR 803.10(c)]. However, FDA generally does not intend to enforce the MDR reporting requirements for those devices exported under section 801(e) or 802 of the FD&C Act, except under certain circumstances. The circumstances under which FDA generally intends to enforce the MDR reporting requirements for such devices includes situations where there has been a device concern identified that necessitates that FDA have information about exported device adverse events. When such a device issue is identified, FDA expects to notify the affected manufacturer(s) regarding the submission of MDR reports for their exported devices.\n\nI'm a US manufacturer of a device that has not been cleared or approved for marketing in the US, although the device is being studied in the US under an approved IDE. Is an event involving my device that occurred outside the US reportable under MDR in this situation?\n\nIf you manufacture a device domestically that is exported under section 801(e) or 802 of the FD&C Act, you are considered a manufacturer and are thus subject to the MDR regulation [21 CFR 803.1]. Failure to submit required reports is a prohibited act [section 301(q) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(q)]. Therefore, manufacturers exporting devices under section 801(e) or 802 of the FD&C Act are required to comply with 21 CFR part 803, including the requirements for written MDR procedures [21 CFR 803.17], MDR files or records [21 CFR 803.18], and MDR reporting requirements [21 CFR 803.10(c)]. However, FDA generally does not intend to enforce the MDR reporting requirements for those devices exported under section 801(e) or 802 of the FD&C Act, except under certain circumstances. The circumstances under which FDA generally intends to enforce the MDR reporting requirements for such devices includes situations where there has been a device concern identified that necessitates that FDA have information about exported device adverse events. When such a device issue is identified, FDA expects to notify the affected manufacturer(s) regarding the submission of MDR reports for their exported devices.\n\nThe adverse event that occurs outside the US should be reported to the IDE program in accordance with [21 CFR part 812].\n\nI'm a foreign manufacturer of a device that has been cleared or approved in the US and is also lawfully marketed in a foreign country. If an adverse event occurs in a foreign country with the device, must the event in the foreign country be reported under the MDR regulation?\n\nYes, FDA considers an event that occurs in a foreign country reportable under the MDR regulation if it involves a device that has been cleared or approved in the US - or a device similar to a device marketed by the manufacturer that has been cleared or approved in the US - and is also lawfully marketed in a foreign country. Devices may be manufactured to slightly modified specifications to meet standards in different countries. If these changes do not substantially alter the performance of the device, then any device eventsthat are MDR reportable events relating to such modified devices should be reported under the MDR regulation (see section 2.14 of this guidance).\n\n11.4 I'm a foreign manufacturer of a device that has not been cleared or approved for marketing in the US, although the device is being studied in the US under an approved IDE. Is an event involving my device that occurred outside the US reportable under MDR in this situation?\n\nNo, you would not be required to submit MDR reports for events occurring in other countries for a device that is manufactured in a foreign country and that is not cleared or approved for marketing in the US. However, if you become aware of information that reasonably suggests a device has malfunctioned and that a similar device that you market in the US would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur, then you should report the device malfunction that occurred outside the US.\n\nAn adverse event that occurs outside the US should be reported to the IDE program in accordance with 21 CFR part 812.\n\nManufacturer ceased Marketing a Device\n\n12.1 If I previously marketed a device that is still in commercial distribution, but have ceased manufacturing the device, do I still have an obligation to submit MDR reportable events?\n\nYes, as long as you remain in business, you have an obligation to report events involving any device that you manufactured, even if you cease marketing the device. See also 4.12.2.\n\n12.2 Firm A manufactured and distributed a device that was cleared for marketing under its 510(k), but later sold the 510(k) to another firm (Firm B). Who should submit the MDR reports for adverse events that involve the devices that Firm A manufactured?\n\nAlthough Firm B is responsible for reporting adverse events for the devices it manufactures after it purchases the 510(k), Firm A remains obligated to report adverse events for the devices it manufactured. The packaging and labeling for the devices Firm A manufactured would identify Firm A as the manufacturer with corresponding address and contact information. If Firm B agrees to assume responsibility for reporting MDRs for the devices manufactured by Firm A, this arrangement should be documented with a written agreement between the two firms. Firm A should also request an exemption from FDA to end its MDR reporting obligation for the devices it manufactured. This guidance also applies when a firm transfers ownership of the PMA for a device. (See 2.27 of this guidance for information on requesting an exemption.)\n\nMedical Intervention\n\n13.1 If a health care provider notices that a medical device is malfunctioning (i.e., not performing as intended) and intervenes before the malfunctioning device can harm the patient (i.e., can cause or contribute to a serious injury or death), is this reportable?\n\nThe event would be reportable as a malfunction if the malfunction would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. If the device malfunctions but the user intervenes before there is any harm to the patient, the event should be reported as a malfunction if the manufacturer concludes that the malfunction is likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction returned. Your investigation of the event should also confirm and document that in this instance; the device malfunction did not cause or contribute to any change in the patient's condition that would be considered a reportable serious injury (see section 2.13 of this guidance for the definition of \"serious injury\").\n\nPatient Information\n\n14.1 It is very difficult to obtain patient information due to patient confidentiality in the health care setting. Is this information always necessary?\n\nIt is necessary to attempt to obtain the patient information required by 21 CFR 803.52, including patient identification, especially if the event involved a death or serious injury. However, we request that the patient be identified only by code, not by an actual patient name.18 This will protect the privacy of the patient. Other required information about the patient (e.g., age, gender, and weight) generally can be provided without affecting patient confidentiality.\n\nFootnote 18: See Instructions for FDA Form 3500A \u2013 Section A: Patient Information, A1: Patient identifier.\n\nExactly what constitutes an MDR reportable event involving my radiation therapy device where there was incorrect treatment but no demonstrable patient injury?\n--------------------\nContext title: Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.475675344467163"], "Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency? If yes, can CDER be notified in an annual report?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency? If yes, can CDER be notified in an annual report?\n--------------------\nContext: Q4:: A packaging site will be added that will enclose two sample cartons, along with some promotional material, into a larger carton or box preprinted with the product name:\n\nDoes the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency? If yes, can CDER be notified in an annual report?\n\nIs the tertiary site held to the same CGMP requirements as a secondary site? For example, if a tertiary site should be submitted to the agency, and this site has not had any CGMP inspection within the last two years, is this change still annual reportable?\n\nA4: The guidance only distinguishes between primary and secondary packaging sites. The site described would be considered a secondary packaging site. CGMP requirements extend beyond packaging and repackaging operations that involve direct product contact. For example, a site must register with FDA (21 CFR Part 207) and is subject to CGMP inspection (21 CFR Part 211) when the site is used to attach inserts, or in the case of a cartoning site, when cartons contain product labels. If registration and/or inspection are required for the site of this secondary packaging operation, CDER should be notified of the different site (via the application). The site should have a satisfactory inspection relating to packaging operations for notification to occur in the annual report. For the purposes of this guidance, in general, there is no two-year limit on the CGMP inspection (see Manufacturing Sites Q10). If registration and inspection are not required for the site of this secondary packaging operation, the applicant need not notify CDER of the site. If you have any questions on whether this packaging operation is subject to FDA registration or inspection, you should contact the appropriate CDER inspection and/or compliance staff for advice.\n\nQ5:: Certain changes relating to contract sterilization sites for packaging components can be reported in an annual report (section VI.D.4). Does this also apply to applicant owned sites?\n\nA5: Yes. Whether the sterilization site is applicant- or contractor-owned, a change to a different sterilization site for packaging components can be reported in an annual report when the process is not materially different from the process described in the approved application, and the facility has a satisfactory CGMP inspection for the type of operation that is being performed.\n\nQ6:: Should a prior approval supplement be submitted for a change in the sterilization site for a primary packaging component of a metered dose inhaler?\n\nA6: The change can be reported in an annual report as long as the process is not materially different from that provided for in the approved application and as long as the facility has a satisfactory CGMP inspection for the type of operation being performed (section VI.D.4)\n\nQ7: If an intermediate or starting material is also a drug substance, would the recommendations on reporting site changes for intermediates or drug substances apply?\n\nA7: If a drug substance is used as an intermediate in a drug substance manufacturing process, the guidance on intermediates would apply. This assumes that the material has been classified appropriately as an intermediate (see relevant definitions in the glossary of the guidance). CDER traditionally does not consider a drug substance to be a starting material.\n\nQ8: Do the recommendations for manufacturing site changes apply to manufacturing sites outside the United States as long as the site has a satisfactory CGMP inspection for the type of operation that will be moved?\n\nA8: Yes. The recommendations in the guidance apply to domestic and foreign manufacturing sites.\n\nQ9: The site where the certificates of analysis and regulatory documentation are reviewed prior to commercial distribution of the product will be relocated. Should this site change be reported in the application?\n\nA9: A change in the site where GMP support paperwork operations occur need not be reported in the application.\n\nQ10: The guidance (section VI.B.2) states that a manufacturing site change should be submitted in a prior approval supplement if the new manufacturing site does not have a satisfactory CGMP inspection for the type of operation being moved. In previous guidances it was stated that a satisfactory CGMP inspection within the last two years was needed. Should a prior approval supplement be used if the new facility has a satisfactory CGMP inspection for the type of operation being moved, but the inspection occurred more than two years ago?\n\nA10: For the purposes of the guidance, there is no time limit on the satisfactory CGMP inspection unless the type of operation was discontinued (section VI.B.1).\n\nQ11: What is the reporting category for a change to a different manufacturing site for an excipient?\n\nA11: CDER need not be notified of this type of change.\n\nQ12: What is the recommended reporting category for the addition of a new aseptic filling line for sterile products?* The addition of a new aseptic filling line should be reported in a prior approval supplement (section VI.B.4).\n* Why does the guidance exclude drug substance intermediates when referring to satisfactory CGMP inspections?\n* Section 510(a)(2)(B) of the Act requires that all drugs be manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs. No distinction is made between the manufacture of drug substance and drug product. Although the CGMP regulations under 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 apply only to drug products, FDA expects appropriate CGMPs to be applied to all steps of a drug substance manufacturing process beginning with the use of starting materials. The types of sites identified in the guidance are routinely subject to FDA inspection with the exception of those facilities or establishments used to manufacture or process drug substance intermediates. Drug substance intermediate manufacturing or processing sites are not exempt from inspection, but an inspection is generally discretionary. Moreover, this type of facility is always subject to for cause inspection. Because drug substance intermediate sites are not routinely inspected, a satisfactory CGMP inspection was not included as a condition for submitting the change in a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected in 30 Days or annual report. However, when a drug substance intermediate manufacturing or processing site has been inspected and the CGMP inspection was not satisfactory, the change in site should be submitted as a prior approval supplement.\n\nManufacturing Process\n\nAn applicant intends to add a coarse screen to the opening of a blender, through which all individual components of a granulation would pass prior to granulation. The applicant asks whether this could be considered a change in a control which would be reportable in a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected under section VII.C.2.a of the guidance.\n\nThis change is not considered a change in control but an additional step in the manufacturing process. However, it is not considered a fundamental change in the manufacturing process. This type of change should be reported in a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected in 30 Days (section VII.C.1.a).\n\nCan changes in mixing steps and elimination of a mixing step be reported in an annual report if these changes are implemented prior to the manufacture of validation batches?\n\nThe timing of the postapproval change (i.e., pre- or post validation batches) does not affect the recommended reporting category. The type of change should be submitted in either a Supplement -- Changes Being Effected in 30 Days (e.g., VIII.C.1.a.) or prior approval supplement (e.g., VII.B.1) depending on the specifics of each situation such as the type of dosage form.\n\nWhat is the recommended reporting category for a drug product (immediate release solid oral dosage form) scale change beyond 10 times the size of the biobatch? If the change is annual reportable, should the information identified in SUPAC-IR3 for a Level 1 scale change be submitted?\n\nAll changes in the scale of the nonprotein drug product manufacturing batches can be reported in an annual report (see section VII.D.1.a).4 However, if the scale change results in other changes (e.g., equipment, process), the change would be considered a multiple change, and the recommended reporting category should be the most restrictive of those for any of the individual changes (section XII). Recommendations on scale changes for protein drug products are included in section VII.C.1.c and VII.D.1.a of the guidance. Footnote 4: The reporting categories in the Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA guidance supersede those recommended in SUPAC guidances where there are inconsistencies. Therefore, the recommendations in SUPAC-IR that certain scale changes be submitted in supplements are superseded.\n\nSPECifications\n\nQ1: How should a revision of an analytical procedure be reported to allow for the use of a company (i.e., secondary) standard in addition to the U. S. Pharmacopeia (USP) standard?\n\nA1: The revision of an analytical procedure to allow the option to use a secondary standard should be reported in an annual report. Also, the laboratory reference standards used must comply with CGMP regulations (e.g., 21 CFR 211.194(c)). Q2: How should a decrease in the fill volume be reported?\n\nA2: A change in the fill volume of a drug product involves a change to the specification and must be submitted in a prior approval supplement unless exempted by regulation or guidance (506A(c)(2)(A) of the Act). There is no exemption for this type of specification change; therefore, a prior approval supplement should be submitted. Q3: What reporting category should be used if a USP HPLC assay procedure replaces, or is used in addition to, a microbiological assay that is listed in the approved specification as the regulatory analytical procedure?\n--------------------\nContext title: Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 8.383594512939453", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency?

This guidance document represents the Agency\u2019s current thinking on container closure systems for the packaging of human drugs and biological products. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.\n\nContainer Closure Systems for Packaging Human Drugs and Biologics\n\nChministry, Manufacturing, and Controls Documentation\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis document is intended to provide guidance on general principles2 for submitting information on packaging materials used for human drugs and biologics.3 This guidance supersedes the FDA Guideline for Submitting Documentation for Packaging for Human Drugs and Biologics, issued in February 1987 and the packaging policy statement issued in a letter to industry dated June 30, 1995 from the Office of Generic Drugs.4 This guidance is not intended to describe the information that should be provided about packaging operations associated with drug product manufacture.\n\nFootnote 2: In general, this guidance does not suggest specific test methods and acceptance criteria (except for references to The United States Pharmacopia methods), nor does it suggest comprehensive lists of tests. These details should be determined based on good scientific principles for each specific container closure system for particular drug product formulations, dosage forms, and routes of administration. Acceptance criteria should be based on actual data for particular packaging components and container closure systems, and they should be set to ensure batch-to-batch uniformity of packaging components.\n\nApproaches which differ from those described in this guidance may be followed, but the applicant is encouraged to discuss significant variations in advance with the appropriate CDER chemistry review staff or CBER review staff. This is to prevent applicants or sponsors from spending unnecessary time and effort in preparing a submission that the FDA may later determine to be unacceptable.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) mandates the need for adequate information related to packaging materials. Section 501(a)(3) of the Act states that a drug is deemed to be adulterated \"if its container is composed, in whole or in part, of any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the contents injurious to health....\" In addition, section 502 of the Act states that a drug is considered misbranded if there are packaging omissions. Also, section 505 of the Act requires a full description of the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the packaging of drugs (see Attachment A).\n\nSection 505(b)(1)(D) of the Act states that an application shall include a full description of the methods used in, the manufacturing, processing and packing of such drug. This includes facilities and controls used in the packaging a drug product.\n\nDefinitions5\n\nFootnote 5: These definitions are intended to clarify the use of certain terms in this guidance only and are not intended to supersede the definitions of container and package as provided for in 21 CFR 600.3.\n\nMaterials of construction6 refer to the substances (e.g., glass, high density polyethylene (HDPE) resin, metal) used to manufacture a packaging component.\n\nFootnote 6: This term is used in a general sense for the basic material, which should be defined in the application in terms of its specific chemical composition for a given drug application (e.g., the specific polymer and any additives used to make the material).\n\nA packaging component means any single part of a container closure system. Typical components are containers (e.g., ampules, vials, bottles), container liners (e.g., tube liners), closures (e.g., screw caps, stoppers), closure liners, stopper overseas, container inner seals, administration ports (e.g., on large-volume parenteral (LVPs)), overwraps, administration accessories, and container labels. A primary packaging component means a packaging component that is or may be in direct contact with the dosage form. A secondary packaging component means a packaging component that is not and will not be in direct contact with the dosage form.\n\nA container closure system refers to the sum of packaging components that together contain and protect the dosage form. This includes primary packaging components and secondary packaging components, if the latter are intended to provide additional protection to the drug product. A packaging system is equivalent to a container closure system.\n\nA package or market package7 refers to the container closure system and labeling, associated components (e.g., dosing cups, droppers, spoons), and external packaging (e.g., cartons or shrink wrap). A market package is the article provided to a pharmacist or retail customer upon purchase and does not include packaging used solely for the purpose of shipping such articles.\n\nFootnote 7: The materials of construction used in the labeling are a concern from a packaging perspective if they affect the protection and/or safety of the drug product.\n\nQuality refers to the physical, chemical, microbiological, biological, bioavailability, and stability attributes that a drug product should maintain if it is to be deemed suitable for therapeutic or diagnostic use. In this guidance, the term is also understood to convey the properties of safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity (see 21 CFR 211.94(a)).\n\nAn extraction profile refers to the analysis (usually by chromatographic means) of extracts obtained from a packaging component. A quantitative extraction profile is one in which the amount of each detected substance is determined.\n\nCGMP, CPSC and USP Requirements on Containers and Closures\n\nCurrent good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements for the control of drug product containers and closures are included in 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211. A listing of the relevant sections is provided in Attachment A. In addition, a listing of Compliance Policy Guides that deal with packaging issues is provided in Attachment B. References in this guidance to CGMP regulations are provided for completeness. For additional information, refer to the FDA Compliance Program Guidance Manual for Pre-Approval Inspections/Investigations (7346.832) which describes specific responsibilities for CDER scientists and for field investigators.\n\nThe FDA requirement for tamper-resistant closures is included in 21 CFR 211.132 and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) requirements for child-resistant closures are included in 16 CFR 1700. An outline of these and other applicable regulatory requirements is provided in Attachment A.\n--------------------\nContext title: Container Closure Systems for Packaging Human Drugs and Biologics Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.466750144958496", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Does the information about the tertiary packaging site need to be submitted to the agency?

Transmittal Letters\n\nTop 0\n\nOriginal Submissions\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/drug-master-files-guidelines\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\nI Introduction\n\nA Drug Master File (DMF) is a submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that may be used to provide confidential detailed information about facilities, processes, or articles used in the manufacturing, processing, packaging, and storing of one or more human drugs. The submission of a DMF is not required by law or FDA regulation. A DMF is submitted solely at the discretion of the holder. The information contained in the DMF may be used to support an Investigational New Drug Application (IND), a New Drug Application (NDA), an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA), another DMF, an Export Application, or amendments and supplements to any of these.\n\nA DMF is NOT a substitute for an IND, NDA, ANDA, or Export Application. It is not approved or disapproved. Technical contents of a DMF are reviewed only in connection with the review of an IND, NDA, ANDA, or an Export Application.\n\nThis guideline does not impose mandatory requirements (21 CFR 10.90(b)). It does, however, offer guidance on acceptable approaches to meeting regulatory requirements. Different approaches may be followed, but the applicant is encouraged to discuss significant variations in advance with FDA reviewers to preclude spending time and effort in preparing a submission that FDA may later determine to be unacceptable.\n\nDrug Master Files are provided for in 21 CFR 314.420. This guideline is intended to provide DMF holders with procedures acceptable to the agency for preparing and submitting a DMF. The guideline discusses types of DMF's, the information needed in each type, the format of submissions to a DMF, the administrative procedures governing review of DMF's, and the obligations of the DMF holder.\n\nDMF's are generally created to allow a party other than the holder of the DMF to reference material without disclosing to that party the contents of the file. When an applicant references its own material, the applicant should reference the information contained in its own IND, NDA, or ANDA directly rather than establishing a new DMF.\n\nII Definitions\n\nFor the purposes of this guideline, the following definitions apply:\n\nAgency means the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAgent or representative means any person who is appointed by a DMF holder to serve as the contact for the holder.\n\nApplicant means any person who submits an application or abbreviated application or an amendment or supplement to them to obtain FDA approval of a new drug or an antibiotic drug and any other person who owns an approved application (21 CFR 314.3 (b)).\n\nIII. Types of Drug Master Files\n\nThere are five types of DMF's:\n\nType I Manufacturing Site, Facilities, Operating Procedures, and Personnel\n\nType II Drug Substance, Drug Substance Intermediate, and Material Used in Their Preparation, or Drug Product\n\nType III Packaging Material\n\nType IV Excipient, Colorant, Flavor, Essence, or Material Used in Their Preparation\n\nType V FDA Accepted Reference Information\n\nEach DMF should contain only one type of information and all supporting data. See Section IV.C of the guideline for more detailed descriptions of the kind of information desired in each type. Supporting information and data in a DMF can be cross referenced to any other DMF (see Part V).\n\n(\\blacktriangle) Top 0\n\nIV Submissions to Drug Master Files\n\nEach DMF submission should contain a transmittal letter, administrative information about the submission, and the specific information to be included in the DMF as described in this section.\n\nThe DMF must be in the English language. Whenever a submission contains information in another language, an accurate certified English translation must also be included.\n\nEach page of each copy of the DMF should be dated and consecutively numbered. An updated table of contents should be included with each submission.\n\nIV A. Transmittal Letters\n\nThe following should be included:\n\nIV. A.1. Original Submissions\n\na. Identification of submission: Original, the type of DMF as classified in Section III, and its subject.\n\nb. Identification of the applications, if known, that the DMF is intended to support, including the name and address of each sponsor, applicant, or holder, and all relevant document numbers.\n\nc. Signature of the holder or the authorized representative.\n\nd. Typewritten name and title of the signer.\n\nIV. A. 2. Amendments\n\na. Identification of submission: Amendment, the DMF number, type of DMF, and the subject of the amendment.\n\nb. A description of the purpose of submission, e.g., update, revised formula, or revised process.\n\nc. Signature of the holder or the authorized representative.\n\nd. Typewritten name and title of the signer.\n\nIV. B. Administrative Information\n\nAdministrative information should include the following:\n\nIV. B.1. Original Submissions\n\na. Names and addresses of the following:\n\nTop 023.8.25.5.71:14 (1) DMF holder. (2) Corporate headquarters. (3) Manufacturing/processing facility. (4) Contact for FDA correspondence. (5) Agent(s), if any. b. The specific responsibilities of each person listed in any of the categories in Section a. c. Statement of commitment. A signed statement by the holder certifying that the DMF is current and that the DMF holder will comply with the statements made in it.\n\nIV B2. Amendments\n\na. Name of DMF holder. b. DMF number. c. Name and address for correspondence. d. Affected section and/or page numbers of the DMF. e. The name and address of each person whose IND, NDA, ANDA, DMF, or Export Application relies on the subject of the amendment for support. f. The number of each IND, NDA, ANDA, DMF, and Export Application that relies on the subject of the amendment for support, if known. g. Particular items within the IND, NDA, ANDA, DMF, and Export Application that are affected, if known.\n\nIV. C. Drug Master File Contents\n\nIV. C.1. Types of Drug Master Files\n\nIV. C.1.a. Type I: Manufacturing Site, Facilities, Operating Procedures, and Personnel\n\nA Type I DMF is recommended for a person outside of the United States to assist FDA in conducting on site inspections of their manufacturing facilities. The DMF should describe the manufacturing site, equipment capabilities, and operational layout.\n\nA Type I DMF is normally not needed to describe domestic facilities, except in special cases, such as when a person is not registered and not routinely inspected.\n\nThe description of the site should include acreage, actual site address, and a map showing its location with respect to the nearest city. An aerial photograph and a diagram of the site may be helpful.\n\nA diagram of major production and processing areas is helpful for understanding the operational layout. Major equipment should be described in terms of capabilities, application, and location. Make and model would not normally be needed unless the equipment is new or unique.\n\nA diagram of major corporate organizational elements, with key manufacturing, quality control, and quality assurance positions highlighted, at both the manufacturing site and corporate headquarters, is also helpful.\n\nIV. C.1.b.Type II: Drug Substance, Drug Substance Intermediate, and Material Used in Their Preparation, or Drug Product\n\nA Type II DMF should, in general, be limited to a single drug intermediate, drug substance, drug product, or type of material used in their preparation.\n\nIV. C.1.b.(1) Drug Substance Intermediates, Drug Substances, and Material Used in Their Preparation\n\nSummarize all significant steps in the manufacturing and controls of the drug intermediate or substance. Detailed guidance on what should be included in a Type II DMF for drug substances and intermediates may be found in the following guidelines:\n\nGuideline for Submitting Supporting Documentation in Drug Applications for the Manufacture of Drug Substances.\n\nGuideline for the Format and Content of the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Section of an Application.\n\nIV. C.1.b.(2) Drug Product\n\nManufacturing procedures and controls for finished dosage forms should ordinarily be submitted in an IND, NDA, ANDA, or Export Application.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis document provides guidance intended to assist those parties responsible for complying with the Reportable Food Registry requirements prescribed by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L110-085). As required by section 1005(f) of this law, in September 2009, FDA issued guidance to industry about submitting reports of instances of reportable food through the electronic portal and providing notifications to other persons in the supply chain of such articles of food. This guidance document provides further guidance to industry on submitting a single reportable food report to FDA covering reportable food located at more than one of a company's facilities.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nOn September 27, 2007, the President signed into law the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA). This law amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) by creating a new section 417, Reportable Food Registry. Section 417 requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) to establish within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a Reportable Food Registry. The congressionally-identified purpose of the Reportable Food Registry is to provide a \"reliable mechanism to track patterns of adulteration in food [which] would support efforts by the Food and Drug Administration to target limited inspection resources to protect the public health\" (Pub. L110-085, section 1005(a)(4)). The Secretary has delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs the responsibility for administering the FD&C Act, including section 417. To further the development of the Reportable Food Registry, section 417 of the FD&C Act requires FDA to establish an electronic portal by which instances of reportable food must be submitted to FDA by responsible parties and may be submitted by public health officials. After receipt of reports through the electronic portal, FDA is requiredto review and assess the information submitted for purposes of identifying reportable food, submitting entries to the Reportable Food Registry, issuing an alert or notification as FDA deems necessary, and exercising other existing food safety authorities under this Act to protect the public health.\n\nThis guidance document contains a question and answer addressing the circumstance where reportable food is located at more than one of a company's facilities. In September 2009, FDA issued a related guidance document entitled \"Questions and Answers Regarding the Reportable Food Registry as Established by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007.(/food/guidance-documents-regulatory-information-topic/guidance-industry-questions-and-answers-regarding- reportable-food-registry-established-food-and-drug).\"\n\n3 Questions and Answers\n\nQ. My company determined that it has a reportable food and the food is located at more than one of our facilities. Can my company submit one combined report that includes all of the information that would be submitted in separate reports from each facility?\n\nA. Yes, you may submit a combined report for a specific reportable food situation that involves more than one of your facilities, such as manufacturing and processing facilities, storage facilities, and/or distribution facilities. The owner, operator, or agent in charge of each facility may authorize an individual to submit a combined report on their behalf through the Reportable Food electronic portal, in lieu of each responsible party for each facility submitting a separate reportable food report for the specific reportable food. The combined report must include all of the required data elements.\n\nTo complete the screens in the Reportable Food electronic portal, the authorized individual may provide the required information for only one of the facilities. The required information relating to all of the facilities, which may also include the facility for which the screens were completed, may be provided in a separate attachment in tabular or spreadsheet format, but should be provided in a manner that clearly associates each facility with the required information that is specific for that facility.\n\nThe following file types are supported as attachments:\n\nPortable document format.\n\nImage file format.\n\nTagged image file format.\n\nRich text format.\n\nText format.\n\nSpreadsheet file format.\n\nWord processing document formats.\n\nWord processing document format.\n\nIf using a tabular or spreadsheet format, FDA recommends that responsible parties use the following column headings, in the order listed, for the required (*) and optional information for each facility:\n\nName of facility*\n\nFood facility registration number*\n\nContact name\n\nContact phone number\n\nStreet address*\n\nCity*\n\nState*\n\nZip code*Related Information\n* Reportable Food Registry_Guidance Documents & Regulatory_Information (/food/guidance-documents-regulatory-information-topic-food-and-dietary-supplements/reportable-food-registry-guidance-documents-regulatory-information)\n\n1.1.

The suitability petition must be approved by FDA before the ANDA is submitted.39 For an ANDA based on an approved petition under 21 CFR 10.30 or 314.93, the name of the RLD in section 1.12.11 must be the same as the listed drug in the petition, and section 1.12.11 must contain the FDA docket number for the petition and a copy of FDA's correspondence approving the suitability petition.40 When an applicant submits a petitioned ANDA, the basis for submission is the RLD and the approved suitability petition. Section 1.12.11 should contain (1) the name of the RLD, which must be the same as the listed drug identified in the approved suitability petition, (2) a reference to the suitability petition's FDA-assigned document number, and (3) a copy of FDA's correspondence approving the suitability petition.41({}^{,})42 When an ANDA applicant seeks approval of a generic drug that is a duplicate of adrug product in an approved petitioned ANDA (and for which the same drug has not been approved under section 505(c) of the FD&C Act), the basis for submission is the RLD and the approved suitability petition. Section 1.12.11 should contain: (1) the RLD, which must be the same as the listed drug identified in the approved suitability petition, and RLD application number; (2) a reference to the suitability petition's FDA-assigned docket number; and (3) a copy of FDA's correspondence approving the suitability petition. The first petitioned ANDA approved should be used for and identified in the appropriate sections of a subsequent ANDA as the reference standard.

The signed and dated pathology report (raw data)4 is critical in facilitating a thorough review of the toxicologic potential of a specific investigational product.\n\nFootnote 4: The final rule, \u201cGood Laboratory Practice Regulations,\u201d published September 4, 1987 (21 CFR Part 58).\n\nTesting facility management should implement appropriate measures to ensure that the conduct of all phases of GLP toxicology studies, including the generation of the pathology report, is free from undue influence impacting the conclusions of the studies. Regarding pathology peer review, the independence of both the study pathologist and the peer-review pathologist(s) throughout the process should be ensured by both the management of the nonclinical testing facility and the sponsor or the applicant. Measures to ensure transparency can include, among other options, the implementation of an audit trail, or conducting contemporaneous peer review after the study pathologist's diagnoses are fixed or locked in an electronic system.\n\nDiverging diagnoses, interpretations, or conclusions between the study pathologist and peer-review pathologist(s) should be addressed using a transparent and unbiased process that is clearly described in written procedures (see Q9).\n\nQ9: How are differences in interpretation that result from pathology peer review addressed?\n\nA9: If no resolution of differences in diagnoses and interpretations can be reached during pathology peer review, the study pathologist and peer-review pathologist should carefully follow a transparent and unbiased process that is clearly described in written procedures (i.e., SOPs, study protocol, or study protocol amendment) for addressing diagnostic and interpretative differences during pathology peer review.\n\nDepending upon the directives of the written procedures, consensus could be achieved through consultation with additional experienced pathologists (e.g., PWG). Records of communications pertinent to differences of opinion relevant to the pathology peer review, including but not limited to records of meetings (e.g., meeting minutes), should be retained in the study file. Adherence to written procedures should be documented. Consensus diagnoses and interpretations should be documented in a report (e.g., PWG report) separate from the study pathologist's report and should be appended to the final study report.\n--------------------\nContext title: Pathology Peer Review in Nonclinical Toxicology Studies- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.616940498352051", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n--------------------\nContext: III Questions and Answers\n\nQ1: What constitutes pathology peer review?\n\nA1: Pathology peer review is the process by which the diagnoses and interpretations of the pathologist assigned to a study (study pathologist) are subjected to review by one or more peer-review pathologist(s) or a PWG. Pathology peer review can help to ensure the quality and accuracy of histopathological diagnoses and interpretations.\n\nCausal discussions, opinion exchange, and mentoring among pathologists do not constitute pathology peer review and are not covered by this guidance document.\n\nQ2: Who should conduct a pathology peer review?\n\nA2: A peer-review pathologist should have a combination of appropriate education, training, and experience to be qualified to render opinions on the study pathologist's histological descriptions. It can be beneficial for a peer-review pathologist to have experience with the route of administration, contact type and duration of the test article, species and strains of animals being tested, and duration and design of the study. It can also be beneficial for a peer-review pathologist to have knowledge of the mechanism of action of the test article and knowledge of the results of test article administration at other dose levels or in other species.\n\nQ3: When can pathology peer review occur?\n\nA3: Pathology peer review can occur before finalization (contemporaneous) or after finalization (retrospective) of the study pathologist's report (i.e., signed and dated pathology report). Pathology peer review that occurs before finalization of the study pathologist's report is considered contemporaneous peer review. When pathology peer review occurs before the finalization of the study pathologist's report, the study pathologist should prepare a written narrative that describes the diagnoses and interpretations of available slides before the contemporaneous peer review occurs.\n\nPathology peer review that occurs after finalization of the pathology report is considered retrospective peer review. When pathology peer review occurs retrospectively, the study pathologist should document any changes to the diagnoses and interpretations that result from the retrospective peer-review process in an amendment to the pathology report. When pathology peer review occurs after the final study report is signed, the study director should amend the final study report as necessary to reflect changes in histopathology diagnoses and interpretations.\n\nQ4: How should pathology peer review be documented, and what should be included in the peer-review statement?\n\nA4: It is important that the peer-review process be well documented and transparent. When either a contemporaneous or a retrospective pathology peer review is part of a GLP toxicology study, the activity should be included in the study protocol or protocol amendment. The process should be guided by written procedures to establish the extent of the review and ensure the integrity of the study. Because the study pathologist is responsible for the overall pathology data, the pathology report will reflect the study pathologist's best scientific opinion and judgment regarding the diagnoses and pathological interpretations.\n\nPathology peer review should be planned, conducted, documented, and reported in accordance with established written procedures. These written procedures should be available to the peer-review pathologist(s) prior to the initiation of peer review as SOPs, or in the study protocol or study-protocol amendment.\n\nThe peer-review pathologist(s) should generate a signed and dated peer-review statement (document, report, memorandum, or certificate) for inclusion in the final study report. All peer-review pathologists' signature blocks (identity and affiliation) should be included in the peer-review statement that is contained in the final study report.\n\nThe peer-review statement should be signed and dated by the peer-review pathologist(s) and include the following information:\n\nWho performed the peer-review and the date(s) it was performed\n\nWhether the peer-review was performed contemporaneously or retrospectively\n\nWhether the peer-review was conducted in compliance with GLP regulations\n\nWhat tissues were examined microscopically, corresponding animal identification number, dose/treatment group, and the basis for their selection\n\nWhat format (e.g., glass slides or whole slide images) was used_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nWhether the terminology, diagnoses, and interpretations used in the pathology report were agreed upon by both the study and peer-review pathologist(s)\n\nWhether a narrative report prepared by the study pathologist was reviewed either prior to or during peer review (for contemporaneous review only)\n\nWhat data and documents were utilized during the peer review (a listing)\n\nIf the peer-review pathologist concurs with the diagnoses and interpretations of the study pathologist, the peer-review statement might not include a comprehensive analysis of the outcome of the peer review. Under these conditions, sponsors or applicants can submit a statement explaining that a peer review was conducted, and the final pathology report reflects the consensus opinions of the study pathologist and peer-review pathologist(s). If no resolution of differences in diagnoses and interpretations can be reached during pathology peer review, the study pathologist and peer-review pathologist should carefully follow a transparent and unbiased process that is clearly described in written procedures (i.e., SOPs, study protocol, or study protocol amendment) for addressing diagnostic and interpretative differences during pathology peer review (as discussed further in Q9).\n\nAny changes to the diagnoses and interpretations by the study pathologist as a result of a contemporaneous peer review do not need to be documented in the study pathology report, as contemporaneous peer review is considered part of the iterative diagnostic pathology process. Any changes to the diagnoses and interpretations by the study pathologist as a result of a retrospective peer-review should be documented in the peer-review statement and in an amendment to the study pathologist's report.\n\nQ5: Can pathology peer review for a GLP toxicology study be conducted at a site that does not have an established quality system that complies with GLP regulations?\n\nA5: Yes, it is possible to conduct the pathology peer review for a GLP toxicology study at a site that does not have an established quality system that complies with GLP regulations provided the integrity of the study is protected. It is preferable that the peer-review pathologist(s) perform the peer review under a GLP-compliant quality system after receiving training on GLP regulations and relevant SOPs. If the pathology peer review is not conducted under a GLP-compliant quality system, that fact should be recorded within the study protocol and final study report. The name, affiliation, and work address of the peer-review pathologist(s) should be included in the final study report. Also, the name, qualifications (including GLP training), affiliations, and work address of the peer-review pathologist(s) should be documented in the peer-review pathologist's training files and retained at the testing facility.\n\nQ6: When should the peer-review statement be signed, and should the peer-review pathologist sign the pathology report?\n\nA6: The peer-review statement for a contemporaneous review can be signed by the peer-review pathologist before or after the study pathologist's report is signed. The peer-review statement for a retrospective review is by definition signed by the peer-review pathologist(s) after the study pathologist report is signed. The pathology report is the sole responsibility of the study pathologist, and the peer-review pathologist(s) should not sign the final pathology report. Anychanges to a study pathologist's report resulting from a retrospective pathology peer-review should be documented in an amendment to the study pathologist's report.\n\nQ7: Should the signed peer-review statement be included in the final study report?\n\nA7: Yes, the signed peer-review statement should be included in the final study report.\n\nQ8: How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n\nA8: The pathology report is the responsibility of the study pathologist and reflects that individual's diagnoses and interpretations. The signed and dated pathology report (raw data)4 is critical in facilitating a thorough review of the toxicologic potential of a specific investigational product.\n\nFootnote 4: The final rule, \u201cGood Laboratory Practice Regulations,\u201d published September 4, 1987 (21 CFR Part 58).\n\nTesting facility management should implement appropriate measures to ensure that the conduct of all phases of GLP toxicology studies, including the generation of the pathology report, is free from undue influence impacting the conclusions of the studies. Regarding pathology peer review, the independence of both the study pathologist and the peer-review pathologist(s) throughout the process should be ensured by both the management of the nonclinical testing facility and the sponsor or the applicant. Measures to ensure transparency can include, among other options, the implementation of an audit trail, or conducting contemporaneous peer review after the study pathologist's diagnoses are fixed or locked in an electronic system.\n\nDiverging diagnoses, interpretations, or conclusions between the study pathologist and peer-review pathologist(s) should be addressed using a transparent and unbiased process that is clearly described in written procedures (see Q9).\n\nQ9: How are differences in interpretation that result from pathology peer review addressed?\n--------------------\nContext title: Pathology Peer Review in Nonclinical Toxicology Studies- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.2074986845254898", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n--------------------\nContext: III Questions and Answers\n\nQ1: What is whole slide imaging?\n\nA1: Whole slide imaging includes the software and hardware used to generate a two-dimensional digital image4 of a glass histology slide used for routine assessment in generation of the pathology report. The process includes four sequential parts: image acquisition (scanning), image processing, image file storage, and display of images. The FDA does not consider the resulting digital image to be an exact copy of the glass slide. A whole slide image used in a GLP-compliant study should include all the elements from the glass slide that are needed for histopathological examination or pathology peer review.\n\nFootnote 4: Digital images comprise a sequence of small images (referred to as tiles) taken from distinct locations on the glass slide. Whole slide imaging systems typically determine the optimal focal plane at a limited, discrete set of locations on the glass slide and interpolate the optimal focal plane to generate all of the tiles. The individual tiles are then combined to create the \u201cwhole slide\u201d image.\n\nQ2: Should whole slide images be retained?\n\nA2: For GLP-compliant nonclinical toxicology studies, if whole slide images are assessed in lieu of the original glass slides and result in the generation of pathology raw data, the whole slide image files should be retained as study records and archived. Consideration should be given to ensure that archived digital images remain viewable as software/hardware updates/versions are implemented.\n\nQ3: If the whole slide image files are retained, should the glass slides also be retained?\n\nA3: Yes. The glass slides contain study specimens and must be retained as study specimens after study finalization in accordance with 21 CFR part 58.\n\nQ4: What should be retained with respect to the whole slide image file? Should modified whole slide image files be retained?\n\nA4: The whole slide image files provided to the study pathologist for histopathological examination and/or provided to the peer review pathologist(s) for pathology peer review (i.e., files containing all image data captured by the scanner and documentation of any technical image processing modifications), referred to here as the original whole slide image files, should be retained if they are used to generate raw data. Specifically, any technical image processing modifications made to whole slide image files prior to being provided to the pathologist (e.g., smoothing, color manipulation) should be documented and retained. Technical image processing should not obscure elements captured from the glass slide (e.g., label, artifact).\n\nThe pathologist should not permanently alter the original whole slide image files. Nonpermanent adjustments made by the pathologist using the image viewing software during whole slide image evaluation (e.g., brightness, contrast, annotations) do not need to be documented or retained.\n\nQ5: Should written procedures for whole slide imaging processes be in place?\n\nA5: Yes, written procedures for whole slide imaging processes should be in place because whole slide images may be used to generate raw data. These processes may include, for example, training, slide scanning, software management, and file access and exchange control.\n\nQ6: Should the whole slide imaging system be validated?\n\nA6: If the whole slide images are used to generate raw data, the whole slide imaging system (including software and hardware) should be validated in a manner specific to the intended use of the technology.\n\nQ7: Should whole slide image files be protected, including when transmitted to external users?\n\nA7: If the whole slide images are used to generate raw data, they should be protected to prevent loss or alteration of data, maintain chain of custody, control access, and secure data systems and data transmission. These measures should be performed following written procedures and processes in compliance with electronic record requirements under 21 CFR part 11 to maintain whole slide image file integrity.\n\nQ8: Should the signed pathology report/peer review statement state that whole slide images were evaluated in lieu of glass slides?\n\nA8: Yes, the signed pathology report should state whether glass slides or whole slide images were used for histopathological evaluation by the study pathologist, consistent with 21 CFR 58.\n\nContents\n\n1 Introduction\n\n2 Preliminaries\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_POST]\n\nuidance for Industry Pathology Peer Review in Nonclinical Toxicology Studies: Questions and Answers (December 2021).

It is a source of inconsistency that can negatively affect detection of treatment-related lesions/changes or the determination of no-effect levels (Crissman et al., 2004).\n\n1.1.2 Chronological Bias\n\nChronological bias is defined as the evolutionary process of a grading system, whereby more specific and sensitive criteria for grade assignment are clarified, learned, and publicized. As pathologists gain experience, subtleties of the evolving system are applied to interpretation of tissue sections (Kondylis et al., 2003). This is also a source of inconsistency that can negatively affect detection of treatment-related lesions/changes or the determination of no-effect levels.\n\nGlossary\n\nBiomarker (or biological marker):\n\nA characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biologic processes, pathogenic processes, or biological responses to a therapeutic intervention (Biomarkers Definitions Working Group 2001).\n\nBiomarker qualification study or qualification study:\n\nA general term used in this guidance to refer to nonclinical studies specifically pertaining to the qualification of a biomarker.\n\nChronological bias:\n\nThe evolutionary process of a grading system, whereby more specific and sensitive criteria for grade assignment are clarified, learned, and publicized (Kondylis et al. 2003).\n\nConfirmatory nonclinical biomarker qualification study or confirmatory study:\n\nA well-designed and -controlled nonclinical study in which the hypotheses are stated in advance and evaluated. In such studies, the key hypothesis of interest is predefined and is the hypothesis that is tested when the study is complete. Confirmatory studies are intended to provide firm evidence in support of the proposed context of use of the biomarker and, therefore, adherence to the protocol is particularly important.\n\nDiagnostic drift:\n\nA gradual change in nomenclature or severity grading of lesions within a single study. Diagnostic drift is a source of inconsistency that can negatively affect detection of treatment-related lesions/changes or the determination of no-effect levels (Crissman et al. 2004).\n\nExploratory nonclinical biomarker qualification study or exploratory study:\n\nA study that has clear objectives and provides information that may guide further investigation. In contrast to confirmatory nonclinical studies, an exploratory study may occur early in the characterization of a biomarker and can use a flexible design that allows for changes in the study protocol in response to the accumulating data. The analyses may involve exploring data and testing different hypotheses. Such studies cannot be the sole basis to support the proposed context of use of a biomarker, but can contribute to the total body of evidence. Exploratory studies are frequently (but not limited to) descriptive science.\n\nHistorical (external) control:\n\nA group of subjects, treated or untreated, from an earlier time than the study under consideration. Historical control data may serve to produce a range of normal rates of certain findings or changes (Keenan et al. 2009).\n\nLexicons:\n\nConsist of predetermined criteria used to classify types and degrees of change. A lexicon may be illustrated to clarify these predetermined criteria.\n\nPathology peer review:\n\nA secondary review with the objective of assisting the study pathologist to refine, verify, and improve the accuracy and quality of the final pathology assessments and interpretations.\n\nPathology working group:\n\nA group composed of the study pathologist, peer review pathologist, and at least one other pathologist. This group may be convened to resolvedifferences of opinion, review overall pathology interpretations within a study, or resolve and document a complicated issue.\n\nSensitivity: In the context of this guidance, refers to a biomarker, an assay for detection of a biomarker, or a diagnostic test using a biomarker. Biomarker sensitivity is the probability that a biomarker will report a specific morphologic change when the change is present. A sensitive biomarker also demonstrates changes after a relatively low amount of target tissue damage. Analytical sensitivity of the detection method for a given biomarker refers to the smallest quantity of biomarker that can be measured. For clarity, the term sensitivity should be qualified as being related to the biomarker itself (i.e., biomarker sensitivity) or the methodology used to measure the biomarker (i.e., analytical sensitivity). Diagnostic sensitivity is the probability that a person having a disease will be correctly identified by a clinical test (the number of true positive results divided by the total number with the disease, which is the sum of the numbers of true positive plus false negative results).\n\nSpecificity: Refers to a biomarker, an assay for the detection of a biomarker, or a diagnostic test using a biomarker. Biomarker specificity is the probability that the biomarker does not change in the absence of change in the tissue of interest. A biomarker with high specificity is reliably unchanged or stable in the absence of a defined morphologic change. Analytical specificity for the biomarker refers to the ability of the assay to measure one specific substance in the presence of other substances expected to be present. Diagnostic specificity is the probability that a person not having a disease will be correctly identified by a clinical test (the number of true negative results divided by the total number of those without the disease, which is the sum of the numbers of true negative plus false positive results).\n\nTruth Standard: Any medical procedure or laboratory method or combination of procedures and methods that the relevant scientific or clinical community relies upon for diagnosis or other specific categorization of the studied tissue, animal, or person and that is accepted by FDA for this purpose in biomarker qualification. Ideal truth standards will have negligible likelihood of either a false positive or a false negative result (Zhou, Obuchowski, and McClish, 2011).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:17]\n\nKondylis FI, Moriarty RP, Bostwick D, Schellhammer PF, 2003, Prostate cancer grade assignment: the effect of chronological, interpretive and translation bias.

Parameters that should be carefully considered for tissue fixation are the type of fixative, fixation time, humidity, oxygenation, and temperature, as well as the compatibility with the downstream nucleic acid extraction method. It is recommended to evaluate the impact of fixation and additives on the analytes of interest and the types of tests to be carried out prior to sample collection in a clinical study. In addition, the specimen tissue type and volume may affect the optimal duration of fixation and therefore should be taken into account. Sample handling methods subsequent to initial fixation could also impact the integrity of the specimens.\n\n2.1.4 Sample Stability and Degradation\n\nAppropriate handling measures should be taken to prevent nucleic acid degradation and genomic profile alterations during sample collection and processing. Nucleic acid fragmentation and apparent changes in gene expression can occur and are dependent on conditions related to pH, hypoxia, the presence of endonucleases, and/or other tissue specific parameters. In addition, the time from specimen collection to freezing, fixation, or processing, as well as the storage time, should be optimized as needed. The parameters employed should be documented in sample collection and handling instructions, training materials and the sample reports. It is recommended to monitor conditions of storage and processing. For example, the temperature should be monitored for possible variations and documented to ensure consistency across samples.\n\nSpecimen Volume and Composition\n\nCollection volume for samples is an issue that requires careful consideration. Consideration should be given to the minimum tissue or cell content needed for the intended purposes (e.g., analytical methodology) to minimize burden on subjects. The optimal amount of tissue may be dependent upon the cellularity of the tissue (e.g., smaller amounts may be sufficient for highly cellular tissue types) and the relative proportion of particular cell types in the entire specimen (e.g., tumor area and/or other aspects of a disease as represented in a biopsy). In the event that only a limited amount of tissue is available, alternative biological material may be considered for collection (see also section 2.1.1). As tumor tissue may exhibit molecular heterogeneity (mosaicism) and tumor biopsies often consist in part of normal tissue, a documented pathological evaluation of the sample prior to genomic analysis may be helpful. When paired samples are collected (e.g., tumor versus normal tissue, pre- versus post-treatment samples, prenatal versus maternal specimens), additional considerations (e.g., matched samples, cell types) may be needed to allow comparison.\n\nParameters Influencing Genomic Sample Quality and Quantity\n--------------------\nContext title: E18_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.51234245300293", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Format and Content of the Nonclinical Pharmacology:Toxicology Section of an Application* Guidance for Industry, How can the Agency be assured that the study pathologist's diagnoses and interpretations are free from undue influence during the pathology peer-review process?\n--------------------\nContext: Instructions for clinical laboratories, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities to help them determine if remote reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides is feasible and appropriate based on an evaluation of their own information technology (IT) infrastructure and remote use environment for individual pathologists. FDA recommends that laboratories and hospitals consider performing a validation study where they deem necessary before remote reviewing and reporting of digital pathology slides at a remote location.\n\nInstructions recommending that pathologists using such devices during the COVID-19 public health emergency use their clinical judgment to determine whether the quality of the images from the remote digital pathology devices are sufficient for interpretation of the pathological images.\n\nFDA recommends that manufacturers consider evaluating the performance of the device in accordance with the following FDA recognized standards, including (as applicable):\n\n_Medical Electrical Equipment\n\nPart 1: General Requirements for Basic Safety and Essential Performance_\n\n_Medical Electrical Equipment Part 1-2: General Requirements for Basic Safety and Essential Performance\n\nCollateral Standard: Electromagnetic Disturbances\n\nRequirements and Tests_\n\nAdditionally, while no device-specific performance recommendations are included in this enforcement policy, CLIA regulations and State law (including those related to performance) apply, although some CLIA regulations may be subject to CMS enforcement policies during this public health emergency.8\n\nFootnote 8: See the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Memorandum, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Laboratory Guidance During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, March 26, 2020, https://www.cms.gov/medicareprovider-enrollment-and-cerificationsurveycertificationgeninfopolicy-and-memos-states-and/clinical-laboratory-improvement-amendments-clia-laboratory-guidance-during-covid-19-public-health.\n\nFore the current edition of the FDA-recognized standard(s) referenced in this document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database.9 For more information regarding use of consensus standards in regulatory submissions, refer to FDA guidance titled \"Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices.\"10\n\n4.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn addition, manufacturers should develop and implement appropriate cybersecurity controls to ensure device cybersecurity and maintain functionality and safety for remote digital pathology devices.

Standards for track and trace, authentication, and validation are also not addressed in this guidance because this guidance only addresses the standardized numerical identifier itself and not implementation or application issues.\n\nIII Standardized Numerical Identifiers\n\nWhat should be a package-level SNI for most prescription drugs?\n\nThe SNI for most prescription drug packages should be a serialized National Drug Code (sNDC). The sNDC is composed of the National Drug Code (NDC) (as set forth in 21 CFR Part 207) that corresponds to the specific drug product (including the particular package configuration)4 combined with a unique serial number, generated by the manufacturer or repackager for each individual package. Serial numbers should be numeric (numbers) or alphanumeric (include letters and/or numbers) and should have no more than 20 characters (letters and/or numbers). An example is shown below with a 10-character NDC.\n\nFootnote 4: In the case of repackaged drugs, each package type should have an NDC that corresponds to the repacker or private label distributor for whom the drug is repacked and to the new package configuration.\n\nWhat should be the package-level SNI for certain biological products that do not use NDC numbers?\n\nSome prescription drugs approved under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, such as blood and blood components and certain minimally manipulated human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), do not currently use NDC numbers. Examples of HCT/Ps that do not use NDC numbers include allogeneic placental/umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood progenitor cells, and donor lymphocytes for infusion. Instead, such productscurrently use other recognized standards for identification and labeling, such as ISBT 128, which creates a unique identification number for each product package. See\n\nhttp://iccbba.org/about gettoknowisbt128.html, \"Guidance for Industry: Recognition and Use of a Standard for Uniform Blood and Blood Component Container Labels,\"\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/BiopicicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Blood/ucm073362.htm.) The SNI for these products should be the unique identification number created for each package under these other recognized standards, such as ISBT 128.5\n\nFootnote 5: FDA currently also recognizes Codabar as a standard for blood and blood component container labels. We note that ISBT 128 is becoming the more widely-used industry standard.\n\nDoes the SNI include expiration date and/or lot or batch number?\n\nExpiration date and/or lot or batch numbers are not part of the recommended SNI. Expiration date and/or lot or batch numbers are already accessible because FDA regulations require the inclusion of this information on the label of each drug product. (See 21 CFR SSS 201.17, 201.18, 211.130, 211.137, 610.60, and 610.61.) In addition, the SNI can be linked to databases containing this and other information. Addition of this information within the SNI will unnecessarily increase the length of, and introduce complexity into, the SNI. However, if a manufacturer or repackager chooses to include expiration date and/or lot or batch number with the SNI, it should ensure that the resulting number still permits users to distinguish and make use of the SNI. For example, expiration date and lot or batch number may be incorporated in accordance with the GS1 standards for use of Global Trade Item Numbers (GTIN)6 (discussed below in Section F).\n\nWhy did FDA select the serialized NDC for package-level SNI for most prescription drugs?\n\nFDA chose the sNDC as the package-level SNI for most prescription drugs because we believe that it serves the needs of the drug supply chain as a means of identifying individual prescription drug packages,7 which in turn should facilitate authentication and tracking and tracing of those drugs. Most prescription drug product packages already have an NDC on them. By combining a serial number of up to 20 characters with the NDC, the sNDC should be sufficiently robust to support billions of units of marketed products without duplication of an SNI. This approach will allow manufacturers and repackagers to assign serial numbers to combine with the NDC for unique identification of individual product packages. The SNI can also be linked to databases containing such product attributes as lot or batch number, expiration date, distribution/transaction history information, and other identifiers related to a product. As already noted, defining the SNI is expected to be a first step to facilitate the development of other standards and systems for securing the drug supply chain. Many aspects of the implementation of package-level identification will take shape in the future, as the standards that make use of SNI are developed.\n\nFootnote 7: As described above, ISBT-128 and Codabar serve the same function for certain biologics that lack NDCs.\n\nShould the SNI be in human- and machine-readable forms?\n\nFDA believes that an SNI generally should be applied to each package in both human-readable and machine-readable forms. However, at this time, FDA is not specifying the means of incorporating the SNI onto the package. The SNIs described in this guidance are compatible with, and flexible for, encoding into a variety of machine-readable forms of data carriers, such as2-dimensional bar codes and radio-frequency identification (RFID),8 leaving options open as technologies for securing the supply chain continue to be identified, and standards making use of SNI are developed. A redundant human-readable SNI on the package would provide the ability to identify the package when electronic means are unavailable (e.g., in the event of hardware/software failure). Due to the wide-variety of packaging required to accommodate different products and product integrity needs, FDA also is not specifying a location on the package where an SNI should be placed. If the NDC is already printed on the package in human-readable form, then the serial number could be printed in human-readable form in a non-contiguous manner elsewhere on the product package. Any SNI placed on the package must not obstruct FDA-required labeling information9 and should be placed in a manner that allows it to be readily scanned/viewed without damaging the integrity of the packaging or product..\n\nFootnote 8: FDA\u2019s enforcement policy with respect to the application of current good manufacturing practices to RFID technology is provided in Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Section 400.210. See http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074357.htm. This CPG would apply if an SNI were embedded into an RFID tag.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 502(c) of the Act.\n\nF. Is the SNI that FDA is recommending compatible with international standards? In addition to facilitating other actions to secure the drug supply chain, adoption of the sNDC as the SNI for most prescription drugs, and of other recognized standards, such as ISBT 128, for certain biological products, satisfies the requirement in 505D(b)(2) that the SNI developed by FDA be harmonized, to the extent practicable, with internationally recognized standards for such an identifier. Specifically, use of an sNDC is compatible with, and may be presented within, a GTIN, which can be serialized using an Application Identifier (AI) [(21)] to create a serialized GTIN (sGTIN) for use with RFID or for certain barcodes.10 GTIN is a global standard for item and object identification, established by GS1, a consensus-based, not-for-profit, international\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]\n--------------------\nContext title: Standards for Securing the Drug Supply Chain - Standardized Numerical Identification for Prescription Drug Packages Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.14424020051956177", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 10: Package is defined in section 581(11) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(d)(4)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 12: For this guidance, (tradangpartner) is defined as described in section 581(23)(A) of the FD&C Act. Although third-party logistics providers are also considered trading partners under section 581(23)(B) of the FD&C Act, they are not subject to the same product tracing requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nThe Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) (Title II of Public Law 113-54) was signed into law on November 27, 2013. Section 202 of the DSCSA added section 582 to the FD&C Act. This section established product tracing, product identifier, authorized trading partner, and verification requirements for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers, and dispensersto facilitate the tracing of a product through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Failure to comply with the requirements of section 582 of the FD&C Act is prohibited under section 301(t) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(t)) and subject to enforcement action under the FD&C Act.\n\nOne requirement of the verification scheme outlined in the DSCSA is the verification of saleable returned product. Under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act, wholesale distributors must have systems in place that will enable them to verify the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, on each sealed homogeneous case of saleable returned product, or, if such product is not in a sealed homogeneous case, on each package of saleable returned product. A saleable returned product may not be further distributed until the product identifier is verified.13 The product should be handled as suspect product if the product identifier is not successfully verified (i.e., it should be quarantined and investigated).14. 15 FDA published the 2019 Compliance Policy on September 24, 2019, announcing a 1-year delay in enforcement against wholesale distributors who do not verify the product identifier of saleable returned product prior to further distributing such product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 14: See Verification Systems Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act for Certain Prescription Drugs (October 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIn addition, section 582 of the FD&C Act requires certain trading partners (manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers) to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and a transaction statement when engaging in transactions involving certain prescription drugs.16({}^{,})17 A transaction statement must include a statement that the entity transferring ownership in a transaction had systems and processes in place to comply with verification requirements under section 582 of the FD&C Act.18 In the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA acknowledged that wholesale distributors may not have systems in place by November 27, 2019, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, the 2019 Compliance Policy indicated FDA's intent to take no enforcement action prior to November 27, 2020, against a wholesale distributor that provided a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor did not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(c)(4)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act details how wholesale distributors must handle suspect product.\n\nFootnote 17: Transaction, transaction history, transaction information, and transaction statement are defined under sections 581(24), (25), (26), and (27) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 18: See section 581(27)(E) of the FD&C Act.\n\nSection 582 also includes requirements for dispensers to verify product identifiers when investigating suspect or illegitimate product. Specifically, section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act provides that, effective November 27, 2020, dispensers must verify \"the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, of at least 3 packages or 10 percent of such suspect product, whichever is greater, or all packages, if there are fewer than 3, corresponds with the product identifier for such product [in the dispenser's possession or control]\".19 Section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act requires dispensers to verify product as described in 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act when they have received a notification of illegitimate product from FDA or a trading partner.\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIII Compliance Policy for Wholesale Distributor Verification of Saleable Returned Product\n\nAfter publishing the 2019 Compliance Policy, FDA has received comments and feedback from wholesale distributors, as well as other trading partners and stakeholders, expressing additional concern with industry-wide readiness for implementation of the verification of saleable returned product requirement for wholesale distributors. Stakeholders have explained that the primary factors FDA considered when issuing the 2019 Compliance Policy still exist: (1) the very large volume of saleable returned products requiring verification; (2) the need to refine and test verification systems during actual production using real-time volumes of saleable returned product rather than simply in pilots; and (3) the complexities of building an interoperable, electronic system with the capabilities to timely and efficiently verify the large volume of saleable returned products amid immature technologies.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some wholesale distributors may still need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, when the delay in enforcement set forth in the 2019 Compliance Policy expires, before they can begin verifying returned products prior to resale or other further distribution as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act in an efficient, secure, and timely manner. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against wholesale distributors who do not verify a product identifier prior to resale or other further distribution of a package or sealed homogenous case of product as required by section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.\n\nAdditionally, FDA recognizes that wholesale distributors may still not have systems in place by November 27, 2020, to enable the wholesale distributor to timely and efficiently comply with the verification of saleable returned product requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act without potentially causing a disruption to the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Therefore, prior to November 27, 2023, FDA does not intend to take action against a wholesale distributor for providing a transaction statement to a subsequent purchaser of product on the basis that such wholesale distributor does not yet have systems and processes in place to comply with the saleable return verification requirements under section 582(c)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.20\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPolicy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (September 2018), addresses such returns.28_\n\nFootnote 28: For the most recent version of the guidance, check the FDA guidance web page.\n\nIV Compliance Policy for the Dispenser Verification Requirements\n\nIn the years since the passage of the DSCSA, FDA has received comments and feedback from dispensers expressing concern with readiness for implementation of certain requirements under section 582(d) of the FD&C Act, including the verification requirements addressed in this compliance policy. Specifically, dispensers have described challenges with implementation of these provisions in the DSCSA due to the time necessary to develop technologies and processes that would support a robust verification system.\n\nGiven the concerns expressed, FDA recognizes that some dispensers may need additional time beyond November 27, 2020, before they can begin to verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect and illegitimate products as described in sections 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and (B)(iii) of the FD&C Act. To minimize possible disruptions in the distribution of certain prescription drugs in the United States, FDA does not intend to take action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of suspect product as required by section 582(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the FD&C Act. In addition, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action before November 27, 2023, against dispensers who do not verify, as required by section 582(d)(4)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act, the statutorily-designated portion of product identifiers of product that is the subject of an illegitimate product notification by FDA or a trading partner.\n--------------------\nContext title: Wholesale Distributor Verification Requirement for Saleable Returned Drug Product and Dispenser Verification Requirements When Investigating a Suspect or Illegitimate Product\u2014Compliance Policies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.6915342807769775", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?\n--------------------\nContext: 4.2.5.1 FDA Regionally Controlled Terminology for Section G.k: Drug(s) Information\n\nFDA currently uses regional controlled terminologies to support ISO IDMP Standards. The FDA regionally controlled terminologies are defined in Section G.k, Drug(s) Information, to support use of FDA regional product identifiers and FDA specialized product categories:\n\nMedicinal Product Identifier (MPID) (ISO 11615:2012)\n\nMedicinal Product Name as Reported by the Primary Source\n\nSubstance/Specified Substance TermID (ISO 11238:2012)\n\nAuthorization/Application Number\n\nPharmaceutical Dosage Form TermID (ISO 11239:2012)\n\nFDA Additional Information on Drug\n\nFDA Specialized Product Category\n\n4.2.5.2 Data Element G.k.2.1.1b: Medicinal Product Identifier (MPID)\n\nThe FDA National Drug Code (NDC), when known, should be used as the regional MPID.23 If the NDC or MPID is unknown, please refer to the E2B(R3) Electronic Transmission of ICSRs IG. Information about obtaining a list of the NDCs can be found on the NDC Structured Product Labeling Data Elements (\"NDSE\") web page (see https://www.fda.gov/industry/structured-product-labeling-resources/nsde).\n\nFootnote 23: The full three segments of the NDC are technically referred to as Packaged Medicinal Product Identifier (PCID) per ISO 11615. Reporters can use either only the first two segments of the NDC or the full NDC as regional MPID in ICSR reporting to FDA.\n\n4.2.5.3 Data Element G.k.2.2: Medicinal Product Name as Reported by the Primary Source\n\nFDA validates Medicinal Product Names for products marketed in the United States against the available Structured Product Labeling (SPL)24 XML file or the label that was submitted with the ICSR as an attachment. When the product has an SPL file, use the same naming convention in the ICSR as the name appears in the SPL file. When submitting a product label as an attachment to an ICSR, use the name as it appears on the submitted product label.\n\nIf the Medicinal Product Name is not provided but the active substance name is known, provide the active substance as it appears in the FDA SRS Unique Ingredient Identifiers (UNII) (see https://precision.fda.gov/unisearch) list using the free text data element G.k.2.3.r.1, Substance/Specified Substance Name.\n\nIf data element G.k.2.2, Medicinal Product Name as Reported by the Primary Source, is a foreign product trade name, provide the active substance name as it appears in the FDA SRS UNII list using the free text data element G.k.2.3.r.1, Substance/Specified Substance Name. Additionally, provide the foreign product trade name in data element G.k.2.2.\n\n4.2.5.4 Data Element G.k.2.3.r.2b: Substance/Specified Substance TermID\n\nIf the Substance/Specified Substance TermID (data element G.k.2.3.r.2b) is not available, the FDA SRS UNII list should be used to populate data element G.k.2.3.r.1, Substance/Specified Substance Name.\n\nFDA recommends that applicants proactively validate substance information with primary source reporters before preparing the ICSR submission. FDA UNII codes are updated monthly and may be obtained from the FDA SRS UNII list.\n\n4.2.5.5 Data Element G.k.3.1: Authorisation/Application Number\n\nFDA requires the use of a prefix to determine the application type associated with products. For example, for human drug products, include the acronym \"NDA\" or \"ANDA\" immediately followed by the application number with no spaces (e.g., NDA123456, ANDA012345). Table 3 describes format specifications for FDA application numbers and exceptions such as marketed unapproved prescription drug products (use 000000), marketed unapproved nonprescription drug products (use 999999), and compounded products (use COMP99).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \\hline Product Type & FDA Application Type & Recommended Format \\ \\hline Human drug product & NDA/ANDA & NDA123456 or ANDA012345 \\ \\hline Biological product & BLA & BLA123456 \\ \\hline Prescription drug products marketed without an approved application & Rx No Application & 000000 \\ \\hline Non-prescription drug product marketed without an approved application & Non-Rx No Application & 999999 \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 3: FDA Product and Format Specifications\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:22]\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:23]\n\nSubmission Rules\n\nThe submission rules define conditions that will result in a negative acknowledgement and not be accepted by FAERS, if not met. The document FDA E2B(R3) Core and Regional Data Elements and Business Rules defines the conformance and the business rules for each data element. The tab \"Rejection and Warning Rules\" lists the rejection rules that will result in a negative acknowledgement, and the warning rules that will list a warning but result in positive acknowledgement.\n\nForward Compatibility\n\nThe forward compatibility defines the rules to migrate existing FDA regional E2B(R2) data elements to the FDA regional E2B R3 data elements. The document FDA E2B(R3) Forward Compatible Rules lists the data elements and the rules to be applied when moving from E2B(R2) to E2B(R3) format. Additionally, the guidance for industry Appendix I (B) to the ICH E2B(R3) ICSRs Implementation Guide -- Backwards and Forwards Compatibility (April 2022) should be referenced for data elements whose \"Source\" is ICH.\n\nGeneral Data Completion Instruction\n\nRequired and Optional Data Elements\n\nA required data element is one that needs to be present (i.e., not to be omitted) either in the ICSR message or an instance of a repeating data element section within the ICSR message.\n\nA required data element may or may not allow a nullFlavor, depending on the data validation rules associated with the data element.\n\nAn optional data element generally does not have to be included in the message if it does not have a value. But in some cases, a referential data validation rule may necessitate an optional data element be indicated with a nullFlavor under certain circumstances.\n\nThe FDA E2B(R3) Core and Regional Data Elements and Business Rules document lists all data elements, including ICH and FDA regional data elements, and validation rules used to process incoming ICSRs. The Business Rules document provides detailed information on the conformance, format, and where applicable, allowed values, nullFavors, and controlled terminologies for each data element.\n\nRegional extensions not described in the FDA E2B(R3) Core and Regional Data Elements and Business Rules document are not allowed.\n\nDescription in English\n\nAll ICSR data elements should be completed in English with the exceptions of the following elements:\n\n\"Reaction/Event as Reported by the Primary Source in Native Language\" (E.i.1.1a);\n\n\"Case Summary and Reporter's Comments in Native Language\" (H.5.r)\n\nDate/Time Data Elements\n\nActual local dates and times should be used and offset (i.e., +/-ZZzz) is attached where appropriate. A single format (CCYYMMDDhhmmss.UUUU[+/-ZZzz]) is used to represent dates and times. The minimum level of precision for the date data elements is specified in theBusiness Rules; however, as much information as is available (e.g., known) should be provided. Future dates are not acceptable in an ICSR message.\n\nUse of Metric Units\n\nMetric units should be used for measurement values.\n\nVersion of Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)\n\nA single version of MedDRA should be used for all MedDRA coding data elements within the same ICSR (i.e., ICSR message). Therefore, the same MedDRA version should be reflected in all the populated data elements concerning MedDRA version information. However, within a safety message (i.e., a batch of ICSRs), different ICSRs can refer to different MedDRA versions.\n\nStandard Terminologies and Codelists\n\nIf a data element is defined with a specific codelist (in the \"Values\" column of the Business Rules), the associated codelist needs to always be used. Also, when the codelist code is captured as the value of a data element, its text name should be provided in display name to make the XML code human readable.\n\nUse of nullFlavors\n\nNullFlavors are used to explain the reason for the lack of data on required elements. The definitions of nullFlavors are from the E2B(R3) Electronic Transmission of ICSRs IG and can be used as appropriate.\n\nICSR Attachment(s)\n\nIn accordance with E2B(R3) Electronic Transmission of ICSRs IG, ICSR attachments should be sent inline as embedded files using base 64 encoding (refer to E2B(R3) Electronic Transmission of ICSRs IG Section 3.5 (Document Attachments) for further information). To facilitate ICSR attachment file processing, the data element \"Attachment file name\" must be included using the (<)reference value(>) data element in the XML file, which must be placed after the (<)text mediaType(>) tag.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\n(<)reference typeCode=\"REFR\"(>)\n\n(<)document classCode=\"DOC\" moodCode=\"EVN\"(>)\n\n(<)code code=\"1\" codeSystem=\"2.16.840.1.113883.3.989.2.1.1.27\"\n\ndisplayName=\"documentsHeldBySender\"/(>)\n\n(<)title(>)Narrative Summary Report\n\n(<)text mediaType=\"text/plain\" representation=\"B64\"(>)\n\n(<)reference value=\"Narrative Summary Report.pdf\"/(>)\n\nVGhllIHBhdGllbnQgd2FzIGEgMzUgeWxlIHdpdGggbbm8gc=\n\n(<)/text(>)Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n(<)/document(>)\n\n(<)/reference(>)\n\nSpecial Note: the \"attachment file name\" must follow the naming convention for a valid \"url\". Letters, digits, and special characters \"a\"-\"z\", digits, as well as the characters plus (\"+\"), period (\".\"), and hyphen (\"-\") are allowed.\n\nIf the file type in the reference value tag does not match the file extension in the file name, the file will be rejected. For example, a file with (<)reference value=\"SAMPLE FILE.txt\"/(>) must have a text file media type reported.\n\nFor more information about restrictions, see http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt.\n\nICSR Attachment File-Size Limitations\n--------------------\nContext title: FDA Regional Implementation Guide for E2B(R3) Electronic Transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports for Drug and Biological Products\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.8303316831588745", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy Guidance for Industry , What is a National Drug Code (NDC)?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.3.3 Ndc\n\nTo identify each drug for which you are reporting, you will use the 10-digit NDC for the drug as listed with FDA.

The recommendations in this guidance are intended to assist manufacturers and repackagers in developing standardized formats for the human- and machine-readable information that is contained in the product identifier. The requirements set forth in the DSCSA do not change the linear barcode requirements under 21 CFR 201.25.\n\nV Product Identifiers under the DSCSA\n\nAs noted in Section II of this guidance, a product identifier is defined under section 581(14) of the FD&C Act as a standardized graphic that includes the product's standardized numerical identifier (composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number), lot number, and expiration date, in both human- and machine-readable formats. The machine-readable format must be on a data carrier that conforms to the standards developed by a widely recognized international standards development organization.10 The product identifier data is specifically required under section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act to be in a \"2-dimensional data matrix barcode\" for packages and in a \"linear or 2-dimensional data matrix barcode\" for homogenous cases, which can be verified using \"human-readable or machine-readable methods.\"11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 581(14) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: See section 582(a)(9) of the FD&C Act. As described in section 582(a)(9)(A), FDA may decide in the future to allow the use of other technologies for data instead of, or in addition to, the 2-dimensional data matrix barcode or linear barcode.\n\nUnder section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act, manufacturers are required to \"affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce\" beginning no later than November 27, 2017. Under section 582(e)(2) of the FD&C Act, repackagers are required to \"affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction in commerce\" beginning no later than November 27, 2018. Therefore, each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction into commerce must include the NDC, unique serial number, lot number, and expiration date in both human- and machine-readable formats.\n\nVI Compliance Policy for Product Identifier Requirements\n\nIn the guidance titled \"Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act - Compliance Policy,\" FDA stated that it did not intend to take enforcement action against manufacturers who did not, prior to November 27, 2018, affix or imprint a product identifier to each package and homogenous case of product intended to be introduced in a transaction intocommerce as required by section 582(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.12 As the time frame described in this compliance policy has since ended, it no longer represents the Agency's thinking in terms of enforcement policy.\n\nFootnote 12: See guidance for industry Product Identifier Requirements Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act \u2013 Compliance Policy (September 2018). We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance web page at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nVII Products that are subject to the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA\n\nThe product identifier requirements of section 582(b)(2)(A) and (e)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act apply to packages and homogenous cases of product intended to be introduced into commerce via a transaction.13 A \"product\" under section 581(13) of the FD&C Act is a \"prescription drug in finished dosage form for administration to a patient without substantial further manufacturing.\"\n\nFootnote 13: There are exemptions to the definition of \u201ctransaction\u201d (see section 581(24)(B) of the FD&C Act).\n\nThe following prescription drug products are excluded from the definition of a \"product\" under the DSCSA, and thus are not subject to the product identifier requirements:14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 581(13) of the FD&C Act, defining \u201cproduct.\u201d\n\nblood or blood components intended for transfusion\n\ncertain radioactive drugs or radioactive biological products15\n\nimaging drugs\n\ncertain intravenous products16\n\nFootnote 15: Radioactive drugs and radioactive biological products excepted from the definition of \u201cproduct\u201d under the DSCSA are defined in 21 CFR 600.3(ee) and regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or by a state, pursuant to an agreement with such Commission under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2021).\n\nhave noted that the following rule is not applicable to the FD&C Act.\n\nhave noted that the following rule is not applicable to the FD&C Act.\n\ndrug compounds compounded in compliance with sections 503A or 503B of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353a or 353b).\n\nVIII Linear Barcode Requirements Under 21 CFR 201.25\n\nConsidering the product identifier requirements under the DSCSA, manufacturers and repackagers have asked FDA whether some of their products are still required under 21 CFR 201.25 to include a linear barcode. The linear barcode requirements were established for different purposes than the DSCSA requirements and apply to additional FDA-regulated products and packaging in some instances, and are still in effect. In the Federal Register of February 26, 2004 (69 FR 9120), FDA published a final rule requiring certain human drug and biological product labels to have a linear barcode that contains, at a minimum, the drug's NDC number (SS 201.25).18 Manufacturers, repackers (also known as \"repackagers\"), relabelers, and private label distributors of human prescription drug products, biological products, and over-the-counter (OTC) drug products dispensed pursuant to an order and commonly used in hospitals, are subject to the linear barcode requirement. The linear barcode must appear on the drug's label as defined by section 201(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(k)). FDA has interpreted that requirement to mean the linear barcode should be on the outside container or wrapper, as well as on the immediate container unless the barcode is readily visible and machine-readable through the outside container or wrapper.19\n\nFootnote 18: See 69 FR 9120 at 9140 (Feb. 26, 2004), https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2004-02-26/pdf/04-4249.pdf.\n\nAs stated in the preamble to the final rule:\n\nBar codes can help reduce or detect potential medication errors by enabling health care professionals to check whether they are giving the right drug via the right dose and right route of administration to the right patient at the right time.20\n\nFootnote 20: Id. at 9120.\n\nThe preamble contemplated that linear barcodes, the use of scanning equipment, and computerized databases would be part of a system that could help reduce the number of medication errors that occur in hospitals and other health care settings.21\n\nFootnote 21: Id. at 9120.\n\nManufacturers, repackers, relabelers, and private label distributors of drug products who are subject to the establishment registration and drug listing requirements in section 510 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360) are responsible for placing the appropriate barcode on the product.22 The following prescription drug products, however, are exempted under SS 201.25 from the linear barcode requirements:\n\nFootnote 22: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products. Private label distributors who do not also manufacture, repack, relabel, or salvage drugs are not required to register under part 207.\n\nFootnote 23: For the purposes of the linear barcode requirements, radiopharmaceuticals are considered \u201cradioactive drugs\u201d or \u201cradioactive biological products\u201d, as defined in 21 CFR 310.3(n) and 21 CFR 600.3(ce), respectively.\n\nFootnote 24: \u00a7 201.25(b)(1)(ii).\n\nprescription drug samples\n\nallergenic extracts\n\nintrauterine contraceptive devices regulated as drugs\n\nmedical gases\n\nradiopharmaceuticals23\n\nlow-density polyethylene form fill and seal containers that are not packaged with an overwrap.\n\nFootnote 23: See 21 CFR 207.17 regarding what establishments are required to register and list drug products.

Product Identifier is defined in section 581(14) and includes the product\u2019s standardized numerical identifier, which is composed of the NDC and a unique alphanumeric serial number (see section 581(20)).\n\nFootnote 19: See section 582(b)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 20: See section 582(b)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nProduct Tracing and Verification\n\nUnder section 582(b)(1), (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) of the FD&C Act, trading partners are required to provide the subsequent purchaser with product tracing information22 for each transaction23 involving a DSCSA-covered MMA product. For example, if the manufacturer transfers ownership of a DSCSA-covered MMA product to a wholesale distributor, the wholesale distributor generally shall not accept ownership of a product unless the manufacturer has, prior to or at the time of the transaction, provided the transaction history, transaction information, and a transaction statement for the product.24\n\nFootnote 21: See FDA Guidance for Industry Grandfathering Policy for Packages and Homogenous Cases of Product Without a Product Identifier (Sept. 2018).

These requirements include steps to handle suspect and illegitimate product.25\n\nFootnote 23: Suspect product is defined in section 581(21), and illegitimate product is defined in section 581(8), of the FD&C Act.\n\nVIII. Importation of MMA Products\n\nThis section sets forth recommendations intended to assist importers of MMA products by facilitating an efficient and effective admissibility review. Following the procedures in this section will also assist FDA in determining that the importation is authorized and not, for example, a counterfeit.\n\nImportant Entries for MMA Products\n\nTo help FDA verify that a shipment that purports to contain an MMA product is one in which the manufacturer26 has, in fact, authorized the drug to be marketed in the United States and has caused the drug to be labeled to be marketed in the United States, we strongly encourage the filing of an electronic entry in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). If a manufacturer plans to use or authorize another process for making entry of an MMA product other than ACE, such as a paper entry, we strongly encourage the manufacturer to inform FDA in advance. FDA's view is that international mail is not appropriate for the importation of MMA products.\n\nFootnote 26: As noted in footnote 5, above, for purposes of this guidance, the manufacturer is the NDA or BLA holder for the MMA product.\n\nACE is currently the sole Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system authorized by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to process electronic entry and entry summary filings for FDA-regulated products. Submitting complete, accurate information in ACE facilitates effective and efficient admissibility review by FDA. FDA regulations set forth the required data elements that must be submitted in an electronic entry in ACE, or any other EDI system authorized by CBP, for any entry that includes FDA-regulated products (21 CFR Part 1, Subpart D).27\n\nFootnote 27: FDA published its final rule, \u201cSubmission of Food and Drug Administration Import Data in the Automated Commercial Environment,\u201d on November 29, 2016 (81 FR 85854), and the rule was effective December 29, 2016.\n\nAt the time of filing entry in ACE, a filer must submit, among other elements, a Drug Listing Number, which is currently the NDC for drugs, including biological products and combination products, regulated by CDER (21 CFR 1.74). For drugs, biological products and combination products, regulated by CBER, the Drug Listing Number is not required. Although not required, FDA strongly encourages filers to submit the Drug Listing Number for CBER-regulated MMA products in ACE at the time of entry because this information will assist FDA's initial screening and further review of the entry, which can significantly increase the likelihood that the entry line will receive an automated \"May Proceed\" from FDA.\n\nManufacturer Authorization for MMA Products\n\nAs stated above, section 801(d)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act provides that, with limited exceptions:\n\n[N]o drug that is subject to section 503(b)(1) [of the FD&C Act] may be imported into the United States for commercial use if such drug is manufactured outside the United States, unless the manufacturer has authorized the drug to be marketed in the United States and has caused the drug to be labeled to be marketed in the United States.\n\nUnder this provision, any shipment of a purported MMA product that is offered for importation would be subject to refusal unless the manufacturer has authorized the MMA product to be marketed in the United States. It is essential that FDA be provided the information needed to confirm that each shipment of a purported MMA product offered for importation has been authorized for marketing in the United States by the manufacturer. To help ensure that a particular shipment is authorized, and to help mitigate the potential for counterfeiting, the manufacturer should provide information that is sufficient for FDA to verify that each shipmentof an MMA product has, in fact, been authorized by the manufacturer to be marketed in the United States. This information is described in the following paragraph.\n\nFDA strongly encourages manufacturers to submit a report via the Electronic Submissions Gateway (ESG) (or to an alternative transmission point identified by FDA) notifying the Agency of the importation of an MMA product 10 business days in advance of the first import entry of an MMA product covered by the report, which will facilitate FDA's timely admissibility review when the MMA product is offered for import. This report should include: the MMA product name, dosage form, and quantity of the MMA product; the name, address, and telephone number of the authorized importer; and any temporal or other limitations the manufacturer has placed on the authorized importation. For example, a report could authorize multiple shipments of an MMA product for a specified period of time. An updated report should be timely submitted by the manufacturer each time there is a change to the material information in the report; this updated report would be submitted before any additional imports affected by the changes are entered into ACE. Manufacturers who choose to submit this report must do so electronically in Portable Document Format (PDF) using the Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) format and the ESG (or to an alternative transmission point identified by FDA).28 The report should be referenced and placed in Module 1. For further information regarding eCTD, please refer to FDA's website at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/Electr\n\nonicSubmissions/ucm153574.htm.\n\nFootnote 28: FDA Guidance for Industry Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format \u2014 Certain Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specifications (Jan. 2019). For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents.\n\nIX Other Requirements applicable to an MMA product\n\nAn MMA product is subject to all relevant requirements of applicable statutes, including those implemented by FDA such as the FD&C Act and the PHS Act; applicable implementing regulations under those authorities; and other relevant statutes, including the Social Security Act, the Poison Prevention Packaging Act, and the Controlled Substances Act. The provisions implemented by FDA include, but are not limited to, provisions related to adulteration and misbranding, and requirements related to adverse event reporting (or postmarketing safety reporting for combination products under 21 CFR Part 4, Subpart B), recalls, and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAppendix A: Dear Healthcare Provider Letter\n\nDear Healthcare Provider\n\nMonth Year\n\nIMPORTED PRODUCT FOLLOWING PROCEDURES IN: \"Importation of Certain FDA-\n\nApproved Human Prescription Drugs, Including Biological Products, and Combination Products\n\nunder Section 801(d)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act: Guidance for\n\nIndustry\" - MODEL LETTER\n\nSubject: Importation of TRADENAME (nonproprietary name for drugs/proper name for\n\nbiological products) (NDC #1, NDC #2): Availability of an FDA-approved prescription drug/biological product/combination product that was originally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and authorized for sale in that foreign country.\n\nDear Health Care Provider:\n\nThe purpose of this letter is to inform you that TRADENAME (NDC #1, NDC #2), an FDA-\n\napproved prescription drug(s)/biological product(s)/combination product(s) that was/were\n\noriginally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and authorized for sale in that foreign\n\ncountry, will be available in the United States.

The blended wet formulation has a water content of 50% (i.e., a solids content of 50%). The product goes through a drying step. The finished product has a water content of 10% (i.e., a solids content of 90%) and a serving size of 40 g.\n\nStep 1: The amount of total sugars contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving.\n\nBecause there is water loss during manufacturing, in this method we calculate the amount of wet formulation needed to yield 40 g serving size finished product.\n\nSolids content in the finished product g = 40 x 90% = 36 g.\n\nBecause the solids prior to drying is 50% (moisture = 50%), the starting wet formulation prior to drying that yielded the 40 g serving size finished product is 72 g (36 g / 50%).\n\nThe amount of total sugar contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving (based on wet formulation weight percentage) = 72 g (\\times) 20% (\\times) 11.5% = 1.656 g.\n\nStep 2: The water content of the finished product = weight per serving (\\times)moisture content = 40 g (\\times) 10% = 4 g.\n\nStep 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = (1.656 g/ 4 g) (\\times) 100 = 41.4%.\n\nSince 41.4% is greater than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength apple juice (11.5 Brix value), you would need to calculate the amount of sugars from the apple juice ingredient (41.4% sugar) that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent apple (11.5% sugar). Please note that, in this hypothetical example, even though the starting juice is a single strength juice, because of the concentration during processing, the amount of added sugars from the apple juice is not zero. You may use the method described in Q&A 11 or other alternative methods to determine the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient.\n\n13. The regulation says in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii) that added sugars are a \"statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving, except that label declaration of added sugars content is not required for products that contain less than 1 gram of added sugars in a serving if no claims are made about sweeteners, sugars, added sugars, or sugar alcohol content.\" What does FDA consider to be a \"sweetener?\" Do sweeteners include sugar alcohols and other low-calorie sweeteners?\n\nWe have used the term \"sweetener\" to refer to ingredients that provide sweetness to a food regardless of whether they provide calories (43 FR 43248, September 22, 1978; 56 FR 60437 to 60438, November 27, 1991; and 58 FR 2326 to 2327, January 6, 1993). We have not changed our approach to the use of this term. Therefore, we consider both caloric and non-caloric sweeteners, including sugar alcohols, to be sweeteners for the purposes of this regulation.\n\nSome ingredients contain mono- and disaccharides (DP1 and DP2 (one and two degrees of polymerization)) that are created through processes such as hydrolysis. Do the mono- and disaccharide portions of ingredients that are created through hydrolysis need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33832), we said that, other than sugar syrup types of products where the sugars are specifically and purposely produced via hydrolysis, we do not have information suggesting that sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates results in significant increase in the sugar content of foods. We did not receive any comments or other information suggesting that these sugars should be captured under the added sugars declaration, and we did not include sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis in our definition of added sugars (id.). Therefore, such sugars would not be declared as added sugars on the label. We also explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, since hydrolysis was purposely used by the manufacturer to increase the sugar content of the product (id.).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33835), we also said that, in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Report (2015 DGAC Report).\n\nManufacturers may purposely employ methods, such as hydrolysis, for a number of reasons, some of which result in an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides with DP1 and DP2. Ingredients such as maltodextrin and corn syrup solids are hydrolyzed to achieve various degrees of dextrose equivalence (DE). The higher the DE, the lower the degree of polymerization, and the sweeter the ingredient becomes. Maltodext (21 CFR 184.1444) are ingredients with a DE less than 20, and corn syrup (21 CFR 168.120, 168.121, and 184.1865) are ingredients with a DE of 20 or higher. Depending on the manufacturing process, different maltodextrin and corn syrup will have different DE and different amounts of mono- and disaccharides. Although maltodext are not used primarily for sweetening purposes, depending on the DE, some can contain 8-9% mono and disaccharides and can contribute to sweetness. We also understand that the hydrolysis process to manufacture maltodextrin and corn syrup are controlled so that the desired DE can be consistently achieved. This indicates that some maltodext and corn syrup solids are manufactured purposely to contain certain levels of mono- and disaccharides. Information that is publicly available (e.g., online product specification sheets and reference materials) indicates that manufacturers have knowledge of the level of mono- and disaccharides created during the processing of ingredients through controlled hydrolysis.\n\nMaltodext, corn syrups, and other ingredients with mono-and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis are widely used by manufacturers and are present in many different types of food products (47 FR 36443 at 36444, September 20, 1982). The sugars contributed by these ingredients are consistent with the concept of empty calories as described in the 2015 DGAC Report because they supply sugars and calories to the diet when they are added as an ingredient to foods. We explained in the Nutrition Facts label final rule that small amounts of added sugars that are contributed to the diet by a wide variety of foods can add up over the course of the day and can make it difficult for an individual to eat sufficient amounts of foods from the basic food groups to meet nutrient needs without exceeding the amount of calories they need in a day for weight maintenance (81 FR 33742 at 33759). As such, when an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis (e.g. maltodextrin or corn syrup) is added to a food during processing, those mono- and disaccharides contributed by the ingredient need to be declared as added sugars on the label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(9)(iii).\n\nShould sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch and other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g., beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label?\n\nYes. Sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch or other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g. beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods need to be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label because the sugars created through controlled hydrolysis add empty calories to the diet (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii); 81 FR 33742 at 33831 through 33832 (comment 201 and response), 33835 (comment 207 and response)).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, because the manufacturer purposely used hydrolysis to increase the product's sugar content (81 FR 33742 at 33832).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.0430827140808105", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: Step 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n\na) Single strength apple juice has a Brix value of 11.5 (21 CFR 101.30). You may use the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration in a single strength apple juice or other information such as data obtained through chemical analysis, information from databases, or reference documents (see response to Q&A 9). Therefore, the sugar concentration in a single strength apple juice is 11.5% (based on weight).\n\nb) Determine the density of single strength apple juice with a Brix value of 11.5. You can either measure the density or look up references that convert Brix values to densities.\n\nc) The amount of sugars in 240 ml serving size of single strength apple juice of the same type = 240 ml x density (g/ml) x 11.5 % (or.115).\n\nStep 3: The weight of added sugars (in grams) is the weight of sugars obtained from step 1 minus that from step 2.\n\n11. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit juice blend containing the juices of multiple fruit types that is reconstituted above 100 percent where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)?\n\nIf the juice blend is reconstituted such that the amount of sugar in the finished product is equal to or less than what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice (e.g., less than 100% juice), the added sugar declaration would be zero.\n\nIf the juice blend is reconstituted such that the amount of sugar in the finished product is greater than what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final juice blend.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished juice blend product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the juice blend were reconstituted to single strength juice of the same type (i.e., the weight of sugars in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type). The single strength juice of the same type is a juice that contains the same ratios of the apple, mango, and pear juices in our hypothetical example.\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you can make a single strength juice blend with the same ratios of the three juices and measure the amount of total sugars per 240 ml serving size.\n\nYou can also calculate the sugar weight in the theoretical single strength juice blend of the same type by the following method:\n\na) Calculate the ratios of the three juices in your formulation based on weight.\n\nTo obtain the weight-based ratios of the three juices in this hypothetical juice blend example, you need to first determine the weight-based concentration factors for the three types of juice. The weight-based concentration factor is the ratio of the Brix values between the concentrate and the single strength juice. For example, the weight-based concentration factor for the apple juice in the hypothetical example is 70 / 11.5 = 6.087. Using a similar calculation, the weight based concentration factor for the mango juice is 5.385 and the weight based concentration factor for the pear juice is 5.833.\n\nBecause the hypothetical juice blend formulation has 10% apple juice concentrate (70 Brix), 10% mango juice concentrate (70 Brix), and 20% pear juice concentrate (70 Brix), the theoretical single strength juice blend of the same type would have the following ratios of single strength apple juice, single mango juice, and single pear juice:\n\nPercentage apple juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) apple juice concentration factor; percentage mango juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) mango juice concentration factor; percentage pear juice concentrate in the formulation (\\times) pear juice concentration factor\n\nOr\n\n10% (\\times) 6.087; 10% (\\times) 5.385; 20% (\\times) 5.833\n\nOr\n\n0.6087; 0.5385; 1.167_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nThe above ratios for the three types of juice can be converted to percentage-based ratios with the sum of the ratios being 100%. The sum of the ratios is 100% because all of the sugars in the juice blend are from the three types of juices.\n\nTherefore:\n\nSingle apple juice: single strength mango juice: single strength pear juice =\n\n({)[0.6087 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (}):\n\n({)[0.5385 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (}):\n\n({)[1.167 / (0.6087 + 0.5385 + 1.167)] x 100% (})\n\nOr\n\n26.30%: 23.27%: 50.42%\n\nb) Calculate the theoretical Brix value of the single strength juice blend of the same type juice with the same ratios of the three juices.\n\nThe theoretical Brix value of the juice blend is the sum of the multiplication products of the Brix value and the percentage contribution (the ratio percentage from step 2a) for each type of juice.\n\n(Single strength apple juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single strength apple juice) + (single strength mango juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single strength mango juice) + (single strength pear juice (\\times) percentage contribution of single pear juice) = theoretical Brix value of the hypothetical juice blend.\n\n11.5% (\\times) 26.31% + 13% (\\times) 23.27% + 12% (\\times) 50.42% = 12.10%.\n\nc) Determine the density of single strength juice blend with a Brix value of 12.10.

We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n\nThe determination of the amount of added sugars contributed by a powdered fruit or vegetable juice that is added as an ingredient to a product and that is not reconstituted to single strength juice during processing (e.g., that is added to a pureed fruit or to a yogurt) would be the same as the determination of the sugars contributed by a liquid or frozen fruit or vegetable juice concentrate. In our response to question 11, we have suggested that when calculating the added sugars declaration for a product containing concentrated fruit or vegetable juice, the total moisture content of the finished product can be considered to go towards reconstitution of the fruit juice concentrate in the formulation. Thus, the total moisture content of a finished product formulated with powdered fruit or vegetable juice concentrates can be considered to contribute towards the dilution of the powdered fruit or vegetable juice. Further, the sugars contributed by the powdered fruit or vegetable juice that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type must be declared as added sugars on the label, as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule.\n8. Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates? We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12). We require that, when a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)). If you use Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 to calculate the amount of added sugars in a product containing juice concentrate, you must document this information in the records regarding the amount of added sugars added to the food during processing (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). If you use the amount of sugars present in a single strength juice and/or a juice concentrate, that is determined through chemical analysis or other available information, when calculating the amount of added sugars in a product containing fruit juice concentrate, you must document the source of the information and/or the amount of sugars determined through chemical analysis in the records that you make and keep (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). If a diluted juice concentrate slightly exceeds the amount of sugar that would be found in the same volume of the same type of 100 percent fruit juice, manufacturers should document the average and consistency with cGMPs in the records that they make and keep.\n9. Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis? The amount of added sugars declared on the label must be in grams (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The added sugars definition includes sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. For juice, the serving size is based on volume (e.g., 8 oz. or 240 ml) while the amount of added sugars per serving is based on weight. Therefore, when calculating the weight of added sugars per serving, you may need to consider the densities of both the finished juice product and the single strength juice of the same type. You may choose to arrive at the gram amount of added sugars in different ways. Please see our responses to questions 11 and 12 for examples of how to calculate the amount of added sugars in products containing concentrated fruit juices on both a volume and weight basis.\n10. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit or vegetable juice (juice made from a single type of fruit or vegetable) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength juice where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)? In the hypothetical example below, we provide three general steps to calculate the amount of added sugars (in grams) for an apple juice product (240 ml serving size) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength apple juice. The product in this hypothetical example is reconstituted to have juice soluble solids above the minimum Brixrequirement in 21 CFR 101.30 where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9). Therefore, all sugars in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice must be declared as added sugars. The apple juice example here uses the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration. This example is provided solely to demonstrate one method of calculating the added sugars content of the product. You can use alternate methods.\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.4400886297225952", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: 3. Do I need to take into consideration sugars from ingredients that are used in formulating my product when determining the added sugars declaration for a serving of my product?\n\nIngredients containing free mono- and disaccharides that meet our definition of added sugars need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (e.g. sugars from cane sugar and concentrated fruit juice added to sweeten an apple sauce). Manufacturers may need to work with ingredient suppliers to determine the amount of added sugars provided by ingredients used in formulating food products.\n\n4. Do the sugars in dried fruits meet the definition of added sugars?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we responded to comments on dried fruits (see response to comment 212, 81 FR 33742 at 33837). We said that dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them should not be considered to contain added sugars because they are essentially a dehydrated whole fruit and still retain the nutrients and other components of a whole fruit (e.g. diced dried apples). However, if additional sugar is added to a dried fruit, the sugar added to the dried fruit must be declared on the label as added sugars (81 FR 33742 at 33837).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5. Are the sugars used in the production of vinegar added sugars?\n\nIn the production of vinegar, naturally occurring sugars are first fermented into alcohol and then a secondary fermentation occurs in which alcohol is converted to vinegar. For most vinegar products, no sugars remain in the final product. Vinegars that do not contain any sugars in the finished food would not need an added sugars declaration. However, we are aware of some vinegars (e.g., balsamic vinegar) that are made using ingredients that are often used as sweeteners in foods, and that are similar to concentrated fruit juices (e.g., grape must). According to the definition of added sugars, sugars found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type are added sugars. Therefore, fruit juices that are concentrated before or during processing of some vinegars contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars. To the extent that sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are present in the finished product, the added sugars must be declared on the label and in labeling, as required in our Nutrition Facts label final rule. We understand that the manufacturing of vinegar involves several steps, and manufacturers need to consider the impact of these steps (e.g. potential concentration due to water loss when aged in wooden barrels) on the final added sugars declaration.\n\n6. The definition of added sugars excludes the \"fruit component of fruit spreads.\" What constitutes the \"fruit component\" of a non-standardized fruit spread?\n\nPlease see our response to question 1 above. The fruit component of a non-standardized fruit spread would include whole fruits, pieces of fruit, dried fruit, fruit or vegetable pures (single strength or concentrated), fruit pulps, single strength juices, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders that are not made from fruit or vegetable juices.\n\n7. Do sugars found in fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the form of the fruit or vegetable (e.g., concentrated fruit and vegetable pures, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders) need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833), we explained that we excluded from the definition of \"added sugars\" whole fruit, fruit pieces, dried fruit, pulps, and pures because they are nutrient rich and maintain the basic properties of a fruit when added to foods and are not considered to contain added sugars (see response to comment 208, 81 FR 33742 at33835). We also explained that sugars from 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, and sugars from certain fruit and vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under certain regulations, fruit juice concentrates used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, and preserves under our standards of identity, and 100 percent juice concentrate sold directly to consumers (e.g. frozen orange juice concentrate) are excluded from the definition of \"added sugars.\"\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833 through 33834), we explained that, while foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices can be a part of a healthful diet, the sugars added to the foods by the concentrated fruit or vegetable juice provide additional calories. Over the course of the day, small amounts of calories in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages can add up and make it difficult to balance the amount of calories expended (81 FR 33742 at 33834). For these reasons, we consider foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices to be sugar-sweetened foods (id).\n\nWe also explained that in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report (Ref. 1) (81 FR 33742 at 33835).\n\nWe are applying these same guiding principles when determining when the sugars in an ingredient are added sugars. Concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes, and some fruit and vegetable powders are essentially whole fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the physical form of the fruit or vegetable and to remove moisture. They maintain the basic properties of a whole fruit or vegetable, even if the peel and seeds may be removed. Their composition and use is more consistent with that of whole fruits or vegetables, dried fruits or vegetables, pulps and pureses than that of concentrated fruit juices, which are commonly used by industry in place of sugars. Therefore, the sugars in concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes and some fruit and vegetable powders contribute to the diet the same way that sugars found in whole fruits or vegetables do, and do not have to be declared as added sugars on the label. However, we consider sugars in powders made from fruit and vegetable juices to be the same as those found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices because such powders are essentially concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that have all moisture removed. Therefore, some or all sugars contributed by a powder made from fruit or vegetable juices must be declared as added sugars on the label as required by the Nutrition Facts label final rule, depending on the degree of reconstitution in the finished food.\n\nThe definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.2674410045146942", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: Or\n\n10% (\\times) 6.087; 10% (\\times) 5.385; 20% (\\times) 5.833\n\nOr\n\n0.6087; 0.5385; 1.167_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nThe above ratios for the three types of juice can be converted to percentage-based ratios with the sum of the ratios being 100%.

The amount of added sugars is based on the finished product composition. Juice (fruit or vegetable) ingredients are unique in that the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient depends on whether the juice ingredient is concentrated, and thus, contains sugar in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. We realize that food formulation is complex and manufacturers can use different ingredients or alternative formulas to achieve the same finished product composition. For example, you may use 100% fruit juice and dry sugar in a baking application. You also may have an alternative formulation that uses concentrated fruit juice and liquid syrup to achieve the same product composition. When water or other wet ingredients containing water (e.g. milk, syrup, egg, diluted wines and cider with less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, etc.) are added to a formulation containing concentrated juice and other ingredients during processing, the amount of moisture that goes towards reconstituting the juice or towards wetting or reconstituting other ingredients is not known. Furthermore, if the water added during formulation is divided among the ingredients when determining the amount of reconstitution or wetting that has occurred, different formulations of the same finished food could have different calculated added sugar amounts. Therefore, we considered an approach that we believe would provide a reasonable estimate of the added sugars content of a multi-ingredient product that includes concentrated fruit juice as an ingredient (e.g. a bakery product, marinade, or diluted wines and cider with less than 7 percent alcohol by volume). When concentrated juices are used in the formulation, we believe that it is practical to use all of the moisture in the formulation towards reconstitution of the concentrated juice when calculating the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product. It is also possible that the initial juice ingredient in the formulation (either diluted, 100%, or concentrated) is further concentrated during processing due to loss of water (e.g., during drying or baking). Because the amount of added sugars is based on the finished product composition, you should account for the loss of water during processing to reflect the concentration of the juice ingredient after processing. Considering the complexity of food formulation and processing, we believe it is also appropriate to use the moisture content of the finished product towards reconstitution of the juice soluble solids when the product is subject to water loss during processing. This approach is consistent with our approach for the use of all of the moisture in the formulation towards reconstitution of concentrated juices when calculating the added sugars content of an ingredient. The following general approach can be used to calculate the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation. This general approach applies when there is either dilution or concentration during manufacturing.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nStep 1: Determine the amount of total sugars contributed by the juice ingredient.\n\nStep 2: Determine the water content (i.e., the moisture content) of the finished product.\n\nStep 3: Determine the sugar concentration of the juice ingredient with the assumption that all of the water in the finished product can be used to reconstitute the juice ingredient.\n\nStep 4: Compare this sugar concentration of juice ingredient with that of the theoretical single strength juice of the same type.\n\n(a) If the sugar concentration is less than, or the same as, the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type, the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient is zero.\n\n(b) If the sugar concentration is greater than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type, you may use the method described in Q&A 11 or other alternative methods to determine the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient.\n\nStep 5: The amount of total added sugar per serving is the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient determined from step 4(b) plus added sugars from other ingredients (e.g., cane sugar), if any, in the formulation.\n\nIf you use multiple juice ingredients in your formulation, you may follow the same general steps above except that in step 4(b) you would need to use the method described in Q&A 12 or other alternative methods to determine the amount of added sugars from the multiple juice ingredients.\n\nTo demonstrate the general approach described above, we provide two hypothetical examples below. In these hypothetical examples, we use the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration.\n\nHypothetical example 1:\n\nA product formulation contains a single juice ingredient (5% apple juice at 70 Brix value). The finished product has a serving size of 250 gm and a moisture content of 50%.\n\nStep 1: The amount of total sugars in the juice ingredient = weight per serving (\\times) percentage apple juice concentrate (\\times) % sugar in apple juice concentrate = 250 g (\\times) 5% (\\times) 70% = 8.75 g.\n\nStep 2: The water content or the moisture content of the finished product = weight per serving (\\times) moisture content = 250 g (\\times) 50% = 125 g.\n\nStep 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = 8.75 g / 125 g = 7%.\n\nBecause 7% is less than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength apple juice (11.5 Brix value), the added sugar from the apple juice ingredient in this hypothetical example is zero even though the starting ingredient is a concentrated apple juice.\n\nHypothetical example 2 (with drying step where water is removed):Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA product formulation contains a single juice ingredient (20% single strength apple juice at 11.5 Brix) in the wet formulation (prior to drying). The blended wet formulation has a water content of 50% (i.e., a solids content of 50%). The product goes through a drying step. The finished product has a water content of 10% (i.e., a solids content of 90%) and a serving size of 40 g.\n\nStep 1: The amount of total sugars contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving.\n\nBecause there is water loss during manufacturing, in this method we calculate the amount of wet formulation needed to yield 40 g serving size finished product.\n\nSolids content in the finished product g = 40 x 90% = 36 g.\n\nBecause the solids prior to drying is 50% (moisture = 50%), the starting wet formulation prior to drying that yielded the 40 g serving size finished product is 72 g (36 g / 50%).\n\nThe amount of total sugar contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving (based on wet formulation weight percentage) = 72 g (\\times) 20% (\\times) 11.5% = 1.656 g.\n\nStep 2: The water content of the finished product = weight per serving (\\times)moisture content = 40 g (\\times) 10% = 4 g.\n\nStep 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = (1.656 g/ 4 g) (\\times) 100 = 41.4%.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.7177389860153198", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , What is step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?\n--------------------\nContext: Ingredients Declared as Evaporated Cane Juice: Guidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Nutrition and Food Labeling\n\nFood Labeling and Standards Staff, HFS-820\n\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5001 Campus Drive\n\nCollege Park, MD 20740\n\n(Tel) 240-402-2371\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/FoodGuidances\n\nYou may submit electronic or written comments regarding this guidance at any time.

Each class or subclass of food is to be given a common or usual name that states, in clear terms, what it is in a way that distinguishes it from different foods. The common or usual name, which may be a coined term, must accurately describe, in as simple and direct terms as possible, the basic nature of the food or its characterizing properties or ingredients; must be uniform among all identical or similar products; and may not be \"confusingly similar to the name of any other food that is not reasonably encompassed within the same name\" (21 CFR 102.5(a)).\n\nSugar cane products exist in many different forms, ranging from raw sugars and syrups to refined sugar and molasses. These products are differentiated by their moisture, molasses, and sucrose content as well as by crystal size and any special treatments (e.g., treatment with sulfur).2 Sugar cane products with common or usual names established by regulation are sugar (21 CFR 101.4(b)(20)) and cane sirup (alternatively spelled \"syrup\") (21 CFR 168.130). Several other sugar cane products have common or usual names established by common usage (e.g., molasses, brown sugar, turbinado sugar, muscovado sugar, and demerara sugar). For purposes of ingredient labeling, \"sugar\" is defined to mean sucrose obtained from sugar cane or sugar beets in accordance with 21 CFR 184.1854, the regulation affirming that sucrose is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in food when used under specified conditions. The GRAS regulation describes sucrose as the substance \"obtained by crystallization from sugar cane or sugar beet juice that has been extracted by pressing or diffusion, then clarified and evaporated\" (21 CFR 184.1854(a)). To be GRAS for use in food, sucrose must be of a purity suitable for its intended use (21 CFR 184.1854(b)).\n\nFootnote 2: Honig, P. Principles of Sugar Technology. Elsevier Publishing Company. 1953.\n\nOn October 7, 2009, FDA published a draft guidance entitled \"Guidance for Industry:\n\nIngredients Declared as Evaporated Cane Juice\" in the Federal Register (74 FR 51610) to advise industry of FDA's view that the common or usual name for the solid or dried form of sugar cane syrup is \"dried cane syrup,\" and that sweeteners derived from sugar cane syrup should not be declared on food labels as \"evaporated cane juice\" because that term falsely suggests the sweeteners are juice. On March 5, 2014, we reopened the comment period (79 FR 12507) for the draft guidance seeking further comments, data, and information about how the ingredient sometimes declared as \"evaporated cane juice\" is produced, what its basic nature and characterizing properties are, and how it compares with other sweeteners made from sugar cane. We received numerous comments on the draft guidance. The majority of comments objected to the term \"dried cane syrup.\" Several comments from sugar producers asserted that this term does not accurately describe the ingredient they produce, mostly because the standardized food \"cane syrup\" is not the starting material or an intermediate step for the ingredient they refer to as \"evaporated cane juice.\" Based on comments stating that the ingredient sometimes declared as evaporated cane juice is not made from cane syrup as defined in 21 CFR 168.130, FDA is no longer recommending that this ingredient be labeled as \"dried cane syrup.\"\n\nMany comments described the process used to manufacture the ingredient described as \"evaporated cane juice,\" and some comments also described the manufacturing process for other products derived from sugar cane. The initial processing steps are generally the same for all products produced from sugar cane. After sugar cane is harvested, it is cut or shredded and then crushed to extract the fluid. The extracted fluid is clarified and then evaporated to concentrate the solids. To make the product \"evaporated cane juice,\" the concentrated cane extract is filtered and undergoes a single crystallization process. The crystals are then separated from the molasses using centrifugation. From the comments, the method of filtering the \"evaporated cane juice\"\n\nfluid varies from producer to producer, as does the method used for single crystallization.\n\nMost other common types of cane sugar (e.g., white sugar, brown sugar) are not filtered prior to the first crystallization. After the crystals are separated from the molasses using centrifugation, as part of the refining process, the sugar is melted and re-crystallized. Most cane-based sweeteners, including white sugar, undergo multiple crystallization steps.\n\nSome comments stated that \"evaporated cane juice\" has essentially the same composition as white sugar and other sweeteners derived from sugar cane. As support for this point, one comment provided a specification sheet for \"evaporated cane juice\" indicating that the ingredient contains between 99.0 and 99.8% sucrose. The comment also included a specification sheet for another product identified as \"certified organic sugar\" and pointed out that the composition of the two products was identical except that the organic ingredient was made with organic sugar cane. Other comments focused on the differences between \"evaporated cane juice\" and other cane-based sweeteners. For example, some of these comments stated that \"evaporated cane juice\" has a different composition from white sugar because it retains traces of molasses and minerals. A few comments said that \"evaporated cane juice\" is different than other less refined, \"alternative\" sugars because it contains less molasses and can be substituted for white sugar in processed foods without affecting the taste or appearance of the finished product.\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nThis guidance is intended to help consumers make informed choices among sweeteners by promoting accurate and consistent labeling. To that end, we are advising the regulated industry of our view that the term \"evaporated cane juice\" is not the common or usual name of any type of sweetener and that this ingredient should instead be declared on food labels as \"sugar,\" preceded by one or more truthful, non-misleading descriptors if the manufacturer so chooses (e.g., \"cane sugar\").\n\nIn developing this guidance, FDA reviewed the Codex Alimentarius Commission's (Codex's) Standard for Sugars, Codex Stan. 212-1999 (Ref. 4), which provides standards for certain sugars intended for human consumption without further processing, to determine whether Codex had established a standard for a product similar to that described on some U.S. food labels as \"evaporated cane juice.\" The Codex Standard for Sugars contains no product identified as \"evaporated cane juice.\" However, the Codex standard does define \"raw cane sugar\"3 as \"[p]artially purified sucrose, which is crystallised from partially purified cane juice, without further purification, but which does not preclude centrifugation or drying, and which is characterised by sucrose crystals covered with a film of cane molasses.\" This standard appears to describe the same sweetener referred to in many of the comments as \"evaporated cane juice.\" We agree that the common or usual name used to describe this ingredient on food labels should include the term \"sugar\" because that term describes the basic nature and characterizing properties of the food.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Ingredients Declared as Evaporated Cane Juice \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.5911216735839844"], "Based on the information from Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 9: In the Federal Register of February 21, 2020, FDA issued a final rule that amends its regulation that defines \u201cbiological product\u201d to incorporate changes made by the BPCI Act and the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, and to provide its interpretation of the statutory term \u201cprotein\u201d (85 FR 10057).

To enhance transparency and facilitate planning for the transition date, FDA is posting on the FDA website (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/deemed-be-license-provision-bpci-act) a preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act (as of December 31, 2019) that will be affected by the transition provision, and FDA intends to periodically update the list before the transition date (see Q3 below). Shortly after the transition date, FDA intends to post a final list of approved applications under the FD&C Act that have been deemed to be licenses under the PHS Act.\n\nDoes the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n\nFDA interprets the transition provision to mean that the holder of an approved application for a biological product does not need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA. Specifically, FDA interprets section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act to mean that an approved application under the FD&C Act for a biological product will be \"deemed to be a license\" for the biological product on the transition date by operation of the statute.10\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe statute is silent regarding the process for accomplishing the transition of approved NDAs to deemed BLAs. FDA intends to send a letter to such application holders on March 23, 2020, advising that the approved NDA was deemed to be a BLA at 1200 am Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on March 23, 2020, and no longer exists as an NDA. (If the NDA is approved on March 23, 2020, the approved NDA will be deemed to be a BLA immediately after approval.) In the letter, FDA also will notify the application holder that it has been issued a license that authorizes the application holder to manufacture the biological product within the meaning of section 351 of the PHS Act and to introduce the biological product or deliver the biological product for introduction into interstate commerce (see Q6 below). The letter also will remind application holders that they will need to ensure that the listing information for the biological product is updated in FDA's electronic Drug Registration and Listing System (eDRLS) between March 23, 2020, and June 30, 2020, to reflect a change in the prefix of the application number (from \"NDA\" to \"BLA\") (see 21 CFR 207.57(b)). FDA notes that the deeming of an approved NDA to be a BLA and the corresponding update of the eDRLS listing information for the biological product to change the prefix for the application number will not result in the need for a new National Drug Code (NDC) number with a new product code. Accordingly, in the absence of other changes made by the application holder that would require a new NDC number, biological products approved under the FD&C Act will retain their current NDC number after the NDA is deemed to be a BLA. This will provide consistency for manufacturers and for the databases and pharmacy systems that track drug and biological products.\n\nTo enhance transparency and facilitate planning for the transition date, FDA is posting on the FDA website a preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act (as of December 31, 2019) that will be affected by the transition provision, and FDA intends to periodically update the list before the transition date (see Q1 above). Biological products approved in NDAs that are deemed to be BLAs will be removed from FDA's Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book) on March 23, 2020, and will be listed in FDA's Lists of Licensed Biological Products with Reference Product Exclusivity and Biosimilarity or Interchangeability Evaluations (the Purple Book) and the CDER Therapeutic Biologics Products list on or shortly after the March 23, 2020, transition date.\n\n2.2 Who should an application holder contact if it believes that its approved NDA should or should not be included on FDA's preliminary list of approved applications for biological products that will be affected by the transition provision?\n\nIf an application holder or other person reviews, on FDA's website, the preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act that will be affected by the transition provision and believes that an approved NDA should be added to the list or should not be included on the list, the application holder or other person should submit a comment to the public docket established for this guidance and the preliminary list. For information on submission of comments to the public docket, please refer to the Federal Register (FR) Notice of Availability of this guidance.\n\nQ4.: How will FDA notify the sponsor of a proposed biological product who seeks to obtain approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act that the planned application would need to be approved under the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2020?\n\nFDA provided notice to sponsors of proposed biological products intended for submission in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act that they will be affected by the transition provision through the Biosimilars Q&A Guidance, as well as through FDA's draft guidance for industry Implementation of the \"Deemed to be a License\" Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (March 2016) (Transition Policy Draft Guidance) and the Biosimilars Q&A Draft Guidance. In the Biosimilars Q&A Guidance, FDA initially stated its interpretation of the statutory term \"protein\" in the amended definition of \"biological product\" (see Q1 above and Biological Product Definition Final Rule). In the Transition Policy Final Guidance, FDA provides recommendations to sponsors of proposed protein products intended for submission in an application that may not receive final approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2020, to facilitate alignment of product development plans with FDA's interpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.11 FDA recommends that sponsors of development programs for proposed protein products evaluate whether a planned submission under section 505 of the FD&C Act would allow adequate time for approval of the application prior to March 23, 2020, considering, among other things, whether the submission may require a second cycle of review and, for certain types of applications, whether unexpired patents or exclusivity may delay final approval. If a sponsor is unsure whether its proposed product may receive approval under the FD&C Act by March 23, 2020, the sponsor should consider submitting a BLA under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act instead. For additional information, please see the Transition Policy Final Guidance.\n\nFootnote 11: After FDA issued the Transition Policy Final Guidance, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 was enacted. Section 607 of this Act amended section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act to provide that FDA will continue to review an application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act after March 23, 2020, so long as that application was submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act, is filed not later than March 23, 2019, and is not approved as of March 23, 2020. If such an application is approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act before October 1, 2022, it will be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act upon approval (see section 7002(e)(4)(B)(iii) and (vi) of the BPCI Act).\n\nB.: Applications for Biological Products Submitted Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act on or Before the Transition Date\n\nQ5.: When will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the application number that will be used for its deemed BLA?\n\nFDA intends to assign the same application number used for the approved NDA to the deemed BLA on the March 23, 2020, transition date. As a hypothetical example, NDA 012345 would be deemed to be BLA 012345 on the transition date. This approach is intended to minimize burden on holders of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act who are preparing submissions to their applications around the transition date and to facilitate the administrative conversion of any pending supplements to such applications (see the Transition Policy Final Guidance for additional information regarding such supplements). The use of a predictable application numbering system for deemed BLAs is also expected to facilitate preparation and submission of a 351(k) BLA for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeableproduct that references a product licensed in a deemed 351(a) BLA as a reference product. The FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date will include the product's BLA number.\n\nWhen will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the license number that will apply to its deemed BLA(s)?\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 7.829297065734863", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: Interpretation of the \"Deed to be a License\" Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nDecember 2018\n\nProceduralInterpretation of the \"Deed to be a License\" Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Communications, Division of Drug Information\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10001 New Hampshire Ave., Hillandale Bldg., 4({}^{th}) Floor\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 855-543-3784 or 301-796-3400; Fax: 301-431-6353\n\nEmail: druginfo@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nand/or\n\nOffice of Communication, Outreach and Development\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 71, Room 3128\n\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nPhone: 800-835-4709 or 240-402-8010\n\nEmail: occod@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guida\n\nnces/default.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nDecember 2018\n\nProcedural\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nInterpretation of the \"Deemed to be a License\" Provision of the\n\nBiologicals Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for\n\nBiologicals Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or\n\nAgency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA\n\nor the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the\n\napplicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff\n\nresponsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance describes FDA's interpretation of the provision of the Biologic's Price Competition\n\nand Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) under which an application for a biological product\n\napproved under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21\n\nU.S.C. 355) as of March 23, 2020, will be deemed to be a license for the biological product\n\nunder section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 262) on March 23, 2020. Specifically, this guidance describes FDA's interpretation of the \"deemed to be a license\"\n\nprovision in section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act for biological products that are approved under\n\nsection 505 of the FD&C Act as of March 23, 2020 (the transition date). This guidance also\n\nprovides recommendations to sponsors of proposed protein products intended for submission in\n\nan application that may not receive final approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or\n\nbefore March 23, 2020, to facilitate alignment of product development plans with FDA's\n\ninterpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.\n\nAlthough the majority of therapeutic biological products have been licensed under section 351 of\n\nthe PHS Act, some protein products historically have been approved under section 505 of the\n\nFD&C Act (see the Appendix to this guidance for examples of such products). On March 23,\n\n2010, the BPCI Act was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n\n(Public Law 111-148). The BPCI Act clarified the statutory authority under which certain\n\nprotein products will be regulated by amending the definition of a \"biological product\"2 in\n\nsection 351(i) of the PHS Act to include a \"protein (except any chemically synthesizedpolypeptide),\"3 and describing procedures for submission of a marketing application for certain biological products.\n\nFootnote 3: FDA has described its interpretation of the statutory terms \u201cprotein\u201d and \u201cchemically synthesized polypeptide\u201d in the amended definition of \u201cbiological product\u201d in guidance. See draft guidance for industry New and Revised Draft Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act (Revision 2). When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic. FDA\u2019s guidances for industry are available on the FDA Drugs guidance web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs web guidance page. In addition, in the Federal Register of December 12, 2018, FDA also has issued a proposed rule to amend its regulation that defines \u201cbiological product\u201d to incorporate changes made by the BPCI Act, and to provide its interpretation of the statutory terms \u201cprotein\u201d and \u201cchemically synthesized polypeptide.\u201d When final, this regulation will codify FDA\u2019s interpretation of these terms.\n\nThe BPCI Act requires that a marketing application for a \"biological product\" (that previously could have been submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act) must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act; this requirement is subject to certain exceptions during a 10-year transition period ending on March 23, 2020 (see section 7002(e)(1)-(3) and (e)(5) of the BPCI Act and section II of this guidance). On March 23, 2020 (i.e., the transition date), an approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act (see section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act). This guidance sets forth FDA's current interpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nBPCI Act\n\nThe BPCI Act amended the PHS Act and other statutes to create an abbreviated licensure pathway in section 351(k) of the PHS Act for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product (see sections 7001 through 7003 of the BPCI Act). The objectives of the BPCI Act are conceptually similar to those of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-417) (commonly referred to as the \"Hatch-Waxman Amendments\"), which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of drug products under section 505(b)(2) and 505(j) of the FD&C Act. An abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products can present challenges given the scientific and technical complexities that may be associated with the generally larger and typically more complex structure of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured. Most biological products are produced in a living system such as a microorganism, or plant or animal cells, whereas small molecule drugs are typically manufactured through chemical synthesis.\n\nSection 351(k) of the PHS Act, added by the BPCI Act, sets forth, among other things, the requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product and an application or a supplement for a proposed interchangeable product. Section 351(i) defines \"biosimilarity\" to mean that \"the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components\" and that \"there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product\" (section 351(i)(2) of the PHS Act). A 351(k) application must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product based upon data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies, unless FDA determines, in its discretion, that certain studies are unnecessary in a 351(k) application (see section 351(k)(2) of the PHS Act). To meet the standard for \"interchangeability,\" an applicant must provide sufficient information to demonstrate biosimilarity, and also to demonstrate that the biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, if the biological product is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch (see section 351(k)(4) of the PHS Act). Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider (see section 351(i)(3) of the PHS Act).\n\nThe BPCI Act also includes, among other provisions:\n\nA 12-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which approval of a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be made effective (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nA 4-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be submitted (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.590873718261719", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: B.: Applications for Biological Products Submitted Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act on or Before the Transition Date\n\nQ5.: When will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the application number that will be used for its deemed BLA?\n\nFDA intends to assign the same application number used for the approved NDA to the deemed BLA on the March 23, 2020, transition date. As a hypothetical example, NDA 012345 would be deemed to be BLA 012345 on the transition date. This approach is intended to minimize burden on holders of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act who are preparing submissions to their applications around the transition date and to facilitate the administrative conversion of any pending supplements to such applications (see the Transition Policy Final Guidance for additional information regarding such supplements). The use of a predictable application numbering system for deemed BLAs is also expected to facilitate preparation and submission of a 351(k) BLA for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeableproduct that references a product licensed in a deemed 351(a) BLA as a reference product. The FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date will include the product's BLA number.\n\nWhen will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the license number that will apply to its deemed BLA(s)?\n\nThe FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be an approved BLA will include the U.S. license number assigned to the application holder. Each establishment that is listed in the approved NDA as currently involved in the manufacture of the biological product on the transition date will be considered a licensed establishment on that date (see section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act; see also section 7002(e)(4)(B)(iii) of the BPCI Act). FDA does not intend to conduct pre-license inspections of manufacturers of the transitioning biological products because FDA interprets section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act to mean that an approved application under the FD&C Act for the biological product will be \"deemed to be a license\" on the transition date by operation of the statute.12 Moreover, the establishments will have been inspected in connection with the previously approved NDAs under the FD&C Act (see Q16 below for information on establishment inspections related to certain supplements to a deemed 351(a) BLA).\n\nFootnote 12: See also footnote 10 in the response to Q2.\n\nFDA issues only one U.S. license number per BLA holder, regardless of the number of licensed biological products manufactured by that BLA holder under separate BLAs. Accordingly, if an NDA holder is also a BLA holder and has been assigned a U.S. license number for another biological product, the NDA holder will not be issued a different U.S. license number when its approved NDA for a biological product is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date.\n\nSection 351(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the PHS Act requires that each package of a biological product is plainly marked with, among other things, the applicable license number of the manufacturer of the biological product in order for the biological product to be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce. To minimize possible disruption in the distribution of biological products in the United States and to minimize burden on holders of deemed BLAs, FDA intends to adopt a compliance policy for the labeling of biological products that are the subject of deemed BLAs (see Q14 and section IV below for additional information on the compliance policy for labeling of biological products in deemed BLAs).\n\nWill an approved NDA for a biological product be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA or a 351(k) BLA?\n\nFDA interprets the transition provision, along with the applicable provisions of the FD&C Act and the PHS Act, to mean that an approved NDA, including an application submitted through the pathway described by section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act (505(b)(2) application), will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA on the transition date.\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act is directed primarily to the submission of an application for a biological product during the transition period ending on March 23, 2020, and does not explicitly state whether an approved NDA will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA or a 351(k) BLA. The Agency's interpretation that an approved NDA submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA is based on the shared requirement that both types of applications contain full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (or, for a 351(a) BLA, safety, purity, and potency). We expect that the measures FDA has taken to minimize differences in the review and approval of products in marketing applications submitted under section 351(a) of the PHS Act and section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act will facilitate implementation of the statutory provision under which an approved NDA will be deemed to be a BLA.\n\nThe Agency's interpretation that an approved 505(b)(2) application will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA reflects the shared requirement that both types of applications contain full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (or, for a 351(a) BLA, safety, purity, and potency).13 This approach also reflects the Agency's view that it is more appropriate to regulate a biological product approved through the 505(b)(2) pathway that may be intended to differ in certain respects (e.g., different strength, dosage form, or route of administration or approved conditions of use) from a previously approved product under the statutory and regulatory framework for 351(a) BLAs, as such differences are not permitted under the statutory framework for 351(k) BLAs. Moreover, FDA's approval of a 505(b)(2) application reflects the Agency's evaluation of the data against a different statutory standard than a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: A 505(b)(2) application is an NDA that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use (e.g., FDA\u2019s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug or published literature).\n\nWill an approved NDA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing be deemed to be a BLA?*\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) states that an \"approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the [FD&C Act]\" will be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date. Accordingly, FDA interprets the statute to mean that an approved NDA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing, but for which FDA has not withdrawn approval of the application, will be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date. The holder of an NDA for a discontinued product must comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for its application before the transition date, and after its application is deemed to be a BLA. These requirements include, for example, postmarketing reporting of adverse drug experiences and, if appropriate, the submission of proposed revisions to product labeling. If the holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing seeks to reintroduce the product to the market, the BLA holder should consult with the relevant FDA review division before submitting a supplement to the deemed BLA, to discuss any data and information that may be needed.\n\nHow will the transition on March 23, 2020, affect the annual program fee for an approved NDA for a biological product?\n\nUnder section 736(a)(2) of the FD&C Act, a person named as the applicant in a human drug application (which refers to an NDA or a 351(a) BLA, subject to applicable statutory exceptions) is assessed an annual prescription drug program fee. A prescription drug program fee is assessed each fiscal year for each prescription drug product identified in a human drug application approved as of October 1 of the fiscal year, with certain exceptions described by statute. For more information about the prescription drug program fee, consult the FDA guidance for industry Assessing User Fees Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017 (May 2018).\n\nIn general, sponsors of biological products for which annual prescription drug program fees are assessed prior to the transition, and that are deemed to be licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act on the transition date, will continue to be assessed prescription drug program fees for such products after the transition, subject to applicable statutory requirements and exceptions.\n\nIf an applicant withdraws an NDA that is tentatively approved on or before the transition date, or otherwise pending with FDA, and submits an application for the same product under section 351(a) of the PHS Act, will an additional PDUFA application fee be assessed?\n\nAn applicant (or the applicant's licensee, assignee, or successor) will not be charged a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) application fee for the submission of an application under section 351(a) of the PHS Act if all of the following circumstances are satisfied (see section 736(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act):\n\nThe applicant previously submitted an NDA for the same product and paid the associated PDUFA application fee for the NDA.\n\nThe NDA was accepted for filing. (Note that an NDA for a biological product will not be accepted for filing after the transition date.)\n\nThe NDA was not approved14 or was withdrawn (without a waiver). Footnote 14: An NDA that is tentatively approved is notan approved NDA (see 21 CFR 314.105(a)).\n\nFor questions regarding user fees, please contact the User Fee Staff at\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.7049672603607178", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: The holders of deemed BLAs may be required to report or provide different information than is required for biological products under the FD&C Act. In the sections below, we highlight such requirements, namely lot release, biological product distribution reports, notification of manufacturing problems involving distributed products, and establishment standards for \"non-specified biological products.\"Additionally, as with all biological products, FDA may recommend changes to the control strategy throughout the product life cycle to modernize control strategies, to address product-specific issues, and to help ensure that biological products remain safe, pure, and potent for their approved conditions of use. Furthermore, as with all biological products, these changes may be recommended as a result of postapproval or surveillance inspections, which are independent of a submission and generally expected to be similar for a biological product whether approved in an NDA prior to the transition date or licensed in a BLA. For inspections related to CMC supplements see Q16 below.\n\nFDA is committed to working with application holders to minimize any potential burden, and encourages application holders with any CMC-related questions to contact OPQ/Office of Program and Regulatory Operations (OPRO) at CDER-OPQ-Inquiries@fda.hhs.gov.\n\niv.1.1 Lot Release\n\nFDA may require that a BLA holder submit samples and CMC data for each lot of product for FDA review and release (see 21 CFR 610.2). However, FDA generally does not anticipate that lot release requirements will apply for biological products approved in NDAs that are deemed to be BLAs.\n\nIn 1995, FDA announced the elimination of lot-by-lot release for licensed well-characterized therapeutic recombinant DNA-derived and monoclonal antibody biotechnology products (see the 1995 (Federal\\,Register) notice \"Interim Definition and Elimination of Lot-by-Lot Release For Well-Characterized Therapeutic Recombinant DNA-Derived and Monoclonal Antibody Biotechnology Products; Notice,\" (60 FR 63048, December 8, 1995)). FDA subsequently amended 21 CFR 601.2 to specify, instead of the term \"well characterized biotechnology product,\" the categories of products to which lot-by-lot release would not be necessary (see \"Elimination of Establishment License Application for Specified Biotechnology and Specified Synthetic Biological Products,\" 61 FR 24227, May 14, 1996). Most of the biological products subject to the transition provision will meet the description of products for which lot-by-lot release is not required. Furthermore, for biological products that do not fall into the categories specified in 21 CFR 601.2, FDA generally does not anticipate that lot-by-lot release will be needed. As stated in the December 1995 (Federal\\,Register) notice:\n\n[O]nce a company has demonstrated its ability to consistently produce acceptable lots, and has procedures in place that will prevent the release of lots that do not meet release specifications, it is not necessary for FDA to verify that each manufactured lot is acceptable for release.19\n\nFDA generally considers application holders for biological products subject to the transition provision as having demonstrated the \"ability to consistently produce acceptable lots\" and as having \"procedures in place that will prevent the release of lots that do not meet release specifications\" based on product history.\n\n4.2.2 Product Distribution Reports\n\nFDA anticipates that all biological product application holders will have adequate records of the product distributed to the market. Although the frequency and content of distribution reporting required for products regulated under the FD&C Act and PHS Act differ, FDA expects these differences will present minimal burden to holders of deemed BLAs.\n\nApplication holders of biological products affected by the transition provision should be aware that 21 CFR 600.81, which covers product distribution reporting for licensed BLAs, requires submission of more granular distribution data than is required for approved NDAs under 21 CFR 314.81. However, FDA anticipates that affected application holders will generally already have the distribution information specified in 21 CFR 600.81. Additionally, 21 CFR 600.81 requires reporting every 6 months, in contrast to annual reporting. However, holders of deemed BLAs may request at any time, including within the first 6 months of being deemed a BLA, a waiver to provide product distribution reports annually (e.g., to align with the timing of the holder's Annual Report) rather than every 6 months (21 CFR 600.90). The requirements for a waiver request are described in 21 CFR 600.90.\n\n4.2.3 Notification of Manufacturing Problems Involving Distributed Products\n\nRegardless of whether a biological product has been approved under the FD&C Act or licensed under the PHS Act, application holders are required to report certain events that have the potential to affect the safety, purity, or potency of a distributed product. Under the FD&C Act, reporting of such events is through a field alert report (FAR) (see 21 CFR 314.81(b)(1)), while under the PHS Act, reporting is through a biological product deviation report (BPDR) (see 21 CFR 600.14). FDA expects the change in reporting between FAR and BPDR will present minimal burden to holders of deemed BLAs.\n\nIn particular, we note that under 21 CFR 600.14, application holders for biological products approved under the FD&C Act will be required, once the product is deemed to be licensed under a BLA, to report on events with the potential to affect the safety, purity, or potency of a distributed product by submission of BPDRs to CDER. Additionally, the BPDR is to be submitted as soon as possible but within 45 calendar days of acquiring information reasonably suggesting that a reportable event has occurred (rather than within 3 calendar days as is required in the case of a FAR). Finally, for any initial FAR submitted by the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product before March 23, 2020, the corresponding follow-up report is to be submitted as a BPDR if submitted on or after March 23, 2020.\n\n4.2.4 Establishment Standards for \"Non-Specified Biological Products\"\n\nBiological products that do not fall within the specified categories of biological products described in 21 CFR 601.2 (\"non-specified biological products\") are subject to certain additional CMC-related requirements under the PHS Act when seeking marketing approval in a BLA or BLA supplement (see establishment standards described in 21 CFR 600.10, 600.11, 600.12 and 600.13). These requirements differ in some respects from establishment standards under the FD&C Act; however, FDA expects the practical implications for transition biological products tobe minimal. As a preliminary matter, we note that an approved NDA for a biological product will be deemed to be a license (i.e., an approved BLA) for the biological product by operation of the BPCI Act. Accordingly, certain premarket approval requirements may not be applicable unless the application holder seeks approval of a supplement to the deemed BLA and the requirement applies to the supplement (see Q16 below). Moreover, as provided in 21 CFR 601.2, the additional requirements described above are not applicable to the \"specified categories\" of biological products described in that section of the regulations, and many transition biological products will fall within those identified categories of biological products, for which such additional requirements would not be applicable.\n\nQ16. What is required for CMC changes submitt d in a PAS or changes being effected supplements submitted to deemed 351(a) BLAs?\n\nFDA requires applicants or application holders of biological products--whether approved under the FD&C Act or licensed under the PHS Act--to notify FDA about each change in the conditions established in an approved application. The types of reporting categories for biological products generally are the same for an NDA (see 21 CFR 314.70) and for a BLA (see 21 CFR 601.12), and in both cases, the applicant or application holder is expected to demonstrate that the postchange product continues to be of acceptable quality as it may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. Overall, the nature and type of data required to support such a demonstration has historically been similar for biological products approved under the FD&C Act or licensed under the PHS Act.\n\nHowever, there are limited differences with respect to the type, timing, and evaluation of certain data in submissions, and verification of these data during the review cycle and inspection varies. For example, validation data would be required to be submitted in BLA supplements to support certain postapproval changes (21 CFR 601.12). In another example, for biological products that do not fall within the specified categories of biological products described in 21 CFR 601.2 (\"non-specified biological products\"), compliance with the establishment standards set forth under 21 CFR 600.10, 600.11, 600.12, and 600.13 may be required for a BLA supplement to support certain postapproval changes (e.g., addition of a new facility).\n\nApplication holders that intend to propose manufacturing changes are encouraged to contact OPQ/OPRO at CDER-OPO-Inquiries@fda.hhs.gov. FDA is committed to working with application holders to minimize any potential burden.\n\nv.1.1 Data Necessary to Support a Process or Manufacturing Site Change\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.5249526500701904", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: Q16. What is required for CMC changes submitt d in a PAS or changes being effected supplements submitted to deemed 351(a) BLAs?\n\nFDA requires applicants or application holders of biological products--whether approved under the FD&C Act or licensed under the PHS Act--to notify FDA about each change in the conditions established in an approved application. The types of reporting categories for biological products generally are the same for an NDA (see 21 CFR 314.70) and for a BLA (see 21 CFR 601.12), and in both cases, the applicant or application holder is expected to demonstrate that the postchange product continues to be of acceptable quality as it may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product.

For example, validation data would be required to be submitted in BLA supplements to support certain postapproval changes (21 CFR 601.12). In another example, for biological products that do not fall within the specified categories of biological products described in 21 CFR 601.2 (\"non-specified biological products\"), compliance with the establishment standards set forth under 21 CFR 600.10, 600.11, 600.12, and 600.13 may be required for a BLA supplement to support certain postapproval changes (e.g., addition of a new facility).\n\nApplication holders that intend to propose manufacturing changes are encouraged to contact OPQ/OPRO at CDER-OPO-Inquiries@fda.hhs.gov. FDA is committed to working with application holders to minimize any potential burden.\n\nv.1.1 Data Necessary to Support a Process or Manufacturing Site Change\n\nSupplements to applications for biological products subject to the transition provision that remain under review after the transition date, including supplements submitted prior to the transition date, must comply with 21 CFR 601.12 and other applicable regulations. Applicants should also consult relevant guidances for biological products. A supplement submitted to a deemed BLA to support process or manufacturing site changes must contain, for the lots manufactured using the postchange process, manufacturing process validation data (see 21 CFR 601.12). Specifically, process validation for a BLA should be performed at commercial manufacturing scale, prior to submission of a supplement. Process validation information should be included in the supplement as this may affect submission and implementation timelines of the changes for commercial distribution.\n\nA supplement requesting approval of a proposed change to the manufacturing site for a biological product also must assess the effects of the change and contain sufficient information to support the safety, purity, and potency of material manufactured with the change (21 CFR 601.12(a)(2); compare 21 CFR 314.70). In assessing the effects of the change, information demonstrating comparability of the pre and postchange material should also be submitted, consistent with the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process (June 2005) and the recommendations below.\n\nComparability data.\n\nThe type and amount of data needed to support a comparability exercise depends on the extent of the changes and the potential risk to product quality. A robust control strategy for drug substance and drug product is critical in generating comparability data. For example, a potency assay that is accurate, precise, and reliable will facilitate the review of manufacturing changes. In some cases, in addition to the typical battery of release tests, extended characterization may be necessary for comparison, in particular for process changes that may affect purity, potency, or safety of the product.\n\nBatch analysis data.\n\nAppropriate stability data.\n\nGenerally, limited real-time stability data for the postchange product and comparability study results, including stability data under accelerated and stressed storage conditions, are sufficient to leverage existing stability data to support the shelf life of the postchange product.\n\nAs with all biological products, FDA may recommend changes to the control strategy throughout the product life cycle to modernize outdated assays, to address product-specific issues, and to help ensure that biological products remain safe, pure, and potent for their approved conditions of use.\n\nvi.2.2 Facility Inspections Related to Certain Supplements to a Deemed 351(a) BLA\n\nWhether a biological product is regulated under the FD&C Act or the PHS Act, application holders for biological products should be ready for FDA inspections to assure such compliance with the conditions of approval.\n\nAfter March 23, 2020, supplements submitted to deemed BLAs, including supplements submitted prior to the transition date but with an action date after the transition date, must comply with the inspection requirements as specified in the relevant regulations in 21 CFR part 600.\n\nIn particular, supplements for site changes where facilities are added to the license or supplements for major manufacturing changes may be subject to an inspection. FDA intends to contact the holder of a deemed BLA to schedule any such inspection during the review of the supplement. After March 23, 2020, holders of deemed BLAs that submit a site change or major manufacturing change supplement are advised that, as with the holder of any BLA, they should be ready for an inspection while in operation and manufacturing the product for which the change is requested during the supplement review timeframe.\n\nQ17. Can the application holder for a deemed 351(a) BLA for a biological product originally approved through the 505(b)(2) pathway submit a supplement that relies, in part, on FDA's finding of safety, purity, and potency for another licensed biological product?\n\nSupplements to a deemed 351(a) BLA, like any supplement to any 351(a) BLA, must meet the requirements of section 351(a) of the PHS Act. The holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product originally approved through the 505(b)(2) pathway may not, for example, submit an efficacy supplement to the deemed 351(a) BLA that relies on FDA's finding of safety, purity, and potency for another licensed biological product (e.g., for a newly approved indication or other condition of use for a related biological product).\n\nThere might be instances where there is a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a stand-alone NDA or a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a 505(b)(2) application that would be administratively converted to a pending efficacy supplement to the corresponding deemed 351(a) BLA on the transition date. To obtain approval under section 351(a) of the PHS Act, the applicant may need to amend the administratively converted supplement to provide the scientific data necessary to meet the requirements of section 351(a) of the PHS Act, or a right of reference to such data, for the change proposed in the supplement.\n\nQ18. Can a biological product approved in an NDA that is deemed to be a 351(a) BLA on the transition date subsequently be a \"reference product\" for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product?\n\nA biological product approved in an NDA (including a 505(b)(2) application) that is deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act may be a reference product for a 351(k) BLA. The term \"reference product\" is defined as the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in an application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act (see section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nSponsors may request advice from FDA regarding proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product development programs that identify a biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as the intended reference product. A sponsor will be able to submit a 351(k) BLA that references the biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as its reference product after the NDA for the biological product is deemed to be a 351(a) BLA.\n\nQ19. Can an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a \"deemed\" 351(a) BLA seek a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act to another biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act?\n\nAny person (including an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a \"deemed\" 351(a) BLA) may seek to establish the biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product to another biological product licensed or deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. FDA intends to work with applicants to address scientific or regulatory issues that may arise in the context of these 351(k) development programs, and to provide additional procedural information. Any sponsor or applicant may contact the relevant review division within the Office of New Drugs in FDA's CDER to request advice on a 351(k) development program.\n\nD. Transition of Biological Products from the Orange Book to the Purple Book\n\nQ20. Will any therapeutic equivalence evaluations for biological products previously listed in the Orange Book be reflected in the Purple Book?\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.8703821897506714", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry, Does the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n--------------------\nContext: Accordingly, an original 505(b)(2) application (including a resubmission) for a biological product that relies, at least in part, on FDA's finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug that is a biological product will receive a complete response if the application is pending at the end of the day (11:59 pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) on Friday, March 20, 2020, because the NDA for the listed drug relied upon will no longer exist at midnight on Monday, March 23, 2020.\n\nFDA intends to assist applicants who may be affected by section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act, where feasible and appropriate. For example, during the review of a BLA submitted after the transition date under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act for a proposed biological product that was previously submitted, but not approved, in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act, FDA intends to consider any previously conducted scientific review by the Agency of such previous application under the FD&C Act, to the extent that such review is relevant to, and consistent with, applicable requirements of section 351 of the PHS Act.\n\nAn application generally includes all amendments and supplements to the application.13 We recognize that there may be one or more supplements submitted to an approved NDA for a biological product before March 23, 2020, that is pending on March 23, 2020. Such supplements may include a prior approval supplement (e.g., an efficacy supplement,14 a labeling supplement,\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \\hline Date/Time & Relevant Application Type & Event \\ \\hline Friday, March 20, 2020, 11:59 pm (EDT) & Pending 505(b)(2) applications that rely, at least in part, on FDA\u2019s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug that is a biological product & Deadline for any pending 505(b)(2) application of this type to be approved under the FD\\&C Act. \\ \\hline Monday, March 23, 2020, 12:00 am (EDT) & Approved NDAs for biological products & Approved NDAs for biological products are deemed to be BLAs, and cease to exist as NDAs. \\ \\hline Monday, March 23, 2020, 12:01 am (EDT) & 351(k) BLA that relies on a deemed BLA for its reference product & A 351(k) BLA can be submitted for a proposed biosimilar or a proposed interchangeable to a biological reference product that is the subject of a deemed BLA. \\ \\hline Monday, March 23, 2020, 11:59 pm (EDT) & Approved NDAs for biological products & FDA intends to send a letter to each holder of an approved NDA for a biological product that advises that the approved NDA has been deemed to be a BLA by operation of the statute, and no longer exists as an NDA.

For example, a pending \"stand-alone\" efficacy supplement to a \"stand-alone\" NDA16 (e.g., a supplement intended to address a post-approval requirement or post-approval commitment) will be administratively converted to a pending efficacy supplement to the corresponding deemed 351(a) BLA on the transition date and reviewed under applicable standards for 351(a) BLAs. Similarly, a pending CBE supplement to an application submitted under the FD&C Act will be administratively converted to a pending CBE supplement to the deemed BLA on the transition date, irrespective of whether the change described in the CBE supplement has been implemented before or after the transition date. The Agency also intends to maintain the same goal date, where applicable, for completion of its review of such supplements.\n\nFootnote 15: See generally 21 CFR 314.70.\n\nFootnote 16: See section III.B.1 of this guidance for information on \u201cstand-alone\u201d NDAs. There may be additional considerations for a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a stand-alone NDA and a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a 505(b)(2) application.\n\nii.2.2 Removal of Biological Products from the Orange Book on March 23, 2020\n\nFDA intends to remove biological products that have been approved in NDAs from FDA's Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book)17 on March 23, 2020, based on the Agency's position that these products are no longer \"listed drugs\" and such NDAs may not be relied upon by a 505(b)(2) applicant (or ANDA applicant) for approval. After March 23, 2020, FDA will not approve any NDA (or ANDA), including those that are pending or tentatively approved, for a biological product.\n\nFootnote 17: Biological products approved in NDAs that are deemed to be BLAs will be listed in FDA\u2019s Lists of Licensed Biological Products with Reference Product Exclusivity and Biosimilarity or Interchangeability Evaluations (the Purple Book) on or shortly after the March 23, 2020, transition date.\n\nMoreover, with the exception of orphan drug exclusivity and pediatric exclusivity, the exclusivity provisions of the FD&C Act serve to limit the submission or approval of applications under section 505 of the FD&C Act, but not under section 351 of the PHS Act. Section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act provides that no applications for biological products may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act after the transition date. Accordingly, on March 23, 2020, any unexpired period of exclusivity associated with an approved NDA for a biological product subject to section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act (e.g., 5-year exclusivity or 3-year exclusivity) would\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]\n\ndeemed to be licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. Reference product exclusivity recognizes the fact that the sponsor of an eligible reference product generated (and submitted for review) the data and information required to obtain a license under section 351(a) of the PHS Act and limits competition from biosimilar and interchangeable products for a limited period of time. The biological products that will be deemed to have BLAs on the transition date, however, have already obtained marketing approval under a different statutory authority. Allowing such products to obtain a separate 12-year period of reference product exclusivity would inappropriately impede biosimilar or interchangeable product competition in several product classes.\n\nRecognizing these principles, FDA interprets section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act together with section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act such that section 351(k)(7)(A)-(B) of the PHS Act applies only to products that have undergone review and licensing under section 351(a), and not to biological products that will be deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act on the transition date. At the same time, FDA interprets the limitations on eligibility for reference product exclusivity in section 351(k)(7)(C) of the PHS Act to apply to any \"reference product,\" without regard to whether such product was \"first licensed under subsection (a)\" or instead deemed to be a license under section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act. Nothing in the BPCI Act suggests that Congress intended holders of deemed BLAs to be able to circumvent the statutory limitations on eligibility for a 12-year period of reference product exclusivity through subsequent submissions simply because the previous reference product was deemed to be licensed under section 7002(e). Therefore, FDA interprets section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act together with section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act such that section 351(k)(7)(C) will operate to bar supplements to deemed BLAs and, where applicable, subsequent BLAs from being eligible for their own periods of reference product exclusivity.\n\nRecommendations for Sponsors of Proposed Protein Products Intended for Submission in an Application Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act\n\nSponsors of development programs for proposed protein products should evaluate whether a planned submission under section 505 of the FD&C Act would allow adequate time for approval of the application prior to March 23, 2020, considering, among other things, whether the submission may require a second cycle of review and, for certain types of applications, whether unexpired patents or exclusivity may delay final approval. FDA's recommendations for sponsors are based on whether a \"stand-alone\" or abbreviated development program is planned.\n\n1.1 \"Stand-Alone\" New Drug Applications\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.6605826020240784"], "Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n--------------------\nContext: It is not FDA policy to request documents during an inspection to which the Agency is not legally entitled. On occasion, the Agency may request such documents when pursuing an audit trail of a possible violation. Under these circumstances, it is the laboratory's prerogative to cooperate or refuse without fear of reprisal. The requests should be specific and pertinent to the inspection. The Agency discourages investigators from making vague requests to see documents with no specific purpose in mind.\n* Should the Form-FD-483, Notice of Observations issued by the FDA investigator reflect current practices only; and should it include practices that were corrected during the course of the inspection?\n\nThe FD-483 can include historical practices, which may have affected the scientific validity of the nonclinical study in question even though subsequent correction may have occurred. Any corrective action taken by the facility will be noted by the investigator in the establishment inspection report.\n* At time of the observation, the management should discuss any differing opinions and attempt to clarify the investigator's perceptions or observations. The management may also, at the conclusion of the inspection, offer to explain what the management considers to be erroneous 483 observations. Should the matter in question remain unresolved, a written objection should be sent to the local FDA district director or a meeting with district personnel should be requested to attempt to resolve the issue.\n* What is the procedure for correcting errors in the FDA investigator's inspection report? Such errors can be damaging to the laboratories since the reports are ultimately available through FOI.\n\nIf in fact an error is made in an investigator's report, the matter should be immediately brought to the attention of FDA district management. If district management agrees with the complaint, the report will be amended and amended reports will be sent to all outside persons who may have received the erroneous report. It should be stressed, however, that the time to change what a facility believes is an erroneous conclusion is when the FD-483 is discussed with laboratory management because as soon as the FD-483 is presented to management, it becomes available for public disclosure.\n18. Does refusal to allow the FDA investigator access to certain information, which the laboratory sincerely believes is not subject to FDA jurisdiction, constitute a refusal of inspection? How can a disagreement of this kind be resolved? Refusal to permit access to records which are associated with a study being audited or which preclude a judgement being made regarding compliance with GLPs, is considered a refusal of inspection with certain ensuing consequences. However, a facility may legitimately question FDA authority to review certain documents. Such objections and the reasons therefore, should be presented in writing or by telephone to the FDA district office management where the investigator is based. Each case will be individually reviewed both in the field and, if necessary at headquarters and a decision will be communicated to the inspected facility.\n19. Will inspections and audits of foreign laboratories be carried out? Who pays for these inspections? Inspections are being conducted of foreign facilities, which have engaged in nonclinical studies, which have been submitted to FDA in support of a marketing permit. FDA pays for travel and other expenses associated with such inspections.\n20. In order for foreign laboratories to comply with the GLPs, do protocols, standard operating procedures, records, etc. have to be in English? Do FDA investigators bring interpreters with them to review records and data? Submissions to FDA in support of a marketing application for a FDA regulated product must be in English. Review of source documents at the site of the foreign facility may necessitate review of documents written in the language of the country of origin. FDA does not employ interpreters to accompany investigators on foreign inspections. It has been our experience that persons associated with the laboratory are normally fluent in the English language.\n21. What kind of training does an FDA investigator have which qualifies him/her to conduct a GLP inspection or data audit? Does the investigator draw conclusions from his observations regarding the competence of the laboratory or quality of the studies? Along with education in one of the natural or physical sciences, the individuals selected to conduct GLP inspections generally have had considerable experience inspecting facilities involved in drug manufacturing, biologics production, medical device assembly, food processing, and a range of other operations on products regulated by the Agency. In addition, the investigators conducting nonclinical laboratory inspections (GLPs) have undergone intensive training in the normal operating procedures of nonclinical testing facilities. This training which includes a full review of the Agency's policies and of the GLP regulations National Center for Toxicological Research accomplished at FDA's National located in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. Field investigators are encouraged to contact any resource within the Agency, i.e., scientists and other personnel of the various bureaus to resolve scientific questions that may arise during an inspection. Bureau scientists and not the investigators, draw conclusions regarding the competence of the laboratory of the quality of the study\n22. Does a laboratory manager have the right to ask for the FDA investigator's educational and experience qualifications prior to a GLP inspection?\n\nYes, questions regarding the formal training, educational experience, and on-the-job training of an individual investigator may be addressed to the investigator prior to a GLP inspection.\n23. What can a laboratory manager do when he encounters an FDA investigator who is overly antagonistic or uncertain as to what he is looking for?\n\nThe Agency makes every effort to promote a professional attitude in its investigators including special training and selection of investigators for this program. However, if in the judgement of the laboratory manager there is a question as to the qualifications or attitude of the investigator, the local FDA district office director should be contacted.\n24. What assurance does a firm have that confidential or trade secret information given to the FDA investigator will be safeguarded by the Agency? What happens when an FOI request for the inspection report is received by FDA?\n\nSection 301(j) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits any employee from revealing for his/her advantage any information obtained in the course of carrying out his/her duties. Trade secrets and confidential commercial information are deleted from documents before they are released under FOI. Inspected firms may help by identifying information, which they consider to be confidential when it is given to the investigator. FDA will however, exercise its own judgment, in accordance with its FOI regulations as to whether such information may properly be classified as confidential.\n25. How can copies of inspection reports be obtained under FOI?\n\nInspection reports may be obtained by making a request under FOI to:\n\nFreedom of Information Staff, HFI-35\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration5600 Fishers Lane\n\nRockville, Maryland 20857\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit Comments Online (https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-1976-N-0476-0380)\n\nYou can submit online or written comments on any guidance at any time (see 21 CFR 10.115(g)(5))\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061\n\nRockville, MD 20852\n\nAll written comments should be identified with this document's docket number: FDA-1976-N-0476-0380\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-1976-N-0476-0380).\n\nSearch for FDA\n\nGuidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Management Briefings, Post Conference Report, Aug 1979 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.1113467812538147", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA recognizes that some facilities maintain documents in paper format and not all electronic systems will be accessible for direct viewing. Thus, when such a facility agrees to participate in a remote interactive evaluation, they should consider taking steps to enable FDA's remote viewing and verification of the facility's documents, procedures, and electronic systems. Requested documents maintained in paper format should be scanned as searchable Portable Document Format (PDF) files when possible.\n\nConcluding a Remote Interactive Evaluation\n\nUpon completion of a remote interactive evaluation, FDA will have a closeout meeting with the facility's management. During this meeting, FDA will usually present a written list of observations, if any, and describe and discuss any observations in sufficient detail to enable understanding and foster an appropriate response.13 This written list of observations will not be a final Agency action or decision. FDA will not issue a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations. As with an inspection, FDA encourages facilities to respond during the discussion and/or provide responses in writing to the observations within 15 U.S. business days.\n\nFootnote 13: If the remote interactive evaluation, including the review of any records before or during the evaluation, is intended to supplement a scheduled inspection, then FDA usually will combine any observations from the remote interactive evaluation(s) into a single written list of observations issued at the close of the inspection, which would be issued on a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations.\n\nDepending on the purpose and outcome of the remote interactive evaluation, the information and documentation collected may be used to, among other regulatory purposes:\n\nSupport FDA's assessment of pending applications, including whether to approve an application\n\nPreclude the need for an inspection in follow-up to a reported concern or defect\n\nSupport a regulatory meeting, warning letter, import alert, recall activities, or enforcement action\n\nRank or prioritize a facility for an inspection, particularly a surveillance CGMP inspection\n\nJustify a follow-up or compliance inspection or any other surveillance activity\n\nAfter the remote interactive evaluation concludes, FDA will provide a copy of the final remote interactive evaluation report to the facility. A remote interactive evaluation report and any written list of observations may be subject to a disclosure request under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nIf FDA determines that an inspection will be necessary based on the outcome of the remote interactive evaluation, we will use the information obtained from the remote interactive evaluation to prepare for and conduct the inspection.\n\nVI Impacts of Remote Interactive Evaluations on Established Commitments and Timeframes\n\nIn general, the use of remote interactive evaluations should help FDA operate within normal timeframes (i.e., in a similar manner as an inspection) as outlined below, especially for higher priority activities in spite of challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFDA intends to use information from a remote interactive evaluation to meet user fee commitments and to update FDA's relevant internal databases. FDA expects that a remote interactive evaluation will generally enable us to meet a user fee goal date. However, FDA will notify applicants if we expect to miss a user fee goal date.\n\nAppendix A Commitments for Pre-Approval and Pre-License Inspections\n\nFDA will adhere to existing response timeframes applicable to inspections.\n\nAny responses or corrective actions submitted to the FDA in response to the observations identified during the remote interactive evaluation will be considered in the application assessment if provided within 15 U.S. business days of FDA's communication. FDA may defer consideration of responses or corrective actions in the current review cycle if received after 15 days.\n\nResponses received after 15 U.S. business days will be considered in the next application user fee cycle, should the application receive a complete response action and the facility requires re-evaluation.\n\nAppendix B Timeframes for All Inspection Types\n\nFDA generally intends to use existing timelines established for reporting on and evaluating the outcome of an inspection for the remote interactive evaluation.\n\nAny responses or corrective actions submitted to the FDA in response to the issues identified during the remote interactive evaluation will be considered with respect to further regulatory action if provided within 15 U.S. business days of FDA's communication of the observations.\n--------------------\nContext title: Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.9613003730773926", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n--------------------\nContext: establishment, amendment or revocation of a performance standard;\n\nreview of a PMA or PDP;\n\nreview of the Quality System (formerly Good Manufacturing Practice) regulation;\n\nestablishment of minimum national uniform quality standards for mammography facilities.\n\nNote that all meetings of the Medical Device Advisory Committee Panels are held under Part 14. FDA will publish a notice in the Federal Register of advisory committee meetings. In general, ten copies of written submissions to a committee are to be sent to the executive secretary unless otherwise specified in the Federal Register notice.24 Submissions for a Public Hearing under Part 14 do not need to be sent to FDA's Dockets Management Staff.\n\nFootnote 24: 21 CFR 14.35(a).\n\n4 Public Hearing Before the FDA Commissioner (21 CFR Part 15)\n\nA hearing under Part 15 is held at the discretion of the Commissioner, when provided by law or regulation, or as an alternative to a formal evidentiary hearing (where granted in the discretion of the Commissioner), to permit persons to present information and views at a public hearing on any matter pending before the FDA. Examples of issues that can be referred to a Part 15 hearing include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nProposals to allow persons to order custom devices;\n\nProposed Quality System (formerly Good Manufacturing Practice) Regulation;\n\nProposed exemptions from federal preemption of state and local device requirements.25\n\nFootnote 25: 21 CFR 808.25(e).\n\nFDA will publish a notice of hearing in the Federal Register. The scope of a hearing is determined by the notice of hearing and any regulation under which the hearing is held. A person may submit information or views on the subject of the hearing in writing to FDA's Dockets Management Staff as described previously.26\n\nFootnote 26: 21 CFR 15.25.\n\n5 Regulatory Hearing Before the FDA (21 CFR Part 16)\n\nA hearing under 21 CFR Part 16 (Regulatory Hearing Before the Food and Drug Administration) is called at the discretion of the FDA Commissioner when considering regulatory action, or when provided by law or regulation. Part 16 provides an opportunity for a regulatory hearing on various matters including but not limited to:\n\nSections 520(g)(4) and (g)(5) of the FD&C Act, relating to disapproval of an Investigational Device Exemption, or notice of a proposed withdrawal of approval;\n\n21 CFR 814.46(c), relating to withdrawal of approval of a PMA;\n\nRescission of a 510(k) clearance;\n\nAn order suspending or revoking an FDA certificate issued to a U.S. mammography facility pursuant to the MQSA.\n\nA regulatory hearing is initiated by a notice of opportunity for hearing from FDA. A person offered a hearing has the amount of time specified in the notice to request a hearing. Under 21 CFR 16.26(a), a request for a hearing may be denied if the request fails to demonstrate a genuine and substantial issue of fact that warrants a hearing; therefore, the request should specify the grounds for the hearing request. FDA and the party requesting the hearing will, if feasible, at least one day before the hearing provide to each other written notice of any published articles or written information to be presented or relied on at the hearing. A regulatory hearing is informal and the rules of evidence do not apply.27\n\nFootnote 27: 21 CFR 16.60(c).\n\nVI Judicial Review\n\nFDA is frequently asked about judicial remedies. A party seeking judicial review of a final action taken by FDA should consult its attorney or perform its own research of applicable statutes and regulations. It is not appropriate for FDA to offer advice or assistance concerning whether, and how, a party may seek judicial review of an adverse decision, and nothing in this guidance should be construed as constraining the ability of a stakeholder to exercise any remedies provided by statute or regulation.\n\nIn general, FDA believes it is in the public interest for parties to avail themselves of administrative remedies within the agency prior to engaging in litigation, so that FDA has the opportunity to reconsider and review any dispute concerning an FDA action before it is referred to judicial review.28 In the event that a petitioner brings judicial action relating to a matter that is subject to a pending review under 21 CFR 10.75 or 10.33, or any other administrative process, the Commissioner may request that the court refer the matter back to the Agency or hold its review in abeyance pending completion of administrative reconsideration.29 Moreover, the Commissioner will generally consider a petition for reconsideration only before the petitioner brings legal action in the courts.\n\nFootnote 28: 21 CFR 10.45.\n\nFootnote 29: 21 CFR 10.33(h).\n\nVII Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n\nThis guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).\n\nThe time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average 8 hours per response, including the time to review instructions, search existing data sources, gather the data needed, and complete and review the information collection. Send comments regarding this burden estimate to:\n\nFDA PRA Staff\n\nOffice of Operations\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nPRAStaff(rda.hhs.gov)\n\nAn Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The OMB control number for this information collection is 0910-0738 (expires 08/31/2022).\n--------------------\nContext title: Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Appeals Processes Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.806673526763916", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n--------------------\nContext: The procedures for the incoming acceptance activities at the subject manufacturing site, if different from the procedures contained and approved in the original PMA.

If procedures are the same as those contained and approved in the original PMA, you should provide a statement indicating this.\n\nC. Determining whether an inspection may be needed.\n\nAs with a premarket approval application, a supplemental premarket approval application may be approved if it meets the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. One such requirement is that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packaging, storage or installation of a device conforms to the requirements of section 520(f) of the FD&C Act. A preapproval inspection for a site change supplement may be necessary for FDA to find that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packaging, storage or installation of the device conform to the requirements of the QS regulation, 21 CFR Part 820. See sections 515(c)(1)(C), 515(d)(2)(C) and 520(f) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. SSS 360e(c)(1)(C), 360e(d)(2)(C) and 360j(f).\n\nCDRH and CBER generally determines whether to conduct an inspection of a new site associated with a site change supplement based upon the following factors:\n\nthe dates of the last inspections of the current site and the new site;\n\nthe classifications of the last inspections of the current site and the new site;\n\nthe relevance of the last QS regulation inspection to the moved manufacturing, processing, or packaging activities (e.g., whether similar products or processes were inspected);\n\na review of relevant recalls and adverse events, associated with manufacturing processes for devices manufactured, processed or packaged at this site; and\n\nthe risk to the safety or effectiveness of the device associated with the manufacturing activities performed at the new site.\n\nCDRH and CBER review the inspectional record to determine the classification of previous inspections. Inspections can be classified as Official Action Indicated (OAI), Voluntary Action Indicated (VAI), or No Action Indicated (NAI). OAI is synonymous with the definition of a Situation I inspection as defined in Part V of FDA's Compliance Program 7382.845, \"Inspection of Medical Device Manufacters.\"15 Situation I indicates one or more major deficiencies with the Quality System regulation such that FDA is prepared to initiate administrative and/or regulatory action, including, but not limited to, issuance of a warning letter, injunction, detention, seizure, civil money penalty, or prosecution. NAI and VAI classifications are generally synonymous with a Situation II inspection, which indicates Quality System deficiencies of a quantity or type to conclude that there is a minimal probability, in light of the relationship between quality system deficiencies observed and the particular device and manufacturing process involved, that the establishment will produce nonconforming or defective finished devices. In Situation II, FDA informs the establishment of any objectionable findings, but generally does not initiate administrative or regulatory action.\n\nFootnote 15: See supra n. 6.\n\nCDRH and CBER intend to consider the factors outlined above in determining the need for an inspection at the time of review. For example, when the new site has not been inspected or the last inspection of either the current or the new site was classified as OAI, then FDA intends to conduct an inspection of the new site if CDRH or CBER reviews the site change supplement and concludes that it is approvable pending a non-violative (Situation II) inspection. Manufacturers may contact the appropriate office to discuss whether a pre-approval inspection may be required; the pre-submission process may be utilized for these interactions, if appropriate.16\n\nFootnote 16: For more information on requests for feedback on medical device submissions, please refer to FDA\u2019s final guidance, Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff, available at https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm07795.pdf\n\nVI Resources\n\nThe following are resources that may be of assistance in developing the content of your site change supplement or 30-day notice, preparing for an inspection, or in performing process validation:\n\nQuality System Information for Certain Premarket Application Reviews; Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, available at https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm070899.pdfhttps://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocumen ts/UCM070899\n\nGuidance for Industry and FDA Staff; The Review and Inspection of Premarket Approval Application Manufacturing Information and Operations, available at https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-meddev-gen/documents/document/ucm077795.pdf\n\nGuidance for Industry; Process Validation: General Principles and Practices, available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/.../Guidances/UCM070336.pdf.\n\nMedical Devices; Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) Final Rule; Quality System Regulation, 61 FR 52602, October 7, 1996, available at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/PostmarketRequirements/QualitySystemsRegulations/ucm230127.htm.\n\nGuidance for Industry and FDA Staff: 30-Day Notices, 135-Day Premarket Approval (PMA) Supplements, and 75-Day Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Supplements for Manufacturing Method or Process Changes, available at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM080194.pdf\n\nOEI (Official Establishment Inventory) Development and Maintenance Procedures, available at http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/Inspections/FieldManagementDirectives/ucm096034.htm.\n\nCompliance Program Guidance Manual, Inspection of Medical Device Manufacturers.

For example, non-traditional device manufacturers that previously operated under different quality standards or requirements may face challenges that take more time to address in transitioning to a system that fully complies with 21 CFR Part 820. FDA intends to take such considerations into account when making case-by-case compliance and enforcement decisions. Some manufacturers who intend to continue distributing their devices after the EUA termination date may choose to request an exemption or variance from a device QS requirement as outlined in 21 CFR 820.1(e) and section 520(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. Any such exemption or variance should be requested within 90 days of publication of the advance notice of termination of the EUA declaration pertaining to the device at issue to help ensure FDA considers your request in time.\n\nAppendix F Laboratory developed tests (LDTs)\n\nFor laboratory developed tests (LDTs)83 in general, FDA has generally exercised enforcement discretion, meaning that FDA generally does not exercise its authority to enforce the regulatory requirements for these devices, although it maintains that authority. FDA has not applied this general enforcement discretion approach to, among other LDTs, those used for declared emergencies under section 564 of the FD&C Act. As such, following termination of the EUAdeclaration for COVID-19 IVDs,84 FDA intends to have the same enforcement approach for COVID-19 LDTs as it does for other LDTs.\n\nFootnote 84: HHS declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 (issued February 4, 2020 (85 FR 7316) and amended March 15, 2023 (88 FR 16644)).\n\nVI Examples\n\nThe following hypotheticals are intended to illustrate the transition policy outlined above. To exemplify the timeline of the Transition Implementation Plan outlined in this section (Section VI. of this guidance), for purposes of the examples, FDA set the hypothetical advance notice of termination date for the EUA declaration pertaining to the device at issue as July 1 in Year 1, and the EUA termination date as January 1 in Year 2. This date is not intended to propose an actual advance notice of termination or EUA termination date; it is hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only. Note that these generalized examples do not account for every possible detail, risk, or consideration a manufacturer should evaluate or that may be relevant to FDA decisions regarding a particular device.\n\nExample 1\n\nA single-use surgical mask that is intended for use in healthcare settings by healthcare personnel as personal protective equipment to provide a physical barrier to fluids and particulate materials was authorized for emergency use under an umbrella EUA for surgical masks.85 The manufacturer does not intend to continue distributing the surgical mask after the EUA is no longer in effect.\n\nFootnote 85: Available at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-eaus/surgicalmasks.\n\nOn July 1, the advance notice of termination of the relevant EUA declaration is published. After July 1, the manufacturer continues to distribute the surgical masks and continues to comply with all conditions of authorization.\n\nOn the EUA termination date (January 1), the relevant EUA declaration is terminated and the umbrella EUA is no longer in effect. On January 1, the manufacturer ceases distribution of the surgical mask. Before January 1, the manufacturer had recently sold surgical masks directly to retailers and device distributors. Some of the surgical masks are in transit to these customers, and others are being held in device distributors' warehouses in the U.S.\n\nThe policies included in this guidance relate to the following actions by the device manufacturer and others:\n\nThe surgical masks in transit or in device distributors' warehouses remain distributed (they were already distributed by the EUA termination date), and they are used by the end user prior to their expiration date.\n\nIf on January 1, some of the surgical masks are in the manufacturer's possession, the surgical masks in the manufacturer's possession are not subsequently distributed (they were not already distributed by the EUA termination date).\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe manufacturer does not update the labeling of the already distributed surgical masks (they are single-use, non-life-supporting/non-life-sustaining devices).\n\nUser exhaustion of already distributed surgical masks is described in Section V.C. of this guidance.\n\nEven after the cessation of distribution, the manufacturer continues to submit any adverse event reports of which it becomes aware to FDA consistent with 21 CFR Part 803.\n\nExample 2\n\nA continuous ventilator was authorized under the umbrella EUA for ventilators and ventilator accessories86 to support patients who develop respiratory distress due to COVID-19.\n\nFootnote 86: Available at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/ventilators-and-ventilator-accessories-cua.\n\nOn July 1, the advance notice of termination of the relevant EUA declaration is published. Before August 1, to help FDA plan for transition-related premarket review activities, the manufacturer submits an \"EUA report\" to the CDRH Document Control Center with \"Attention: Notification of Intent\" on the cover letter of the submission to inform FDA that it does not intend to pursue marketing authorization. This EUA report includes the information outlined in Section V.A. of this guidance, which includes the manufacturer's plans to have already distributed ventilators remain distributed.\n\nOn the EUA termination date (January 1), the relevant EUA declaration is terminated and the umbrella EUA is no longer in effect. On January 1, the manufacturer ceases distribution of the ventilator. FDA does not intend to object if the manufacturer implements a plan (that was included in the Notification of Intent) for the already distributed ventilators to remain distributed (e.g., ventilators in device distributors' warehouses), including ventilators in the possession of end users (e.g., ventilators in healthcare facilities). As part of the plan, the manufacturer interacts with affected stakeholders, such as healthcare facilities, to determine the stakeholders' interest in keeping distributed ventilators. The ventilator manufacturer updates the electronic labeling as outlined in Section V.C. of this guidance, and emails a copy of the electronic labeling to affected stakeholders that have expressed an interest in keeping the ventilators.\n\nThe policies included in this guidance relate to the following actions by the device manufacturer and others:\n\nThe already distributed ventilators are not used.\n\nShould healthcare facilities wish to retain the ventilator that lacks FDA clearance, approval, or authorization for use in the future, the future use of the device would be subject to the regulatory requirements of any future authorization, including marketing authorization or EUA.\n\nFor governmental stockpilers that wish to retain a device that lacks requisite FDA clearance, approval, or authorization for use in the future, FDA recommends engaging with the Agency to discuss the public health need for future deployment and/or use of the device in specific circumstances (e.g., regional natural disaster, localized disease outbreaks).\n\nEven after the cessation of distribution, the manufacturer continues to submit any adverse event reports of which it becomes aware to FDA consistent with 21 CFR Part 803.\n\nExample 3\n\nA non-traditional device manufacturer worked with a traditional device manufacturer (original equipment manufacturer (OEM)) to produce, as a contract manufacturer, ventilators that were designed by the traditional device manufacturer. Such devices were authorized under the umbrella EUA for ventilators and ventilator accessories87 and distributed by the OEM during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFootnote 87: Available at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/ventilators-and-ventilator-accessories-eus.\n\nOn July 1, the advance notice of termination of the relevant EUA declaration is published. Before August 1, to help FDA plan for transition-related premarket review activities, the OEM submits an \"EUA report\" to the CDRH Document Control Center with \"Attention: Notification of Intent\" on the cover letter of the submission to inform FDA that it intends to pursue marketing authorization. This EUA report includes the information outlined in Section V.A. of this guidance.\n\nOn October 1, the OEM submits a marketing submission to FDA. In its marketing submission, the OEM includes a \"Transition Implementation Plan\" for already distributed ventilators in the case of a positive decision as well as in the case of a negative decision on the marketing submission. On October 10, the marketing submission is determined to be administratively incomplete because it is missing a test report for a biocompatibility endpoint; the marketing submission is not accepted for review (an \"RTA1 decision\"). The OEM resolves the acceptance review deficiency by including the missing test report for the biocompatibility endpoint and resubmits the marketing submission on November 1. On November 8, the marketing submission is accepted for substantive review.\n--------------------\nContext title: Transition Plan for Medical Devices Issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Guidance for Industry, Other Stakeholders, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -8.242365837097168", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , What is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 10: See sections 301(x) and 501(c)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nWhen submitters are interested in making a DOC to a consensus standard, and the device type is not included within the scope of that standard and is not listed in the SIS, the submitter should explain why that consensus standard is appropriate for the device in question. In most circumstances, the scope of the standard defines what is to be tested, whether that is the device itself, or an attribute of that device, e.g., the device's material composition/properties or packaging. FDA recommends that most testing be conducted on a final finished device. \"Finished device\" under 21 CFR 820.3(l) means any device or accessory to any device that is suitable for use or capable of functioning, whether or not it is packaged, labeled, or sterilized. In contrast, a final finished device is a device that includes all manufacturing processes for the \"to be marketed\" device, including packaging and sterilization, if applicable. If the tested device is not the final finished device the submitter intends to market, the submitter should provide a justification for any differences that may impact performance of the tested device compared to the final finished device to be marketed. The DOC may be based on data or information provided bythe component manufacturer(s), but it is the responsibility of the submitter to ensure the accuracy of the information. In these instances, FDA recommends that submitters consult with the appropriate FDA staff prior to initiating testing. Information for requesting feedback may be found in the guidance titled Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with FD4 Staff.12\n\nFootnote 12: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program\n\nA submitter may base a DOC on testing and analysis performed in-house or on testing performed by a third party, such as a testing laboratory or certification body. If a submitter used a third party, the submitter should provide the name and address of each testing laboratory or certification body that was involved in determining the conformance of the device with the applicable consensus standard(s) that FDA has recognized or decided to recognize and reference any accreditations of those organizations.\n\nAlthough accompanying test data is not required to be submitted with a DOC, FDA may request, at any time, the data or information relied on by the submitter to make a DOC to a consensus standard (see section 514(c)(3)(B) of the FD&C Act). However, these requests should only occur in certain cases, as described below in sections IV.A(2) and (3) of this guidance. The submitter must maintain all records that include data and information demonstrating conformity, whether based upon third-party or in-house testing, to the consensus standard that FDA has recognized or decided to recognize in accordance with the Quality System Regulation (21 CFR part 820). Such records are part of the design history file for the device and are subject to inspection in accordance with 21 CFR 820.180.\n\nFalsifying a DOC to a consensus standard is a prohibited act under section 301(x) of the FD&C Act. If a DOC to a consensus standard has been falsified, or if the device does not conform to the standard as declared, purported, or represented, the device would be deemed adulterated under section 501(e)(2) of the FD&C Act. Also, intentionally or unintentionally falsifying a DOC to obtain device clearance or approval is a prohibited act under section 301(q)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nElements of a Declaration of Conformity\n\nThe elements that should be in a DOC are listed below. A submitter may choose to create a DOC using the format as described in ISO/IEC 17050-1 Conformity Assessment - Supplier's declaration of conformity - Part 1: General requirements. The elements that should be included are:\n\nName and address of the applicant/sponsor responsible for the DOC\n\nProduct/device identification, including product codes, device marketing name, model number and any other unique product identification data specific to the DOC in question\n\nStatement of conformity\n\nA list of standards for which the DOC applies including, for each standard, the options selected, if any\n\nThe FDA recognition number for each standard\n\nThe date and place of issuance of the DOC\n\nSignature, printed name, and function of the sponsor responsible for the DOC\n\nAny limitation on the validity of the DOC (e.g., how long the declaration is valid, what was tested, or concessions made about the testing outcomes)\n\n(2) Supplemental Documentation to Support a Declaration of Conformity\n\nNot all consensus standards that FDA has recognized or decided to recognize are appropriate for DOCs without the submission of supporting documentation that describes how the device conforms to the consensus standard. It is important to restate that the use of consensus standards may satisfy only a portion of a premarket submission and conformance to a standard on its own may not provide a sufficient basis for a regulatory decision. Many consensus standards that FDA has recognized or decided to recognize, while useful in the premarket process, are too general and broad in scope for FDA to determine whether conformance to the applicable consensus standard has been met or whether conformance to the consensus standard alone is sufficient to make a regulatory decision, unless FDA also reviews the underlying data or supporting documentation. Types of consensus standards where review of the underlying data may be necessary may include standards that are horizontal, are process-oriented, or that include choices relating to test methods, test selection, or have guidelines that apply to a broad range of device types and safety issues. An example is ISO 14971 Medical devices - Application of risk management to medical devices. These consensus standards typically do not list all of the detailed acceptance criteria for the necessary performance tests. In cases where the consensus standard is not well-suited for a DOC without the submission of supporting documentation, the FDA recommends that submitters follow ISO/IEC 17050-2 Conformity assessment - Supplier's declaration of conformity - Part 2: Supporting documentation. In brief, if a premarket submission contains a DOC to such a consensus standard, FDA recommends including a summary test report that includes test results. Similarly, for consensus standards that describe test methods, a process, or consists of guidelines, but do not provide specific acceptance criteria for all of the necessary performance tests, the supporting documentation should be submitted, for example, ANSU/AAMI/IEC 60601-1-2 Medical electrical equipment - Part 1-2: General requirements for basic safety and essential performance - Collateral standard: Electromagnetic compatibility - Requirements and tests.\n\nMany standards, called \"parent\" standards, have accompanying consensus standards (e.g., IEC collateral13 and particular14 standards, or standards within a series such as ANSI/AAMI/ISO 80369 Small-bore connectors for liquids and gases in healthcare applications series) that provide acceptance criteria for the testing of specific types of devices (e.g., ANSI/AAMI/ISO 80369-3 Small-bore connectors for liquids and gases in healthcare applications - Part 3: Connectors for enteral applications). These accompanying consensus standards, if recognized by FDA, may be appropriately suited for DOCs without submission of underlying data.\n\n(3) FDA Review of Declarations of Conformity and Supplemental Documentation\n\nDuring review of a premarket submission in which a DOC has been submitted, FDA will review the DOC and determine whether the following have been met:\n\nThe elements in this guidance, ISO/IEC 17050-1, or equivalent, of a Declaration of Conformity are present.\n\nThe standard(s) identified in the DOC has (have) a recognition number.15 Footnote 15: See section 514(c)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThere have been no deviations made to the normative part of the consensus standard(s) identified.\n\nThe consensus standard(s) identified in the DOC is (are) applicable to the medical device under review.16 Footnote 16: See section 514(c)(3)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe supportive documentation, if determined to be necessary per ISO/IEC 17050-1, is provided according to ISO/IEC 17050-2 or equivalent (see Table 1 below).\n\nThe data or information submitted to support such declaration demonstrates that the device is in conformity with the normative section of the standard.17 Footnote 17: See section 514(c)(3)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThe DOC does not include a promissory statement (See Section VI).18\n\nFootnote 18: See section 514(c)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIf any of the elements above are not met, FDA will review any explanation provided by the sponsor to determine if it is adequate to support the DOC or will request additional information to meet the requirements.\n\nAs outlined above, there are circumstances when supplemental documentation is necessary to support a DOC. The type of information a sponsor should submit and the FDA needs to review as supplemental documentation will vary based on the specific consensus standard; however, the following general principles should govern the need for and review of supplemental documentation:\n\nWhen the consensus standard includes both a test method or test procedure with a single set of predefined acceptance criteria, FDA should generally not request the data relating to the specific consensus standard identified in the DOC.\n\nWhen the consensus standard describes a test method or procedure, but does not include acceptance criteria, the submitter should provide an assessment of the results and how conformity was determined.\n--------------------\nContext title: Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -8.264158248901367"], "In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n\nYes. Regardless of whether equipment is dedicated or not, it is expected that acceptance criteria for residues be defined and that the equipment be cleaned at appropriate intervals to prevent build-up and carry-over of contaminants. Intervals can be based on number of batches, product change-over, time, etc. (ICH Q7, paragraphs 5.22, 5.23, 5.24, 5.25, 8.50).\n\nCleaning intervals and acceptance criteria should be established based on an understanding of the process/reactions/degradation, taking into account solubility, potency, toxicity, etc. Establishment of acceptance criteria does not necessarily imply sampling and testing after every cleaning. Visual inspection of equipment for cleanliness is an expectation of ICH Q7, paragraph 5.21. Where validation data has confirmed effective cleaning, cleaning procedures should be monitored at appropriate intervals (ICH Q7, paragraph 12.76).\n\nIs it expected that equipment cleaning time limits be confirmed in cleaning validation?\n\nYes. Equipment cleaning is addressed in two sections in ICH Q7. Although the cleaning validation (ICH Q7, section XII.G (12.7)) does not specifically address time limits for cleaning, ICH Q7, paragraph 5.21, indicates that the maximum time between completion of processing and equipment cleaning (dirty hold time) should be established by the company. This maximum established dirty hold time is the time period for which evidence is available to demonstrate that the equipment can still be reliably cleaned. This maximum established dirty hold time is confirmed during the initial cleaning validation and can be extended with appropriate supporting data.\n\nAlthough ICH Q7 does not specify the need for time limits between equipment cleaning and use in the next process (clean hold time), ICH Q7, paragraph 5.21 does state that written procedures should include instructions for the protection of clean equipment from contamination prior to use and inspection of equipment for cleanliness immediately before use, if practicable.\n\nIs it expected that campaign manufacturing be addressed in cleaning validation?\n\nYes. The cleaning validation section (ICH Q7, section XII.G (12.7)) does not specifically address campaign manufacture. However, ICH Q7, paragraphs 5.23 and 8.50 set forth the expectations that equipment be cleaned at appropriate intervals (e.g., time or number of batches) to prevent build-up and carryover of contaminants so that they do not adversely alter the quality of the API. The appropriate interval is confirmed during cleaning validation.\n\nAt product changeover, are both visual examination and analytical testing necessary to verify that equipment is clean?\n\nAppropriate cleaning validation verifies that the cleaning process is effective. During cleaning validation, both visual examination and analytical testing should be used to verify cleaning effectiveness (ICH Q7, paragraphs 12.72 to 75). Once the cleaning process is validated, routine monitoring of cleanliness of equipment at product changeover should include visual inspection (ICH Q7, paragraph 12.76). Frequency of analytical testing to verify ongoing effectiveness of the validated cleaning process is determined by the API manufacturer using a risk-based approach. In situations where the cleaning process is not yet validated, both visual examination and analytical testing are expected.\n\nDocumentation and Records (6)\n\nWhat is meant by \"completely distributed\" in ICH Q7, paragraph 6.13, which states that \"records should be retained for at least 3 years after the batch is completely distributed\"?\n\nFor APIs with a retest date, ICH Q7, paragraph 6.13 states that records related to production, control, and distribution should be retained for at least 3 years after the API batch is \"completely distributed,\" which is understood as the complete distribution of the entire batch of the API by the API manufacturer to the next party in the supply chain. In the case of APIs handled by agents, brokers, traders, distributors, repackers, and relabelers (ICH Q7, section XVII (17)), \"completely distributed\" refers to distribution of the received quantity of the batch of API.\n\nThe intent of ICH Q7 is that records be retained for the period of time that the API could be on the market in order to investigate any problems and/or product complaints. Based on accepted industry practice at the time ICH Q7 was written, it was not anticipated that a manufacturer would set a retest date longer than 3 years. However, the use of \"at least 3 years\" in this section of ICH Q7 covers longer record retention periods, which is in alignment with the basic GMP principle and/or regional requirements that records be retained for the entire period the material is available on the market.\n\nIt is good industry practice to consider retaining records for the period of time the drug product(s) in which the API was used may be available on the market.\n\nDoes a batch numbering system need to be sequential?\n\nNo, ICH Q7, paragraph 6.51 says only that batch production records should have a unique batch or ID number.\n\nWho is responsible for the issuance of batch production records?\n\nICH Q7, section II.C (2.3) does not specify who is responsible for the issuance of batch production records (ICH Q7, section VI.D (6.5)) as long as the issuance process is described in writing and approved by the quality unit (ICH Q7, paragraph 2.21).\n\nMaterials Management (7)\n\nDoes the phrase \"grouping of containers\" have the same meaning in ICH Q7, paragraphs 7.20 and 7.24?\n\nThe phrase \"grouping of containers\" should be read in the context of each sentence. A grouping of containers refers to multiple containers physically secured by the supplier (e.g., shrink-wrapped pallet) usually intended for ease of shipment and reconciliation. ICH Q7, paragraph 7.20 is referring to incoming visual examination of materials before acceptance into the facility under quarantine.\n\nThe phrase in ICH Q7, paragraph 7.24, \"grouping of containers (batches)\" contains an additional word \"batches\" because this section is addressing establishment of batch traceability for the incoming material.\n\nWhat is expected in terms of evaluation of suppliers of materials?\n\nDifferent phrases are used to describe the expectation for evaluation of suppliers of materials (ICH Q7, paragraphs 7.11, 7.12, 7.31), including traders, if any.\n\nICH Q7, paragraph 7.12 states that all materials are purchased against a specification and from suppliers approved by the quality unit (ICH Q7, paragraph 7.31). Prior to approval of any supplier, an evaluation should be conducted using a risk-based approach (ICH Q9, Appendix II.5; ICH Q7, paragraph 7.31). More extensive evaluation is important for suppliers of those materials classified as \"critical\" (ICH Q7, paragraph 7.11).\n\nWhat is meant by \"full analysis\" (ICH Q7, paragraph 7.31) on batches of raw materials to qualify a supplier?\n\nA \"full analysis\" should include all tests specified by the user of the raw material in the regulatory filing. In cases where no filing is required, the full analysis should include tests in other formal written specifications issued by the user of the raw material (ICH Q7, paragraph 7.31). A raw material supplier's Certificate of Analysis (CoA) may not necessarily align with the user's specifications.\n\nAre on-site audits required in the evaluation of suppliers?\n\nNo. An on-site audit is not required; however, an on-site audit could be a useful tool inthe evaluation of a supplier. A risk assessment of the material or the service provided can be used to develop an audit strategy and manage the ongoing evaluation of suppliers (ICH Q7, paragraphs 7.11, 7.31).\n\nWhich tests are considered to be identity tests?\n\nFor incoming production materials, identity tests and related methods should be used as described in the relevant sections of a pharmacopoeia monograph, in an approved regulatory filing, or in an in-house specification (including method/analytical procedure) (ICH Q7, paragraph 7.30). When available, a discriminating test should be considered for identification testing. The visual examination of a label or the material is not considered sufficient except in the cases described in ICH Q7, paragraph 7.32.\n\nIs it possible to extend the expiry date or retest date of a raw material and what is the acceptable practice to determine how long it may be extended for?\n\nManufacturing and labeling of raw materials for use by API manufacturers is outside the scope of ICH Q7. For this reason, retest and expiry dates, as defined in ICH Q7, do not strictly apply to raw materials and may be used in a different manner by the raw material supplier. Expiry date, as defined in the Glossary (section 20) of ICH Q7, applies specifically to the API.\n\nAPI manufacturers may re-evaluate (ICH Q7, section VII.E (7.5)) and then use a raw material after the expiry date or retest date, based on an appropriate scientific and risk-based justification (e.g., understanding of material attributes, testing, and stability). Similar justifications may be used to extend the date by which the material should be re-evaluated. It is the responsibility of the API manufacturer to ensure the raw materials are appropriate for the intended use at the time of use.\n\nProduction and In-Process Controls (8)\n\nCan yield ranges defined for the first batch differ from latter batches within a campaign?\n\nYes. Differing yield ranges (ICH Q7, paragraph 8.14) may be described and justified in the manufacturing procedure/master batch record explaining the ranges (ICH Q7, paragraph 6.41). For example, the first batch in the series of production of batches of the same material (campaign) may leave residual material in the equipment, resulting in a low yield in the first batch and contributing to an increased yield in a subsequent batch of the campaign.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 7.144365310668945", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: Individual and/or collective acceptance criteria for impurities (product-related and process-related) should be set, as appropriate. Under certain circumstances, acceptance criteria for selected impurities may not be necessary (section 2.3).\n\nExamples of analytical procedures which may be employed to test for the presence of impurities are listed in Appendix 6.2. New analytical technology and modifications to existing technology are continually being developed and should be utilized when appropriate.\n\nFor the purpose of lot release (section 4), an appropriate subset of these methods should be selected and justified.\n\n(\\bullet) Contaminants\n\nContaminants in a product include all adventitiously introduced materials not intended to be part of the manufacturing process, such as chemical and biochemical materials (e.g., microbial proteases), and/or microbial species. Contaminants should be strictly avoided and/or suitably controlled with appropriate in-process acceptance criteria or action limits for drug substance or drug product specifications (section 2.3). For the special case of adventitious viral or mycoplasma contamination, the concept of action limits is not applicable, and the strategies proposed in ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guidelines \"Quality of Biotechnological/Biological Products: Viral Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology Derived Products Derived from Cell Lines of Human or Animal Origin\" and \"Quality of Biotechnological/Biological Products: Derivation and Characterization of Cell Substrates Used for Production of Biotechnological/Biological Products\" should be considered.\n\n2.1.5 Quantity\n\nQuantity, usually measured as protein content, is critical for a biotechnological and biological product and should be determined using an appropriate assay, usually physicochemical in nature. In some cases, it may be demonstrated that the quantity values obtained may be directly related to those found using the biological assay. When this correlation exists, it may be appropriate to use measurement of quantity rather than the measurement of biological activity in manufacturing processes, such as filling.\n\nAnalytical Considerations\n\n2.2.1 Reference standards and reference materials\n--------------------\nContext title: Q6B Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.9177591800689697", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: For powders for reconstitution, uniformity of mass testing is generally considered acceptable.\n\nb) pH: Acceptance criteria for pH should be provided where applicable and the proposed range justified.\n\nc) Microbial limits: Microbial limit testing is seen as an attribute of Good Manufacturing Practice (21 CFR 211.165(b)), as well as of quality assurance. In general, it is advisable to test the medicinal product unless its components are tested before manufacture and the manufacturing process is known, through validation studies, not to carry a significant risk of microbial contamination or proliferation. It should be noted that, whereas this Guidance does not directly address excipients, the principles discussed here may be applicable to excipients as well as to new medicinal products. Skip testing may be an appropriate approach in both cases where permissible. With acceptable scientific justification, it may be possible to propose no microbial limit testing for powders intended for reconstitution as oral liquids.\n\nAcceptance criteria should be set for the total count of aerobic microorganisms, total count of yeasts and molds, and the absence of specific objectionable bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli and Salmonella.; testing of additional organisms may be appropriate according to the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP)). These should be determined by suitable procedures, using pharmacopoeial procedures, and at a sampling frequency or time point in manufacture which is justified by data and experience.\n\nDecision tree #8 provides additional guidance on the use of microbial limits testing.\n\nd) Antimicrobial preservative content: For oral liquids needing an antimicrobial preservative, acceptance criteria for preservative content should be established. Acceptance criteria for preservative content should be based upon the levels of antimicrobial preservative necessary to maintain microbiological quality of the product at all stages throughout its proposed usage and shelf-life. The lowest specified concentration of antimicrobial preservative should be demonstrated to be effective in controlling microorganisms by using a pharmacopoeial antimicrobial preservative effectiveness test.\n\nTesting for antimicrobial preservative content should normally be performed at release. Under certain circumstances, in-process testing may suffice in lieu of release testing. When antimicrobial preservative content testing is performed as an in-process test, the acceptance criteria should remain part of the specification.\n\nAntimicrobial preservative effectiveness should be demonstrated during development and throughout the shelf-life and the in-use period (e.g., in stability testing: see the VICH GL3 Guidance, \"Stability Testing of New Veterinary Drug Substances and Products\"), althoughchemical testing for preservative content is the attribute normally included in the specification.\n\ne) Antioxidant pressure content: Release testing for antioxidant content should normally be performed. Under certain circumstances, where justified by developmental and stability data, shelf-life testing may not be important, and in-process testing may suffice in lieu of release testing where permitted. When antioxidant content testing is performed as an in-process test, the acceptance criteria should remain part of the specification. If only release testing is performed, this decision should be reinvestigated whenever either the manufacturing procedure or the container/closure system changes.\n\nf) Extractables: Generally, where development and stability data show evidence that extractables from the container/closure systems are consistently below levels that are demonstrated to be acceptable and safe, elimination of this test can normally be accepted. This should be reinvestigated if the container/closure system or formulation changes.\n\nWhere data demonstrate the need, tests and acceptance criteria for extractables from the container/closure system components (e.g., rubber stopper, cap liner, plastic bottle, etc.) are considered appropriate for oral solutions packaged in non-glass systems, or in glass containers with non-glass closures. The container/closure components should be listed, and data collected for these components as early in the development process as possible.\n\ng) Dissolution: In addition to the attributes recommended immediately above, it may be appropriate (e.g., insoluble drug substance) to include dissolution testing and acceptance criteria for oral suspensions and dry powder products for resuspension. Dissolution testing should be performed at release. This test may be performed as an in-process test when justified by product development data. The testing apparatus, media, and conditions should be pharmacopoeial, if possible, or otherwise justified. Dissolution procedures using either pharmacopoeial or non-pharmacopoeial apparatus and conditions should be validated.\n\nSingle-point measurements are normally considered suitable for immediate-release dosage forms. Multiple-point sampling, at appropriate intervals, should be performed for modified-release dosage forms. Acceptance criteria should be set based on the observed range of variation, and should take into account the dissolution profiles of the batches that showed acceptable performance in vivo. Developmental data should be considered when determining the need for either a dissolution procedure or a particle size distribution procedure.\n\nh) Particle size distribution: Quantitative acceptance criteria and a procedure for determination of particle size distribution may be appropriate for oral suspensions. Developmental data should be considered when determining the importance of either a dissolution procedure or a particle size distribution procedure for these formulations.\n\nParticle size distribution testing should be performed at release. It may be performed as an in-process test when justified by product development data. If these products have been demonstrated during development to have consistently rapid drug release characteristics, exclusion of a particle size distribution test from the specification may be proposed.\n\nParticle size distribution testing may also be proposed in place of dissolution testing; justification should be provided. The acceptance criteria should include acceptable particle size distribution in terms of the percent of total particles in given size ranges. The mean, upper, and/or lower particle size limits should be well defined.\n\n3.3.2.3 Parameter Medicinal Products\n\nThe following tests may be applicable to parenteral medicinal products.\n\na) Uniformity of dosage units: This term includes both the mass of the dosage form and the content of the active substance in the dosage form; a pharmacopoeial procedure should be used. In general, the specification should include one or the other but not both and is applicable to powders for reconstitution. When weight variation is applied for new medicinal products exceeding the threshold value to allow testing uniformity by weight variation, applicants should verify during drug development that the homogeneity of the product is adequate.\n\nIf appropriate (see section 2.3), these tests may be performed in-process; the acceptance criteria should be included in the specification. This test may be applied to both single-dose and multiple-dose packages.\n\nFor powders for reconstitution, uniformity of mass testing is generally considered acceptable.\n\nb) pH: Acceptance criteria for pH should be provided where applicable and the proposed range justified.\n\nc) Sterility: All parenteral products should have a test procedure and acceptance criterion for evaluation of sterility. Where data generated during development and validationjustifies parametric release, this approach may be proposed for terminally sterilized medicinal products (see section 2.6).\n\nd) Endotoxins/Pyrogens: A test procedure and acceptance criterion for endotoxins, using a procedure such as the imulus amoebocyte lysate test, should be included in the specification in accordance with regional requirements. Pyrogenicity testing may be proposed as an alternative to endotoxin testing where justified.\n\ne) Particulate matter: Parenteral products should have appropriate acceptance criteria for particulate matter. This will normally include acceptance criteria for visible particulates and/or clarity of solution, as well as for sub-visible particulates as appropriate.\n\nf) Water content: For non-aqueous parenterals, and for parenteral products for reconstitution, a test procedure and acceptance criterion for water content should be proposed when appropriate. Loss on Drying is generally considered sufficient for parenteral products, if the effect of absorbed moisture vs. water of hydration has been adequately characterized during development. In certain cases a more specific procedure (e.g., Karl Fischer titration) may be preferred.\n\ng) Antimicrobial pressure content: For parenteral products needing an antimicrobial pressure, acceptance criteria for preservative content should be established. Acceptance criteria for preservative content should be based upon the levels of antimicrobial pressure necessary to maintain microbiological quality of the product at all stages throughout its proposed usage and shelf life. The lowest specified concentration of antimicrobial preservative should be demonstrated to be effective in controlling microorganisms by using a pharmacopoeial antimicrobial preservative effectiveness test.\n\nTesting for antimicrobial preservative content should normally be performed at release. Under certain circumstances, in-process testing may suffice in lieu of release testing where permitted. When antimicrobial preservative content testing is performed as an in-process test, the acceptance criteria should remain part of the specification.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #176 (VICH GL39) Specifications- Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Veterinary Drug Substances and New Medicinal Products- Chemical Substances \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.065654754638672", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.2 Acceptance Criteria............................................................. 1\n\n3.

The proposed texts were submitted by the Pharmacopoeial Discussion Group (PDG).\n\n2 Q4B Outcome\n\nAnalytical Procedures\n\nThe ICH Steering Committee, based on the evaluation by the Q4B Expert Working Group (EWG), recommends that the official pharmacopoeial texts, Ph.Eur. 20414 Sulphated Ash, JP 2.44 Residue on Ignition Test, and USP <281> Residue on Ignition can be used as interchangeable in the ICH regions given the following:\n\nUnless otherwise specified in a monograph, an appropriate sample weight is chosen, typically 1-2 g, to result in a level of residue sufficient to be accurately measurable by weight (typically 1 mg). If not specified in the monograph, the appropriate sample weight should be justified, and the sample weight and the acceptance criteria should be specified in the application dossier.\n\nThe muffle furnace should be appropriately calibrated to ensure compliance with regional GMP requirements.\n\nAcceptance Criteria\n\nThe proposed texts evaluated did not contain acceptance criteria.\n\n3 Timing of Annex Implementation\n\nWhen this annex is implemented (incorporated into the regulatory process at ICH Step 5) in a region, it can be used in that region. Timing may differ for each region.\n\n4 Considerations for Implementation\n\nGeneral consideration: When sponsors or manufacturers change their existing methods to the implemented Q4B-evaluated pharmacopoeial texts that are referenced in Section 2.1 of this annex, any change notification, variation, and/or prior approval procedures should be handled in accordance with established regional regulatory mechanisms pertaining to compential changes.\n\nFDA consideration: Based on the recommendation above, and in accordance with the conditions set forth in this annex, the pharmacopoeial texts referenced in Section 2.1 of this annex can be considered interchangeable. However, FDA might request that a company demonstrate that the chosen method is acceptable and suitable for a specific material or product, irrespective of the origin of the method.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q4B Annex 1(R1) Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.3943257331848145", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: The quality of the raw materials used in the production of the drug substance (or drug product) should meet standards, appropriate for their intended use. Biological raw materials or reagents may require careful evaluation to establish the presence or absence of deleterious endogenous or adventitious agents. Procedures which make use of affinity chromatography (for example, employing monoclonal antibodies), should be accompanied by appropriate measures to ensure that such process-related impurities or potential contaminants arising from their production and use do not compromise the quality and safety of the drug substance or drug product. Appropriate information pertaining to the antibody should be made available.\n\nThe quality of the excipients used in the drug product formulation (and in some cases, in the drug substance), as well as the container/closure systems, should meet pharmacopoeial standards, where available and appropriate. Otherwise, suitable acceptance criteria should be established for the non-pharmacopoeial excipients.\n\nPharmacopoeial Specifications\n\nPharmacopoeias contain important requirements pertaining to certain analytical procedures and acceptance criteria which, where relevant, are part of the evaluation of either the drug substance or drug product. Such monographs, applicable to biotechnological and biological products, generally include, but are not limited to tests for sterility, endotoxins, microbial limits, volume in container, uniformity of dosage units and particulate matter. With respect to the use of pharmacopoeial methods and acceptance criteria, the value of this guidance is linked to the extent of harmonisation of the analytical procedures of the pharmacopoeias. The pharmacopoeias are committed to developing identical or methodologically equivalent test procedures and acceptance criteria.\n\nRelease Limits vs. Shelf-life Limits\n\nThe concept of release limits vs. shelf-life limits may be applied where justified. This concept pertains to the establishment of limits which are tighter for the release than for the shelf-life of the drug substance or drug product. Examples where this may be applicable include potency and degradation products. In some regions, the concept of release limits may only be applicable to in-house limits and not to the regulatory shelf-life limits.\n\nStatistical Concepts\n\nAppropriate statistical analysis should be applied, when necessary, to quantitative data reported. The methods of analysis, including justification and rationale, should be described fully. These descriptions should be sufficiently clear to permit independent calculation of the results presented.\n\n3 Justification of the Specification\n--------------------\nContext title: Q6B Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.433430194854736", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Should acceptance criteria for residues be defined for dedicated equipment?\n--------------------\nContext: Acceptance criteria and analytical procedures should be developed and justified, based upon previous experience with the drug product, to measure changes in the drug substance during the manufacture and/or storage of the drug product.\n\nThe choice and optimization of analytical procedures should focus on the separation of the desired product and product-related substances from impurities including degradation products, and from excipients.\n\n4.2.4 Potency\n\nA relevant, validated potency assay (section 2.1.2) should be part of the specifications for a biotechnological and biological drug substance and/or drug product. When anappropriate potency assay is used for the drug substance, an alternative method (physicochemical and/or biological) may suffice for quantitative assessment of the drug product. However, the rationale for such a choice should be provided.\n\n4.2.5 Quantity\n\nThe quantity of the drug substance in the drug product, usually based on protein content (mass), should be determined using an appropriate assay. In cases where product manufacture is based upon potency, there may be no need for an alternate determination of quantity.\n\n4.2.6 General tests\n\nPhysical description and the measurement of other quality attributes is often important for the evaluation of the drug product functions. Examples of such tests include pH and osmolarity.\n\n4.2.7 Additional testing for unique dosage forms\n\nIt should be recognized that certain unique dosage forms may need additional tests other than those mentioned above.\n\n5 Glossary\n\nAcceptance Criteria\n\nNumerical limits, ranges, or other suitable measures for acceptance of the results of analytical procedures which the drug substance or drug product or materials at other stages of their manufacture should meet.\n\nAction Limit\n\nAn internal (in-house) value used to assess the consistency of the process at less critical steps.\n\nBiological Activity\n\nThe specific ability or capacity of the product to achieve a defined biological effect. Potency is the quantitative measure of the biological activity.\n\nContaminants\n\nAny adventitiously introduced materials (e.g., chemical, biochemical, or microbial species) not intended to be part of the manufacturing process of the drug substance or drug product.\n\nDegradation Products\n\nMolecular variants resulting from changes in the desired product or product-related substances brought about over time and/or by the action of, e.g., light, temperature, pH, water, or by reaction with an excipient and/or the immediate container/closure system. Such changes may occur as a result of manufacture and/or storage (e.g., deamidation, oxidation, aggregation, proteolysis). Degradation products may be either product-related substances, or product-related impurities.\n\nDesired Product\n--------------------\nContext title: Q6B Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.680481433868408"], "As per the details in Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , How do I provide the \"Supplement Facts\" panel if my dietary supplements are sold from bulk containers?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , How do I provide the \"Supplement Facts\" panel if my dietary supplements are sold from bulk containers?\n--------------------\nContext: The \"Supplement Facts\" nutrition information (referred to as a panel) must be enclosed in a box by using hairlines. The title, \"Supplement Facts,\" must be larger than all other print in the panel and, unless impractical, must be set full width of the panel. The title and all headings must be bolded to distinguish them from other information.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n36. How must I present the information in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nYou must present all information using the following:\n\na. A single easy-to-read type style;\n\nb. All black or one color type, printed on a white or neutral contrasting background, whenever practical;3. Upper- and lowercase letters, except that you may use all uppercase lettering on small packages (i.e., packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches); d. At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text); and e. Letters that do not touch.\n37. What are the type size requirements for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nExcept as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must set information other than the title, headings, and footnotes in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. You also must use a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label for the title \"Supplement Facts.\" You may set the column headings and footnotes in type no smaller than 6 point type. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nMust I use hairlines in the Supplement Facts panel?\n\nExcept for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must use a hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text to separate each dietary ingredient from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it. FDA has provided an exception for certain packages with space constraints. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nHow closely must I follow the \"Examples of graphic enhancements used by the FDA\" in appendix B to Part 101?\n\nYou are not required to follow Appendix B to Part 101. Appendix B and its specifications are a model, which FDA has suggested in the interest of uniformity of presentation. For example, 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(i) requires the use of an \"easy-to-read\" type style, not specifically Helvetica type, as suggested in Appendix B.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)(9)\n\nHow do I provide nutrition labeling when my product contains two or more packets of supplements (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening)?\n\nYou may present the information for each packet (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening) in an individual nutrition label or you may use an aggregate nutrition label. For two packets, this would consist of five columns. List all of the dietary ingredients in the first column. List the amounts and percents of the morning packet in the second and third columns and similar information for the evening packet in the fourth and fifth columns (see the illustration of aggregate nutrition labeling in 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iii)).\n\nCompliance\n\nWhat kind of samples will FDA collect to determine compliance with 21 CFR 101.36?\n\nFDA will collect a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller. FDA will randomly select these packages.\n\nWhat if it is not technically feasible for me to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements?\n\nFDA may permit you to use an alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9). If your firm needs such special allowances, you must make your request in writing to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(f)(2)\n\nMust dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?\n\nFor dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value.\n\nExemptions\n\nWhat are the circumstances in which my dietary supplement products would be exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements? Your dietary supplement product is not required to have a \"Supplement Facts\" panel if: a. Your firm is a small business that has not more than $50,000 gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers or not more than $500,000 per year from total sales in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1); b. You sell less than 100,000 units of the product annually, your firm has fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(2) andyou file an annual notification with FDA as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(18)(iv); or c. You ship the product in bulk form, do not distribute it to consumers in such form, and you supply it for use in the manufacture of other dietary supplements in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(3). The two exemptions for small businesses and low-volume products (a. and b. above) are available to you only if your products' labels bear no claims or other nutrition information.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(h)(1) - (3)\n\nSpecial Labeling Provisions\n\nWhat are small packages?\n\nSmall packages are those packages having less than 12 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)\n\nWhat is the telephone provision for small packages?\n\nIn lieu of a \"Supplement Facts\" panel, you may print labels for small packages with a telephone number or address that consumers can use to obtain nutrition information. You may use a telephone number or an address in place of the \"Supplement Facts\" panel only if you place no claims or other nutrition information on the product label.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size that I may use for small packages?\n\nYou may use a type size no smaller than 4-5 point for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of small packages.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(i)\n\nMay I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small package?\n\nYes. You may use a tabular format on small packages. You also may present \"Supplement Facts\" information in a linear (i.e., string) fashion if the label will not accommodate the \"Supplement Facts\" panel in a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j) (13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display.)\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n\nWhat are intermediate-sized packages?\n\nIntermediate-sized packages are those packages having from 12 to 40 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(ii)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size for intermediate-sized packages?The \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of intermediate-sized packages must use type size no smaller than 6 point, except that type no smaller than 4-5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches that list more than 16 dietary ingredients. Also, 4-5 point type may be used on packages with less than 20 square inches that list more than 8 dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the type size used in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an inner container may be as small as needed to accommodate all required information if the \"Supplement Facts\" on the outer container meets these type size requirements.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv)\n51. May I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an intermediate-sized package? You may use a tabular format on an intermediate-sized package if the package shape or size cannot accommodate vertical columns. You may use a linear format if the label will not accommodate a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n52. May I abbreviate on the labels of intermediate- sized packages? You may use the abbreviations in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel for small and intermediate-sized packages, e.g, \"Serv size\" for \"Serving Size\" and \"Servings\" for \"Servings Per Container.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B)\n53. Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV.

A mineral;\n\nAn herb or other botanical;\n\nAn amino acid;\n\nA dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or\n\nA concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or a combination of any ingredient mentioned above. Further, dietary supplements are products intended for ingestion, are not represented for use as a conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or the diet, and are labeled as dietary supplements. The complete statutory definition is found in section 201(ff) of Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321).\n\nWhat label statements are required on the containers and packages of dietary supplements? Five statements are required: 1) the statement of identity (name of the dietary supplement), 2) the net quantity of contents statement (amount of the dietary supplement), 3) the nutrition labeling, 4) the ingredient list, and 5) the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor.\n\n21 CFR 101.3(a), 21 CFR 101.105(a), 21 CFR 101.36, 21 CFR 101.4(a)(1), and 21 CFR 101.5\n\nWhere do I place the required label statements? You must place all required label statements either on the front label panel (the principal display panel) or on the information panel (usually the label panel immediately to the right of the principal display panel, as seen by the consumer when facing the product), unless otherwise specified by regulation (i.e., exemptions).\n\n21 CFR 101.2(b) and (d), 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13) and (j)(17), 21 CFR 101.36(g), (i)(2) and (i) (5)\n\nWhat label statements must I place on the principal display panel? You must place the statement of identity and the net quantity of contents statement on the principal display panel. Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, you must place this information on each alternate principal display panel.\n\n21 CFR 101.1, 21 CFR 101.3(a) and 21 CFR 101.105(a)\n\nHow do I locate the principal display panel? The principal display panel of the label is the portion of the package that is most likely to be seen by the consumer at the time of display for retail purchase. Many containers are designed with two or more different surfaces that are suitable for use as the principal display panel. These are alternate principal display panels.\n\n6 What label statements must I place on the information panel?\n\nYou must place the \"Supplement Facts\" panel, the ingredient list, and the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor on the information panel if such information does not appear on the principal display panel, except that if space is insufficient, you may use the special provisions on the \"Supplement Facts\" panel in 21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(iii) and (i)(5). See questions 46 and 56 in Chapter IV for more details.\n\n7 Where is the information panel?\n\nThe information panel is located immediately to the right of the principal display panel as the product is displayed to the consumer. If this panel is not usable, due to package design and construction (e.g. folded flaps), the panel immediately contiguous and to the right of this part may be used for the information panel. The information panel may be any adjacent panel when the top of a container is the principal display panel.\n\n8 What name and address must I list on the label of my product?\n\nYou must list the street address if it is not listed in a current city directory or telephone book, the city or town, the state, and zip code. You may list the address of the principal place of business in lieu of the actual address.\n\n9 May I place intervening material on the information panel?\n\nNo. You may not place intervening material, which is defined as label information that is not required (e.g., UPC bar code), between label information that is required on the information panel.\n\nWhat type size, prominence and conspicuousness am I required to use on the principal display panel and the information panel?\n\nYou are required to use a print or type size that is prominent, conspicuous and easy to read. The letters must be at least one-sixteenth (1/16) inch in height based on the lower case letter \"o,\" and not be more than three times as high as they are wide, unless you petition for an exemption in accordance with 21 CFR 101.2(f). The lettering must contrast sufficiently (it does not need to be black and white) with the background so as to be easy to read. See Chapter IV for the type size requirements for the nutrition label.\n\nDo I need to specify the country of origin if my product, or the ingredients in my product, is not from the United States?\n\nYes. Unless excepted by law, the Tariff Act requires that every article of foreign origin (or its container) imported into the United States conspicuously indicate the English name of the country of origin of the article.\n\nSection 304, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 304)\n* 12.Who regulates the statement \"Made in the U. S. A.\"? FDA does not have regulatory authority over such statements. The U.S. Customs Service regulates country of origin marking (i.e., \"Made in the U.S.A.\") as authorized by the Tariff Act of 1930. Their website is www.customs.ustreas.gov.\n* 13.How do I obtain a UPC bar code? The UPC bar code may be obtained from the Uniform Code Council. Their website is www.uc-council.org. Click on the button that says \"I Need a UPC Bar Code.\"\n* 14.Must expiration dating be included on the label of dietary supplements? No. However, a firm may include this information if it is supported by valid data demonstrating that it is not false or misleading.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter I.

Can the term \"dietary supplement\" by itself be considered the statement of identity?\n\nYes. This term describes the basic nature of a dietary supplement and therefore is an \"appropriately descriptive term\" that can be used as the product's statement of identity. The statement of identity for a dietary supplement may therefore consist simply of the term \"dietary supplement,\" or \"dietary supplement\" may be part of a longer statement of identity (e.g., \"cod liver oil liquid dietary supplement\"). In either case, the word \"dietary\" may be deleted and replaced by another appropriately descriptive term identifying the contents of the product, such as \"calcium supplement,\" \"herbal supplement\", or \"herbal supplement with vitamins.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.3(g)\n\n4. Should I make the statement of identity stand out?\n\nYes. You must make the statement of identity one of the most important features on the principal display panel. To do this, you must use bold type and a type size reasonably related to the most prominent printed matter on the front panel of your label.\n\n21 CFR 101.3(d)\n\n5. How should I place the statement of identity on the principal display panel?\n\nYou must place the statement of identity of your dietary supplement product in lines generally parallel to the base of the package.\n\n21 CFR 101.3(d)\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter II.

If the principal display panel of your product is 5square inches or less, the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent does not apply when the declaration of net quantity of contents meets the other requirements of 21 CFR 101.105(f)\n3. How must I express the net quantity of contents statement on my label? You must express the net quantity of contents statement in either weight, measure, numerical count or a combination of numerical count and weight or measure. When you express this quantity as a weight or measure, you must specify both metric (grams, kilograms, milliliters, or liters) and U.S. Customary System (ounces, pounds, or fluid ounces) terms. Public Law 102-329, August 3, 1992 and 21 CFR 101.105\n4. Why must I calculate the area of the principal display panel? You must calculate the area of the principal display panel (calculated in square inches or square centimeters) to determine the minimum type size that is permitted for the net quantity of contents statement.\n5. How do I calculate the area of the principal display panel? You may calculate the area of the principal display panel for rectangular or square shaped packages by multiplying the height by the width (both in inches or both in centimeters), and for cylindrical shaped packages by multiplying 40% of the circumference by the height. For example, a rectangular package that is 8 inches high and 6 inches wide would have a principal display panel of 48 square inches. A cylindrical package having a circumference of 10 inches and a height of 2 inches would have a principal display panel of 8 square inches.\n6. Am I required to place the net quantity of contents statement conspicuously and prominently on my product labels? Yes. You are required to use a print style that is prominent, conspicuous, and easy to read, with letters not more than three times as high as wide. Use letters that contrast sufficiently with the background.\n7. What is the minimum type size that I can use for the net quantity of contents statements? The smallest type size permitted for the net quantity of contents statement is based on the size of the principal display panel.

The DS CGMP rule requires you to:\n\nIdentify and hold in-process material under conditions that protect against mix-up, contamination, and deterioration (21 CFR 111.460(a)); and\n\nHold in-process material under appropriate conditions of temperature, humidity, and light (21 CFR 111.460(b)).\n\nWhat container-closure system does the DS CGMP rule require me to use to hold reserve samples of packaged and labeled dietary supplements? The DS CGMP rule requires you to use the following container-closure systems to hold reserve samples of dietary supplements:\n\nIf you are distributing a packaged and labeled dietary supplement, the DS CGMP rule requires you to keep the reserve samples in a container-closure system that is the same as the container-closure system in which the dietary supplement is (\\bigstar) distributed.\n\nIf you are distributing a dietary supplement for packaging and labeling, the DS CGMP rule requires you to keep the reserve samples in a container-closure system that provides essentially the same characteristics to protect against contamination or deterioration as the one in which you distributed the dietary supplement for packaging and labeling elsewhere. For example, if you distribute product in bulk using a polyethylene bottle that can hold 50 kilograms of the product, and there is an air space above the product, you would hold the reserve samples in a polyethylene bottle with an air space. However, you would use a bottle sized to fit the smaller amount you are holding in reserve. (21 CFR 111.83(b)(1); 21 CFR 111.465(a)(2); 72 FR 34752 at 34904)\n\nHow does the DS CGMP rule require me to hold reserve samples of packaged and labeled dietary supplements? The DS CGMP rule requires you to hold reserve samples under conditions consistent with product labels or, if no storage conditions are recommended on the label, under ordinary storage conditions. For example, if the product label states \"Keep this product refrigerated,\" you would store the reserve sample in a refrigerator. (21 CFR 111.465(a)(1))\n\nHow long does the DS CGMP rule require me to hold reserve samples of packaged and labeled dietary supplements? The DS CGMP rule requires you to hold reserve samples of packaged and labeled dietary supplements for: * One year past the shelf life date (if shelf life dating is used); or * Two years from the date of distribution of the last batch of dietary supplements associated with the reserve sample. (21 CFR 111.83(b)(3) and 111.465(b))\n\nWhat does the DS CGMP rule require me to do when distributing dietary supplements? The DS CGMP rule requires you to distribute dietary supplements under conditions that will protect the dietary supplements against contamination and deterioration. (21 CFR 111.470)\n\n1. What does the DS CGMP rule require me to do with a returned dietary supplement?\n\nThe DS CGMP rule requires you to identify and quarantine a returned dietary supplement until quality control personnel conduct a material review and make a disposition decision.\n2. When does the DS CGMP rule require me to destroy, or otherwise suitably dispose of, a returned dietary supplement? The DS CGMP rule requires you to destroy, or otherwise suitably dispose of, any returned dietary supplement unless the outcome of a material review and disposition decision is that quality control personnel approve the salvage of the returned dietary supplement for redistribution, or approve the returned dietary supplement for reprocessing. (21 CFR 111.515)\n3. When may I salvage a returned dietary supplement? You may salvage a returned dietary supplement only if quality control personnel conduct a material review and make a disposition decision to allow the salvage. (21 CFR 111.520)\n4. What does the DS CGMP rule require me to do with a returned dietary supplement that quality control personnel approve for reprocessing? The DS CGMP rule requires that:\n\nYou ensure that any returned dietary supplements that are reprocessed meet all product specifications established for the finished batch to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement(21 CFR 111.525(a)); and\n\nQuality control personnel approve or reject the release for distribution of any returned dietary supplement that is reprocessed (21 CFR 111.525(b)).\n\nWhen does the DS CGMP rule require me to conduct an investigation of my manufacturing processes and other batches following the return of a product? The DS CGMP rule requires you to conduct an investigation of your manufacturing processes and each of those other batches to determine compliance with specifications if the reason for a dietary supplement being returned implicates other batches. (21 CFR 111.530)\n\nXIX. Subpart 0 - Product Complaints\n\nWhat are some examples of product complaints? Examples of product complaints are: foul odor, off taste, illness or injury, disintegration time, color variation, tablet size or size variation, under-filled container, foreign material in a dietary supplement container, improper packaging, mislabeling, or dietary supplements that are superpotent, subpotent, or contain the wrong ingredient, or contain a drug or other contaminant (e.g., bacteria, pesticide, mycotoxin, glass, lead). (21 CFR 111.3)\n\nDoes the DS CGMP rule establish requirements for handling complaints about the inherent safety of a dietary supplement?No (72 FR 34752 at 34763 and 34765). However, we encourage firms to investigate all complaints in a consistent way, regardless of whether the complaints relate to the quality of the dietary supplement or to the inherent safety of a dietary ingredient (72 FR 34752 at 34910). We also note that manufacturers, packers, and distributors whose names appear on the label of dietary supplements marketed in the United States are required to submit to FDA any report received of a serious adverse event associated with such dietary supplement when used in the United States (section 761 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the Act) (21 U.S.C. 379aa-1)) (see also question 8 below).\n\nWhat does the DS CGMP rule require me to do during the review and investigation of a product complaint? The DS CGMP rule requires that: * A qualified person review all product complaints to determine whether the product complaint involves a possible failure of a dietary supplement to meet any of its specifications, or any other requirements of part 111, including those specifications and other requirements that, if not met, may result in a risk of illness or injury (21 CFR 111.560(a)(1)); * A qualified person investigate the product complaint if it is determined that the product complaint does involve such a failure (21 CFR 111.560(a)(2)); * Quality control personnel review and approve decisions about whether to investigate a product complaint and review and approve the findings and follow-up action of any investigation performed (21 CFR 111.560(b)); and * The review and investigation of the product complaint extend to all relevant batches and records (21 CFR 111.560(c)).\n\nAm I subject to the requirements for product complaints if I am a packager, labeler, or distributor rather than a manufacturer? Yes. The DS CGMP rule requires any person in the manufacturing chain who receives a product complaint to comply with the requirements for product complaints (21 CFR 111.1; 72 FR 34752 at 34909). This is true regardless of the source of the product complaint - i.e., regardless of whether you receive the complaint from a consumer or from another firm in the manufacturing chain (72 FR 34752 at 34909).\n\nWhat should I do if I am a packager, labeler, or distributor and I conclude that the problem in a product complaint is unrelated to any process under my control? We recommend that you contact the manufacturer so that the manufacturer can determine whether the product complaint involves a possible failure of a dietary supplement to meet any of its specifications, or any other requirements of part 111, including those specifications and other requirements that, if not met, may result in a risk of illness or injury.\n\n(72 FR 34752 at 34909)Am I subject to the requirements for product complaints if I manufacture dietary ingredients rather than dietary supplements?\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.2162551879882812", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , How do I provide the \"Supplement Facts\" panel if my dietary supplements are sold from bulk containers?\n--------------------\nContext: In addition to establishing specifications under 21 CFR 111.70(b) or (d), to be eligible for the modified FSVP requirements, you or your customer must determine that the established component, label, and/or packaging specifications have been met in accordance with 21 CFR 111.73 and 111.75.\n\nK.6 Q: What FSVP requirements apply if I am an importer subject to and in compliance with the specified dietary supplement CGMP provisions requiring that I establish certain specifications and verify they are met?\n\nA: If you establish specifications for a dietary supplement or dietary supplement component under 21 CFR 111.70(b) or (d) and ensure that they are met in accordance with 21 CFR 111.73 and 111.75, the FSVP requirements that apply to you are as follows:\n\nIdentify yourself at entry as the importer of the food (i.e., dietary supplement or dietary supplement component) (21 CFR 1.509); and\n\nUse a qualified individual (to ensure identification at entry) (21 CFR 1.503).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nK.7 Q: What FSVP requirements apply to me if my customer is subject to and in compliance with the specified dietary supplement CGMP provisions requiring them to establish certain specifications and verify they are met?\n\nA: If your customer establishes specifications for a dietary supplement or dietary supplement component under 21 CFR 111.70(b) or (d) and ensures that they are met in accordance with 21 CFR 111.73 and 111.75, the FSVP requirements that apply to you are as follows:\n\nAnnually obtain from the customer written assurance that they are in compliance with the applicable CGMP requirements (21 CFR 1.511(b));\n\nUse a qualified individual (21 CFR 1.503);\n\nIdentify yourself at entry as the importer of the food (i.e., dietary supplement or dietary supplement component) (21 CFR 1.509); and\n\nMaintain applicable FSVP records (i.e., written customer assurances) (21 CFR 1.510).\n\nK.8 Q: What is acceptable \"written assurance\" that my customer is in compliance with the above-discussed CGMP specification requirements for a dietary supplement or dietary supplement component I import?\n\nA: Examples of acceptable \"written assurance\" include a letter on your customer's company letterhead or a report of an audit of the customer. The letter, report, or other form of annual written assurance from your customer should:\n\nIdentify the customer and the dietary supplement or dietary supplement component you import;\n\nState whether specifications under 21 CFR 111.70(b) or (d) are required to be established for the food; and\n\nProvide a statement or information to assure that the customer is in compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 111.73 and 111.75 applicable to determining whether those specifications are met.\n\nK.9 Q: What FSVP requirements apply under 21 CFR 1.511 if I am importing a dietary supplement and neither section 1.511(a) or (b) applies?\n\nA: If you import a dietary supplement and neither 21 CFR 1.511(a) nor (b) applies, you must comply with the FSVP requirements relating to:\n\nUse of a qualified individual to develop the FSVP and perform each required FSVP activity (21 CFR 1.503);\n\nConducting an evaluation for foreign supplier approval and verification (21 CFR 1.505(a)(1)(ii) through (a)(1)(iv), (a)(2), and (b) through (d));\n\nWritten procedures to ensure use of approved foreign suppliers (or when necessary and appropriate, and on a temporary basis, unapproved foreign suppliers) (21 CFR 1.511(c)(2));\n\nWritten procedures to ensure appropriate foreign supplier verification activities are conducted (21 CFR 1.511(c)(3));\n\nDetermination of appropriate foreign supplier verification activities (21 CFR 1.511(c)(4));\n\nPerformance of foreign supplier verification activities (including review of results of activities) (21 CFR 1.511(c)(5));\n\nPromptly taking appropriate corrective actions (21 CFR 1.508);\n\nIdentifying the importer of the food (i.e., dietary supplement) at entry (21 CFR 1.509); and\n\nMaintaining applicable FSVP records (21 CFR 1.510).\n\nQ: What imported dietary supplements are subject to 21 CFR 1.511(c)?\n\nA: The requirements in 1.511(c) apply to importers of dietary supplements and do not apply to dietary supplement components. The dietary supplements that are subject to 1.511(c) include finished dietary supplements (i.e., dietary supplements ready for retail sale without any additional manufacturing, processing, or labeling). In addition, dietary supplements are subject to 1.511(c) if they will undergo labeling and packaging in the United States after they have left the control of the person who manufactured the product. For example, if an importer is a dietary supplement distributor and applies branded labeling to already-manufactured dietary supplements, those importers would be subject to 21 CFR 1.511(c). (However, if the importer is manufacturing dietary supplements and establishing specifications for labeling and packaging in accordance with 111.70(d), then the importer may follow the requirements in 1.511(a) provided the criteria for that provision are satisfied).\n\nQ: What FSVP requirements may apply if I import a food that will be used as a component in a finished dietary supplement by an entity in my distribution chain, but neither I nor my direct customer will conduct the manufacturing/processing of the dietary supplement that incorporates the component?\n\nFor the written assurances required in 21 CFR 1.507(a)(4)(ii), we intend to exercise enforcement discretion, as stated in our \"Guidance for Industry: Policy Regarding Certain Entities Subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practice and Preventive Controls, Produce Safety, and/or Foreign\n\nSupplier Verification Programs\" (see Question G.3).\n\nSince 21 CFR 1.511(c) does not require importers to conduct a hazard analysis under 21 CFR 1.504 of the FSVP regulation, how does the importer determine appropriate verification activities?\n\nA: The modified requirements in 21 CFR 1.511(c) do not require the importer to conduct a hazard analysis under section 1.504 of the FSVP regulation, because the importer is instead required to assure that their foreign suppliers are in compliance with the applicable requirements in the dietary supplement CGMP regulation in 21 CFR part 111. As the importer, you must conduct verification activities to provide adequate assurances that your foreign supplier has produced the dietary supplement in accordance with processes and procedures that provide the same level of public health protection as those required under the dietary supplement CGMP regulation (21 CFR 1.511(c)(4)(i))). Some examples of dietary supplement CGMP requirements, with which it may be appropriate to verify your foreign supplier's compliance, include:\n\nYour foreign supplier established specifications for any point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement (21 CFR 111.70(a)). In addition, your foreign supplier is in compliance with requirements in 21 CFR 111.73 and 111.75 applicable to determining whether the specifications are met.\n\nYour foreign supplier established specifications for each element used in the manufacturing of a dietary supplement so that they are identified properly, have the appropriate purity, strength, and composition, and have limits on those types of contamination that may adulterated, or that may adulterate or may lead to adulteration of the dietary supplement (21 CFR 111.70(b)). In addition, your foreign supplier is in compliance with requirements in 21 CFR 111.73 and 111.75 applicable to determining whether the specifications are met.\n\nYour foreign supplier established product specifications for each dietary supplement manufactured for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contaminations that may adulterated, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement (21 CFR 111.70(e)). In addition, your foreign supplier is in compliance with requirements in 21 CFR 111.73 and 111.75 applicable to determining whether the specifications are met.\n\nYour foreign supplier established and followed written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations, including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision and for approving or rejecting any reprocessing (21 CFR 111.103).\n\nYour foreign supplier prepared and followed a written master manufacturing record for each unique formulation of dietary supplement, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch (21 CFR 111.205(a)).\n\nWhat evaluation for foreign supplier approval and verification must I conduct?\n\nA: When approving a foreign supplier of a dietary supplement and determining the appropriate supplier verification activities, you must, under 21 CFR 1.505(a)(1)(ii) through (a)(1)(iv), evaluate the following:\n\nThe entity or entities that will be significantly minimizing or preventing the hazards requiring a control or verifying that such hazards have been significantly minimized or prevented, such as the foreign supplier, the foreign supplier's raw material or other ingredient supplier, or another entity in your supply chain.\n\nForeign supplier performance, including:* The foreign supplier's procedures, processes, and practices related to the safety of the food;\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Foreign Supplier Verification Programs for Importers of Food for Humans and Animals\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.261805534362793"], "As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: An exception can be made for retrospective validation for well established processes that have been used without significant changes to API quality due to changes in raw materials, equipment, systems, facilities, or the production process. This validation approach may be used where:\n\nCritical quality attributes and critical process parameters have been identified;\n\nAppropriate in-process acceptance criteria and controls have been established;\n\nThere have not been significant process/product failures attributable to causes other than operator error or equipment failures unrelated to equipment suitability; and\n\nImpurity profiles have been established for the existing API.\n\nBatches selected for retrospective validation should be representative of all batches made during the review period, including any batches that failed to meet specifications, and should be sufficient in number to demonstrate process consistency. Retained samples can be tested to obtain data to retrospectively validate the process.\n\nProcess Validation Program\n\nThe number of process runs for validation should depend on the complexity of the process or the magnitude of the process change being considered. For prospective and concurrent validation, three consecutive successful production batches should be used as a guide, but there may be situations where additional process runs are warranted to prove consistency of the process (e.g., complex API processes or API processes with prolonged completion times). For retrospective validation, generally data from ten to thirty consecutive batches should be examined to assess process consistency, but fewer batches can be examined if justified.\n\nCritical process parameters should be controlled and monitored during process validation studies. Process parameters unrelated to quality, such as variables controlled to minimize energy consumption or equipment use, need not be included in the process validation.\n\nProcess validation should confirm that the impurity profile for each API is within the limits specified. The impurity profile should be comparable to or better than historical data and, where applicable, the profile determined during process development or for batches used for pivotal clinical and toxicological studies.\n\nPeriodic Review of Validated Systems\n\nSystems and processes should be periodically evaluated to verify that they are still operating in a valid manner. Where no significant changes have been made to the system or process, and a quality review confirms that the system or process is consistently producing material meeting its specifications, there is normally no need for revalidation.\n\nCleaning Validation\n--------------------\nContext title: Q7 Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.4473763704299927", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: All relevant data collected during validation and formulae used for calculating validation characteristics should be submitted and discussed as appropriate.\n\nApproaches other than those set forth in this guideline may be applicable and acceptable. It is the responsibility of the applicant to choose the validation procedure and protocol most suitable for their product. However it is important to remember that the main objective of validation of an analytical procedure is to demonstrate that the procedure is suitable for its intended purpose. Due to their complex nature, analytical procedures for biological and biotechnological products in some cases may be approached differently than in this document.\n\nWell-characterized reference materials, with documented purity, should be used throughout the validation study. The degree of purity necessary depends on the intended use.\n\nIn accordance with the parent document, and for the sake of clarity, this document considers the various validation characteristics in distinct sections. The arrangement of these sections reflects the process by which an analytical procedure may be developed and evaluated.\n\nIn practice, it is usually possible to design the experimental work such that the appropriate validation characteristics can be considered simultaneously to provide a sound, overall knowledge of the capabilities of the analytical procedure, for instance: specificity, linearity, range, accuracy and precision.\n\n1 Specificity\n\nAn investigation of specificity should be conducted during the validation of identification tests, the determination of impurities and the assay. The procedures used to demonstrate specificity will depend on the intended objective of the analytical procedure.\n\nIt is not always possible to demonstrate that an analytical procedure is specific for a particular analyte (complete discrimination). In this case a combination of two ormore analytical procedures is recommended to achieve the necessary level of discrimination.\n\nIdentification\n\nSuitable identification tests should be able to discriminate between compounds of closely related structures which are likely to be present. The discrimination of a procedure may be confirmed by obtaining positive results (perhaps by comparison with a known reference material) from samples containing the analyte, coupled with negative results from samples which do not contain the analyte. In addition, the identification test may be applied to materials structurally similar to or closely related to the analyte to confirm that a positive response is not obtained. The choice of such potentially interfering materials should be based on sound scientific judgement with a consideration of the interferences that could occur.\n\nAssay and Impurity Test(s)\n--------------------\nContext title: Q2(R1) Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.2447056770324707", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: In summary, the CGMP regulations require that manufacturing processes be designed and controlled to assure that in-process materials and the finished product meet predetermined quality requirements and do so consistently and reliably.\n\nIV Recommendations\n\nIn the following sections, we describe general considerations for process validation, the recommended stages of process validation, and specific activities for each stage in the product lifecycle.\n\nGeneral Considerations for Process Validation\n\nIn all stages of the product lifecycle, good project management and good archiving that capture scientific knowledge will make the process validation program more effective and efficient. The following practices should ensure uniform collection and assessment of information about the process and enhance the accessibility of such information later in the product lifecycle.\n\nWe recommend an integrated team approach11 to process validation that includes expertise from a variety of disciplines (e.g., process engineering, industrial pharmacy, analytical chemistry, microbiology, statistics, manufacturing, and quality assurance). Project plans, along with the full support of senior management, are essential elements for success. Footnote 11: This concept is discussed in more detail in FDA\u2019s guidance for industry, Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations, available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatory/Information/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nThroughout the product lifecycle, various studies can be initiated to discover, observe, correlate, or confirm information about the product and process. All studies should be planned and conducted according to sound scientific principles, appropriately documented, and approved in accordance with the established procedure appropriate for the stage of the lifecycle.\n\nThe terms attribute(s) (e.g., quality, product, component) and parameter(s) (e.g., process, operating, and equipment) are not categorized with respect to criticality in this guidance. With a lifecycle approach to process validation that employs risk based decision making throughout that lifecycle, the perception of criticality as a continuum rather than a binary state is more useful. All attributes and parameters should be evaluated in terms of their roles in the process and impact on the product or in-process material, and reevaluated as new information becomes available. The degree of control over those attributes or parameters should be commensurate with their risk to the process and process output. In other words, a higher degree of control is appropriate for attributes or parameters that pose a higher risk. The Agency recognizes that terminology usage can vary and expects that each manufacturer will communicate the meaning and intent of its terminology and categorization to the Agency.\n\nMany products are single-source or involve complicated manufacturing processes. Homogeneity within a batch and consistency between batches are goals of process validation activities. Validation offers assurance that a process is reasonably protected against sources of variability that could affect production output, cause supply problems, and negatively affect public health.\n\nStage 1 -- Process Design\n\nProcess design is the activity of defining the commercial manufacturing process that will be reflected in planned master production and control records. The goal of this stage is to design a process suitable for routine commercial manufacturing that can consistently deliver a product that meets its quality attributes.\n\nii.2.1 Building and Capturing Process Knowledge and Understanding\n\nGenerally, early process design experiments do not need to be performed under the CGMP conditions required for drugs intended for commercial distribution that are manufactured during Stage 2 (process qualification) and Stage 3 (continued process verification). They should, however, be conducted in accordance with sound scientific methods and principles, including good documentation practices. This recommendation is consistent with ICH Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality System.12 Decisions and justification of the controls should be sufficiently documented and internally reviewed to verify and preserve their value for use or adaptation later in the lifecycle of the process and product.\n\nFootnote 12: Available at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.\n\nAlthough often performed at small-scale laboratories, most viral inactivation and impurity clearance studies cannot be considered early process design experiments. Viral and impurity clearance studies intended to evaluate and estimate product quality at commercial scale should have a level of quality unit oversight that will ensure that the studies follow sound scientific methods and principles and the conclusions are supported by the data.\n\nProduct development activities provide key inputs to the process design stage, such as the intended dosage form, the quality attributes, and a general manufacturing pathway. Process information available from product development activities can be leveraged in the process design stage. The functionality and limitations of commercial manufacturing equipment should be considered in the process design, as well as predicted contributions to variability posed by different component lots, production operators, environmental conditions, and measurement systems in the production setting. However, the full spectrum of input variability typical of commercial production is not generally known at this stage. Laboratory or pilot-scale models designed to be representative of the commercial process can be used to estimate variability.\n\nDesigning an efficient process with an effective process control approach is dependent on the process knowledge and understanding obtained. Design of Experiment (DOE) studies can help develop process knowledge by revealing relationships, including multivariate interactions, between the variable inputs (e.g., component characteristics 13 or process parameters) and the resulting outputs (e.g., in-process material, intermediates, or the final product). Risk analysis tools can be used to screen potential variables for DOE studies to minimize the total number of experiments conducted while maximizing knowledge gained. The results of DOE studies can provide justification for establishing ranges of incoming component quality, equipmentparameters, and in-process material quality attributes. FDA does not generally expect manufacturers to develop and test the process until it fails.\n\nOther activities, such as experiments or demonstrations at laboratory or pilot scale, also assist in evaluation of certain conditions and prediction of performance of the commercial process. These activities also provide information that can be used to model or simulate the commercial process. Computer-based or virtual simulations of certain unit operations or dynamics can provide process understanding and help avoid problems at commercial scale. It is important to understand the degree to which models represent the commercial process, including any differences that might exist, as this may have an impact on the relevance of information derived from the models.\n\nIt is essential that activities and studies resulting in process understanding be documented. Documentation should reflect the basis for decisions made about the process. For example, manufacturers should document the variables studied for a unit operation and the rationale for those variables identified as significant. This information is useful during the process qualification and continued process verification stages, including when the design is revised or the strategy for control is refined or changed.\n\nii.2.2 Establishing a Strategy for Process Control\n\nProcess knowledge and understanding is the basis for establishing an approach to process control for each unit operation and the process overall. Strategies for process control can be designed to reduce input variation, adjust for input variation during manufacturing (and so reduce its impact on the output), or combine both approaches.\n\nProcess controls address variability to assure quality of the product. Controls can consist of material analysis and equipment monitoring at significant processing points (SS 211.110(c)). Decisions regarding the type and extent of process controls can be aided by earlier risk assessments, then enhanced and improved as process experience is gained.\n\nFDA expects controls to include both examination of material quality and equipment monitoring. Special attention to control the process through operational limits and in-process monitoring is essential in two possible scenarios:\n\nWhen the product attribute is not readily measurable due to limitations of sampling or detectability (e.g., viral clearance or microbial contamination) or\n\nWhen intermediates and products cannot be highly characterized and well-defined quality attributes cannot be identified.\n\nThese controls are established in the master production and control records (see SS 211.186(a) and (b)(9)).\n\nMore advanced strategies, which may involve the use of process analytical technology (PAT), can include timely analysis and control loops to adjust the processing conditions so that the output remains constant. Manufacturing systems of this type can provide a higher degree of process control than non-PAT systems. In the case of a strategy using PAT, the approach to process qualification will differ from that used in other process designs. Further information on PAT processes can be found in FDA's guidance for industry on PAT -- A Framework for Innovative Pharmaceutical Development, Manufacturing, and Quality Assurance.14\n--------------------\nContext title: Process Validation- General Principles and Practices Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.341505289077759", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: Control of Materials (3.2.S.2.3);* Controls of Critical Steps and Intermediates (3.2.S.2.4);\n\nControl of Drug Substance (3.2.S.4);\n\nContainer Closure System (3.2.S.6).\n\nProcess Validation/Evaluation\n\nGeneral Principles\n\nProcess validation is the documented evidence that the process, operated within established parameters, can perform effectively and reproducibly to produce a drug substance or intermediate meeting its predetermined specifications and quality attributes (ICH Q7).\n\nProcess validation can include the collection and evaluation of data, from the process design stage throughout production, that establish scientific evidence that a process is capable of consistently delivering a quality drug substance.\n\nThe drug substance manufacturing process should be validated before commercial distribution of resulting drug product. For biotechnological processes, or for aseptic processing and sterilisation process steps for drug substances, the data provided in support of process validation is included as part of the marketing application (3.2.S.2.5). For non-sterile chemical entity drug substance processes, results of process validation studies are not normally included in the dossier.\n\nGenerally, process validation includes the collection of data on an appropriate number of production batches (see ICH Q7, Section 12.5). The number of batches can depend on several factors including but not limited to: (1) the complexity of the process being validated; (2) the level of process variability; and (3) the amount of experimental data and/or process knowledge available on the specific process.\n\nAs an alternative to the traditional process validation, continuous process verification (ICH Q8) can be utilised in process validation protocols for the initial commercial production and also for manufacturing process changes for the continual improvement throughout the remainder of the product lifecycle.\n\nPrinciples Specific to Biotechnological/Biological Drug Substance\n\nFor biotechnological/biological drug substances, the information provided in the dossier in support of process validation usually contains both commercial-scale process validation studies and small-scale studies. Process validation batches should be representative of the commercial process, taking into account the batch definition as detailed in the process description.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11 Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.5230934619903564", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: Manufacturers should seek regulatory approval before implementing a conversion of an approved batch process to a CM process. Manufacturers can seek advice from the regulatory authority to gain clarification on the regulatory expectations and acceptability of their strategy and data package for the proposed changes (e.g., when potential changes in formulation are necessary to enable conversion to CM and the impact of these changes on product registration).\n\nProcess Validation\n\nThe requirements for process validation as established by region are similar for CM and batch manufacturing processes. Approaches such as traditional process validation that uses a fixed number of validation batches or continuous process verification can be used.\n\nWhen continuous process verification is used, the CM system performance and output material quality is continuously monitored, such that the real-time data collected demonstrate the maintenance of a state of control and production of output material with the desired quality for the run time duration. The use of continuous process verification should be justified based on the product and process understanding, system design, and overall control strategy. This justification should be provided in the dossier (see Table 1 below).\n\nWhen a continuous process verification approach is used to support initial product launch, applicants should justify the appropriateness of the validation activities to provide confidence in the commercial manufacturing process.\n\nPharmaceutical Quality System\n\nPQS expectations are the same for batch and CM processes and should follow pertinent ICH guidelines. One important operational aspect of CM is that non-conforming materials can be diverted from the rest of the batch when material traceability, process monitoring, and material diversion strategies are well established. Procedures for material diversion, when required, should be established under the PQS (see Section 4.2). An overarching plan or decision tree that describes how disturbances are managed for various types of material diversion should be maintained under the PQS. Diverted materials resulting from planned events (e.g., system start-up and shutdown) generally do not require investigation when the events meet established process performance criteria. Examples of approaches for managing disturbances are provided in Annex V. As described therein, when unexpected and/or frequent disturbances occur, appropriate investigation, root cause analysis, and corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) should be instituted.\n\nLifecycle Management\n\nThe principles and approaches described in ICH Q12 are applicable to the lifecycle management of CM.\n\nSubmission of CM-Specific Information in the CTD\n--------------------\nContext title: ICH_Q13_Step4_Guideline_2022_1116\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.159520626068115", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As described in Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry , Is a retrospective approach to validation still acceptable?\n--------------------\nContext: To determine the extent of validation, e.g.,\n\nIdentification of critical performance parameters\n\nSelection of the requirements and design\n\nCode review\n\nThe extent of testing and test methods\n\nReliability of electronic records and signaturesQuality Risk Management as Part of Materials Management Assessment and Evaluation of Suppliers and Contract Manufacturers (II.5)\n\nTo provide a comprehensive evaluation of suppliers and contract manufacturers (e.g., auditing, supplier quality agreements).\n\nStarting Material\n\nTo assess differences and possible quality risks associated with variability in starting materials (e.g., age, route of synthesis).\n\nUse of Materials\n\nTo determine whether it is appropriate to use material under quarantine (e.g., for further internal processing);\n\nTo determine appropriateness of reprocessing, reworking, use of returned goods.\n\nStorage, Logistics and Distribution Conditions\n\nTo assess the adequacy of arrangements to ensure maintenance of appropriate storage and transport conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, container design);\n\nTo determine the effect on product quality of discrepancies in storage or transport conditions (e.g., cold chain management) in conjunction with other ICH guidelines;\n\nTo maintain infrastructure (e.g., capacity to ensure proper shipping conditions, interim storage, handling of hazardous materials and controlled substances, customs clearance);\n\nTo provide information for ensuring the availability of pharmaceuticals (e.g., ranking risks to the supply chain).\n\nQuality Risk Management as Part of Production Validation (II.6)\n\nTo identify the scope and extent of verification, qualification, and validation activities (e.g., analytical methods, processes, equipment, and cleaning methods);\n\nTo determine the extent for follow-up activities (e.g., sampling, monitoring and re-validation);\n\nTo distinguish between critical and non-critical process steps to facilitate design of a validation study.\n\nIn-Process Sampling and Testing\n\nTo evaluate the frequency and extent of in-process control testing (e.g., to justify reduced testing under conditions of proven control);\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTo evaluate and justify the use of process analytical technologies (PAT) in conjunction with parametric and real time release.\n\n4.2.3 Production Planning\n\nTo determine appropriate production planning (e.g., dedicated, campaign and concurrent production process sequences).\n\nG.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe purpose of this guidance is to advise manufacturers who wish to use the implied nutrient content claim \"healthy\" to label their food products as provided by our regulations. More specifically, this guidance is intended to advise food manufacturers of our intent to exercise enforcement discretion relative to foods that use the implied nutrient content claim \"healthy\" on their labels which: (1) Are not low in total fat, but have a fat profile makeup of predominantly mono and polyunsaturated fats; or (2) contain at least ten percent of the Daily Value (DV) per reference amount customarily consumed (RACC) of potassium or vitamin D.\n\nThis guidance is immediately effective because the agency has determined that prior public participation is not feasible or appropriate (21 CFR 10.115(g)(2)).\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nUnder section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(1)(A)), a food2 is misbranded if it bears claims, either express or implied, that characterize the level of a nutrient which is of a type required to be declared in nutritionlabeling3 unless the claim is made in accordance with a regulatory definition established by FDA (see section 403(r)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 343(r)(2)). 21 CFR 101.65(d) provides such regulatory definition for use of the term \"healthy\" or related terms (such as \"health,\" \"healthful,\" \"healthfully,\" \"healthfulness,\" \"health,\" \"healthiest,\" \"healthily,\" and \"healthiness\") as an implied nutrient content claim on the label or in labeling of a food. The \"healthy\" nutrient content claim can be used if the food meets certain nutrient conditions; and, when used with an explicit or implicit claim or statement about a nutrient (e.g. \"healthy, contains 3 grams of fat\"), suggests that a food, because of its nutrient content, may be useful in creating a diet that is consistent with dietary recommendations. The nutrient conditions for bearing a \"healthy\" nutrient content claim include specific criteria for nutrients to limit in the diet, such as total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, as well as requirements for nutrients to encourage in the diet, including vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, iron, protein, and fiber. The criteria are linked to elements in the Nutrition Facts label and serving size regulations (see 21 CFR SSS 101.9 and 101.12). The nutrient criteria to use the claim can vary for different food categories (e.g., fruits and vegetables, or seafood and game meat) (see 21 CFR 101.65(d)(2)).\n\nFootnote 3: Section 201(m) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(m)) defines \u201clabeling\u201d as all labels and other written, printed, or graphic matter upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers or accompanying such article.\n\nIn addition, it is also important to note that under section 403(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)), a food is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(n)) provides that labeling is misleading if, among other things, it fails to reveal facts that are material in light of representations made or suggested in the labeling, or material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the food to which the labeling relates under the conditions of use prescribed in the labeling, or under such conditions of use as are customary or usual.\n\n3 Discussion\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016, we issued final rules updating the Nutrition Facts label and serving size information for packaged foods to reflect new scientific information, including the link between diet and chronic diseases such as obesity and heart disease (see 81 FR 33742, \"Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels\"; 81 FR 34000, \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments\"). Updates to the Nutrition Facts label include changes in the individual nutrients that must be declared and also changes to the Daily Value (DV) of other individual nutrients, reflecting changes in recommended intake levels, based on current science. The individual nutrients included in Nutrition Facts and their DVs significantly influence the regulations on nutrient content and health claims. Because the framework for many of FDA's other nutrition labeling regulations is linked to elements in the Nutrition Facts label and serving size regulations, we plan to update those other regulations, such as those for health claims and nutrient content claims (including the implied nutrient content claim \"healthy\"), to align with these most recent updates.\n\nWe are re-evaluating the regulatory criteria for use of the implied nutrient content claim \"healthy\" in light of the latest nutrition science and the current dietary recommendations and seek input on possible future rulemaking to update the existing regulations for this claim. Because the rulemaking process can sometimes be lengthy, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion in the interim with respect to some of the existing criteria for the nutrient content claim \"healthy\" if the alternative nutrient criteria described below are met. We intend to exercise enforcement discretion until we amend 21 CFR 101.65(d)(2).\n\nLow Fat\n\nAs stated above, since we published the final rule defining \"healthy\" (58 FR 2302, January 6, 1993), the science related to public health recommendations for intake of dietary fats has evolved. The focus of the most recent dietary fat recommendations has shifted away from limiting total fat intake to encouraging intakes of mono and polyunsaturated fats. Foods that use the term \"healthy\" on their labels that are not low in total fat should have a fat profile makeup of predominantly mono and polyunsaturated fats (i.e., sum of monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats are greater than the total saturated fat content of food). Consistent with consensus science and public health recommendations for dietary fats which no longer recommend low total fat intake, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the current requirement that any food bearing the nutrient content claim \"healthy\" meet the low fat requirement (SS101.65(d)(2)(i)), provided that: (1) The amounts of mono and polyunsaturated fats are declared on the label and (2) the amounts declared constitute the majority of the fat content. These conditions are necessary so that consumers are made aware that the total fat is mostly made up of fats that are encouraged by current dietary recommendations.\n\nBeneficial Nutrients\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Use of the Term \u201cHealthy\u201d in the Labeling of Human Food Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.446859359741211", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What do you mean by \"recognized antioxidant activity\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Activity Equivalents (mcg RAE)\n\nExample 12: A serving (240 mL) of milk contains 500 IU of vitamin A\n\nVitamin A Conversion from IU to mcg RAE\n\nVitamin A (mcg RAE) = Vitamin (IU per serving) (\\times) 0.3 (conversion factor for pre-formed retinol)\n\nVitamin A (mcg RAE) = 500 IU (\\times) 0.3 = 150 mcg RAE\n\n% DV Calculation\n\n% DV = [Vitamin A (mcg RAE) (\\div) 2016 RDI for vitamin A (mcg RAE)] (\\times) 100\n\n% DV = (150 mcg RAE (\\div) 900 mcg RAE) (\\times) 100 = 17%Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nLabel Declaration\n\nDeclaring vitamin A on a conventional food label is voluntary.

One IU of vitamin D has been previously defined as the activity of 0.025 mcg of cholecalciferol (Vitamin D({}_{3})) in bioassays with rats and chicks (Ref. [9]):\n\n1 mcg cholecalciferol = 40 IU vitamin D\n\nVitamin D is considered a nutrient of public health significance, and so mandatory declaration of vitamin D is necessary to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices (81 FR 33742 at 33891). The required unit of measure for vitamin D is \"mcg\" for both conventional foods and dietary supplements. It is also permissible to include the voluntary labeling of vitamin D in IU, in parentheses, next to the mandatory declaration in mcg units (81 FR 33742 at 33912-33913). The two major forms of vitamin D, vitamin D({}{2}) (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D({}{3}) (cholesterol), have been reported to exhibit identical responses in the body (Ref. [9]), so for the purpose of converting from IU to mcg, we consider them to be bioequivalent. Table 4 shows the conversion factor from IU to mcg of vitamin D.\n\nExamples of Conversion from IU to mcg Vitamin D\n\nCONVENTIONAL FOODS\n\nExample 14: A serving (240 mL) of milk that contains 100 IU of vitamin D\n\nVitamin D Conversion from IU to mcg\n\nVitamin D (mcg) = Vitamin D (IU per serving) (\\times) 0.025 (conversion factor for vitamin D)\n\nVitamin D (mcg) = 100 IU (\\times) 0.025 = 2.5 mcg\n\n% DV Calculation\n\n% DV = [Vitamin D (mcg) (\\div) 2016 RDI for vitamin D (mcg)] (\\times) 100\n\n% DV = (2.5 mcg (\\div) 20 mcg) (\\times) 100 = 13%\n\nLabel Declaration\n\nDeclaring vitamin D on a conventional food label is mandatory (SS 101.9(c)(8)(ii)).

(21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAs for the phrase \"levels of significance,\" as used in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii) and 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and whether the phrase refers to statistical testing of hypotheses or mathematical concepts related to the degree of accuracy starting with the first nonzero digit, the phrase \"levels of significance\" refers to the degree of accuracy when rounding nutrients for purposes of declaring quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the label.\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c), provide specific rounding requirements for nutrients such as sodium. Before we issued the Nutrition Facts label final rule, sodium and potassium content was to be expressed as zero when the serving contained less than 5 milligrams (mg), to the nearest 5 mg increment when the serving contained less than or equal to 140 mg, and to the nearest 10 mg increment when the serving contained more than 140 mg. The Nutrition\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFacts label final rule amended 21 CFR 101.9(c)(5) to replace the requirements for the labeling of potassium with those of fluoride and amended 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) to establish an RDI for potassium and add it to the list of vitamins and minerals with RDIs. The requirements for declaring the quantitative amount of potassium are now the same as those for other vitamins and minerals with RDIs.\n\nThe RDIs for some vitamins and minerals are small numerical values (e.g., copper 0.9 mg). Nutrients with an RDI of less than 5 would not be able to be declared on the Supplement Facts label if they contain less than 2 percent of the RDI (e.g. 2 percent of the RDI for copper is 0.018 mg) and the amount is declared to the nearest mg or microgram (mcg) (e.g. if the amount of copper in a serving of the product is 0.017, but is rounded to zero). The vitamins and minerals with an RDI of less than 5 mg or mcg are thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, copper, and manganese. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest hundredth of a mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 5 mg or mcg, but less than 50 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest tenth of a mg or mcg per serving. The vitamins or minerals with an RDI of at least 5 mg or mcg but less than 50 mg or mcg are iron, vitamin D, vitamin E, niacin, biotin, pantothenic acid, zinc, chromium, and molybdenum. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest tenth of a mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg, but less than 250 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest mg or mcg. The vitamins or minerals with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg but less than 250 mg or mcg are vitamin C, vitamin K, iodine, and selenium. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the minerals with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg but less than 250 mg or mcg are vitamin C, vitamin K, iodine, and selenium.

Class I nutrients are those added in fortified or fabricated foods. These nutrients are vitamins, minerals, protein, dietary fiber, or potassium. Class I nutrients must be present at 100% or more of the value declared on the label ; in other words, the nutrient content identified by the laboratory analysis must be at least equal to the label value. For example, if vitamin C is added in a fortified product and the label states that vitamin C is present at 10% Daily Value (DV), the laboratory value must equal at least 6 mg of vitamin C/serving (i.e., 10% of the 60 mg Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for vitamin C that is specified in 2i CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv)). The ratio between a laboratory finding of 4.8 mg vitamin C/serving (i.e., 8% DV) and the label value of 10% DV would be calculated as follows:\n\n(8% / 10%) x 100 = 80% or (4.8 mg / 6 mg) x 100 = 80%\n\nand the label value would not be in compliance.\n\nClass II nutrients are vitamins, minerals, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, other carbohydrate, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat, or potassium that occur naturally in a food product. Class II nutrients must be present at 80% or more of the value declared on the label. As an example: If vitamin C is a naturally occurring nutrient in a product, and the product declares 10% DV vitamin C (i.e., 6 mg/serving) on its label, then laboratory analysis must find at least 80% of the label value (80% of 6 mg or 4.8 mg vitamin C/serving) for the product to be in compliance.\n\nThe Third Group nutrients include calories, sugars, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium. However, for products (e.g., fruit drinks, juices, and confectioneries) with a sugars content of 90 percent or more of total carbohydrate, to prevent labeling anomalies due in part to rounding, FDA treats total carbohydrate as a Third Group nutrient instead of a Class II nutrient. For foods with label declarations of Third Group nutrients, the ratio between the amount obtained by laboratory analysis and the amount declared on the product label in the Nutrition Facts panel must be 120% or less, i.e., the label is considered to be out of compliance if the nutrient content of a composite of the product is greater than 20% above the value declared on the label. For example, if a laboratory analysis found 8 g of total fat/serving in a product that started that it contained 6 g of total fat/serving, the ratio between the laboratory value and the label value would be (8 / 6) x 100 = 133%, and the product label would be considered to be out of compliance.\n\nReasonable excesses of class I and II nutrients above labeled amounts and reasonable deficiencies of the Third Group nutrients are usually considered acceptable by the agency within good manufacturing practices.\n\nWhy Submit a Data Base to FDA?\n\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(8), compliance with the provisions set forth in 2i CFR 101.9(g)(1) through (g)(6) may be provided by use of an FDA approved data base that has been developed following FDA guideline procedures and where food samples have been handled in accordance with current good manufacturing practice to prevent nutrient loss. An approval is granted when FDA has agreed to all aspects of the data base in writing or when a clear need is presented (e.g., raw produce and seafood). Approvals are granted for a limited time and will be eligible for renewal in the absence of significant changes in agricultural or industry practices. Guidance in the use of data bases may be found in this document, the FDA Nutrition Labeling Manual--a Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases.\n\nFDA published its policy concerning the review of data bases for use in the voluntary and mandatory nutrition labeling of foods in a final rule entitled \"Guidelines for the Voluntary Nutrition Labeling of Raw Fruits, Vegetables, and Fish\" in the Federal Register of August 16, 1996 (6i FR 42742). This policy is the most recent such statement of the policy made by the agency and will be referred to throughout the manual.\n\nFDA states that upon submission of a data base, \"firms are free...to begin use of the nutrient label values and to initiate the planned studies to collect and update nutrient values. During this interim period, FDA does not anticipate that it will take action against a product bearing label values included in a data base submitted to the agency for review. If any product is identified through FDA compliance activities as including label values that are out of compliance, contingent on the company's willingness to come into compliance, the agency intends to work with both the manufacturer and the data base developer to understand and correct the problem label values\" (6i FR 42742).\n\n23.8.25.2.317.31\n\nChapter II: How to Develop a Nutrition Labeling Data Base\n\nFDA recommends five general steps that industry may choose to follow in the development of a nutrition labeling data base:\n\ncharacterizing the product(s);\n\ndesigning a sampling plan;\n\ncollecting the sample units;\n\nanalyzing the laboratory test samples; and\n\nstatistically analyzing the data and interpreting the results.\n\nThis chapter will address each of the five steps. Each of the steps can be performed in several different ways, and decisions made regarding the alternatives may directly impact the available resources, data quality (error in a data set), and the statistically defined risk of making a correct decision. Please note that this manual is not intended to be a statistics book or a comprehensive sampling text. Data base developers may need to consult the scientific literature, and in some cases, a statistician or research analyst to obtain additional detailed information that is relevant to the data base(s) of interest, but that is not contained in this manual.\n\nThis chapter, with the examples and definitions that are given, should serve as a general guide for individuals needing a basic reference concerning some of the administrative and statistical considerations that are associated with the development of a data base.\n\n1 Characterizing the Product(s)\n\nIn characterizing the product, one should first determine the innate nutrient makeup of the product and obtain preliminary estimates of nutrient levels, nutrient variation, and the factors that could impact nutrient levels and variation. The first step in describing a product or products is to perform a literature search to determine if there are (1) existing nutrient data; (2) estimates that describe the market (production and sales); and, if appropriate, (3) information that describes the varieties (or species, if applicable); (4) the regions where the food is grown or raised; and (5) factors already studied and known to impact or not to impact nutrient levels. If the scientific literature and other sources reveal that a nutrient is known to be absent from the food or is present in negligible amounts (e.g., sugars and dietary fiber in seafood, cholesterol and saturated fat in produce), then the agency will not require testing for that nutrient, as long as the data base developer includes supporting documentation (58 FR 2079 at 2019, January 6, 1993).\n\nIf no information is available that adequately describes the food and its nutrients, the data base developer may choose to perform a pilot study to determine if certain factors do impact nutrient levels, to determine if there are regional differences in the nutrient levels, or to test for nutrient losses over time. In addition, the developer may choose to include other relevant factors of interest in a proposal to collect nutrient data for a data base study. For fruits and vegetables, variability may arise from seasonal and geographic influences associated with such factors as variety, location (e.g., soil type, climatic conditions); growing conditions (e.g., planting time, irrigation and fertilization practices, harvest maturity); product transport (e.g, packing, shipping, storage); and processing practices. For seafoods, the variability in nutrient levels may arise from such factors as species, dietary habits, processing practices, etc. For \"mixed products\", in addition to the factors that influence the variation in the nutrient levels in the product ingredients, processing factors associated with the formulation of the product ingredients into the \"mixed product\" may also influence the variation in the nutrient levels of the finished product. In some instances, if there is a great difference in nutrient values attributable to a particular factor (e.g., different nutrient values for different food types), a data base developer may determine that the foods are different and may even consider different nutrition labels for different food types.\n\nWhen a data base developer submits a proposal to FDA, it is important to include the results of any pilot or experimental study that was completed. One data base developer, for example, completed a number of experimental studies that determined differences in nutrient levels between/among several independent variables (e.g., variety of food (2 levels), site of sampling (production vs. retail), packing medium (brine vs. water), geographical region (5 levels), and age of product (5 levels)). FDA requests that the results of any experimental study that is submitted to the agency be included in statistical tables to better describe the type(s) of statistical test used, the sample size, and the exact probability levels that were used in drawing conclusions based on these results.\n\nIn determining the sampling plan (next section), existing nutrient data are extremely helpful in determining the number of samples to test.\n\n2 Designing a Sampling Plan\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases for Nutrition Labeling \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.396765232086182", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What do you mean by \"recognized antioxidant activity\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Source (when a food substance is of natural biological origin);\n\nQuantitative composition;\n\nImpurities and contaminants; and\n\nPhysical and chemical properties and specifications for these properties (e.g., melting point, boiling point, specific gravity, refractive index, optical rotation, pH, solubility, reactivity, particle size, and chromatographic, spectroscopic or spectrometric data that can be used as a \"fingerprint\" for identification).\n\nThe specifications of identity of a food substance are an important component of the safety assessment and are used to establish safe conditions of use in food. Changes in the physical and chemical properties of a food substance can influence its technical effect in food or food contact materials and can influence the nutritional or toxicological properties of the food substance.\n\nIn sections III.B through III.D of this document, we explain how the identity of a substance (particularly its physical and chemical properties) can affect the technical effect, self-limiting levels of use, and dietary exposure and the level at which a food substance exhibits adverse effects.\n\nTechnical Effect\n\nSubstances may be added to food to accomplish a variety of technical effects in food. Examples of food substances that may be added for physical or technical functional effects include antimicrobial agents, humectants, flavoring agents, surface-active agents, stabilizers and thickeners (21 CFR 170.3(o)).\n\nThe physical and chemical properties of a food substance generally impact its technical effect and significant changes to a food substance's technical or functional effect may result in conditions of use that are not authorized. For example:\n\nIf an isolated or chemically processed fiber is intended for use as a replacement for part of the flour used in baked goods, its ability to swell due to high water absorption or to bind physiologically important ions may be relevant to determining the appropriate level of the fiber in baked goods.\n\nThe color of a color additive may change simply by reducing the particle size of the substance, as seen with gold particles which display a range of colors dependent on the size of the particle (Ref. [12]).\n\nSelf-limiting Levels of Use\n\nWhen a substance is added to food above its technologically self-limiting level, the food may become unpalatable, unappealing or otherwise unfit for consumption. For example, the taste associated with many chemically defined flavoring substances limits the levels at which the flavoring substances can be used. A self-limiting level of use can help ensure safety if, for example, any known toxic effects would only occur at levels that exceed the self-limiting use levels.\n\nThe physical and chemical properties of a food substance can affect the level at which it becomes self-limiting from a food technology or palatability perspective. For example, the self-limiting level of a flavoring agent may be affected by the particle size of the flavoring agent - e.g., if smaller particles are absorbed more quickly than larger particles. Significant alterations to physical or chemical properties of a food substance and any associated changes to the self-limiting use levels are important considerations in the safety assessment and in establishing the conditions of safe use of the food substance.\n\nDietary Exposure and Safety Studies\n\nStudies conducted in vitro or in vivo can identify adverse effects that could occur from acute exposure to, or chronic consumption of, a food substance. In most cases, such effects are dose-dependent. A key determinant in the safety evaluation of a food substance is the relation of its probable human intake to the level at which adverse effects are observed in toxicological studies (Ref. [9]). In many cases, determining the amount of a food substance that can safely be consumed involves application of a \"safety factor\" (as described in 21 CFR 170.3(i)) to a \"no observed adverse effect level\" for the most sensitive indicator of an observed adverse effect.\n\n2.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAlterations in the physical and chemical properties of a food substance can affect its bioavailability through altered absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the substance in the body. Such changes in the substance's biological interactions can affect the level at which toxic effects may occur (Ref. [13]). For example, the particle size of a food substance may affect its ability to be absorbed by the body or to migrate from food packaging into food. In such circumstances, safety studies conducted with a food substance manufactured as relatively large particles may have little relevance to the safety of that food substance when manufactured in a substantially smaller particle size.\n\nFDA generally recommends that manufacturers and end users follow our toxicology guidance, (see, e.g., Refs. [10] and [11]) when preparing their comprehensive toxicology profile. There are instances where a compound, or a class of compounds, has known toxicological endpoints that are not specifically addressed through the standard guidelines, e.g., the potential risk of alloinmunization8 posed by exposure to human proteins. In such cases, it is the responsibility of manufacturers and end users to develop appropriate protocols to address particular safety issues. Historically, such persons have been advised that they should consult with FDA on the safety issues related to the intended use.\n\nFootnote 8: Alloinmunization is an immune response generated in an individual or strain of one species by an alloantigen from a different individual or strain of the same species (Dorland\u2019s Online Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers. \u00a9 2007; available online at: http://encyclopedia.thefredictionary.com/alloimmunization)\n\nAppendix E Manufacturing Processes, including Nanotechnology\n\nThe manufacturing process of a food substance is considered for the purposes of safety assessment only insofar as it may affect the properties and safety of the finished product. As explained below, the manufacturing process may affect the identity of the food substance or its conditions of use. The manufacturing process may also affect the purity of a food substance, such as the amounts of impurities and contaminants in the food substance. For example:\n\nAn enzyme preparation that is manufactured from an animal source and contains the enzyme chymosin as its principal enzyme component (SS 184.1685(a)(1)) is chemically different from an enzyme preparation that is manufactured from a microbial source and contains the enzyme chymosin as its principal enzyme component (SS 184.1685(a)(2)). Although they both contain an enzyme component that catalyzes the same chemical reaction, they also contain distinctly different constituents derived from the production organism and constituents derived from the manufacturing process (e.g., components of the fermentation media or the residues of processing aids).\n\nIncluding an activated carbon treatment of fish oil can reduce levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that can be present in fish oil obtained from fish from a natural marine environment (Ref. [14]).\n\nThe catalyst for the production of a food contact polymer may affect the chemical identity or the amounts of residual contaminants that may migrate from the polymer to food.\n\nThe particle size distribution of a food substance may affect its ability to be absorbed by the body or to migrate from food packaging into food (Ref. [13]).\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nNanotechnology is an emerging technology that can be used in food manufacturing. The application of nanotechnology may result in product attributes that differ from those of conventionally-manufactured products, and thus may merit particular examination. However, FDA does not categorically judge all products containing nanomaterials or otherwise involving application of nanotechnology as intrinsically benign or harmful. Rather, for nanotechnology-derived and conventionally-manufactured food products alike, FDA considers the characteristics of the finished product and the safety of its intended use.\n\nFDA issued a guidance document to industry on the agency's considerations related to nanotechnology applications in FDA-regulated products (Ref. [2]). Consistent with the agency's guidance, in this document, we are providing guidance to industry on the potential impact of significant manufacturing process changes involving nanotechnology on the safety and regulatory status of food substances. FDA's consideration of nanotechnology applications in food substances in this document is consistent with the agency's guidance (Ref. [2]) and with the broader federal guidance on regulatory oversight of emerging technologies (Ref. [15]) and nanotechnology (Ref. [16]).\n\nIn this section, we discuss nanotechnology -- in particular, intentional alterations of particle size distribution on the nanometer scale -- to address circumstances in which there is a manufacturing change to a food substance already used in food. FDA considers food manufacturing processes that involve nanotechnology in the same manner as any other food manufacturing technology. Although traditionally manufactured food substances can sometimes include particles with size distributions that extend into the nanometer range, recent advances in technology can allow the intentional production of food substances with particle size distributions more fully in the nanometer range, resulting in new properties not seen in traditionally manufactured food substances.\n--------------------\nContext title: Assessing the Effects of Significant Manufacturing Process Changes, Including Emerging Technologies, on the Safety and Regulatory Status of Food Ingredients and Food Contact Substances, Including Food Ingredients that Are Color Additives\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.903985977172852", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements , What do you mean by \"recognized antioxidant activity\"?\n--------------------\nContext: Another example of a statement in food labeling that may be false or misleading could be the statement \"None of the ingredients in this food is genetically engineered\" on a food where some of the ingredients are incapable of being produced through genetic engineering (e.g., salt). It may be necessary to carefully qualify the statement where modern biotechnology is not used to produce a particular ingredient or type of food.\n\nFurther, a statement may be false or misleading if, when considered in the context of the entire label or labeling (as noted in Section IIIA. above), it suggests or implies that a food product or ingredient is safer, more nutritious, or otherwise has different attributes than other comparable foods because the food was not genetically engineered. For example, the labeling of a bag of specific type of frozen vegetables that states that they were \"not produced through modern biotechnology\" could be misleading if, in addition to this statement, the labeling contains statements or vignettes that suggest or imply that, as a result of not being produced through modern biotechnology, such vegetables are safer, more nutritious, or have different attributes than other foods solely because the food was not produced using modern biotechnology.\n\nCommon or usual nameSection 403(i)(2) of the FD&C Act requires that, for a food that is made from two or more ingredients, each ingredient must be declared on the food label by its common or usual name. Accordingly, FDA regulations require (among other things) that ingredients required to be declared on the label or labeling of a food must be listed on either the principal display panel or information panel of the food subject to certain exceptions. 21 CFR 101.4(a)(1). Further, FDA regulations provide that ingredients required to be declared on the label or in the labeling of food must be listed by their common or usual name and without intervening material. See 21 CFR 101.2(e), 101.4(a)(1), 501.2(e) and 501.4(a). In general, FDA has interpreted a term used to describe an ingredient in the list required by FDA's regulations (typically in an ingredient statement) that is not part of the ingredient's common or usual name (e.g., \"pure,\" \"fresh,\" \"certified non-GE\") to be intervening material that violates FDAregulations (Ref. [16]). However, elsewhere on the label, other than in the ingredient statement, terms that are not a part of the common or usual name of an ingredient may accompany the name of the ingredient provided it is done in a manner that is truthful and not misleading and otherwise in accordance with the FD&C Act and applicable regulations. For example, the principal display panel on a bottle of soybean oil made from soybeans that were not bioengineered could say \"Made from certified non-GE soybeans,\" provided that (1) the text does not obscure information required to be on the principal display panel, such as the statement of identity; and (2) the ingredient (i.e., soybean oil) is listed in the ingredient list by its common or usual name and without intervening material. This statement could also appear on the information panel of the food product, provided that it does not appear in the ingredient list. In this example, for the ingredient soybean oil, the ingredient list may only list such ingredient as \"soybean oil\" as that term is the common or usual name for the ingredient.\n\n5 Statements about foods that are derived from genetically engineered plants\n\nAs explained in section 3.A above, food labeling may be misleading if, among other things, it makes or suggests certain representations, or if it fails to disclose facts that are material in light of representations made or suggested in the labeling, or material with respect to the consequences that may result from use of the food to which the labeling relates under the conditions of use prescribed in the labeling, or under such conditions of use as are customary or usual. In general, an accurate statement about whether a food was produced using bioengineering is one that provides information in a context that refers to bioengineering technology. Examples of such statements include:\n\n\"Genetically engineered\" or \"This product contains cornmeal from corn that was produced using modern biotechnology.\"\n\n\"Some of our growers plant soybean seeds that were developed through modern biotechnology to be drought tolerant.\"\n\nThese kinds of simple statements that a food was developed using bioengineering are not likely to be misleading.\n\nMulti-ingredient foodsWhere a benefit from a bioengineered ingredient in a multi-ingredient food is voluntarily described in the labeling for a food, the statement should be worded so that it addresses the ingredient and not the food as a whole; for example, \"This product contains laurate canola from bioengineered canola that may be used as an alternative to palm kernel oil.\" In addition, the amount of the bioengineered ingredient in the food may be relevant to determine whether the statement is misleading. This would apply especially where the bioengineered difference is characterized as a functional improvement. For example, it may be misleading to make a statement about a functionally improved ingredient (e.g., in this example, that the oil may be used as an alternative to palm kernel oil in high temperature cooking applications) in a food that contains only a small amount of the ingredient, if such statement implies that the food'soverall functional quality is significantly improved when the amount of the ingredient present is not sufficient to confer the properties indicated. Research suggests that the presence of a statement on a product label regarding a specific benefit associated with the product can create a more favorable overall perception of a product. (Refs. [17, 18, and 19]).\n\nThe labeling requirements that apply to foods generally, some of which are described above, also apply to food produced using genetic engineering. Foods from some genetically engineered crops, like food from non-genetically engineered crops, may have characteristics that are materially different from those of comparable foods. Such foods would require labeling under existing provisions to disclose such material differences.\n\nBased on sections 403(a)(1), 201(n), and 403(i) of the FD&C Act:\n\nIf a food derived from genetically engineered plants is significantly different from its traditional counterpart such that the common or usual name or existing statement of identity no longer adequately identifies or describes the new food, the name of the new food must be changed to a term that accurately identifies or describes the new food. For example, if oil from a genetically engineered plant has a significantly different amount of lauric acid such that the fatty acid composition of the oil is significantly changed compared to that of conventionally produced oil, the standard name for the oil no longer adequately identifies or describes the nature of the oil or its characterizing properties, particularly since oils are distinguished by their fatty acid profiles. See 21 CFR 102.5, 502.5. Under sections 403(a)(1), 201(n), and 403(i) of the FD&C Act, a word or phrase like \"laurate\" is required to appear as part of the new name to appropriately identify or describe the food. See also 21 CFR 101.3, 501.3.\n\nIf a genetically engineered food or one of its constituents differs from its traditional counterpart regarding how the food is used or the consequences of its use (for example, if the genetically engineered food behaves differently than its traditional counterpart when used in a comparable way, such as in frying or canning), a statement must be made on the label to describe the difference(s) in use or the consequence(s) of its use. Therefore, in this case, under sections 403(a)(1) and 201(n) of the FD&C Act, the fact that such food behaves differently when canned or fried must be disclosed in the labeling for the food.\n\nIf a food derived from genetically engineered plants has a significantly different nutritional property compared to its traditional counterpart, its label must describe such difference. For example, if (hypothetically) a vegetable has been bioengineered to contain vitamin B12, the fact that the vegetable contains vitamin B12 and that non-bioengineered versions of that vegetable do not contain vitamin B12 is material. Thus, in this instance, under sections 403(a)(1) and 201(n) of the FD&C Act, the fact that the vegetable contains vitamin B12 would have to be disclosed in the labeling for the vegetable.\n\nIf a food derived from genetically engineered plants contains an allergen that consumers would not expect to be present in the food based on the name of the food, the presence of that allergen must be disclosed on the label. The presence of such allergen in the food would be material information. Under sections 403(a)(1), 201(n) and potentially, in some circumstances, section 403(w) of the FD&C Act, the labeling for such food is required to disclose the presence of such allergen.\n\n4 Substantiation of labeling statements\n\nA manufacturer that claims that a food product or its ingredients, including foods such as raw agricultural commodities, is bioengineered or is not bioengineered should substantiate that the claim is truthful and not misleading. We note that when selecting a method to substantiate a claim, a manufacturer should consider the specifics of the claim as one method might substantiate one kind of claim, but not another. The following methods may be used to substantiate that a claim, within this context, is truthful and not misleading:\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Voluntary Labeling Indicating Whether Foods Have or Have Not Been Derived from Genetically Engineered Plants \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -8.020598411560059"], "Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: The BPCI Act also includes, among other provisions:\n\nA 12-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which approval of a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be made effective (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nA 4-year exclusivity period from the date of first licensure of certain reference products, during which a 351(k) application referencing that product may not be submitted (see section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act)\n\nAn exclusivity period for the first biological product determined to be interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use, during which a second or subsequent biological product may not be determined interchangeable with that reference product (see section 351(k)(6) of the PHS Act)\n\nProcedures for identifying and resolving patent disputes involving applications submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act (see section 351(l) of the PHS Act)\n\nTransition Period for Certain Biological Products\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act provides that a marketing application for a \"biological product\" (that previously would have been submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act) must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, subject to the following exception during the transition period described below:\n\nAn application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2020, if the biological product is in a product class4 for which a biological product in such product class was approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act not later than March 23, 2010. Footnote 4: FDA has interpreted the statutory term \u201cproduct class\u201d for purposes of determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period (see guidance for industry Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act, at Q&A II.2).\n\nHowever, an application for a biological product may not be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act if there is another biological product approved under section 351(a) of the PHS Act that could be a \"reference product\"5 if such application were submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 5: The term \u201creference product\u201d means the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in an application submitted under section 351(k) (see section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act (a \"deemed Biologics License Application (BLA)\") on March 23, 2020.\n\nIII Interpretation of the \"deemed to be a license\" provision\n\nFDA's Interpretation of Section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act is directed primarily to the submission of an application for a biological product during the transition period ending on March 23, 2020.6 Though the transition scheme described in section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act culminates with the \"deemed to be a license\" provision in section 7002(e)(4), the statute is silent regarding the process foraccomplishing the transition of approved new drug applications (NDAs) to deemed BLAs, or the implications of the deeming process on pending applications.7\n\nFootnote 7: In other legislation, Congress has described the implications of transitioning applications for drug products from one statutory scheme to another, while also describing the process that would be used in effecting the transition. See, e.g., section 107(c) of the Drug Amendments of 1962 (Pub. L. 87-781) (providing that all NDAs effective on the day immediately preceding the date of enactment of the Drug Amendments of 1962 shall be deemed approved as of the enactment date, and that the provision for withdrawal of approval of an application for lack of effectiveness generally would not apply to such deemed NDAs for a period of 2 years after the enactment date); section 125 of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) (Pub. L. 105-115) (repealing section 507 of the FD&C Act and providing that an application for an antibiotic drug approved under section 507 of the FD&C Act on the day before enactment of FDAMA shall, on and after the date of enactment, be considered to be an NDA submitted and filed under section 505(b) and approved under section 505(c) or an ANDA filed and approved under 505(j)).\n\n2.1.1 FDA Interprets section 7002(e)(4) to be Limited to Approved Applications\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act provides:\n\nAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under such section 351 [of the PHS Act] on the date that is 10 years after the date of enactment of [the BPCI Act].\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) is explicitly limited to an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act. Moreover, while this provision explicitly provides that an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act shall be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date, the statute does not provide a means for deeming an approved NDA to be an approved BLA prior to, or after, the transition date.8 Finally, section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act does not provide a basis for the Agency to treat approved NDAs for biological products as both NDAs and BLAs after such applications are deemed to be BLAs. Therefore, FDA interprets section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act to plainly mean that, on March 23, 2020, only approved NDAs will be deemed to be BLAs. After March 23, 2020, the Agency will not approve any application submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act for a biological product subject to the transition provision that is pending or tentatively approved.9({}^{,})10 As a corollary, applications for biological products approvedunder section 505 of the FD&C Act will no longer exist as NDAs and will be replaced by approved BLAs under section 351 of the PHS Act.11\n\nFootnote 11: See FDA\u2019s draft guidance for industry The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act: Questions and Answers (Transition Q&A Draft Guidance) for additional information, including whether an approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act will be deemed a license for the biological product under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act and administrative issues associated with the transition (including BLA numbers and user fee questions). When final, that guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nAccordingly, an original 505(b)(2) application (including a resubmission) for a biological product that relies, at least in part, on FDA's finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug that is a biological product will receive a complete response if the application is pending at the end of the day (11:59 pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) on Friday, March 20, 2020, because the NDA for the listed drug relied upon will no longer exist at midnight on Monday, March 23, 2020.\n\nFDA intends to assist applicants who may be affected by section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act, where feasible and appropriate. For example, during the review of a BLA submitted after the transition date under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act for a proposed biological product that was previously submitted, but not approved, in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act, FDA intends to consider any previously conducted scientific review by the Agency of such previous application under the FD&C Act, to the extent that such review is relevant to, and consistent with, applicable requirements of section 351 of the PHS Act.\n\nAn application generally includes all amendments and supplements to the application.13 We recognize that there may be one or more supplements submitted to an approved NDA for a biological product before March 23, 2020, that is pending on March 23, 2020. Such supplements may include a prior approval supplement (e.g., an efficacy supplement,14 a labeling supplement,\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.891510963439941", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: B.: Applications for Biological Products Submitted Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act on or Before the Transition Date\n\nQ5.: When will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the application number that will be used for its deemed BLA?\n\nFDA intends to assign the same application number used for the approved NDA to the deemed BLA on the March 23, 2020, transition date. As a hypothetical example, NDA 012345 would be deemed to be BLA 012345 on the transition date. This approach is intended to minimize burden on holders of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act who are preparing submissions to their applications around the transition date and to facilitate the administrative conversion of any pending supplements to such applications (see the Transition Policy Final Guidance for additional information regarding such supplements). The use of a predictable application numbering system for deemed BLAs is also expected to facilitate preparation and submission of a 351(k) BLA for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeableproduct that references a product licensed in a deemed 351(a) BLA as a reference product. The FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date will include the product's BLA number.\n\nWhen will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the license number that will apply to its deemed BLA(s)?\n\nThe FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be an approved BLA will include the U.S. license number assigned to the application holder. Each establishment that is listed in the approved NDA as currently involved in the manufacture of the biological product on the transition date will be considered a licensed establishment on that date (see section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act; see also section 7002(e)(4)(B)(iii) of the BPCI Act). FDA does not intend to conduct pre-license inspections of manufacturers of the transitioning biological products because FDA interprets section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act to mean that an approved application under the FD&C Act for the biological product will be \"deemed to be a license\" on the transition date by operation of the statute.12 Moreover, the establishments will have been inspected in connection with the previously approved NDAs under the FD&C Act (see Q16 below for information on establishment inspections related to certain supplements to a deemed 351(a) BLA).\n\nFootnote 12: See also footnote 10 in the response to Q2.\n\nFDA issues only one U.S. license number per BLA holder, regardless of the number of licensed biological products manufactured by that BLA holder under separate BLAs. Accordingly, if an NDA holder is also a BLA holder and has been assigned a U.S. license number for another biological product, the NDA holder will not be issued a different U.S. license number when its approved NDA for a biological product is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date.\n\nSection 351(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the PHS Act requires that each package of a biological product is plainly marked with, among other things, the applicable license number of the manufacturer of the biological product in order for the biological product to be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce. To minimize possible disruption in the distribution of biological products in the United States and to minimize burden on holders of deemed BLAs, FDA intends to adopt a compliance policy for the labeling of biological products that are the subject of deemed BLAs (see Q14 and section IV below for additional information on the compliance policy for labeling of biological products in deemed BLAs).\n\nWill an approved NDA for a biological product be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA or a 351(k) BLA?\n\nFDA interprets the transition provision, along with the applicable provisions of the FD&C Act and the PHS Act, to mean that an approved NDA, including an application submitted through the pathway described by section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act (505(b)(2) application), will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA on the transition date.\n\nSection 7002(e) of the BPCI Act is directed primarily to the submission of an application for a biological product during the transition period ending on March 23, 2020, and does not explicitly state whether an approved NDA will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA or a 351(k) BLA. The Agency's interpretation that an approved NDA submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA is based on the shared requirement that both types of applications contain full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (or, for a 351(a) BLA, safety, purity, and potency). We expect that the measures FDA has taken to minimize differences in the review and approval of products in marketing applications submitted under section 351(a) of the PHS Act and section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act will facilitate implementation of the statutory provision under which an approved NDA will be deemed to be a BLA.\n\nThe Agency's interpretation that an approved 505(b)(2) application will be deemed to be a 351(a) BLA reflects the shared requirement that both types of applications contain full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (or, for a 351(a) BLA, safety, purity, and potency).13 This approach also reflects the Agency's view that it is more appropriate to regulate a biological product approved through the 505(b)(2) pathway that may be intended to differ in certain respects (e.g., different strength, dosage form, or route of administration or approved conditions of use) from a previously approved product under the statutory and regulatory framework for 351(a) BLAs, as such differences are not permitted under the statutory framework for 351(k) BLAs. Moreover, FDA's approval of a 505(b)(2) application reflects the Agency's evaluation of the data against a different statutory standard than a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: A 505(b)(2) application is an NDA that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use (e.g., FDA\u2019s finding of safety and/or effectiveness for a listed drug or published literature).\n\nWill an approved NDA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing be deemed to be a BLA?*\n\nSection 7002(e)(4) states that an \"approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the [FD&C Act]\" will be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date. Accordingly, FDA interprets the statute to mean that an approved NDA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing, but for which FDA has not withdrawn approval of the application, will be deemed to be a BLA on the transition date. The holder of an NDA for a discontinued product must comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for its application before the transition date, and after its application is deemed to be a BLA. These requirements include, for example, postmarketing reporting of adverse drug experiences and, if appropriate, the submission of proposed revisions to product labeling. If the holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product that has been discontinued from marketing seeks to reintroduce the product to the market, the BLA holder should consult with the relevant FDA review division before submitting a supplement to the deemed BLA, to discuss any data and information that may be needed.\n\nHow will the transition on March 23, 2020, affect the annual program fee for an approved NDA for a biological product?\n\nUnder section 736(a)(2) of the FD&C Act, a person named as the applicant in a human drug application (which refers to an NDA or a 351(a) BLA, subject to applicable statutory exceptions) is assessed an annual prescription drug program fee. A prescription drug program fee is assessed each fiscal year for each prescription drug product identified in a human drug application approved as of October 1 of the fiscal year, with certain exceptions described by statute. For more information about the prescription drug program fee, consult the FDA guidance for industry Assessing User Fees Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017 (May 2018).\n\nIn general, sponsors of biological products for which annual prescription drug program fees are assessed prior to the transition, and that are deemed to be licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act on the transition date, will continue to be assessed prescription drug program fees for such products after the transition, subject to applicable statutory requirements and exceptions.\n\nIf an applicant withdraws an NDA that is tentatively approved on or before the transition date, or otherwise pending with FDA, and submits an application for the same product under section 351(a) of the PHS Act, will an additional PDUFA application fee be assessed?\n\nAn applicant (or the applicant's licensee, assignee, or successor) will not be charged a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) application fee for the submission of an application under section 351(a) of the PHS Act if all of the following circumstances are satisfied (see section 736(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act):\n\nThe applicant previously submitted an NDA for the same product and paid the associated PDUFA application fee for the NDA.\n\nThe NDA was accepted for filing. (Note that an NDA for a biological product will not be accepted for filing after the transition date.)\n\nThe NDA was not approved14 or was withdrawn (without a waiver).

For example, a pending \"stand-alone\" efficacy supplement to a \"stand-alone\" NDA16 (e.g., a supplement intended to address a post-approval requirement or post-approval commitment) will be administratively converted to a pending efficacy supplement to the corresponding deemed 351(a) BLA on the transition date and reviewed under applicable standards for 351(a) BLAs. Similarly, a pending CBE supplement to an application submitted under the FD&C Act will be administratively converted to a pending CBE supplement to the deemed BLA on the transition date, irrespective of whether the change described in the CBE supplement has been implemented before or after the transition date. The Agency also intends to maintain the same goal date, where applicable, for completion of its review of such supplements.\n\nFootnote 15: See generally 21 CFR 314.70.\n\nFootnote 16: See section III.B.1 of this guidance for information on \u201cstand-alone\u201d NDAs. There may be additional considerations for a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a stand-alone NDA and a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a 505(b)(2) application.\n\nii.2.2 Removal of Biological Products from the Orange Book on March 23, 2020\n\nFDA intends to remove biological products that have been approved in NDAs from FDA's Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book)17 on March 23, 2020, based on the Agency's position that these products are no longer \"listed drugs\" and such NDAs may not be relied upon by a 505(b)(2) applicant (or ANDA applicant) for approval. After March 23, 2020, FDA will not approve any NDA (or ANDA), including those that are pending or tentatively approved, for a biological product.\n\nFootnote 17: Biological products approved in NDAs that are deemed to be BLAs will be listed in FDA\u2019s Lists of Licensed Biological Products with Reference Product Exclusivity and Biosimilarity or Interchangeability Evaluations (the Purple Book) on or shortly after the March 23, 2020, transition date.\n\nMoreover, with the exception of orphan drug exclusivity and pediatric exclusivity, the exclusivity provisions of the FD&C Act serve to limit the submission or approval of applications under section 505 of the FD&C Act, but not under section 351 of the PHS Act. Section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act provides that no applications for biological products may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act after the transition date. Accordingly, on March 23, 2020, any unexpired period of exclusivity associated with an approved NDA for a biological product subject to section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act (e.g., 5-year exclusivity or 3-year exclusivity) would\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]\n\ndeemed to be licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. Reference product exclusivity recognizes the fact that the sponsor of an eligible reference product generated (and submitted for review) the data and information required to obtain a license under section 351(a) of the PHS Act and limits competition from biosimilar and interchangeable products for a limited period of time. The biological products that will be deemed to have BLAs on the transition date, however, have already obtained marketing approval under a different statutory authority. Allowing such products to obtain a separate 12-year period of reference product exclusivity would inappropriately impede biosimilar or interchangeable product competition in several product classes.\n\nRecognizing these principles, FDA interprets section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act together with section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act such that section 351(k)(7)(A)-(B) of the PHS Act applies only to products that have undergone review and licensing under section 351(a), and not to biological products that will be deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act on the transition date. At the same time, FDA interprets the limitations on eligibility for reference product exclusivity in section 351(k)(7)(C) of the PHS Act to apply to any \"reference product,\" without regard to whether such product was \"first licensed under subsection (a)\" or instead deemed to be a license under section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act. Nothing in the BPCI Act suggests that Congress intended holders of deemed BLAs to be able to circumvent the statutory limitations on eligibility for a 12-year period of reference product exclusivity through subsequent submissions simply because the previous reference product was deemed to be licensed under section 7002(e). Therefore, FDA interprets section 351(k)(7) of the PHS Act together with section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act such that section 351(k)(7)(C) will operate to bar supplements to deemed BLAs and, where applicable, subsequent BLAs from being eligible for their own periods of reference product exclusivity.\n\nRecommendations for Sponsors of Proposed Protein Products Intended for Submission in an Application Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act\n\nSponsors of development programs for proposed protein products should evaluate whether a planned submission under section 505 of the FD&C Act would allow adequate time for approval of the application prior to March 23, 2020, considering, among other things, whether the submission may require a second cycle of review and, for certain types of applications, whether unexpired patents or exclusivity may delay final approval. FDA's recommendations for sponsors are based on whether a \"stand-alone\" or abbreviated development program is planned.\n\n1.1 \"Stand-Alone\" New Drug Applications\n--------------------\nContext title: Interpretation of the \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.346613883972168", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: Sponsors may request advice from FDA regarding proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product development programs that identify a biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as the intended reference product. A sponsor will be able to submit a 351(k) BLA that references the biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as its reference product after the NDA for the biological product is deemed to be a 351(a) BLA.\n\nQ19. Can an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a \"deemed\" 351(a) BLA seek a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act to another biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act?\n\nAny person (including an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a \"deemed\" 351(a) BLA) may seek to establish the biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product to another biological product licensed or deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. FDA intends to work with applicants to address scientific or regulatory issues that may arise in the context of these 351(k) development programs, and to provide additional procedural information. Any sponsor or applicant may contact the relevant review division within the Office of New Drugs in FDA's CDER to request advice on a 351(k) development program.\n\nD. Transition of Biological Products from the Orange Book to the Purple Book\n\nQ20. Will any therapeutic equivalence evaluations for biological products previously listed in the Orange Book be reflected in the Purple Book?\n\nNo, the Purple Book does not include therapeutic equivalence evaluations as reflected in the Orange Book. The Purple Book identifies, among other things, whether a biological product licensed under section 351(k) of the PHS Act has been determined by FDA to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed biological reference product.\n\nE. Designation of Proper Name\n\nQ21. What will be the proper name for a biological product that has be en approved in an NDA that is deemed to be a BLA?\n\nThe (proper\\,name) is the nonproprietary name designated by FDA in the license for a biological product licensed under the PHS Act (section 351(a)(1)(B)(i) of the PHS Act and 21 CFR 600.3(k)). FDA does not intend to apply the nonproprietary naming convention (in which the proper name is composed of a core name and a four-letter distinguishing suffix) to biological products that are the subject of an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act that is deemed to be a license under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. This is consistent with what was previously communicated in FDA's draft guidance for industry (Nonproprietary\\,Naming) of Biological Products: Update_ (March 2019).20\n\nIV Compliance Policy for Requirements Related to Labeling\n\nTo minimize possible disruption to the distribution of biological products that are the subject of the transition provision and to minimize burden on holders of deemed BLAs, FDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA with labeling that does not conform to certain labeling requirements for BLAs until March 23, 2025, provided that all other applicable labeling requirements are met. The compliance policy set forth in this guidance would apply only as described below.\n\nFDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA and that are introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce between March 23, 2020, and March 22, 2025, where the package is not marked with:\n\nThe proper name of the biological product contained in the package (provided that the current packaging is plainly marked with the established name of the biological product);\n\nThe name and address of the manufacturer of the biological product (provided that the current packaging is plainly marked with the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor as required in 21 CFR 201.1);\n\nThe applicable license number; or\n\nOther information required by 21 CFR 610.60 through 610.64, for which there is not a corresponding requirement under 21 CFR 201.1.\n\nFDA also generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA and that are introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce between March 23, 2020, and March 22, 2025, where the content and format of labeling required by 21 CFR 201.56, 201.57, 201.80, and/or 208.20, as applicable, does not include the following information:\n\nThe proper name of the biological product, including any appropriate descriptors (provided that the current labeling uses the established name of the biological product);\n\nThe name and address of the manufacturer of the biological product (provided that the current labeling includes the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor as required by 21 CFR 201.1);\n\nThe applicable license number; or\n\nFor biological products with approved labeling in the format described by 21 CFR 201.56(d) and 201.57 (PLR format), the year of Initial U.S. Approval of the new biological product (provided that the current labeling includes the year of Initial U.S. Approval of the new molecular entity).\n\nFDA notes that the timing of BLA-specific revisions to the prescribing information should be coordinated with the corresponding revisions to the container labels, carton labeling, and any FDA-approved patient labeling for the biological product to ensure consistency among the different types of product labeling.\n\nIf the holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product has an administratively converted supplement that includes proposed revisions to product labeling or submits a supplement that includes proposed revisions to product labeling before March 22, 2025 (i.e., the end of the compliance period), and the required BLA-specific labeling revisions to container labels, carton labeling, and prescribing information referenced in this guidance have not already been addressed, such revisions would need to be addressed before the supplement could be approved (see, e.g., 21 CFR 610.60). A changes-being-effected (CBE-0) supplement may be submitted prior to submission of a prior approval supplement that includes the BLA-specific labeling revisions. However, the prior approval supplement would need to be approved before or concurrent with approval of the CBE-0 supplement. Under this approach, holders of deemed BLAs may coordinate BLA-specific labeling updates with their plans for other proposed revisions to product labeling.\n\nAfter FDA approval of a supplement for the BLA-specific labeling revisions, FDA understands that application holders may need to wait to implement these labeling revisions until their next printing of the labels and labeling. Accordingly, to enable such application holders to exhaust existing inventory, FDA generally does not intend to object to the labeling of biological products that are marketed under a deemed BLA where FDA has already approved a supplement that includes the BLA-specific labeling revisions but the labels and labeling do not include the BLA-specific labeling revisions prior to March 22, 2025.\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.9985764026641846", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 9: In the Federal Register of February 21, 2020, FDA issued a final rule that amends its regulation that defines \u201cbiological product\u201d to incorporate changes made by the BPCI Act and the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, and to provide its interpretation of the statutory term \u201cprotein\u201d (85 FR 10057). This rule is effective on March 23, 2020.\n\nThe prescription or over-the-counter status of a biological product with an approved application under section 505 of the FD&C Act will not change when the approved application is deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act on March 23, 2020.\n\nExamples of biological products approved under the FD&C Act are listed in the Appendix to the Transition Policy Final Guidance. To enhance transparency and facilitate planning for the transition date, FDA is posting on the FDA website (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidance-compliance-regulatory-information/deemed-be-license-provision-bpci-act) a preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act (as of December 31, 2019) that will be affected by the transition provision, and FDA intends to periodically update the list before the transition date (see Q3 below). Shortly after the transition date, FDA intends to post a final list of approved applications under the FD&C Act that have been deemed to be licenses under the PHS Act.\n\nDoes the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product on FDA's list need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA?\n\nFDA interprets the transition provision to mean that the holder of an approved application for a biological product does not need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA. Specifically, FDA interprets section 7002(e)(4)(A) of the BPCI Act to mean that an approved application under the FD&C Act for a biological product will be \"deemed to be a license\" for the biological product on the transition date by operation of the statute.10\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe statute is silent regarding the process for accomplishing the transition of approved NDAs to deemed BLAs. FDA intends to send a letter to such application holders on March 23, 2020, advising that the approved NDA was deemed to be a BLA at 1200 am Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on March 23, 2020, and no longer exists as an NDA. (If the NDA is approved on March 23, 2020, the approved NDA will be deemed to be a BLA immediately after approval.) In the letter, FDA also will notify the application holder that it has been issued a license that authorizes the application holder to manufacture the biological product within the meaning of section 351 of the PHS Act and to introduce the biological product or deliver the biological product for introduction into interstate commerce (see Q6 below). The letter also will remind application holders that they will need to ensure that the listing information for the biological product is updated in FDA's electronic Drug Registration and Listing System (eDRLS) between March 23, 2020, and June 30, 2020, to reflect a change in the prefix of the application number (from \"NDA\" to \"BLA\") (see 21 CFR 207.57(b)). FDA notes that the deeming of an approved NDA to be a BLA and the corresponding update of the eDRLS listing information for the biological product to change the prefix for the application number will not result in the need for a new National Drug Code (NDC) number with a new product code. Accordingly, in the absence of other changes made by the application holder that would require a new NDC number, biological products approved under the FD&C Act will retain their current NDC number after the NDA is deemed to be a BLA. This will provide consistency for manufacturers and for the databases and pharmacy systems that track drug and biological products.\n\nTo enhance transparency and facilitate planning for the transition date, FDA is posting on the FDA website a preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act (as of December 31, 2019) that will be affected by the transition provision, and FDA intends to periodically update the list before the transition date (see Q1 above). Biological products approved in NDAs that are deemed to be BLAs will be removed from FDA's Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book) on March 23, 2020, and will be listed in FDA's Lists of Licensed Biological Products with Reference Product Exclusivity and Biosimilarity or Interchangeability Evaluations (the Purple Book) and the CDER Therapeutic Biologics Products list on or shortly after the March 23, 2020, transition date.\n\n2.2 Who should an application holder contact if it believes that its approved NDA should or should not be included on FDA's preliminary list of approved applications for biological products that will be affected by the transition provision?\n\nIf an application holder or other person reviews, on FDA's website, the preliminary list of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act that will be affected by the transition provision and believes that an approved NDA should be added to the list or should not be included on the list, the application holder or other person should submit a comment to the public docket established for this guidance and the preliminary list. For information on submission of comments to the public docket, please refer to the Federal Register (FR) Notice of Availability of this guidance.\n\nQ4.: How will FDA notify the sponsor of a proposed biological product who seeks to obtain approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act that the planned application would need to be approved under the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2020?\n\nFDA provided notice to sponsors of proposed biological products intended for submission in an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act that they will be affected by the transition provision through the Biosimilars Q&A Guidance, as well as through FDA's draft guidance for industry Implementation of the \"Deemed to be a License\" Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (March 2016) (Transition Policy Draft Guidance) and the Biosimilars Q&A Draft Guidance. In the Biosimilars Q&A Guidance, FDA initially stated its interpretation of the statutory term \"protein\" in the amended definition of \"biological product\" (see Q1 above and Biological Product Definition Final Rule). In the Transition Policy Final Guidance, FDA provides recommendations to sponsors of proposed protein products intended for submission in an application that may not receive final approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act on or before March 23, 2020, to facilitate alignment of product development plans with FDA's interpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act.11 FDA recommends that sponsors of development programs for proposed protein products evaluate whether a planned submission under section 505 of the FD&C Act would allow adequate time for approval of the application prior to March 23, 2020, considering, among other things, whether the submission may require a second cycle of review and, for certain types of applications, whether unexpired patents or exclusivity may delay final approval. If a sponsor is unsure whether its proposed product may receive approval under the FD&C Act by March 23, 2020, the sponsor should consider submitting a BLA under section 351(a) or 351(k) of the PHS Act instead. For additional information, please see the Transition Policy Final Guidance.\n\nFootnote 11: After FDA issued the Transition Policy Final Guidance, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 was enacted. Section 607 of this Act amended section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act to provide that FDA will continue to review an application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act after March 23, 2020, so long as that application was submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act, is filed not later than March 23, 2019, and is not approved as of March 23, 2020. If such an application is approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act before October 1, 2022, it will be deemed to be a license for the biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act upon approval (see section 7002(e)(4)(B)(iii) and (vi) of the BPCI Act).\n\nB.: Applications for Biological Products Submitted Under Section 505 of the FD&C Act on or Before the Transition Date\n\nQ5.: When will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the application number that will be used for its deemed BLA?\n\nFDA intends to assign the same application number used for the approved NDA to the deemed BLA on the March 23, 2020, transition date. As a hypothetical example, NDA 012345 would be deemed to be BLA 012345 on the transition date. This approach is intended to minimize burden on holders of approved applications for biological products under the FD&C Act who are preparing submissions to their applications around the transition date and to facilitate the administrative conversion of any pending supplements to such applications (see the Transition Policy Final Guidance for additional information regarding such supplements). The use of a predictable application numbering system for deemed BLAs is also expected to facilitate preparation and submission of a 351(k) BLA for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeableproduct that references a product licensed in a deemed 351(a) BLA as a reference product. The FDA letter that notifies the application holder that its approved NDA is deemed to be a BLA on the transition date will include the product's BLA number.\n\nWhen will the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product receive the license number that will apply to its deemed BLA(s)?\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.641688346862793", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , What is the definition of \"product class\" for determining whether an application for a biological product may be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act during the transition period?\n--------------------\nContext: An application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act must contain, among other things, information demonstrating that \"the biological product is biosimilar to a reference product\" based upon data derived from:11\n\nFootnote 10: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(3) of the PHS Act.\n\nAnalytical studies that demonstrate that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;\n\nAnimal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and\n\nA clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product.\n\nThe Agency has the discretion to determine that an element described above is unnecessary in a 351(k) application.12 FDA advises sponsors intending to develop biosimilar products to meet with FDA to present their product development plans and establish a schedule of milestones that will serve as landmarks for future discussions with the Agency. FDA anticipates that early discussions with FDA about product development plans and about approaches to providing adequate scientific justifications will facilitate biosimilar development.13\n\nFootnote 12: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nFootnote 13: See the draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants for a detailed discussion. When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\n4 Complexities of Protein Products\n\nA sponsor should consider the complexities of protein products and related scientific issues when designing a development program to support a demonstration of biosimilarity.\n\nNature of Protein Products and Related Scientific Considerations\n\nUnlike small molecule drugs, whose structure can usually be completely defined and entirely reproduced, proteins are typically more complex and are unlikely to be shown to be structurally identical to a reference product. Many potential differences in protein structure can arise. Because even minor structural differences (including certain changes in glycosylation patterns) can significantly affect a protein's safety and/or effectiveness, it is important to evaluate these differences.\n\nIn general, proteins can differ in at least three ways: (1) primary amino acid sequence; (2) modification to amino acids, such as sugar moieties (glycosylation) or other side chains; and (3) higher order structure (protein folding and protein-protein interactions). Modifications to amino acids may lead to heterogeneity and can be difficult to control. Protein modifications and higher order structure can be affected by formulation and environmental conditions, including light, temperature, moisture, packaging materials, container closure systems, and delivery device materials. Additionally, process- as well as product-related impurities may increase the likelihood and/or the severity of an immune response to a protein product, and certain excipients may limit the ability to characterize the protein product.\n\nAdvances in analytical sciences enable some protein products to be extensively characterized with respect to their physicochemical and biological properties, such as higher order structures and functional characteristics. These analytical methodologies have increasingly improved the ability to identify and characterize not only the drug substance of a protein product but also excipients and product- and process-related impurities.\n\nDespite such significant improvements in analytical techniques, however, current analytical methodology may not be able to detect all relevant structural and functional differences between two protein products. In addition, there may be incomplete understanding of the relationship between a product's structural attributes and its clinical performance. Thus, as set forth in the PHS Act, data derived from analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies are required to demonstrate biosimilarity unless FDA determines an element unnecessary.14\n\nFootnote 14: Section 7002(a)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, adding section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the PHS Act.\n\nManufacturing Process Considerations\n\nDifferent manufacturing processes may alter a protein product in a way that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the product. For example, differences in biological systems used to manufacture a protein product may cause different posttranslational modifications, which in turn may affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the product. Thus, when the manufacturing process for a marketed protein product is changed, the application holder must assess the effects of the change and demonstrate--through appropriate analytical testing, functional assays, and/or in some cases animal and/or clinical studies--that the change does not have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they relate to the safety oreffectiveness of the product.15 The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process (ICH Q5E) describes scientific principles in the comparability assessment for manufacturing changes.\n\nFootnote 15: See 21 CFR 601.12 and 21 CFR 314.70 for regulatory requirements for changes (including manufacturing changes) made to a licensed biologics license application (BLA) and an approved NDA, respectively.\n\nDemonstrating that a proposed product is biosimilar to a reference product typically will be more complex than assessing the comparability of a product before and after manufacturing changes made by the same manufacturer. This is because a manufacturer that modifies its own manufacturing process has extensive knowledge and information about the product and the existing process, including established controls and acceptance parameters. By contrast, the manufacturer of a proposed product is likely to have a different manufacturing process (e.g., different cell line, raw materials, equipment, processes, process controls, and acceptance criteria) from that of the reference product and no direct knowledge of the manufacturing process for the reference product. Therefore, even though some of the scientific principles described in ICH Q5E may also apply in the demonstration of biosimilarity, in general, FDA anticipates that more data and information will be needed to establish biosimilarity than would be needed to establish that a manufacturer's post-manufacturing change product is comparable to the pre-manufacturing change product.\n\nV U.S.-LICENSED Reference Product and Other Comparators\n\nTo obtain licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act, a sponsor must demonstrate that the proposed product is biosimilar to a single reference product that previously has been licensed by FDA.16 In general, a sponsor needs to provide information to demonstrate biosimilarity based on data directly comparing the proposed product with the reference product. As a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical PK study and, if appropriate, at least one PD study, intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity for purposes of section 351(k) of the PHS Act must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed. However, a sponsor may seek to use data derived from animal or clinical studies comparing a proposed product with a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act. In such a case, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.17 Sponsors are encouraged to discuss with FDA during the development program their plans to provide an adequate scientific justification and bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product. A final decision about the adequacy of such justification and bridge will be made by FDA during review of the 351(k) application.\n\nFootnote 16: Sections 7002(a)(2) and (b)(3) of the Affordable Care Act, adding sections 351(k), 351(i)(2), and 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act.\n\nVI Approaches to developing and assessing evidence to demonstrate biosimilarity\n\nFDA recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to develop the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity. FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence provided by a sponsor when the Agency evaluates the sponsor's demonstration of biosimilarity, consistent with a longstanding Agency approach to evaluating scientific evidence.18\n\nFootnote 18: See footnote 4.\n\nUsing a Stepwise Approach to Demonstrate Biosimilarity\n--------------------\nContext title: Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.6147274374961853"], "Upon checking the information in Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances , What information should be included in the application about a starting material that is a commercially available chemical?

(5.14)\n--------------------\nContext: 5.2.1 Justification of Starting Material Selection for Synthetic Drug Substances\n\nThe applicant should provide a justification for how each proposed starting material is appropriate in light of the general principles for the selection of starting materials outlined above in Section 5.1.1. This can include information on:\n\nThe ability of analytical procedures to detect impurities in the starting material;\n\nThe fate and purge of those impurities and their derivatives in subsequent processing steps;\n\nHow the proposed specification for each starting material will contribute to the control strategy.\n\nThe applicant should provide, as part of the justification, a flow diagram outlining the current synthetic route(s) for the manufacture of the drug substance, with the proposed starting materials clearly indicated. Changes to the starting material specification and to the synthetic route from the starting material to final drug substance are subject to regional, post-approval change requirements. In addition, regional requirements concerning starting material suppliers may also be applicable.\n\nAn applicant generally need not justify the use of a commercially available chemical as a starting material. A commercially available chemical is usually one that is sold as a commodity in a pre-existing, non-pharmaceutical market in addition to its proposed use as starting material. Chemicals produced by custom syntheses are not considered to be commercially available. If a chemical from a custom synthesis is proposed as a starting material, it should be justified in accordance with the general principles for the selection of starting materials outlined above in Section 5.1.1.\n\nIn some instances, additional purification steps by the drug substance manufacturer might be called for to ensure the consistent quality of a commercially available starting material. In these instances, the additional purification steps should be included as part of the description of the drug substance manufacturing process.

The ICH Q11 general principles apply to processes where multiple chemical transformations are performed without isolation of intermediates. In the absence of such isolations (e.g., crystallization, or starting materials and precipitation), design of the manufacturing process (e.g., kinetics) and/or unit operations (e.g., extraction, distillation, the use of scavenging agents) should be in place to adequately control and/or purge impurities and be described in the application.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11_Q&As_Q&As\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.529789447784424", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances , What information should be included in the application about a starting material that is a commercially available chemical? (5.14)\n--------------------\nContext: The full bibliographic reference should be cited close to where the reference appears in the text of the application (e.g., in a footnote or section endnote). The full text of the literature cited (e.g., journal article) should be included in the Literature References section, except when otherwise indicated. For example, as previously stated in this guidance, monographs from an official compendium need not be included in the application.\n\nAttachment 1:\n\nStarting materials for synthetic drug substances\n\nA starting material for a synthetic drug substance is a chemical compound of defined molecular structure that contributes to the structure of the drug substance. A reagent that contributes a minor structural element to the drug substance (e.g., hydride ion) is not considered to fall within the meaning of starting material. A synthesis can be linear or convergent. Therefore, an applicant should propose one or more starting materials to mark the beginning of each synthesis branch.\n\nThe description of the manufacturing process in an application begins with the starting material or materials. Appropriate GMPs, as defined in ICH Q7A, can apply to the manufacturing steps after introduction of the starting material. Because there is limited FDA oversight of the manufacturing of the starting material, the starting material should be selected and controlled so that the risk from future changes in the quality of the starting material affecting the identity, quality, purity, or potency of the drug substance is minimized. A proposed starting material should be chosen so that sufficient information will be available to the FDA on the manufacturing process to evaluate the safety and quality of the drug substance. A drug substance that is used to synthesize another drug substance is not an appropriate candidate for designation as a starting material. An applicant can discuss the selection of proposed starting materials prior to submitting its application.\n\nThe extent of information that should be submitted in the application to justify the proposed starting materials depends on whether or not the chemical has a significant nonpharmaceutical market. FDA will consider the justification provided to support a proposed starting material as well as other relevant information such as the proposed starting material specification and controls on manufacturing steps downstream from the proposed starting material when evaluating the appropriateness of a proposal to designate a chemical as a starting material.\n\nStarting Materials with a Significant Nonpharmaceutical Market\n\nA significant nonpharmaceutical market is considered to exist if the quantity of the chemical needed for the production of the drug substance represents only a small fraction of the chemical's total market. This is true whether the chemical is made by the drug substance manufacturer for its own use or is obtained from another firm. If the quality of the chemical made for the nonpharmaceutical market is insufficient to ensure consistent quality of the drug substance and the chemical is further processed to produce material of higher quality, the purification operations should be described as part of the manufacturing process of the drug substance (S.2.2). See section II of this attachment for recommendations on the documentation that should be provided for these starting materials.\n\nStarting Materials without a Significant Nonpharmaceutical Market\n\nA chemical should not be considered to have a significant nonpharmaceutical market if (1) the only market for the chemical is to manufacture drug substance; (2) the drug substancemanufacturer had to synthesize the chemical, or arrange for another firm to synthesize it, to produce drug substance for clinical trials; (3) an existing manufacturer of the chemical had to scale up its process to produce sufficient quantities of drug substance for clinical trials; or (4) the method of manufacture was provided by the drug substance manufacturer to the other firms that manufacture the chemical. See sections I and II of this attachment, respectively, for selection principles and recommendations on the documentation that should be provided for these starting materials.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #169 Drug Substance Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.9811495542526245", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Upon checking the information in Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances , What information should be included in the application about a starting material that is a commercially available chemical? (5.14)\n--------------------\nContext: A starting material is incorporated as a significant structural fragment into the structure of the drug substance. \"Significant structural fragment\" in this context is intended to distinguish starting materials from reagents, solvents, or other raw materials. Commonly available chemicals used to create salts, esters or other simple derivatives should be considered reagents.\n\nAll the general principles above should be considered in selecting Starting Material(s), rather than strictly applying each general principle in isolation (see Example 4, Section 10.4).\n\n5.1.2 Selection of Starting Materials for Semi-Synthetic Drug Substances\n\nFor purposes of this guideline, a semi-synthetic drug substance is one in which the structural constituents have been introduced by a combination of chemical synthesis and elements of biological origin (e.g., obtained from fermentation or by extraction from botanical material). In some cases, it might be appropriate for the applicant to describe the manufacturing process starting from the source material (microorganism or botanical material). However, if it can be demonstrated that one of the isolated intermediates in the synthetic process complies with the principles outlined above for the selection of starting materials for synthetic drug substances, that isolated intermediate can be proposed as the starting material. The applicant should specifically evaluate whether it is possible to analytically characterise the proposed starting material, including its impurity profile, and whether the fermentation or botanical material and extraction process impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. Risks from microbial and other contamination should also be addressed.\n\n5.1.3 Selection of Source and Starting Materials for Biotechnological/Biological Drug Substances\n\nCell banks are the starting point for manufacture of biotechnological drug substances and some biological drug substances. In some regions, these are referred to as source materials; in others, starting materials. Guidance is contained in ICH Q5A, Q5B, and Q5D.\n\nSubmission of Information for Starting Material or Source Material\n\nApplicants should identify all proposed starting materials or source materials and provide appropriate specifications. Proposed starting materials for synthetic and semi-synthetic drug substances should be justified.\n\n5.2.1 Justification of Starting Material Selection for Synthetic Drug Substances\n\nThe applicant should provide a justification for how each proposed starting material is appropriate in light of the general principles for the selection of starting materials outlined above in Section 5.1.1. This can include information on:\n\nThe ability of analytical procedures to detect impurities in the starting material;\n\nThe fate and purge of those impurities and their derivatives in subsequent processing steps;\n\nHow the proposed specification for each starting material will contribute to the control strategy.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q11 Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.6071710586547852"], "As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: B.   Intermediates (4.2)\n\nDuring manufacture of biotechnological/biological products, the quality and control of certain intermediates may be critical to the production of the final product. In general, the manufacturer should identify intermediates and generate in-house data and process limits that assure their stability within the bounds of the developed process. Although the use of pilot-plant scale data is permissible, the manufacturer should establish the suitability of such data using the manufacturing scale process.\n\nC.   Drug Product (Final Container Product) (4.3)\n\nStability information should be provided on at least three batches of final container product representative of that which will be used at manufacturing scale. Where possible, batches of final container product included in stability testing should be derived from different batches of bulk material. A minimum of 6 months data at the time of submission should be submitted in cases where storage periods greater than 6 months are requested. For drug products with storage periods of less than 6 months, the minimum amount of stability data in the initial submission should be determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nProduct expiration dating should be based upon the actual data submitted in support of the application. Because dating is based upon the real-time/real-temperature data submitted for review, continuing updates of initial stability data should occur during the review and evaluation process. The quality of the final container product placed on stability studies should be representative of the quality of the material used in the preclinical and clinical studies. Data from pilot-plant scale batches of drug product may be provided at the time the dossier is submitted to the regulatory agencies with a commitment to place the first three manufacturing scale batches into the long-term stability program after approval.\n\nWhere pilot-plant scale batches were submitted to establish the dating for a product and, in the event that the product produced at manufacturing scale does not meet those long-term stability specifications throughout the dating period or is not representative of the material used in preclinical and clinical studies, the applicant should notify the appropriate regulatory authorities to determine a suitable course of action.\n\nD. Sample Selection (4.4)\n\nWhere one product is distributed in batches differing in fill volume (e.g., 1 milliliter (mL), 2 mL, or 10 mL), unitage (e.g., 10 units, 20 units, or 50 units), or mass (e.g., 1 milligram (mg), 2 mg, or 5 mg), samples to be entered into the stability program may be selected on the basis of a matrix system and/or by bracketing.\n\nMatrizing, i.e., the statistical design of a stability study in which different fractions of samples are tested at different sampling points, should only be applied when appropriate documentation is provided that confirms that the stability of the samples tested represents the stability of all samples. The differences in the samples for the same drug product should be identified as, for example, covering different batches, different strengths, different sizes of the same closure, and, possibly, in some cases, different container/closure systems. Matrixing should not be applied to samples with differences that may affect stability, such as different strengths and different containers/closures, where it cannot be confirmed that the products respond similarly under storage conditions.\n\nWhere the same strength and exact container/closure system is used for three or more fill contents, the manufacturer may elect to place only the smallest and largest container size into the stability program, i.e., bracketing. The design of a protocol that incorporates bracketing assumes that the stability of the intermediate condition samples are represented by those at the extremes. In certain cases, data may be needed to demonstrate that all samples are properly represented by data collected for the extremes.\n\nV. Stability-indicating Profile (5)\n\nOn the whole, there is no single stability-indicating assay or parameter that profiles the stability characteristics of a biotechnological/biological product. Consequently, the manufacturer should propose a stability-indicating profile that provides assurance that changes in the identity, purity, and potency of the product will be detected.\n\nAt the time of submission, applicants should have validated the methods that comprise the stability-indicating profile, and the data should be available for review. The determination of which tests should be included will be product-specific. The items emphasized in the following subsections are not intended to be all-inclusive, but represent product characteristics that should typically be documented to demonstrate product stability adequately.\n\nA. Protocol (5.1)The dossier accompanying the application for marketing authorization should include a detailed protocol for the assessment of the stability of both drug substance and drug product in support of the proposed storage conditions and expiration dating periods. The protocol should include all necessary information that demonstrates the stability of the biotechnological/biological product throughout the proposed expiration dating period including, for example, well-defined specifications and test intervals. The statistical methods that should be used are described in the tripartite guideline on stability.\n\nPotency (5.2)\n\nWhen the intended use of a product is linked to a definable and measurable biological activity, testing for potency should be part of the stability studies. For the purpose of stability testing of the products described in this guideline, potency is the specific ability or capacity of a product to achieve its intended effect. It is based on the measurement of some attribute of the product and is determined by a suitable in vivo or in vitro quantitative method. In general, potencies of biotechnological/biological products tested by different laboratories can be compared in a meaningful way only if expressed in relation to that of an appropriate reference material. For that purpose, a reference material calibrated directly or indirectly against the corresponding national or international reference material should be included in the assay.\n\nPotency studies should be performed at appropriate intervals as defined in the stability protocol and the results should be reported in units of biological activity calibrated, whenever possible, against nationally or internationally recognized standards. Where no national or international reference standards exist, the assay results may be reported in in-house derived units using a characterized reference material.\n\nIn some biotechnological/biological products, potency is dependent upon the conjugation of the active ingredient(s) to a second moiety or binding to an adjuvant. Dissociation of the active ingredient(s) from the carrier used in conjugates or adjuvants should be examined in real-time/real-temperature studies (including conditions encountered during shipment). The assessment of the stability of such products may be difficult because, in some cases, in vitro tests for biological activity and physicochemical characterization are impractical or provide inaccurate results. Appropriate strategies (e.g., testing the product before conjugation/binding, assessing the release of the active compound from the second moiety, in vivo assays) or the use of an appropriate surrogate test should be considered to overcome the inadequacies of in vitro testing.\n\nPurity and Molecular Characterization (5.3)\n\nFor the purpose of stability testing of the products described in this guideline, purity is a relative term. Because of the effect of glycosylation, deamidation, or other heterogeneities, the absolute purity of a biotechnological/biological product is extremely difficult to determine. Thus, the purity of a biotechnological/biological product should be typically assessed by more than one method and the purity value derived is\n\nmethod-dependent. For the purpose of stability testing, tests for purity should focus on methods for determination of degradation products.\n\nThe degree of purity, as well as the individual and total amounts of degradation products of the biotechnological/biological product entered into the stability studies, should be reported and documented whenever possible. Limits of acceptable degradation should be derived from the analytical profiles of batches of the drug substance and drug product used in the preclinical and clinical studies.\n\nThe use of relevant physicochemical, biochemical, and immunochemical analytical methodologies should permit a comprehensive characterization of the drug substance and/or drug product (e.g., molecular size, charge, hydrophobicity) and the accurate detection of degradation changes that may result from deamidation, oxidation, sulfoxidation, aggregation, or fragmentation during storage. As examples, methods that may contribute to this include electrophoresis (SDS09Page, immunoelectrophoresis, Western blot, isoelectrofocusing), high-resolution chromatography (e.g., reversed-phase chromatography, gel filtration, ion exchange, affinity chromatography), and peptide mapping.\n\nWherever significant qualitative or quantitative changes indicative of degradation product formation are detected during long-term, accelerated, and/or stress stability studies, consideration should be given to potential hazards and to the need for characterization and quantification of degradation products within the long-term stability program. Acceptable limits should be proposed and justified, taking into account the levels observed in material used in preclinical and clinical studies.\n--------------------\nContext title: Q5C Quality of Biotechnological Products- Stability Testing of Biotechnological:Biological Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.5634818077087402", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: Failure to meet the acceptance criteria for the PQIT will be handled (e.g., Investigation, batch rejection decision) in the same manner as a failure of a test included in the drug substance specification and the PQIT will be performed on each subsequent batch until the failure is resolved.\n\nAny investigation will assess the effect on all batches produced, in particular, the batches between the last batch tested with a passing test result and the batch that failed.\n\nIf the result of the investigation confirms a batch failure or is inconclusive, a changes-being-effected supplement will be submitted to include the test in the drug substance specification.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA list of PQITs, with associated acceptance criteria and reference to analytical procedures, should be included in S.4.1 of the application. The protocol and commitment should also be included in S.4.1. Data and justification to support the designation of a PQIT should be included in S.4.4 and S.4.5, as appropriate. The recommendations on CMC information that should be provided in S.4.2 and S.4.3 also apply to PQITs.\n\nIt is recognized that only limited data may be available at the time of submission of an application. Therefore, this concept would generally be implemented postapproval once sufficient data are available and after approval of a prior approval supplement.\n\nAnalytical Procedures (S.4.2)\n\nThe analytical procedures used for testing a drug substance should be provided. Recommendations on the content and format of analytical procedures submitted in NADAs and ANADAs will be provided in a forthcoming FDA guidance on Analytical Procedures and Methods Validation: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Documentation. Information should be provided for all analytical procedures listed in the specification (S.4.1). The following additional guidance is provided on submitting analytical procedure information from published sources.\n\nAnalytical Procedures from an Official Compendium or Another FDA- Recognized Standard Reference If the analytical procedure used is in the current revision of an official compendium or another FDA-recognized standard reference (e.g., AOAC International Book of Methods) and the referenced analytical procedure is not modified, the analytical procedure need not be provided. A specific citation to the analytical procedure is sufficient.18 When a general chapter or monograph included in an official compendium or other FDA recognized standard reference allows for the use of more than one analytical procedure for a test, the specific analytical procedure that will be used should be cited here (S.4.2) and in the specification (S.4.1). For example, when using USP (<)921(>)Water Determination, the method should be specified (e.g., Method Ia). If an analytical procedure is based on one of these sources but has been modified, the analytical procedure should be provided. Footnote 18: The current revision of an analytical procedure in a compendial monograph or general chapter should be used. Therefore, when citing an official compendium, the version of the compendium should not be included in the citation. For example, the USP should be cited rather than USP 25.\n\nAnalytical Procedures from Other Published Sources Analytical procedures from any other published source (e.g., another country's compendium, scientific journal) should be provided.\n\nValidation of Analytical Procedures (S.4.3)\n\nAnalytical validation information, including experimental data (e.g., representative chromatograms with peak identification), for the analytical procedures used for testing the drug substance should be provided. Validation of an analytical procedure is the process of demonstrating that analytical procedures are suitable for their intended use. This information should be provided for all analytical procedures listed in the specification (S.4.1). Stability data (S.7.3), including data from stress studies, should be used to support the validation of the analytical procedures.\n\nBatch Analyses (S.4.4)\n\nA description of relevant batches and results of batch analyses should be provided. Batch analysis reports (e.g., certificates of analysis (COAs)) should be provided for all drug substance batches used for (1) nonclinical studies (i.e., pharmacology and/or toxicology), (2) drug product clinical efficacy and safety, bioavailability, bioequivalence, and (3) primary stability studies. Batch analysis data should also be provided for any other batches that are being used to establish or justify specifications and/or evaluate consistency in manufacturing. The batch analysis reports and collated batch analyses data should include a description of the batches. This information can be presented (1) with the batch data as space permits or (2) in a separate table with only the batch identity being included with the batch data. The description should include:\n\nBatch identity (i.e., batch number) and size\n\nDate of manufacture\n\nSite of manufacture\n\nManufacturing process (e.g., synthetic route A), where applicable\n\nUse of batch (e.g., bioavailability, stability)\n\nTest results should be expressed numerically or qualitatively (e.g., white crystalline powder), as appropriate. We discourage the use of terms such as conforms or meets specification.\n\nBatch Analysis Reports\n\nThe batch analysis reports should include results from all tests performed on the batch, including tests that are not part of the proposed specification. References to analytical procedures should be provided.\n\nA summary of any changes in the analytical procedures should be provided if the analytical procedures (1) changed over the course of generating the batch analyses data and/or (2) are different from the analytical procedure included in S.4.2. The summary should identify when an analytical procedure changed, the differences between theanalytical procedures, and the impact of the differences with respect to the data being reported. For example, a summary could state that the solvent system for the assay was changed on December 15, 1999, from A to B so that impurities Y and Z that co-elute using System A could be quantitated separately. If there are significant differences in the analytical procedures (e.g., different fundamental principles such as titration and HPLC), a more detailed summary describing the changes may be warranted.\n\n4.4.2 Collated Batch Analyses Data\n\nPresentation of results from all batches for a particular test in tabular and/or graphical format is often helpful in justifying the acceptance criteria. Collated batch analyses data are not warranted for all tests. However, collated data should be provided for assay and impurities (e.g., degradation products, residual solvents) and should be considered for other tests such as water content.\n\nAdditional guidance is available in:\n\nVICH: GL10(R) Impurities in New Veterinary Drug Substances\n\nVICH: GL18 Impurities: Residual Solvents in New Veterinary Medicinal Products, Active Substances, and Excipients\n\nAppendix E Justification of Specification (S.4.5)\n\nJustification for the proposed drug substance specifications should be provided. The justification should be based on relevant development data (S.2.6), information on impurities (S.3.2), standards in an official compendium, batch analyses data (S.4.1), and stability studies (S.7), toxicology data, and any other relevant data. The discussion in this section should unify data and information that are located in other sections of the application, either by reference or in summary. When justifying the specification, an applicant should consider data from (1) drug substance batches used in evaluating clinical efficacy and safety, bioavailability, and/or bioequivalence, (2) primary stability batches, and (3) relevant development and process validation batches, when available. If multiple drug substance manufacturing sites or processes are planned, it can be valuable to consider data from these sites and processes in establishing the tests and acceptance criteria. This is particularly true when there is limited initial experience with the manufacture of the drug substance at any particular site or by any particular method. Justification for an in-process test that is used in lieu of a drug substance test should be included in S.2.4.\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #169 Drug Substance Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.0640909671783447", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.2.2 Testing for poolability of batches\n\n2.2.1 Analysis of covariance\n\nBefore pooling the data from several batches to estimate a retest period or shelf life, a preliminary statistical test should be performed to determine whether the regression lines from different batches have a common slope and a common time-zero intercept. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) can be employed, where time is considered the covariate, to test the differences in slopes and intercepts of the regression lines among batches. Each of these tests should be conducted using a significance level of 0.25 to compensate for the expected low power of the design due to the relatively limited sample size in a typical formal stability study.\n\nIf the test rejects the hypothesis of equality of slopes (i.e., if there is a significant difference in slopes among batches), it is not considered appropriate to combine the data from all batches. The retest periods or shelf lives for individual batches in the stability study can be estimated by applying the approach described in Appendix section B.1 using individual intercepts and individual slopes and the pooled mean square error calculated from all batches. The shortest estimate among the batches should be chosen as the retest period or shelf life for all batches.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the test rejects the hypothesis of equality of intercepts but fails to reject that the slopes are equal (i.e., if there is a significant difference in intercepts but no significant difference in slopes among the batches), the data can be combined for the purpose of estimating the common slope. The retest periods or shelf lives for individual batches in the stability study should be estimated by applying the approach described in Appendix section B.1, using the common slope and individual intercepts. The shortest estimate among the batches should be chosen as the retest period or shelf life for all batches.\n\nIf the tests for equality of slopes and equality of intercepts do not result in rejection at a level of significance of 0.25 (i.e., if there is no significant difference in slope and intercepts among the batches), the data from all batches can be combined. A single retest period or shelf life can be estimated from the combined data by using the approach described in Appendix section B.1 and applied to all batches. The estimated retest period or shelf life from the combined data is usually longer than that from individual batches because the width of the confidence limit(s) for the mean will become narrower as the amount of data increases when batches are combined.\n\nThe pooling tests described above should be performed in a proper order such that the slope terms are tested before the intercept terms. The most reduced model (i.e., individual slopes, common slope with individual intercepts, or common slope with common intercept, as appropriate) can be selected for retest period or shelf life estimation.\n\n4.2.2 Other methods\n\nStatistical procedures (Ruberg and Stegeman 1991; Ruberg and Hsu 1992; Shao and Chow 1994; Murphy and Weisman 1990; Yoshioka et al. 1997) other than those described above can be used in retest period or shelf life estimation. For example, if it is possible to decide in advance the acceptable difference in slope or in mean retest period or shelf life among batches, an appropriate procedure for assessing the equivalence in slope or in mean retest period or shelf life can be used to determine the data poolability. However, such a procedure should be prospectively defined, evaluated, and justified and, where appropriate, discussed with the regulatory authority. A simulation study can be useful, if applicable, to demonstrate that the statistical properties of the alternative procedure selected are appropriate (Chen et al. 1997).\n\nData Analysis for Multi-Factor, Full-Design Studies\n\nThe stability of the drug product could differ to a certain degree among different factor combinations in a multi-factor, full-design study. Two approaches can be considered when analyzing such data.\n\nThe objective of the first approach is to determine whether the data from all factor combinations support the proposed shelf life.\n\nThe objective of the second approach, testing for poolability, is to determine whether the data from different factor combinations can be combined for an overall estimate of a single shelf life.\n\nb.3.1 Evaluating whether all factor combinations support the proposed shelf life\n\nThe objective of this approach is to evaluate whether the estimated shelf lives from all factor combinations are longer than the one proposed. A statistical model that includes all appropriate factors and factor combinations should be constructed as described in Appendix section B.3.2.2.1, and the shelf life should be estimated for each level of each factor and factor combination.\n\nIf all shelf lives estimated by the original model are longer than the proposed shelf life, further model building is considered unnecessary and the proposed shelf life will generally be appropriate as long as the guidance in sections II.D and II.E is followed. If one or more of the estimated shelf lives fall short of the proposed shelf life, model building as described in Appendix section B.3.2.2.1 can be employed. However, it is considered unnecessary to identify the final model before evaluating whether the data support the proposed shelf life. Shelf lives can be estimated at each stage of the model building process, and if all shelf lives at any stage are longer than the one proposed, further attempts to reduce the model are considered unnecessary.\n\nThis approach can simplify the data analysis of a complicated multi-factor stability study compared to the data analysis described in Appendix section B.3.2.2.1.\n\nb.3.2 Testing for poolability\n\nThe stability data from different combinations of factors should not be combined unless supported by statistical tests for poolability.\n\nb.3.2.1 Testing for poolability of batch factor only\n\nIf each factor combination is considered separately, the stability data can be tested for poolability of batches only, and the shelf life for each non-batch factor combination can be estimated separately by applying the procedure described in Appendix section B.2. For example, for a drug product available in two strengths and four container sizes, eight sets of data from the 2x4 strength-size combinations can be analyzed and eight separate shelf lives should be estimated accordingly. If a single shelf life is desired, the shortest estimated shelf life among all factor combinations should become the shelf life for the product. However, this approach does not take advantage of the available data from all factor combinations, thus generally resulting in shorter shelf lives than does the approach in Appendix section B.3.2.2.\n\nb.3.2.2 Testing for poolability of all factors and factor combinations\n\nIf the stability data are tested for poolability of all factors and factor combinations and the results show that the data can be combined, a single shelf life longer than that estimated based on individual factor combinations is generally obtainable. The shelf life is longer because the width of the confidence limit(s) for the mean will become narrower as the amount of data increases when different factors, such as batches, strengths, container sizes, and/or fills, are combined.\n\nb.3.2.2 Analysis of covariance\n\nAnalysis of covariance can be employed to test the difference in slopes and intercepts of the regression lines among factors and factor combinations (Chen et al. 1997; Fairweather et al. 1995). The purpose of the procedure is to determine whether data from multiple factor combinations can be combined for the estimation of a single shelf life.\n\nThe full statistical model should include the intercept and slope terms of all main effects and interaction effects and a term reflecting the random error of measurement. If it can be justified that the higher order interactions are very small, there is generally no need to include these terms in the model. In cases where the analytical results at the initial time point are obtained from the finished dosage form prior to its packaging, the container intercept term can be excluded from the full model because the results are common among the different container sizes and/or fills.\n\nThe tests for poolability should be specified to determine whether there are statistically significant differences among factors and factor combinations. Generally, the pooling tests should be performed in a proper order such that the slope terms are tested before the intercept terms and the interaction effects are tested before the main effects. For example, the tests can start with the slope and then the intercept terms of the highest order interaction, and proceed to the slope and then the intercept terms of the simple main effects. The most reduced model, obtained when all remaining terms are found to be statistically significant, can be used to estimate the shelf lives.\n\nAll tests should be conducted using appropriate levels of significance. It is recommended that a significance level of 0.25 be used for batch-related terms, and a significance level of 0.05 be used for non-batch-related terms. If the tests for poolability show that the data from different factor combinations can be combined, the shelf life can be estimated according to the procedure described in Appendix section B.1 using the combined data.\n\nIf the tests for poolability show that the data from certain factors or factor combinations should not be combined, either of two alternatives can be applied: (1) a separate shelf life can be estimated for each level of the factors and of the factor combinations remaining in the model; or (2) a single shelf life can be estimated based on the shortest estimated shelf life among all levels of factors and factor combinations remaining in the model.\n\nb.3.2.2 Other methods\n--------------------\nContext title: Q1E Evaluation of Stability Data \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.083776473999023", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: In the case of a clearly identified laboratory error, the retest results would substitute for the original test result. However, all original data must be retained (SS 211.180) and an explanation should be recorded.9 This record should be initialed and dated by the involved persons and include a discussion of the error and supervisory comments. (See section III of this guidance for more details on a laboratory investigation.)\n\nFootnote 9: See \u00a7S211.68 and 211.188. See also FDA guidance for industry Data Integrity and Compliance With Drug CGMP(December 2018).\n\nIf no laboratory or calculation errors are identified in the first test, there is no scientific basis for invalidating initial OOS results in favor of passing retest results. All test results, both passing and suspect, should be reported10 and considered in batch release decisions.\n\nFootnote 10: In other words, all data are reported in, for example, quality control reports, batch records, Certificates of Analysis, in accordance with \u00a7S211.188 and 211.192.\n\n2.2.2 Resampling\n\nWhile retesting refers to analysis of the original, homogenous sample material, resampling involves analyzing a specimen from any additional units collected as part of the original sampling procedure or from a new sample collected from the batch, should that be necessary.\n\nThe original sample from a batch should be sufficiently large to accommodate additional testing in the event an OOS result is obtained. In some situations, however, it may be appropriate to collect a new sample from the batch. Control mechanisms for examination of additional specimens should be in accordance with predetermined procedures and sampling strategies (SS 211.165(c)).\n\nWhen all data have been evaluated, an investigation might conclude that the original sample was prepared improperly and was therefore not representative of the batch quality (SS 211.160(b)(3)). Improper sample preparation might be indicated, for example, by widely varied results obtained from several aliquots of an original composite (after determining there was no error in the performance of the analysis). Resampling should be performed by the same qualified, validated methods that were used for the initial sample. However, if the investigation determines that the initial sampling method was inherently inadequate, a new accurate sampling method must be developed, documented, and reviewed and approved by the QU (SSSS 211.160 and 211.165(c)).\n\nReporting Testing Results\n\nPractices used in reporting and interpretation of test results include (1) averaging and (2) outlier tests.\n\nAveraging There are both appropriate and inappropriate uses of averaging test data during original testing and during an OOS investigation: a. Appropriate uses Averaging data can be a valid approach, but its use depends upon the sample and its purpose. For example, in an optical rotation test, several discrete measurements are averaged to determine the optical rotation for a sample, and this average is reported as the test result. If the sample can be assumed to be homogeneous, (i.e., an individual sample preparation designed to be homogenous), using averages can provide a more accurate result. In the case of microbiological assays, the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) prefers the use of averages because of the innate variability of the biological test system. It should be noted that a test might consist of a specific number of replicates to arrive at a result. For instance, an HPLC assay result may be determined by averaging the peak responses from a number of consecutive, replicate injections from the same preparation (usually 2 or 3). The assay result would be calculated using the peak response average. This determination is considered one test and one result.11 This is a distinct difference from the analysis of different portions from a lot, intended to determine variability within the lot, and from multiple full analyses of the same homogenous sample. The use of replicates to arrive at a single reportable12 result, and the specific number of replicates used, should be specified in the written, test method approved by the QU. Acceptance limits for variability among the replicates should also be specified in the method. Unexpected variation in replicate determinations should trigger remedial action as required by SS 211.160(b)(4). If acceptance limits for replicate variability are not met, the test results should not be used. In some cases, a series of complete tests (full run-throughs of the test procedure), such as assays, are part of the test method. It may be appropriate to specify in the test method that the average of these multiple assays is considered one test and represents one reportable result. In this case, limits on acceptable variability among the individual assay results should be based on the known variability of the method and should also be specified in the test methodology.13 A set of assay results not meeting these limits should not be used. These appropriate uses of averaging test data should be used during an OOS investigation only if they were used during the original testing that produced the OOS result. b. Inappropriate uses Reliance on averaging has the disadvantage of hiding variability among individual test results. For this reason, all individual test results should normally be reported as separate values. Where averaging of separate tests is appropriately specified by the test method, a single averaged result can be reported as the final test result. In some cases, a statistical treatment of the variability of results is reported. For example, in a test for dosage form content uniformity, the standard deviation (or relative standard deviation) is reported with the individual unit dose test results. Averaging can also conceal variations in different portions of a batch, or within a sample. For example, the use of averages is inappropriate when performing powder blend/mixture uniformity or dosage form content uniformity determinations. In these cases, testing is intended to measure variability within the product, and individual results provide the information for such an evaluation. In the context of additional testing performed during an OOS investigation, averaging the result(s) of the original test that prompted the investigation with additional retest or resample results obtained during the OOS investigation is not appropriate because it hides variability among the individual results. Relying on averages of such data can be particularly misleading when some of the results are OOS and others are within specifications. It is critical that the laboratory provide all individual results for evaluation and consideration by the QU, which is responsible for approving or rejecting, e.g., drug products, in-process materials (SS 211.22). For example, in an assay of a finished drug with a specification of 90 to 110 percent, an initial OOS result of 89 percent followed by additional retest results of 90 percent and 91 percent would produce an average of 90 percent. While this average would meet specification,14 the additional test results also tend to confirm the original OOS result. However, in another situation with the same specifications, an initial OOS result of 80 percent followed by additional test results of 85 percent and 105 percent would also produce an average of 90 percent but present a much different picture. These results do not confirm the original OOS result but show high variability and may not be reliable. In both examples, the individual results, not the average, should be used to evaluate the quality of the product.\n\n3.2.2 Outlier Tests\n\nThe CGMP regulations require that statistically valid quality control criteria include appropriate acceptance and/or rejection levels (SS 211.165(d)). On rare occasions, a value may be obtained that is markedly different from the others in a series obtained using a validated method. Such a value may qualify as a statistical outlier. An outlier may result from a deviation from prescribed test methods, or it may be the result of variability in the sample. It should never be assumed that the reason for an outlier is error in the testing procedure, rather than inherent variability in the sample being tested.\n\nOutlier testing is a statistical procedure for identifying from an array those data that are extreme. The possible use of outlier tests should be determined in advance. This should be written into SOPs for data interpretation and be well documented. The SOPs should include the specific outlier test to be applied with relevant parameters specified in advance. The SOPs should specify the minimum number of results required to obtain a statistically significant assessment from the specified outlier test.\n\nFor biological assays having a high variability, an outlier test may be an appropriate statistical analysis to identify those results that are statistically extreme observations. The USP describes outlier tests in the general chapter on Design and Analysis of Biological Assays (USP(<)111(>)). In these cases, the outlier observation is omitted from calculations. The USP also states that \"arbitrary rejection or retention of an apparently aberrant response can be a serious source of bias...the rejection of observations solely on the basis of their relative magnitudes, without investigation as to cause, is a procedure to be used sparingly\" (USP (<)111(>)).\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigating Out-of-Specification (OOS) Test Results for Pharmaceutical Production - Level 2 revision Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.9896650314331055", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As stated in ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products , If one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, what should be done?\n--------------------\nContext: Complete records should also be maintained for:\n\nAny modifications to an established analytical method;\n\nPeriodic calibration of laboratory instruments, apparatus, gauges, and recording devices;\n\nAll stability testing performed on APIs; and\n\nOut-of-specification (OOS) investigations.\n\nBatch Production Record Review\n\nWritten procedures should be established and followed for the review and approval of batch production and laboratory control records, including packaging and labelling, to determine compliance of the intermediate or API with established specifications before a batch is released or distributed.\n\nBatch production and laboratory control records of critical process steps should be reviewed and approved by the quality unit(s) before an API batch is released or distributed.

To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended for conventional food and dietary supplement manufacturers. It provides questions and answers on topics related to compliance with our final rules issued on May 27, 2016, entitled \"Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels\" (81 FR 33742; the \"Nutrition Facts label final rule\") and \"Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Foods That Can Reasonably Be Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Dual-Column Labeling; Updating, Modifying, and Establishing Certain Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Serving Size for Breath Mints; and Technical Amendments\" (81 FR 34000; the \"serving size final rule\") (codified at title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 101 (21 CFR part 101)). This guidance also discusses labeling of added sugars, as well as formatting for lines (e.g. thickness of lines) and leading (e.g. space between lines) in the examples of graphics used by FDA on the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nIn this guidance, \"you\" (or \"I\") refers to a manufacturer of conventional food or dietary supplements.\n\nII Background\n\nOn May 27, 2016, we published the Nutrition Facts label and the serving size final rules related to the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels, which amended our labeling regulations for foods to provide updated nutrition information to assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices.\n\nBelow is a summary of the combined major provisions of the Nutrition Facts label final rule and serving size final rule.\n\nThe final rules revise the Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts labels by:\n\nRemoving the declaration of \"Calories from fat\";\n\nRequiring the declaration of the gram (g) amount of \"added sugars\" in a serving of a product, establishing a Daily Reference Value (DRV) for added sugars, and requiring the percent Daily Value (DV) declaration for added sugars;\n\nChanging \"Sugars\" to \"Total Sugars\" and requiring that \"Includes 'X' g Added Sugars\" be indented and declared directly below \"Total Sugars\";\n\nUpdating the list of vitamins and minerals of public health significance;\n\nUpdating certain reference values used in the declaration of percent DVs of nutrients on the Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts labels;\n\nRevising the format of the Nutrition Facts labels to increase the prominence of the declaration of \"Calories\";\n\nRemoving the requirement for the footnote table listing the reference values for certain nutrients for 2,000 and 2,500 calorie diets;\n\nRequiring the maintenance of records to support the declarations of certain nutrients under specified circumstances;\n\nAmending the definition of a single-serving container;\n\nRequiring dual-column labeling for certain packages;\n\nAmending several reference amounts customarily consumed that are used by manufacturers to determine their label serving size; and * Establishing an effective date of July 26, 2016, and a compliance date of January 1, 2020, for manufacturers with more than $10 million in food sales (originally scheduled to be July 26, 2018) and January 1, 2021, for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales (originally scheduled to be July 26, 2019).2 Footnote 2: On October 2, 2017, FDA issued a proposed rule that would extend the compliance dates to January 1, 2020 (i.e., for manufacturers with more than $10 million in food sales) and January 1, 2021 (i.e., for manufacturers with less than $10 million in food sales) (82 FR 45753). We finalized the changes to the compliance date in the Federal Register of May 4, 2018 (83 FR 19619).\n\nIII. Questions and Answers on Compliance Issues\n\nMust the updated Nutrition or Supplement Facts label appear on all foods sold by the applicable compliance date? After publication of the final rule, we included a frequently asked question on our website asking \"When must the label be displayed on food packages?\" In our response, we stated that the revised labels were to be displayed on food products that are initially introduced into interstate commerce on or after the compliance date, and said we would address the issue further in guidance. We received a number of questions about products at various points in the distribution chain and whether the product would need to bear the new version of the Nutrition or Supplement Facts label. After further consideration, we are providing the following guidance. Products that are labeled (i.e., when the label is placed on the product) on or after the applicable compliance date must bear a nutrition label that meets our new nutrition labeling requirements in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36. Products that are labeled before the applicable compliance date do not need to be in compliance with the new labeling requirements, and therefore, do not need to bear the new nutrition label. We consider the date the food product was labeled for purposes of determining whether the product must bear a nutrition label that meets the new requirements. We would not consider the location of the food in the distribution chain to determine whether a food product must bear a nutrition label that meets our new nutrition labeling requirements. For example, the food product, whether labeled before or after the compliance date, may be at the manufacturing facility awaiting distribution, at a warehouse awaiting further distribution, in transit to the United States to be offered for import, or on the store shelf of a U.S. retail establishment. We do not object to the use of a sticker for providing a revised nutrition label that meets our new requirements in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 before new packaging is printed. The sticker label should not cover any other mandatory information and should adhere to the package during normal handling.\n\nWhen determining whether labels need to be in compliance with the new requirements, should the determination as to whether my company has $10 million or more in annual food sales be based on domestic food sales or total food sales, including international sales, and how many years of sales should I consider? To determine whether a company has $10 million or more in annual food sales, a firm can either take the smallest sales volume from the previous three years (e.g., 2013, 2014, and 2015), or alternately the firm can take the average of the previous three years sales volume. A firm's total (domestic plus international) food sales best reflects the firm's resources and, thus, ability to comply with the final rules by the applicable compliance date.\n\nAre there certain approved companies or nutrition databases that manufacturers can use to get the nutrition values for their products? FDA does not approve nutrition databases. However, the United States Department of Agriculture provides nutrition information for a number of foods, and there are also several commercially available nutrition databases you can use to determine nutrition values for your products.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.15484626591205597", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What is unique about the ingredient labeling of dietary supplements?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:1]\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Federal Register is a final rule that established a regulation (21 CFR part 111) entitled Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP). In Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, Or Holding Operations For Dietary Supplements (72 FR 34752). The Dietary Supplement (DS) CGMP rule in 21 CFR part 111 (\"the DS CGMP rule\") requires persons who manufacture, package, label, or hold a dietary supplement to establish and follow current good manufacturing practice to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and to ensure that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record.\n\nThe Federal Register (72 FR 34959), FDA also issued an interim final rule (the identity testing interim final rule) setting forth a procedure for requesting an exemption from a requirement of the DS CGMP rule for the manufacturer to conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any dietary ingredient that is a component of a dietary supplement. The provisions of the identity testing interim final rule have the full force of law, but FDA provided a 90-day comment period on those provisions through September 24, 2007. On September 17, 2007, FDA published a notice in the Federal Register to extend the comment period to October 24, 2007.\n\nThe DS CGMP rule and the identity testing interim final rule were effective as of August 24, 2007. The compliance dates are described below.\n\nFDA has prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121). This guidance document restates in plain language the legal requirements set forth in the DS CGMP rule 1111. The DS CGMP rule is binding and has the full force and effect of law.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]\n\nIII.

Do the requirements of the DS CGMP rule apply to all types of dietary supplements (e.g., for botanical dietary supplements and for vitamin/mineral dietary supplements)?\n\nYes.\n\n(72 FR 34752 at 34913)\n\nB. How the DS CGMP Rule Applies to Specific Types of Operations\n\nAm I subject to the DS CGMP rule if I package, label, or distribute a dietary supplement manufactured by another firm?\n\nYes. The DS CGMP rule requires you to comply with those provisions directly applicable to the operations you perform.\n\nFor example, if you are a labeler, the DS CGMP rule:\n\nRequires you to comply with the requirement in 21 CFR 111.255 to establish a batch production record;\n\nRequires you to comply with other applicable requirements, such as requirements for personnel, physical plant and grounds, equipment and utensils, and holding operations;\n\nDoes not require you to comply with the requirement of 21 CFR 111.260(e) to include the identity and weight or measure of each component used, because you would be starting from packages that already had been filled rather than from individual components.\n\nAs another example, if you are a distributor who purchases a packaged and labeled dietary supplement and then holds the product in a warehouse for distribution to another physical location, the DS CGMP rule:\n\nRequires you to comply with requirements for holding and distributing; and\n\nRequires you to comply with other applicable requirements, such as requirements for personnel, the physical plant and grounds.\n\n(72 FR 34752 at 34793)\n9. How does FDA expect to apply the DS CGMP rule to practitioners?\n\nFDA expects to exercise enforcement discretion, on a case-by-case basis, in determining whether to apply the DS CGMP rule to practitioners such as herbalists, acupuncturists, naturopaths, and other related health care providers. For example:\n\nWe expect to exercise discretion in the case of a one-on-one consultation by a practitioner who is adequately trained in his or her profession. We believe such a case may not necessitate the same types of controls as we established in the DS CGMP rule for manufacturing activities on a larger scale. Such a practitioner may make some formulations in advance of the consultation and still make the formulations in very limited quantities for the individual client.\n\nWe are not considering exercising our enforcement discretion with respect to practitioners who prepare batches of dietary supplements and sell them to individual consumers without determining whether the dietary supplement is appropriate for each consumer's needs in a one-on-one personal consultation.\n\nWe are not considering exercising our enforcement discretion with respect to practitioners who prepare batches of a dietary supplement for which there is a known or suspected safety concern.\n\nWe do not expect the number of practitioners subject to the consideration of our enforcement discretion to be very large. Many products manufactured by practitioners would not necessarily be considered to be dietary supplements (e.g., certain products used by traditional Asian medicine practitioners).\n\n(72 FR 34752 at 34793)\n\nC. How the DS CGMP Rule Applies to Contractors\n\n1. Does the DS CGMP rule apply to a contractor who provides a service to a firm who is subject to the DS CGMP rule?\n\nYes. Contractors who provide a particular service (such as packaging, labeling or both packaging and labeling) to a firm who is subject to the DS CGMP rule must comply with those regulations directly applicable to the operations they perform for the firm who contracted with them (72 FR 34752 at 34790). For example, if a contractor is a labeler, the DS CGMP rule:\n\nD. Terms Used in the DS CGMP Rule and In This Document\n\n1. What terms does the DS CGMP rule define?\n\nThe DS CGMP rule defines the following terms:\n\nActual yield;\n\nBatch;\n\nBatch number, lot number, or control number;\n\nComponent;\n\nContact surface;\n\nIngredient;\n\nIn-process material;\n\nLot;\n\nMicroorganisms;\n\nPest;\n\nPhysical plant;\n\nProduct complaint;\n\nQuality;\n\nQuality control;\n\nQuality control personnel;\n\nRepresentative sample;\n\nReprocessing;\n\nReserve sample;\n\nSanitize;\n\nTheoretical yield; and\n\nWater activity.\n\nThe DS CGMP rule also explains how we use the following terms:\n\nMust;\n\nWe; and\n\nYou.\n\nE. Other Applicable Statutory Provisions and Regulations\n\n1. Do other statutory provisions and regulations apply to persons who manufacture, package, label or hold dietary supplements? Yes. You must comply with other applicable statutory provisions and regulations under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act related to dietary supplements. (21 CFR 111.5)\n2. How does the DS CGMP rule relate to the food CGMP rule in 21 CFR part 110? In establishing 21 CFR part 111, we:\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.23621192574501038", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What is unique about the ingredient labeling of dietary supplements?\n--------------------\nContext: The \"Supplement Facts\" nutrition information (referred to as a panel) must be enclosed in a box by using hairlines. The title, \"Supplement Facts,\" must be larger than all other print in the panel and, unless impractical, must be set full width of the panel. The title and all headings must be bolded to distinguish them from other information.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n36. How must I present the information in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nYou must present all information using the following:\n\na. A single easy-to-read type style;\n\nb. All black or one color type, printed on a white or neutral contrasting background, whenever practical;3. Upper- and lowercase letters, except that you may use all uppercase lettering on small packages (i.e., packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches); d. At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text); and e. Letters that do not touch.\n37. What are the type size requirements for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel?\n\nExcept as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must set information other than the title, headings, and footnotes in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. You also must use a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label for the title \"Supplement Facts.\" You may set the column headings and footnotes in type no smaller than 6 point type. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nMust I use hairlines in the Supplement Facts panel?\n\nExcept for small and intermediate-sized packages, you must use a hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text to separate each dietary ingredient from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it. FDA has provided an exception for certain packages with space constraints. See the section on \"Special Labeling Provisions\" for the exceptions for small and intermediate-sized packages.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)\n\nHow closely must I follow the \"Examples of graphic enhancements used by the FDA\" in appendix B to Part 101?\n\nYou are not required to follow Appendix B to Part 101. Appendix B and its specifications are a model, which FDA has suggested in the interest of uniformity of presentation. For example, 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(i) requires the use of an \"easy-to-read\" type style, not specifically Helvetica type, as suggested in Appendix B.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(e)(9)\n\nHow do I provide nutrition labeling when my product contains two or more packets of supplements (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening)?\n\nYou may present the information for each packet (e.g., a packet of capsules for the morning and a different packet for the evening) in an individual nutrition label or you may use an aggregate nutrition label. For two packets, this would consist of five columns. List all of the dietary ingredients in the first column. List the amounts and percents of the morning packet in the second and third columns and similar information for the evening packet in the fourth and fifth columns (see the illustration of aggregate nutrition labeling in 21 CFR 101.36(e)(10)(iii)).\n\nCompliance\n\nWhat kind of samples will FDA collect to determine compliance with 21 CFR 101.36?\n\nFDA will collect a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer packages) or 10 percent of the number of packages in the same inspection lot, whichever is smaller. FDA will randomly select these packages.\n\nWhat if it is not technically feasible for me to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements?\n\nFDA may permit you to use an alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(9). If your firm needs such special allowances, you must make your request in writing to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(f)(2)\n\nMust dietary ingredients that I have added to my products be present at 100% of the amount that I declare?\n\nFor dietary ingredients that are specifically added, your product must contain 100% of the volume or weight that you have declared on the label, with the exception of a deviation that is attributable to the analytical method. Products that contain less than this amount of such a dietary ingredient would be misbranded and in violation of the law. Dietary ingredients that are naturally-occurring must be present at 80% of the declared value. For example, if you add vitamin C that was isolated from a natural source or made synthetically to your dietary supplement product, it would be subject to the 100% rule. However, if you added rose hips to your product, the vitamin C in the rose hips is naturally-occurring and must be present at least 80% of the declared value.\n\nExemptions\n\nWhat are the circumstances in which my dietary supplement products would be exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements? Your dietary supplement product is not required to have a \"Supplement Facts\" panel if: a. Your firm is a small business that has not more than $50,000 gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers or not more than $500,000 per year from total sales in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1); b. You sell less than 100,000 units of the product annually, your firm has fewer than 100 full-time equivalent employees in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(2) andyou file an annual notification with FDA as specified in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(18)(iv); or c. You ship the product in bulk form, do not distribute it to consumers in such form, and you supply it for use in the manufacture of other dietary supplements in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(h)(3). The two exemptions for small businesses and low-volume products (a. and b. above) are available to you only if your products' labels bear no claims or other nutrition information.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(h)(1) - (3)\n\nSpecial Labeling Provisions\n\nWhat are small packages?\n\nSmall packages are those packages having less than 12 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)\n\nWhat is the telephone provision for small packages?\n\nIn lieu of a \"Supplement Facts\" panel, you may print labels for small packages with a telephone number or address that consumers can use to obtain nutrition information. You may use a telephone number or an address in place of the \"Supplement Facts\" panel only if you place no claims or other nutrition information on the product label.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(i)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size that I may use for small packages?\n\nYou may use a type size no smaller than 4-5 point for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of small packages.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(i)\n\nMay I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small package?\n\nYes. You may use a tabular format on small packages. You also may present \"Supplement Facts\" information in a linear (i.e., string) fashion if the label will not accommodate the \"Supplement Facts\" panel in a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j) (13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display.)\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n\nWhat are intermediate-sized packages?\n\nIntermediate-sized packages are those packages having from 12 to 40 square inches of total surface area available to bear labeling.\n\n21 CFR 101:36(i)(2)(ii)\n\nWhat is the minimum type size for intermediate-sized packages?The \"Supplement Facts\" panel on the labels of intermediate-sized packages must use type size no smaller than 6 point, except that type no smaller than 4-5 point may be used on packages that have 20 to 40 square inches that list more than 16 dietary ingredients. Also, 4-5 point type may be used on packages with less than 20 square inches that list more than 8 dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the type size used in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an inner container may be as small as needed to accommodate all required information if the \"Supplement Facts\" on the outer container meets these type size requirements.\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2)(ii) and (i)(2)(iv)\n51. May I use a tabular or linear format for the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on an intermediate-sized package? You may use a tabular format on an intermediate-sized package if the package shape or size cannot accommodate vertical columns. You may use a linear format if the label will not accommodate a tabular format. (See 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(1) for an illustration of a tabular display and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(2) for an illustration of a linear display).\n\n21 CFR 101.36(i)(2) and 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)\n52. May I abbreviate on the labels of intermediate- sized packages? You may use the abbreviations in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel for small and intermediate-sized packages, e.g, \"Serv size\" for \"Serving Size\" and \"Servings\" for \"Servings Per Container.\"\n\n21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B)\n53. Must I always use hairlines on the labels of intermediate-sized packages? No. You may use a row of dots connecting the columns containing the name of each dietary ingredient and the quantitative amount (by weight and as a percent of Daily Value) in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel on a small or an intermediate-sized package if you use the minimum type size and there is not sufficient space for you to use hairlines.\n--------------------\nContext title: questions_Dietary Supplement Labeling Guide- Chapter IV. Nutrition Labeling \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.5924694538116455", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What is unique about the ingredient labeling of dietary supplements?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 17: For purposes of the dietary supplement labeling requirements, a \u201cdisease\u2019 is damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition\u201d (21 CFR 101.93(g)(1)).\n\n.4.3 Conventional Food\n\nSection 201(f) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(f)) defines a food as \"(1) articles used for food or drink for man or other animals, (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article.\" For studies intended to evaluate the effects of a food, the analysis for whether an IND is needed turns on the intent of the clinical investigation.\n\nAs is the case for a dietary supplement, a food is considered to be a drug if it is \"intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease,\"18 except that a food may bear an authorized health claim about reducing the risk of a disease without becoming a drug (see section VI.4.3). Therefore, a clinical investigation intended to evaluate the effect of a foodon a disease would require an IND under part 312. For example, a clinical investigation intended to evaluate the effect of a food on the signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease would require an IND.\n\nThe following paragraph in brackets [ ] is STAYED.\n\n[The FD&C Act also defines drug to include \"articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\"19 This provision contains a parenthetical exception for foods that affect the structure and function of the body by virtue of providing nutrition to sustain life and health. Consistent with case law interpreting the other than food, exception as applying to articles consumed primarily for taste, aroma, or nutritive value, FDA regulates conventional foods (including infant formula) that are intended to affect the structure or function of the body as foods, not drugs, as long as the intended structure or function effect derives from the product's character as a food -- its taste, aroma, or nutritive value.20 However, if an edible product that might otherwise be a conventional food is intended for a use other than providing taste, aroma, or nutritive value, such as blocking the absorption of carbohydrates in the gut, the product becomes a drug because the primary purpose of consuming it has changed. In other words, the product is no longer being consumed as a food -- primarily for taste, aroma, or nutritive value -- but used as a drug for some other physiological effect. Accordingly, a clinical investigation intended only to evaluate the nutritional effects of a food (including medical foods21) would not require an IND, but an investigation intended to evaluate other effects of a food on the structure or function of the body would. For example, a study of the effect of iron on hemoglobin levels in which subjects were fed beef or lambas a source of iron would not require an IND, but a study of the effect of soy isoflav on bone metabolism would. Similarly, a study of the ability of an infant formula to support growth of infants or of other nutritional properties of the formula would not require an IND. However, a study of other effects of the formula on the structure or function of the body (e.g., an investigation of the effects of docosahexaenoic action in infant formula on visual acuity of infants) would require an IND.\n\nFootnote 19: 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C).\n\nFootnote 20: See Nutrilab v. Schweiker, 713 F.2d 335 (7th Cir. 1983).\n\nFootnote 21: A medical food is \u201ca food which is formulated to be consumed or administered generally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation.\u201d 21 U.S.C. 360ee(b)(3).\n\nA clinical study intended to evaluate the safety of a food ingredient generally does not require an IND, even if the ingredient is known to have an effect on the structure and function of the body that is in addition to its taste, aroma, or nutritional effect. For example, a study of the safety of a flavor ingredient that has been found to bind to a receptor outside of the target location in the mouth would not require an IND if the intent of the study was to evaluate the safety of the ingredient when ingested as food. The following sentence in brackets [ ] is STAYED. [In contrast, if the intent of the study was to evaluate the beneficial effects (beyond nutritional effects) of binding the newly found receptor, the study would require an IND.] Similarly, a clinical study may be performed to evaluate the tolerability of a food in a specific susceptible population, including individuals with a disease. In such an evaluation, biological parameters affected by the disease may need to be assessed in order to establish tolerance. For example, the administration of high intensity sweeteners to diabetic patients to establish no adverse effect on HbA1c levels or the administration of a novel food protein ingredient to a potentially allergic population to establish lack of allergic reactivity in this population would not require an IND. However, if the intent of the study was to demonstrate an effect of the food in decreasing HbA1c levels in diabetic patients or an effect of the food to desensitize or raise threshold levels of allergic reactivity in sensitive individuals, the study would require an IND.\n\nConsistent with the considerations for conventional foods described in the previous paragraph, an investigation intended to evaluate the effects of a medical food on a disease would require an IND. However, if the medical food is simply being fed to subjects for nutritional purposes during a study examining the effects of another intervention, the use of the medical food in the study would not trigger the need for an IND, although the study might require an IND or investigational device exemption (IDE) for the intervention being studied.\n\niv.2.3 Studies Intended to Support a Health Claim\n\nNOTE: The stay does not apply to clinical investigations intended to evaluate whether a food substance may reduce the risk of a disease in individuals less than 12 months of age, those with altered immune systems, and those with serious or life-threatening medical conditions. This subsection is in effect for such clinical investigations.\n\nThe following paragraph in brackets [] is STAYED, except as noted above.\n\n[Section 201(g) of the FD&C Act provides that a health claim in the label or labeling of a food (conventional food or dietary supplement) characterizing the relationship between a substance (food or food component) and a disease or health-related condition does not cause the food to be a drug on the basis of that claim, provided the claim is authorized under and made in accordance with the requirements of section 403(r(1)R) and (r(3)S) of the FD&C Act [22] (for conventional foods) or under section 403(r)(1)B and (r(3)D)-(for dietary supplements). Notwithstanding this provision, however, a clinical study designed to evaluate the relationship between a food substance and a disease and intended to provide support for such a claim is required to be conducted under an IND (21 CFR part 312), unless the substance disgate relationship being studied is already the subject of an authorized health claim. Section 403 provides, in effect, an exemption from the normal operation of the drug definition [14] it permits the use of health claims that would, without the exemption caused in conventional food or dietary supplement to be a drug. However the exemption does not apply until the health claim has been authorized by FDA. Therefore a study conducted to support a new or expanded health claim would require an IND. For example, a study designed to evaluate whether vitamin D may reduce the risk of one or more site-specific cancers would require an IND, as there is currently no authorized health claim for this substance-disease relationship. Similarly, a study conducted to support a petition to amend the health claim for soluble fiber from certain foods and reduced risk of coronary heart disease (21 CFR 101.81) to include a new type of fiber would require an IND.]\n\nResearch With Noncommercial Intent\n\nSome believe that the IND regulations do not apply to clinical investigations that are not intended to investigate a drug's potential for commercial sale. Whether the IND regulations apply to a planned clinical investigation does not depend on whether the intent of the clinical investigation is commercial or noncommercial. Therefore, these types of studies would require an IND under part 312, unless they meet the criteria for an exemption in SSSS 312.2(b) or 320.31(b) (see section IV) or the criteria in SS 361.1, or the compound used is labeled with a cold isotope and used in the manner described in section V.\n\nVII Frequently asked questions\n\n1 Do I need an IND if I use a lawfully marketed drug for an unlabeled indication?\n\nIf you are a health care provider and you prescribe a marketed drug to treat a patient for an unlabeled indication (also referred to as off-label use), an IND is not required because this use is considered to be within the scope of medical practice and not a clinical investigation. However, if you use the marketed drug for the same purpose in a clinical investigation intended to evaluate the drug's ability to treat a disease or condition, an IND is required under part 312 unless the clinical investigation meets the criteria for an exemption for studies of lawfully marketed drugs (see 21 CFR 312.2(b) and section IV.A of this guidance).\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.8175088167190552", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Delving into Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels , What is unique about the ingredient labeling of dietary supplements?\n--------------------\nContext: Regarding dietary supplements, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium must be declared when they are present in a dietary supplement in quantitative amounts by weight that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling of foods in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c). (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAs for the phrase \"levels of significance,\" as used in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii) and 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and whether the phrase refers to statistical testing of hypotheses or mathematical concepts related to the degree of accuracy starting with the first nonzero digit, the phrase \"levels of significance\" refers to the degree of accuracy when rounding nutrients for purposes of declaring quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the label.\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c), provide specific rounding requirements for nutrients such as sodium. Before we issued the Nutrition Facts label final rule, sodium and potassium content was to be expressed as zero when the serving contained less than 5 milligrams (mg), to the nearest 5 mg increment when the serving contained less than or equal to 140 mg, and to the nearest 10 mg increment when the serving contained more than 140 mg. The Nutrition\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFacts label final rule amended 21 CFR 101.9(c)(5) to replace the requirements for the labeling of potassium with those of fluoride and amended 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) to establish an RDI for potassium and add it to the list of vitamins and minerals with RDIs. The requirements for declaring the quantitative amount of potassium are now the same as those for other vitamins and minerals with RDIs.\n\nThe RDIs for some vitamins and minerals are small numerical values (e.g., copper 0.9 mg). Nutrients with an RDI of less than 5 would not be able to be declared on the Supplement Facts label if they contain less than 2 percent of the RDI (e.g. 2 percent of the RDI for copper is 0.018 mg) and the amount is declared to the nearest mg or microgram (mcg) (e.g. if the amount of copper in a serving of the product is 0.017, but is rounded to zero). The vitamins and minerals with an RDI of less than 5 mg or mcg are thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, copper, and manganese. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest hundredth of a mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 5 mg or mcg, but less than 50 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest tenth of a mg or mcg per serving. The vitamins or minerals with an RDI of at least 5 mg or mcg but less than 50 mg or mcg are iron, vitamin D, vitamin E, niacin, biotin, pantothenic acid, zinc, chromium, and molybdenum. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest tenth of a mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg, but less than 250 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest mg or mcg. The vitamins or minerals with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg but less than 250 mg or mcg are vitamin C, vitamin K, iodine, and selenium. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the minerals with an RDI of at least 50 mg or mcg but less than 250 mg or mcg are vitamin C, vitamin K, iodine, and selenium. With respect to the declared quantitative amounts of these vitamins and minerals, we consider it appropriate for manufacturers to declare the quantitative amounts to the nearest mg or mcg per serving, provided that such a level of specificity does not represent a greater level of precision in the amount of the nutrient present than the method of analysis, database, source of the nutrient, and/or calculation used for the declaration can scientifically support.\n\nA vitamin or mineral with an RDI of at least 250 mg or mcg, but less than 500 mg or mcg, would not be declared on the Supplement Facts label if it contains less than 2 percent of the RDI unless the quantitative amount is declared to the nearest 5 mg or mcg. The vitamins and minerals with an RDI of at least 250 mg or mcg, but less than 500 mg or mcg, are folate and\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:28]\n\n2.2 Recommendations for declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels using RDIs for adults and children (\\geq) 4 years\n\nThis table provides recommendations for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals using only the RDIs that have been established for adults and children 4 years of age and older. Our regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv), provide RDIs for infants through 12 months, children 1 through 3 years, and pregnant and lactating women.

It specifically explains how FDA intends to consider exercising enforcement discretion when a conflict occurs between compliance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), section 101.9(c), and compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(g) such that compliance with both sections is not possible.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe our current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nFDA's regulations in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 describe requirements for nutrition labeling in conventional foods and dietary supplements, respectively. The requirements for declaring the nutrient value in a serving of conventional food are in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8). Certain dietary ingredients in dietary supplements are also required to be declared in accordance with these requirements (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)). These dietary ingredients are listed in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2) and are referred to as \"(b)(2)-dietary ingredients.\" Unlike nutrients in conventional food, the (b)(2)-dietary ingredients can only be declared when they are present in dietary supplements in amounts that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling according to 21 CFR 101.9(c) (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nFDA's regulations under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4) and (5) describe compliance requirements for declaring nutrients and dietary ingredients2 in nutrition labeling. A conventional food or dietary supplement declaring the amount of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in its labeling is misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)] if:\n\nFootnote 2: See 21 CFR 101.36(f)(1).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber is below 80 percent of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).3 Footnote 3: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii)).\n\nThe nutrient content of the composite of calories, total sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).4 Footnote 4: Provided that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved (21 CFR 101.9(g)(5)).\n\nFor the remainder of this document, we refer to 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) as \"the compliance requirements.\"\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nIn many cases, the amount of a nutrient or (b)(2)-dietary ingredient declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) will not conflict with the compliance requirements. However, certain small amounts of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients cannot be declared in accordance with both 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) and the compliance requirements. In these cases, the amount declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8) is below or above the level provided by the compliance requirements.\n\nExample 1 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(iv), monounsaturated fat content must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams. Therefore, if the analyzed value of monounsaturated fat is 0.75 to 1.00 grams, the amount of monounsaturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 1.00 gram (or 1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value is 0.80 gram or greater. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) if the analyzed value of monounsaturatedfat is 0.75 to 0.79 gram because values in this range are not at least equal to 80 percent of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 1 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are below 80 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are greater than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable excesses of nutrients, such as monounsaturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nExample 2 shows when a conflict occurs between compliance with 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i), saturated fat must be expressed to the nearest 0.5 gram increment below 5 grams, unless the amount is less than 0.5 gram. Therefore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.50 to 0.74 gram, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with this requirement is 0.50 gram (0.5g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 0.50 to 0.60 gram. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 0.61 to 0.74 gram because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 0.50 gram.\n\nFurthermore, if the analyzed value of saturated fat is 1.00 to 1.24 grams, the amount of saturated fat declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i) is 1.00 gram (1 g). This declared amount complies with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.20 grams or less. However, this declared amount would not comply with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) if the analyzed value is 1.21 to 1.24 grams because values in this range are greater than 20 percent in excess of 1.00 gram.\n\nExample 2 pertains to the analyzed nutrient values that are above 20 percent of the nutrient value declared on the label for the 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) nutrients. Regarding analyzed nutrient values that are less than the amount declared on the label, the regulations allow for reasonable deficiencies of nutrients, such as saturated fat, within current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(g)(6).\n\nFor certain nutrients, such as total fat and its components (including monounsaturated fat and saturated fat), if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the amount must be expressed as zero in nutrition labeling (21 CFR 101.9(c)). Unlike nutrients in conventional food, (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in dietary supplements must not be declared in nutrition labeling when the amount is zero (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nIV FDA's Policy\n\nAs discussed, when the analyzed value of nutrients or (b)(2)-dietary ingredients present in small amounts is declared in nutrition labeling in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8), the declared amount may conflict with the compliance requirements. In such cases, we intend to consider the use of our enforcement discretion with respect to the compliance requirements and recommend that manufacturers declare nutrients and (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)-(8).\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.7062644958496094"], "When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA intends to monitor the drug distribution system for abuses or exploitation of this exercise of enforcement discretion.\n\nWe note that pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(9), returns by hospitals, health care entities, and charitable institutions are excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution, provided that the returns comply with 21 CFR SS 203.23.\n\nF. Shipping/Delivery Arrangements\n\n27. Is a pedigree required if a manufacturer drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer (i.e., ships the product directly to the non-ADR's customer)?Yes. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50, the non-ADR seller must provide a pedigree to the purchaser.\n\nIs a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n\nYes. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50, the non-ADR seller must provide a pedigree to the purchaser.\n\nWhat is the status of third party logistics providers (TPLP or 3PLs) in the context of PDMA? For example, is a TPLP considered to be a distributor or contractor for the manufacturer for whom the TPLP works?\n\nBased on comments that FDA received from a TPLP, TPLPs typically act as distributors for manufacturers. Therefore, unless the TPLP has ADR status with the manufacturer (which should be posted on the manufacturer's website and reflected in a written contract), the TPLP would be required to provide a pedigree prior to each wholesale distribution. Because of the unique ongoing relationship between a TPLP and a manufacturer, most, if not all, TPLPs distributing prescription drugs on behalf of a manufacturer would be able to obtain ADR status from the manufacturer with which they are doing business. Therefore, the TPLP would be listed on any subsequent pedigree because the TPLP was involved in the prior sale, purchase, or trade of the prescription drug. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\n3 Inventory\n\nIs a pedigree required for products already in the supply chain as of December 1, 2006?\n\nIt depends. A pedigree would be required for prescription drug products that are sold, purchased, or traded by a non-ADR after December 1, 2006. In order to give wholesalers sufficient time to prepare and deplete stock that would require a pedigree after December 1, FDA provided 6 months' notice that the stay would expire on December 1, 2006. However, FDA recognizes that there may be some situations where a wholesaler has prescription drugs in stock that were purchased while the wholesaler considered itself an ADR, yet the wholesaler clearly will not be an ADR for those drugs under 21 C.F.R. SS 202.3(u) after December 1, 2006. FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion until April 1, 2007 regarding the pedigree requirement for such drugs, provided that the wholesaler can furnish documentation that the drugs were purchased prior to December 1, 2006, and that it had purchased the same type of drugs from the manufacturer on at least two prior occasions in the previous 24 months. Bills of sale or invoices could be used for this documentation. Wholesalers that cannot meet this criteria with respect to their inventories will be expected to provide a pedigree for those drugs. FDA believes that the combination of the six month notice that the stay would expire, along with additional four months of enforcement discretion, as described above,provides the wholesalers described above with sufficient time to deplete their pre-December 1, 2006 inventories.\n\n31. If there are two products on a shelf in a pharmacy, with the same lot number, but one was purchased from an ADR and the other was not, how would the pharmacy know which product came from the ADR and which product came from the non-ADR?\n\nInventory control is a business process. FDA expects firms to be able to identify and differentiate drug products that have been obtained from different sources and maintain appropriate records in compliance with PDMA.\n\n32. Is a pedigree required for inventory acquired through a pharmacy acquisition, merger, or buyout?\n\nNo. The purchase of a pharmacy by another pharmacy would not be considered a wholesale distribution, provided that the drugs purchased by the second pharmacy are dispensed or distributed by that pharmacy in the normal practice of retail pharmacy. Therefore, no pedigree would be required. However, the sale, purchase, or trade of those drugs to another pharmacy or wholesale distributor would be considered a wholesale distribution and a pedigree must be provided if that other pharmacy or distributor is not an ADR. If pedigrees are part of the record for the inventory, they must be provided with the sale, purchase, or trade of the product and retained for the appropriate length of time, as required under 21 CFR SSSS203.50(b) and 203.60(d).\n\nH. Pedigrees\n\n33. What does \"date of each previous transaction\" refer to in 21 C.F.R.\n\nSS 203.50(a)(7)?\n\n\"Date of each previous transaction\" refers to the date of each prior sale, purchase, or trade of the product. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nI. Electronic Pedigrees\n\n34. Will electronic pedigrees that conform to the EPCglobal electronic drug pedigree standards be considered PDMA-compliant? At the time of printing, these standards have not been officially adopted or recognized. Therefore, it is premature for FDA to comment on whether they comply with PDMA requirements.\n\n35. Can paper or electronic pedigrees be used?\n\nSection 203.60(a)(2) states that \"combinations of paper records and electronic records, electronic records and handwritten signatures executed on paper, or paper records and electronic signatures or handwritten signatures executed to electronic records, may be used to meet any of the record and signature requirements of the PDMA.\" Both paper and electronic documents and signatures may be used to meet the pedigree requirement of the Act, provided that the requirements of 21 CFR SS 203.60 are met.\n\nIs RFID the only way to achieve an electronic pedigree?\n\nNo. The PDMA and existing regulations do not require any particular technology for pedigrees. Although FDA has stated on several occasions that RFID is the most promising means to achieve an electronic pedigree, electronic pedigree can also be accomplished using bar codes or other track and trace technologies.\n\nCompliance/Enforcement\n\nWhere should a report be sent if there are concerns regarding a pedigree that has been received?\n\nCriminal activity, possible fraud, diversion, counterfeiting, or any other suspicious activity associated with a pedigree should be reported to FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations at rxdrugcops@oci.fda.gov.\n\nWhat are some examples of issues that might raise questions about the pedigree?\n\nDrugs that are sold below market price\n\nUnexplained gaps in the pedigree\n\nUnexplained differences in ordered product vs. shipped product\n\nUnexplained, unexpected, or unusual changes in supplier chain\n\nUnusual variety of lot numbers relative to the size of the shipment\n\nMultiple, unknown wholesalers from various states listed on the pedigree\n\nIncomplete paperwork, invoices, or other materials that do not match pedigree\n\nPattern of discrepancies in ordered vs. shipped product\n\nDiscrepancies in or missing covert/overt anti-counterfeiting measures\n\nSupplier refuses to provide a wholesale license from the state licensing authority\n\nSupplier wants payment in cash only\n\nA non ADR refuses to provide pedigree documentation\n\nSupplier refuses to divulge source of the prescription drug\n\nIf a company says that it is an ADR and not required to provide a pedigree, yet the purchaser has reason to believe that the company is not an ADR, what should the purchaser do?\n\nIf a purchaser has reason to believe that the wholesaler is not an ADR, FDA recommends that the purchaser contact the manufacturer to determine whether the entity is an ADR for that product. This is an especially important action to take in those instances where unsolicited offers are received from unfamiliar companies that meet some of the above mentioned causes for concern. In addition, report any concerns as suggested in Question 38.\n\n40 Does the PDMA Compliance Policy Guide 160.900 apply to pharmacies and chain pharmacy warehouses?\n\nYes. CPG 160.900 relates to the PDMA pedigree requirements. Retail pharmacies and chain pharmacy warehouses are included in the definition of wholesale distributors at 21 CFR SS 203.3(dd) and are required to comply with the PDMA. Please see Addendum at:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cder/regulatory/PDMA/PDMA_addendum.pdf\n\n**ADDENDUM to FDA's Guidance for Industry: PDMA Pedigree Requirements - Questions and Answers Related to the Preliminary Injunction ordered 12/5/06 in RXUSA Wholesalers, Inc. v. HHS 12.15.06\n\nA What is affected by the preliminary injunction?\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(a). The court order enjoins FDA from implementing 21 CFR SS 203.50(a). 21 CFR SS 203.50(a)(6), states that information regarding \"each prior transaction involving the drug, starting with the manufacture\" be included in the pedigree. However, while the preliminary injunction is in effect, pedigrees shall include information regarding prior transactions going back to the manufacturer or the last ADR that sold, purchased, or traded the prescription drugs. FDA encourages wholesalers to include information regarding each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer when that information is available.\n--------------------\nContext title: Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) Requirements- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 7.879295825958252", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: Does a chain pharmacy warehouse have to provide a pedigree for drugs that it sends to its retail outlets?\n\nNo. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.33(cc)(1), intra-company sales are excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution. FDA considers intra-company transfers, such as those from a chain pharmacy warehouse to its own retail outlets, to fall within the scope of an intra-company sale.\n\nDo pharmacies have to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the pedigree? If so, how should they do this?\n\nNo. Pharmacies do not have this express responsibility under the PDMA, but they are encouraged to perform due diligence in verifying the accuracy of the information and integrity of the source of the drug product.\n\nC Recordkeeping Requirements\n\nWhat are the recordkeeping requirements for pedigree recipients?\n\nPursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(b), the pedigree is subject to the record retention requirements in 21 CFR SS 203.60, and must be retained by all wholesale distributors involved in the distribution of the drug product, whether ADR or non-ADR, for 3 years.\n\nIf the pharmacy receiving the pedigree will not itself engage in further distribution of the product to persons other than a consumer or patient, then the pharmacy is not required to maintain that pedigree under 21 CFR SS 203.60. However, consistent with the spirit of the PDMA, FDA encourages pharmacies and other end users to retain the pedigree for 3 years. As a result, if there is any question about the source or history of the product, it can be traced back through the drug supply chain.\n\nIf an ADR obtains drugs from a non-ADR, is the ADR required to maintain the pedigree?\n\nYes. Although an ADR is not required to provide a pedigree, pursuant to 21 CFR SSS 203.50(b), and 203.60(d), an ADR is required to retain the pedigree for 3 years.\n\nPDMA Scope\n\nDoes PDMA apply to veterinary prescription drugs?\n\nNo. PDMA applies only to prescription drugs intended for use by man. However, FDA is aware that many human prescription drugs are sold to veterinarians. Given that the human drugs are subject to section 503(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,the pedigree requirements apply to them under section 503(e). Accordingly, wholesale distributors who are not ADRs must provide a pedigree prior to wholesale distribution of human prescription drugs to veterinarians.\n\nIs a pedigree required for the distribution of drug samples?\n\nNo. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(7), the distribution of drug samples by manufacturers and authorized distributor's representatives is exempt from the definition of wholesale distribution, so the pedigree requirement does not apply. However, those distributing drug samples must comply with the separate requirements set forth in 21 USC SSS 353(c) and (d) and 21 CFR Part 203..\n\nIs a pedigree required for medical kits that contain prescription drugs, sometimes referred to as convenience kits?\n\nYes. \"Medical kits\" that contain devices and prescription drugs are combination products under 21 CFR SS3.2(e)(2), which are defined as \"two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of a drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products.\" The \"medical kits\" referred to in the question consist of separable finished devices and drugs that are combined in a kit for ready availability and use together in a medical setting. The drug product in the kit retains its separate form and individual packaging. Although these kits may be assigned to FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) as the lead Center for regulatory review when the primary mode of action of the kit is attributable to its device component, regulations for the drug and the device components continue to apply. Because a prescription drug component of a convenience kit is separable, and in the same form as when distributed independently, it is subject to the same pedigree requirements as when it is independently distributed. The pedigree must contain the drug's lot or control number(s), pursuant to 21 CFR SS203.50(a). We recognize that the convenience kit itself may have a lot or control number that is different than that on the prescription drug component. The outer container of the kit should also list the lot or control number of the prescription drug component so that the integrity of the kit's seal would not have to be compromised to confirm that the drug's lot number is the same as that listed in the pedigree. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nDoes PDMA apply to bulk drug substances?\n\nYes. The PDMA applies to drugs subject to SS 503(b) of the Act (i.e., prescription drugs). Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.1, the requirements in 21 CFR Part 203 apply to wholesale distribution of bulk drug substances.\n\nReturns\n\nIs a pedigree required for prescription drugs that are returned from a pharmacy or a physician's office to a wholesaler?Pursuant to the definition of wholesale distribution and other relevant provisions under SS 503(e) of the Act and 21 CFR Part 203, a pedigree is required for returns from a pharmacy or physician's office to a wholesaler unless that pharmacy or physician's office is an ADR for those prescription drugs. Prescription drugs generally are returned for two reasons: (1) the pharmacy or physician's office ordered too much and returns the drug to the wholesaler or manufacturer from whom they purchased the drugs, or (2) the drug is expired or close to expiring, in which case the product is returned to the wholesaler or manufacturer from which it was purchased, or to a reverse distributor for destruction. Pharmacies and physicians' offices generally are not ADRs, and they would find it extremely difficult to provide a pedigree when they return prescription drugs because they would not have received a pedigree if the drugs were purchased from an ADR.\n\nFDA recognizes the disruption that this could cause to the more than 55,000 pharmacies and the hundreds of thousand physicians' offices in the United States. Therefore, FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion to allow pharmacies and physicians' offices to return drugs that are expired, damaged, recalled, or in some other non-saleable condition, without having to provide a pedigree, provided that (1) they return the drugs to the wholesaler or manufacturer from which they purchased the drugs, or to a licensed reverse distributor for destruction, and (2) they maintain for a period of three years records that document each return and the source from which the pharmacy or physician's office originally purchased the drugs. If the returned prescription drugs are in saleable condition and may subsequently be sold, purchased, or traded by the wholesaler or reverse distributor, then that wholesaler or reverse distributor would be required and expected to pass a pedigree if they are not an ADR for those prescription drugs. Any subsequent pedigree should reflect that the drugs were sold, purchased, or traded to the pharmacy or physician's office and subsequently returned. Because the wholesaler to which the drugs are returned originally sold them to the pharmacy or physician's office, the wholesaler would have all the necessary information to provide a pedigree, even without the pedigree from the pharmacy or physician's office.\n\nFDA intends to monitor the drug distribution system for abuses or exploitation of this exercise of enforcement discretion.\n\nWe note that pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(9), returns by hospitals, health care entities, and charitable institutions are excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution, provided that the returns comply with 21 CFR SS 203.23.\n\nF. Shipping/Delivery Arrangements\n\n27. Is a pedigree required if a manufacturer drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer (i.e., ships the product directly to the non-ADR's customer)?Yes. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50, the non-ADR seller must provide a pedigree to the purchaser.\n\nIs a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n\nYes. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50, the non-ADR seller must provide a pedigree to the purchaser.\n\nWhat is the status of third party logistics providers (TPLP or 3PLs) in the context of PDMA? For example, is a TPLP considered to be a distributor or contractor for the manufacturer for whom the TPLP works?\n\nBased on comments that FDA received from a TPLP, TPLPs typically act as distributors for manufacturers.

The court order enjoins FDA from implementing 21 CFR SS 203.50(a). 21 CFR SS 203.50(a)(6), states that information regarding \"each prior transaction involving the drug, starting with the manufacture\" be included in the pedigree. However, while the preliminary injunction is in effect, pedigrees shall include information regarding prior transactions going back to the manufacturer or the last ADR that sold, purchased, or traded the prescription drugs. FDA encourages wholesalers to include information regarding each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer when that information is available.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(a)(1)-(5). The court order also enjoins FDA from implementing the language in 21 CFR SS 203.50 that requires pedigrees to include lot and control numbers, dosage, container size, and number of containers. As described in more detail below, however, the preliminary injunction does not affect the statutory requirement that pedigrees contain the dates of all listed transactions and the names and addresses of all parties involved in those transactions. In addition, since the court did not enjoin implementation of 21 CFR SS 203.3(u), a written agreement between a manufacturer and a wholesaler may limit ADR status to a particular lot number(s), dosage, or the number or size of the containers of prescription drugs. We also note that, without the lot number on the pedigree, it would be extremely difficult to track the inventory that matches the pedigree if the inventory is further sold, purchased or traded. Therefore, FDA recommends that the lot or control number, dosage, and the number and size of the prescription drug containers be included on the pedigree even though it is not required while the preliminary injunction is in effect.\n\nPedigrees for all current and future inventory are affected by the preliminary injunction as long is it remains in effect.\n\nB What is not affected by the preliminary injunction?\n\nPedigrees still must be passed by non-authorized distributors of record (non-ADR) prior to each wholesale distribution. In addition, the court does not mention other pedigree-related regulations or other agency-issued documents relating to the pedigree requirement. Accordingly, those regulations and documents, some of which are described below, are not affected by the preliminary injunction.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.3(u). This regulation, which went into effect on December 1, 2006, defines \"ongoing relationship\" for the purposes of determining who qualifies as an authorized distributor of record (ADR.) As of December 1, 2006, only thosewholesale distributors who have an ongoing relationship (including a written agreement) with the manufacturer, as that term is defined by this regulation, are exempt from the pedigree requirement.\n\nCompliance Policy Guide (CPG) 160.900, which issued in November 2006, remains in effect until December 1, 2007. The CPG describes how FDA intends to prioritize its enforcement efforts regarding the pedigree requirements in the first year after the effective date of 21 CFR SSS 203.3(u) and 203.50. However, FDA will not enforce 203.50(a) as long as the preliminary injunction remains in effect.\n\nAll other definitions in 21 CFR Part 203 that relate to the pedigree requirement, including but not limited to, the definitions of manufacturer and wholesale distribution, have been in effect since December 2000 and remain in effect despite the injunction.\n\nThe names and addresses of all parties to the transaction and the date of the transactions are required by the statute and must be included in the pedigree.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(b). This regulation, which went into effect on December 1, 2006, requires all wholesale distributors (both ADRs and non-ADRs) involved in the distribution of a prescription drug to retain a copy of the pedigree for three years. Accordingly, all wholesale distributors that provide or receive pedigrees after December 1, 2006, must retain copies of the pedigrees for three years.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(c). This regulation, which also went into effect on December 1, 2006, provides that a manufacturer that subjects a drug to additional manufacturing processes is not required to provide a pedigree identifying previous sales of the drug or its components.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.50(d). This regulation also went into effect on December 1, 2006, and requires manufacturers to maintain a current written list of all ADRs, to specify whether each ADR is authorized to distribute all of the manufacturer's drug products or only particular products, to update its list of ADRs on a continuing basis, and to make its list of ADRs available for public inspection or copying. Accordingly, as of December 1, 2006, all manufacturers should have available for public inspection a current list of ADRs that indicates which drug products the ADR is authorized to distribute.\n\n21 CFR SS 203.60. This regulation sets forth certain requirements with respect to the use of electronic records and signatures, record retention, and the availability of records for review and reproduction by FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory and law enforcement officials. This regulation has been in effect since December 2000 and remains in effect despite the injunction.\n\nC Since the court's order only applies to 21 CFR SS 203.50(a), does this mean that the statutory requirement that non-ADRs provide pedigrees that include \"each prior sale, purchase, or trade\" of the drugs is still in effect?\n\nYes. The court order does not enjoin FDA from enforcing the statute. The court order affects only the regulations at 21 CFR SS 203.50(a). It has been FDA's longstanding position, consistent with the language of the PDMA and its legislative history, that, 21 CFR SS 203.50 notwithstanding, the statute itself requires non-ADRs to provide pedigrees that documents each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer. FDA recognizes, however, that confusion regarding the pedigree requirement could cause disruptions or delays in the nation's drug distribution system. Accordingly, as long as the court order remains in effect, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, as described below. To this end, FDA does not intend to enforce the statute insofar as it requires pedigrees to contain information regarding each transaction going back to the manufacturer. Rather, FDA intends to permit non-ADRs to provide pedigrees that include information regarding transactions going back to the manufacturer or the last ADR that handled the prescription drugs. FDA, however, encourages all wholesalers to provide complete pedigrees documenting each prior transaction involving the prescription drug when that information is available.\n\nAppendix D How will FDA apply the court's order outside of the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) and to wholesale distributors that are not plaintiffs in the lawsuit?\n\nFDA believes that limiting application of the preliminary injunction to either the named plaintiffs or the EDNY could lead to confusion and possible disruptions or delays in the nation's drug distribution system and could provide undue advantage to certain wholesale distributors. Accordingly, to the extent that it could be argued that the injunction should be limited in scope, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion in a manner that is consistent with the court's opinion. To this end, as long as the court's order is in effect, FDA does not intend to initiate any enforcement actions against any wholesalers solely for (1) failing to include lot numbers, dosage, container size, or number of containers on a pedigree; or (2) failing to provide a pedigree that goes back to the manufacturer so long as the pedigree otherwise identifies the last authorized distributor of record that handled the drugs.\n\nAppendix E How does the court's order impact what FDA said in the Guidance to Industry: PDMA Pedigree Requirements - Questions and Answers (http://www.fda.gov/cder/regulatory/PDMA/PDMA_qa.pdf)?\n\nTo the extent that Questions 2, 9, 10, 11, 14, 24, 29, and 33 refer to 21 CFR SS 203.50(a), as long as the preliminary injunction is in effect, such references are limited to the scope of the court's order. For example, if the question states that a pedigree include information about each prior transaction going back to the manufacturer, then the answer would be limited to including information going back to the manufacturer or the last ADR that handled the drugs.\n--------------------\nContext title: Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) Requirements- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.2314690351486206", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: Is placing the list of ADRs on the manufacturer's web site adequate to meet the provision of making the list available on request to the public, pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(d)?\n\nYes. We highly encourage manufacturers to post their ADR list on their website in a place and manner that is readily accessible, although they are not required to do so. We note that 21 CFR SS 203.50(d) requires the list to be maintained at the manufacturer's corporate offices even when the list is posted on a website.\n\n8 Where can a pharmacist find the list of ADRs?\n\nPursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(d)(3), manufacturers are required to make their list of ADRs available to the public upon request. However, we recognize that it may be time consuming to get this information from manufacturers' corporate offices. Therefore, we highly encourage manufacturers to post it on their website in a place and manner that is readily accessible. FDA will monitor the accessibility of these lists and determine whether further measures are needed to make this information more readily available to pharmacies.\n\nWhat information does a manufacturer have to provide to a wholesaler to enable that wholesaler to comply with the PDMA?\n\nManufacturers are not required under the PDMA to provide any specific information to wholesale customers. However, the information required under 21 CFR SS 203.50(a) for a pedigree statement may be included in the invoice or similar document that would typically accompany or be associated with any shipment of prescription drug products from a manufacturer to a wholesale distributor. FDA encourages manufacturers to do their part to protect public health by furnishing pedigree information to all of their supply chain partners. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nWhat information does an ADR have to provide to a non-ADR to enable that non-ADR to comply with the PDMA (e.g., to pass a pedigree that lists all prior transactions back to the manufacturer)?\n\nADRs are not required to provide a pedigree, whether they obtained the drug directly from a manufacturer, from an ADR, or from a non-ADR. However, to further advance the shared goals of protecting the public health, FDA encourages all parties in the prescription drug supply chain to cooperate fully by providing pedigrees and information to trading partners for each sale, transfer, or trade of prescription drugs. Therefore, when an ADR sells prescription drugs to another ADR or to a non-ADR, the ADR is encouraged to provide pedigree information obtained at the time of the original purchase of the prescription drugs to its wholesale customers. Each wholesale customer of that ADR, in turn, could then provide updated pedigree information with each successive wholesale distribution. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nIf a wholesaler has ADR status for a particular drug product, but it buys that drug from a non-ADR, is the wholesaler still an ADR for that specific quantity of drugs?\n\nYes. If the specific quantity of drugs purchased from the non-ADR falls within the description contained in the written agreement between that purchasing ADR and the manufacturer, then that purchasing wholesaler would have ADR status for that specific quantity of drugs. However, even though the ADR is not required to provide the pedigree when the product is further distributed, to further advance the shared goals of protecting the public health, FDA encourages all parties in the prescription drug supply chain to cooperate fully by providing pedigree documents and information to trading partners for each sale, transfer, or trade of prescription drugs. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\nWhat definition is used to determine who is a manufacturer and, thus, exempt from providing a pedigree?\n\nFor purposes of the PDMA, \"manufacturer\" is defined under 21 CFR SS 203.3(s), which incorporates the definition from 21 CFR SS 201.1.\n\n13 Are contract manufacturers considered \"manufacturers\" under the PDMA?\n\nYes. A contract manufacturer falls within the definition of a \"manufacturer\" under 21 CFR SS 203.3(s), which incorporates by reference the definition of \"manufacturer\" set forth in 21 CFR SS 201.1. FDA has received several inquiries regarding the status of an NDA-holder under 21 CFR SSS 203.3(s)/201.1 when that NDA-holder's prescription drugs are made by a contract manufacturer. Unless the NDA-holder has performed the operations necessary to achieve \"manufacturer\" status under 21 CFR SS 201.1, that NDAholder is not technically a \"manufacturer\" of the drugs within the meaning of the 21 CFR SS 203.3(s). In such instances, the NDA-holder would therefore not be exempt from the pedigree requirements on the grounds that it was a manufacturer. Thus, for purposes of the PDMA pedigree requirements only, FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion as follows: In those instances where a third party contract manufacturer manufacturers prescription drugs for an NDA-holder, that NDA-holder may also be regarded as a manufacturer of those drugs for purposes of that NDA-holder's compliance with SS 503(e)(1)(A) of the Act, entering into ADR agreements for those prescription drugs, and for purposes of pedigrees created for those prescription drugs. This exercise of enforcement discretion is not intended to relieve the contract manufacturer of its obligations as a manufacturer, including its obligation to register under SS 510 of the Act, nor is it intended to require the NDA-holder to file such a registration unless the NDA-holder would otherwise be obligated to do so.\n\n14 Is a repackager or relabeler exempt from providing a pedigree?\n\nNo. Relabelers and repackagers are not considered to be manufacturers under 21 CFR SS 201.1. Therefore, unless a repackager or relabeler has ADR status with the manufacturer of that product, they are required to provide a pedigree identifying each prior sale, purchase, or trade of the drug. See Addendum Question E at the end of this document.\n\n15 Is a pedigree required if an exclusive distribution agreement exists?\n\nNo, so long as the agreement is in writing. By definition, an exclusivity agreement is a written agreement under which the distributor is authorized to distribute the manufacturer's products for a period or time or for a specified volume of products.\n\nAccordingly, such a written agreement would satisfy the requirements related to ADR status in 21 C.F.R. 203.3(u). Please note that, in such instances, the wholesale distributor named in the agreement would have to be included in the manufacturer's list of ADRs under 21 CFR SS 203.50(d).\n\n16 Do non-ADRs have to provide a pedigree if the customer is a physician's office?\n\nYes. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) requires non-ADRs to provide a pedigree before each wholesale distribution of a drug. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc), wholesale distribution is defined as the distribution of prescription drugs to persons other than a consumer or patient. Although a physician's office is not explicitly mentioned in 21 CFR SS 203.50, which discusses pedigree, it is contemplated within the scope of the language set forth in SS 503(e)(1)(A) of the Act that a pedigree would be provided because physicians offices are not specifically excluded.\n\n17 Are pharmacies required to provide a pedigree when they transfer drug product between pharmacies?For transfers other than intra-company transfers, unless the transfer of prescription drug product from one pharmacy to another is for a documented medical emergency (see 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(5)), or the sale is of minimal quantities of drugs by retail pharmacies to licensed practitioners for office use (see 21 CFR SS 203.3(cc)(10)), retail pharmacies that are not ADRs for the prescription drug products sold or transferred to other retail pharmacies will have to provide a pedigree.\n\nDoes a chain pharmacy warehouse have to provide a pedigree for drugs that it sends to its retail outlets?\n\nNo. Pursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.33(cc)(1), intra-company sales are excluded from the definition of wholesale distribution. FDA considers intra-company transfers, such as those from a chain pharmacy warehouse to its own retail outlets, to fall within the scope of an intra-company sale.\n\nDo pharmacies have to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the pedigree? If so, how should they do this?\n\nNo. Pharmacies do not have this express responsibility under the PDMA, but they are encouraged to perform due diligence in verifying the accuracy of the information and integrity of the source of the drug product.\n\nC Recordkeeping Requirements\n\nWhat are the recordkeeping requirements for pedigree recipients?\n\nPursuant to 21 CFR SS 203.50(b), the pedigree is subject to the record retention requirements in 21 CFR SS 203.60, and must be retained by all wholesale distributors involved in the distribution of the drug product, whether ADR or non-ADR, for 3 years.\n\nIf the pharmacy receiving the pedigree will not itself engage in further distribution of the product to persons other than a consumer or patient, then the pharmacy is not required to maintain that pedigree under 21 CFR SS 203.60. However, consistent with the spirit of the PDMA, FDA encourages pharmacies and other end users to retain the pedigree for 3 years. As a result, if there is any question about the source or history of the product, it can be traced back through the drug supply chain.\n\nIf an ADR obtains drugs from a non-ADR, is the ADR required to maintain the pedigree?\n\nYes. Although an ADR is not required to provide a pedigree, pursuant to 21 CFR SSS 203.50(b), and 203.60(d), an ADR is required to retain the pedigree for 3 years.\n\nPDMA Scope\n\nDoes PDMA apply to veterinary prescription drugs?\n--------------------\nContext title: Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) Requirements- Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.4473911225795746", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 22: See section 505B(e)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(2)(A).\n\nThe sponsor should submit the iPSP to the relevant drug's IND for review by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research as appropriate. In cases where the sponsor has no active IND for the drug but the sponsor expects to open the IND with an initial phase 3 study, the sponsor should submit the iPSP as a pre-IND submission. In this situation, the FDA encourages the sponsor to schedule a pre-IND meeting before submission of the iPSP, and such submission should precede initiation of any phase 3 studies or combined phase 2 and phase 3 studies. In cases where the drug development program includes the possibility of using expedited programs,23 the FDA encourages the sponsor to have discussions about the pediatric development plans with the review division as early as possible.\n\nFootnote 23: For further information on expedited programs, see the guidance for industry Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions\u2014Drugs and Biologics (May 2014).\n\nAfter the sponsor submits an iPSP, the FDA has 90 days to review the iPSP and provide a written response to the iPSP, or meet with the sponsor to discuss the iPSP, as appropriate.24 This review process includes consultation with FDA's internal Pediatric Review Committee (PeRC).25 The sponsor then has a second 90-day period during which it may review FDA comments and initiate any needed negotiations to discuss the iPSP. By the end of this second 90-day review period, the sponsor must submit an agreed iPSP.26 The FDA then has 30 days after receipt of the agreed iPSP to review and issue correspondence confirming agreement or issue correspondence stating disagreement.27 If the FDA does not agree, the iPSP is considered a non-agreed iPSP (see section VIII., Non-Agreed Initial PSPs). The total length of time forreview of an iPSP should not exceed 210 days. A sponsor should not submit a marketing application or supplement until the FDA confirms agreement on the iPSP.\n\nV Content of the Initial Psp\n\nThe FD&C Act requires that an iPSP include \"(i) an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct (including, to the extent practicable, study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints, and statistical approach); (ii) any request for a deferral, partial waiver, or waiver (\\ldots) if applicable, along with any supporting information; and (iii) other information specified in the regulations\" issued by the FDA.28 This section of the guidance describes information that is required or recommended to be included in the iPSP submission. In certain situations, it may be premature to include a detailed outline of a planned pediatric study (or studies) because additional data are needed (e.g., efficacy, safety, potential endpoints). In such cases, the outline of the pediatric studies should include a brief explanation for the lack of more detailed information. The sponsor receives feedback at the time of the review of the iPSP on the planned request for waivers and/or deferrals. For example, the FDA feedback may indicate concurrence with the planned deferral and/or waiver or, if FDA does not concur, include recommendations for the sponsor on the timing of pediatric drug development and on whether to include pediatric data in the initial marketing application instead of obtaining a deferral. However, FDA does not make a formal decision about granting a waiver and/or deferral of required pediatric assessments, or reports on the molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation, until the time of the approval of the marketing application.\n\nFootnote 28: See section 505B(e)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(2)(B).\n\nAppendix: Initial Pediatric Study Plan Template provides a template that we recommend sponsors complete for the iPSP submission.29 The FDA acknowledges that the development program for a drug, including the design of the pediatric studies, may change as the sponsor collects new data from nonclinical studies, clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs (e.g., data from drugs in the same or similar class). The iPSP should include a well-constructed pediatric plan based upon current knowledge of the drug and disease epidemiology; sponsors can submit amendments to an agreed iPSP at any time,30 including changes to the pediatric plan that need to be considered based on additional data described above (see also section VII., Content and Timing of Requested Amendment to an Initial PSP).\n\nFootnote 29: The template also is available at https://www.fda.gov/media/84944/download.\n\nFootnote 30: See section 505B(e)(5) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(5).\n\nIn addition, sponsors can include information in the iPSP (see section 2 in section V.B., Recommendations for the Content of Each Section of the iPSP) about plans for submission of a concurrent or future proposed pediatric study request (PPSR), as appropriate. However, the sponsor should submit the iPSP and PPSR as separate documents to facilitate the FDA's appropriate review and comment.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAlthough, as stated above, the FDA does not make a formal decision about granting a waiver and/or deferral of required pediatric assessments or reports on the molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation until approval of the marketing application, the FDA considers the information contained in an agreed iPSP when considering any requests for waiver and/or deferral at the time of the marketing application review.\n\nMaterially Incomplete iPPs\n\nFailure to include required information may result in an iPSP that the FDA considers materially incomplete. For example, if a sponsor fails to address all pediatric age groups and all indications for which the drug is being developed that are subject to PREA, the FDA generally considers the iPSP to be materially incomplete.31 Additionally, if a sponsor fails to provide justification for any planned waivers or deferrals, the FDA may consider the iPSP to be materially incomplete. If the iPSP is considered materially incomplete, the FDA intends to contact the sponsor, and the sponsor should submit a complete iPSP within 30 days to address the identified deficiencies. A new 210-day review period will start when the sponsor submits a complete iPSP.32\n\nFootnote 31: The FDA anticipates that there will be additional considerations for applications described in section 505B(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act that require submission of reports on the molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation described in section 505B(a)(3) of the FD&C Act. For additional information, see the draft guidances for industry FDARA Implementation Guidance for Pediatric Studies of Molecularly Targeted Oncology Drugs: Amendments to Sec. 505B of the FD&C Act and Pediatric Study Plans for Oncology Drugs: Transitional Information Until Full Implementation of FDARA Section 504: Questions and Answers. When finalized, these guidances will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on these topics.\n\nHowever, if the sponsor includes sufficient information for the FDA to evaluate the plan, even if the FDA disagrees with the proposed plan, the FDA in general considers the iPSP to be sufficient for initial review. For example, if a sponsor includes a plan to request a full waiver with a justification and the FDA disagrees with this plan, the FDA does not intend to consider such disagreement as grounds for a determination that the iPSP is materially incomplete.\n\nRecommendations for the Contents of Each Section of the iPSP\n\nThis section provides specific recommendations for the content of each section of the iPSP.\n\nTitle Page\n\nSponsors should include relevant administrative information on the title page (e.g., drug name, IND number, indication or indications that apply) (see Appendix: Initial Pediatric Study Plan Template).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n1 Overview of the Disease/Condition in the Pediatric Population\n\nThis section should briefly summarize (1 to 3 pages)33 available information on the pathophysiology of the disease, methods of diagnosis, and currently available treatments and/or prevention strategies in the pediatric population, including neonates. The sponsor should also include available information on the incidence and prevalence of the disease in both the overall population and the pediatric population, including in specific age subgroups when appropriate. Additionally, the sponsor should discuss current understanding of and available evidence supporting any similarities and differences between the disease in adults and in the pediatric population.\n\nFootnote 33: The recommended page count for each section of the iPSP applies to the overall iPSP and not to the individual active ingredients in the case of a fixed-dose combination product.\n\n2 Overview of the Drug or Biological Product\n--------------------\nContext title: Pediatric Study Plans- Content of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.299007415771484", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Is a pedigree required if an ADR drop ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to the pharmacy or customer?\n--------------------\nContext: Q29: A man started medications before his partner became pregnant. The baby was born with ADR. Are the following statements correct?\n\nQuestion 29a: A report should be submitted as a parent-child/fetus report.\n\nQuestion 29b: B.1.10 captures the data of the father.\n\nQuestion 29c: Route of administration is unknown. (E2BM IWG0048)\n\nA29: Answer 29a: Yes. The report should be submitted as a parent-child/fetus report. The patient should be the baby.\n\nAnswer 29b: Yes, B.1.10 should be populated with the father's data.\n\nAnswer 29c: Yes, in this case, not enough information was provided to determine the route of administration of the suspected drug to the baby. The route of administration should be indicated as unknown.\n\nQ30: Given the user guidance in the E2BM guideline and the answer to question 10 (E2BM IWG0011) in the Q&A document, please describe the preferred use of B.4.k.15a for the following two scenarios. The reports are from spontaneous sources and exact dates of drug administration are unknown in both instances:\n\nScenario 1: Identifiable patient received drug \"X\" p.o. in hospital for one week and then the same drug/form/dose for two weeks at home. There was a serious, unexpected event and an identifiable reporter, etc.\n\nQuestion 30a: For scenario 1, would it be necessary to repeat B.4.k.15a? That is, should a single entry of (<)3(>) populate the duration field (B.4.k.15b units entry (<)803(>) week) or should the related field repeat with the drug listed twice with (<)1(>) and (<)2(>) populating the corresponding B.4.k.15a field, respectively?\n\nScenario 2: Identifiable patient received drug \"X\" i.v. in hospital for one week and then took the same dose but a different formulation of the same drug/dose p.o. for two weeks at home. There was a serious, unexpected event and an identifiable reporter, etc.\n\nQuestion 30b: For scenario 2, would B.4.k.15a repeat? That is, should a single entry of (<)3(>) populate the duration field or would it be preferable to show the two formulations separately and with two separate entries in the respective duration fields, (<)I(>) and (<)2(>) for the i.v. and p.o. form/administration? Question 30c: Should, for Scenario 2, the drug be listed twice (different forms, per Q(\\&A) 10) and the duration for BOTH show as 3? Question 30d: Should an adjustment be made in the E2B message if there was a known missed dose/day or two in either scenario (to cover the \"intermittent\" user guidance)? (E2BM IWG0050) A30: Answer 30a: For scenario 1, if the drug treatment was continuous, drug \"X\" should be listed in B.4.k.2 (B.4.k.2.1, Proprietary medicinal product name, and B.4.k.2.2, Active drug substance name) with (<)3(>) populating field B.4.k.15a (Duration of drug administration) and (<)803(>) (week) populating field B.4.k.15b (Duration of drug administration unit). Fields B.4.k.15a and B.4.k.15b would not need to be repeated. However, if treatment was stopped between hospital and home, it would be preferred to repeat drug \"X\" in block B.4.k.2 (repeat entries in both field B.4.k.2.1 and field B.4.k.2.2), with values of (<)1(>) and (<)2(>) populating the corresponding duration fields (B.4.k.15a) and (<)803(>) (week) populating the two unit fields (B.4.k.15b). Answer 30b: For scenario 2, drug \"X\" should be listed twice in the repeating block B.4.k.2 with values of (<)1(>) and (<)2(>) populating the two corresponding duration fields (B.4.k.15a) and (<)803(>) populating both of the units fields (B.4.k.15b). The two routes of administration can be indicated by providing separate entries of (<)042(>) (Intravenous not otherwise specified) and (<)048(>) (Oral) in the corrresponding B.4.k.8 fields (Route of administration). Answer 30c: For Scenario 2, a duration value of (<)3(>) in field B.4.k.15a would not be considered appropriate. Answer 30d: An adjustment in the structured data fields need not be made for a known missed dose/day or two in either scenario (in accordance with the \"intermittent\" user guidance); descriptive information can be provided in the dosage text field (B.4.k.6). Q31: ICH E2D states: For regulatory purposes, if an event is spontaneously reported, even if the relationship is unknown or unstated, it meets the definition of an adverse drug reaction. Question 31a: In the case of a spontaneous report with an unstated relationship, does that imply that the fields B.4.k.18.1 through B.4.k.18.4 should be populated with the causality assessment \"possible\" for all the drugs? Question 31b: Can the company have a different opinion from the reporter and state the causality with the same drug is unrelated or unlikely? (E2BM IWG0051) [A31] Answer 31a: If an event is spontaneously reported to a company about the patient who took that company's drug, and the relationship is unstated, it implies a suspected causal relationship to the drug. However, fields B.4.k.18.1 through B.4.k.18.4 should be left blank unless otherwise required by local regulation. Answer 31b: The company's causality assessment can be captured in fields B.4.k.18.1 through B.4.k.18.4 and the sender's comments can be captured in field B.5.4.\n* [Q32] A company wishes to report a fixed combination medicinal product (e.g., ace inhibitor 20 mg and diuretic 12.5 mg). How should we code this information in section B.4, taking into account the need to provide the structured dosage information for this combination? (E2BM IWG0053)\n* [A32] The proprietary medicinal product name of the fixed combination product should be entered in B.4.k.2.1. The active substance for the ace inhibitor should be entered in B.4.k.2.2. B.4.k.2.2 should be repeated and the active substance for the diuretic should be repeated. The dosage information should be entered in B.4.k.6 as free text. In Japan, codes are available for approved combination drugs and can be used in the appropriate fields: B.4.k.2.1 (proprietary medicinal product name) and B.4.k.2.2 (active substance name).\n* [Q33] If a report is forwarded to a company by a Health Authority, should the company consider that: Question 33a: the Health Authority's causality assessment is at least \"possible\"? Question 33b: the reporter's causality assessment is also at least \"possible\"? (E2BM IWG0054)\n* [A33] Answers 33a and 33b: By definition a spontaneous report contains suspected adverse reactions (i.e., a possible causal relationship is suspected but not established). However, there is no universally accepted definition for \"possible\" in the scale of causality assessment. It is therefore not possible to provide a precise answer to this question. It is up to the company and receiver to define causality assessment method and classify the case-reports accordingly.\n* [Q34] _Use of Elements: - B.4.k.5.3  - B.4.k.5.4  -* _B.4.k.5.5 __Can you confirm that it is the case that if any one of the above three elements is provided then all three must be provided, as sending only some of these elements gives information that cannot be interpreted?

(2.12)": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section \"2.9 Photosafety Testing\" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: G. Carcinogenicity (2.7)\n\nThe appropriateness of a carcinogenicity assessment for anticancer pharmaceuticals is described in ICH S1A. Carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer.\n\nH. Immunotoxicity (2.8)\n\nFor most anticancer pharmaceuticals, the design components of the general toxicology studies are considered sufficient to evaluate immunotoxic potential and support marketing. For immunomodulatory pharmacokinetics, additional endpoints (such as immunophenotyping by flow cytometry) might be included in the study design.\n\nI. Photosafety testing (2.9)\n\nAn initial assessment of phototoxic potential should be conducted prior to Phase 1, based on photochemical properties of the drug and information on other members in the class. If assessment of these data indicates a potential risk, appropriate protective measures should be taken during outpatient trials. If the photosafety risk cannot be adequately evaluated based on nonclinical data or clinical experience, a photosafety assessment consistent with the principles described in ICH M3 should be provided prior to marketing.\n\n3 Nonclinical data to support clinical trial design and Marketing (3)\n\nStart Dose for First Administration in Humans (3.1)\n\nThe goal of selecting the start dose is to identify a dose that is expected to have pharmacologic effects and is reasonably safe to use. The start dose should be scientifically justified using all available nonclinical data (e.g., pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicity), and its selection based on various approaches (see Note 2). For most systemically administered small molecules, interspecies scaling of the animal doses to an equivalent human dose is usually based on normalization to body surface area. For both small molecules and biopharmaceuticals, interspecies scaling based on body weight, AUC, or other exposure parameters might be appropriate.\n\nFor biopharmaceuticals with immune agonistic properties, selection of the start dose using a minimally anticipated biologic effect level (MABEL) should be considered.\n\nDose Escalation and the Highest Dose in a Clinical Trial (3.2)\n\nIn general, the highest dose or exposure tested in the nonclinical studies does not limit the dose-escalation or highest dose investigated in a clinical trial in patients with cancer. When a steep dose- or exposure-response curve for severe toxicity is observed in nonclinical toxicology studies, or when no preceding marker of severe toxicity is available, smaller than usual dose increments (fractional increments rather than dose doubling) should be considered.\n\nDuration and Schedule of Toxicology Studies to Support Initial Clinical Trials (3.3)\n\nIn Phase 1 clinical trials, treatment can continue according to the patient's response, and in this case, a new toxicology study is not called for to support continued treatment beyond the duration of the completed toxicology studies.\n\nThe design of nonclinical studies should be appropriately chosen to accommodate different dosing schedules that might be utilized in initial clinical trials. It is not expected that the exact clinical schedule always will be followed in the toxicological study, but the information provided from the toxicity studies should be sufficient to support the clinical dose and schedule and to identify potential toxicity. For example, one factor that can be considered is the half-life in the test species and the projected (or known) half-life in humans. Other factors could include exposure assessment, toxicity profile, saturation of receptors, etc. Table 1 provides examples of nonclinical treatment schedules that are commonly used in anticancer pharmaceutical development and can be used for small molecules or biopharmaceuticals. In cases where the available toxicology information does not support a change in clinical schedules, an additional toxicology study in a single species is usually sufficient.\n\nDuration of Toxicology Studies to Support Continued Clinical Development and Marketing (3.4)\n\nThe nonclinical data to support Phase 1 and the clinical Phase 1 data would normally be sufficient for moving to Phase 2 and into second or first line therapy in patients with advanced cancer. In support of continued development of an anticancer pharmaceutical for patients with advanced cancer, results from repeat dose studies of 3 months' duration following the intended clinical schedule should be provided prior to initiating Phase 3 studies. For most pharmaceuticals intended for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer, nonclinical studies of 3 months' duration are considered sufficient to support marketing.\n\nWhen considering a change in the clinical schedule, an evaluation of the existing clinical data should be conducted to justify such change. If the clinical data alone are inadequate to support the change in schedule, the factors discussed in section III.C (3.3) above should be considered.\n\nCombination of Pharmaceuticals (3.5)\n\nPharmaceuticals planned for use in combination should be well studied individually in toxicology evaluations. Data to support a rationale for the combination should be provided prior to starting the clinical study. In general, toxicology studies investigating the safety of combinations of pharmaceuticals intended to treat patients with advanced cancer are not warranted. If the human toxicity profile of the pharmaceuticals has been characterized, a nonclinical study evaluating the combination is not usually warranted. For studies in which at least one of these compounds is in early stage development (i.e., the human toxicity profile has not been characterized), a pharmacology study to support the rationale for the combination should be provided. This study should provide evidence of increased activity in the absence of a substantial increase in toxicity on the basis of limited safety endpoints, such as mortality, clinical signs, and body weight. Based on available information, a determination should be made whether or not a dedicated toxicology study of the combination is warranted.\n\nNonclinical Studies to Support Trials in Pediatric Populations (3.6)\n\nThe general paradigm for investigating most anticancer pharmaceuticals in pediatric patients is first to define a relatively safe dose in adult populations and then to assess some fraction of that dose in initial pediatric clinical studies. The recommendations for nonclinical testing outlined elsewhere in this document also apply for this population. Studies in juvenile animals are not usually conducted in order to support inclusion of pediatric populations for the treatment of cancer. Conduct of studies in juvenile animals should be considered only when human safety data and previous animal studies are considered insufficient for a safety evaluation in the intended pediatric age group.\n\nOther Considerations (4)\n\nConjugated Products (4.1)\n\nConjugated products are pharmaceuticals covalently bound to carrier molecules, such as proteins, lipids, or sugars. The safety of the conjugated material is the primary concern. The safety of the unconjugated material, including the linker used, can have a more limited evaluation. Stability of the conjugate in the test species and human plasma should be provided. A toxicokinetic evaluation should assess both the conjugated and the unconjugated compound after administration of the conjugated material.\n\nLiposomal Products (4.2)\n\nA complete evaluation of the liposomal product is not warranted if the unencapsulated material has been well characterized. As appropriate, the safety assessment should include a toxicological evaluation of the liposomal product and a limited evaluation of the unencapsulated pharmaceutical and carrier (e.g., a single arm in a toxicology study). The principle described here might also apply to other similar carriers. A toxicokinetic evaluation should be conducted as appropriate. If possible, such an evaluation should assess both the liposomal product and the free compound after administration of the liposomal product.\n\nEvaluation of Drug Metabolites (4.3)\n\nIn some cases, metabolites that have been identified in humans have not been qualified in nonclinical studies. For these metabolites, a separate evaluation is generally not warranted for patients with advanced cancer.\n\nEvaluation of Impurities (4.4)\n\nIt is recognized that impurity standards have been based on a negligible risk, as discussed in ICH Q3A and Q3B. Exceeding the established limits for impurities identified in these ICH guidances could be appropriate for anticancer pharmaceuticals, and a justification should be provided in the marketing application. The justification could include the disease being treated and the patient population, the nature of the parent pharmaceutical (pharmacologic properties, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, etc.), duration of treatment, and the impact of impurity reduction on manufacturing. Further, the qualification assessment could include consideration of either the dose or concentration tested in nonclinical study relative to clinical levels. For genotoxic impurities, several approaches have been used to set limits based on increase in lifetime risk of cancer. Such limits are not appropriate for pharmaceuticals intended to treat patients with advanced cancer, and justifications described above should be considered to set higher limits. Impurities that are also metabolites present in animal and/or human studies are generally considered qualified.\n\nV Notes (5)\n\nFor nonrodent studies, dose groups usually consist of at least 3 animals/sex/group, with an additional 2/sex/group for recovery, if appropriate (see section II.D (2.4)). Both sexes should generally be used, or justification should be given for specific omissions.\n--------------------\nContext title: S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.4164979457855225", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section \"2.9 Photosafety Testing\" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: Photosafety Tests Using In Vivo Assays and Dermal Administration (3.5)\n\nThe main recommendations provided for investigating the systemic route of administration also apply to dermal administration, including those for species selection, study duration, and irradiation conditions. For dermal drug products in general, the clinical formulation should be tested. The intended clinical conditions of administration should be used to the extent possible. Irradiation of the exposed area should take place at a specified time after application, and the interval between application and irradiation should be justified based on the specific properties of the formulation to be tested. Signs of phototoxicity should be assessed based on relevant endpoints (see section III.D(3.4)). The sensitivity of the assay should be demonstrated using appropriate reference compounds. Assessment of systemic drug levels is generally not warranted in dermal phototoxicity studies.\n\nFor dermal drug products, contact photoallergy has often been assessed in a nonclinical study along with acute phototoxicity (photoirritation). However, no formal validation of such assays has been performed. Although the acute photoirritation observed in these studies is considered relevant to humans, the predictivity of these studies for human photoallergy is unknown. For regulatory purposes, such nonclinical photoallergy testing is generally not recommended.\n\nIV Clinical Photosafety Assessment (4)\n\nThere are various options for collecting human data, if warranted, ranging from standard reporting of adverse events in clinical studies to a dedicated clinical photosafety trial. The precise strategy is determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nV Assessment Strategies (5)\n\nThe choice of the photosafety assessment strategy is up to the drug developer. ICH M3(R2) suggests that an initial assessment of the phototoxicity potential based on photochemical properties and pharmacological/chemical class be undertaken before outpatient studies. Characterization of the UV-visible absorption spectrum is recommended as the initial assessment because it can obviate any further photosafety evaluation. In addition, the distribution to skin and eye can be evaluated to inform further on the human risk and the recommendations for further testing. Then, if appropriate, an experimental evaluation of phototoxicity potential (in vitro, in vivo, or clinical) should be undertaken before exposure of large numbers of subjects (phase 3).\n\nFigure 1 provides an outline of possible phototoxicity assessment strategies. The figure is based on the strategies outlined in this section of this guidance. The strategies are flexible. Depending on the particular situation, some portions of the assessment are optional and might not be conducted.\n\nRecommendations for Pharmaceuticals Given via Systemic Routes (5.1)\n\nv.1.1 Assessment of Phototoxicity Potential (5.1.1)\n\nIf the substance does not have an MEC greater than 1000 L mol-1 cm-1 (between 290 and 700 nm), no photosafety testing is recommended and no direct phototoxicity is anticipated in humans. However, it should be noted that phototoxicity by indirect mechanisms (e.g., pseudoporphyria or porphyia), although rare, could still occur. For compounds with MEC values of 1000 L mol-1 cm-1 or higher, if the drug developer chooses to conduct a test for photoreactivity, a negative result could support a decision that no further photosafety assessment is warranted (see section III.B(3.2)). Otherwise, nonclinical and/or clinical photosafety assessment of the substance should be conducted. Available data on the phototoxicity of chemical class-related compounds should be evaluated because this could inform on the approach to be taken.\n\nv.1.2 Evaluation of Phototoxicity (5.1.2)\n\nTo reduce the use of animals in accordance with the 3R principles, a validated in vitro method should generally be considered before conducting animal testing (see, for example, Directive 2010/63/EU). If the drug developer chooses an in vitro approach, the 3T3 NRU-PT is currently the most widely used assay and in many cases could be considered as an initial test for phototoxicity. The high sensitivity of the 3T3 NRU-PT results in good negative predictivity and the negative results are generally accepted as sufficient evidence that a substance is not phototoxic. In such cases no further testing is recommended and no direct phototoxicity is anticipated in humans.\n\nIn some situations (e.g., poorly soluble compounds), an initial assessment of phototoxicity in an in vitro assay might not be appropriate. In this case, an assessment in animals or in humans could be considered. Alternatively, if drug distribution data are available, they could, on a case-by-case basis, support a decision that no further photosafety assessment is warranted (see section II.B(2.2)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSome properties of the clinical formulation that could influence the potential phototoxic response (e.g., penetration into skin, intracellular uptake) cannot be evaluated using the 3T3 NRU-PT alone. Therefore, confirmation of the overall negative result in an evaluation using the clinical formulation and/or monitoring during clinical trials can still be warranted.\n\nReconstructed human skin models can be used to assess the phototoxicity potential of clinical formulations. Under adequate test conditions (see section III.C(3.3)), a negative result in a reconstructed human skin assay indicates that the direct phototoxicity potential of the formulation can be regarded as low. In this case, generally no further phototoxicity testing is recommended (see Note 5 for exception).\n\nIf an appropriate in vitro assay is not available, the initial test could be an in vivo phototoxicity test on the clinical formulation. A negative result in an appropriately conducted in vivo animal phototoxicity study would be sufficient evidence that the formulation is not directly phototoxic and no further phototoxicity testing is recommended (see Note 5 for exception). Alternatively, the phototoxicity potential can be assessed in the clinical setting.\n\nFor dermal products where the API or any new excipient has an MEC value greater than 1000 L mol({}^{\\text{-1}}) cm({}^{\\text{-1}}) at any wavelength between 290 and 700 nm, a photoullergy assessment is generally warranted in addition to phototoxicity testing. Because the predictivity of nonclinical photoullergy tests is unknown, this would typically be a clinical assessment using the to-be-marketed formulation and conducted during phase 3.\n\nPhotosafety evaluation of the clinical formulation delivered via dermal patches can follow the above described principles for clinical dermal formulations. For transdermal patches, the principles for both dermal and systemic drugs should be applied. In addition, the intended clinical use (e.g., skin area recommended for use, duration of application) and the properties of the patch matrix (e.g., being opaque to UV and visible light) should be considered for the overall risk assessment.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n\"otherwise\": data do not support a low potential for phototoxicity or have not been generated (assay/test/evaluation not conducted)\n\nA \"negative\" result in an appropriately conducted in vivo phototoxicity study supersedes a positive in vitro result. A robust clinical phototoxicity assessment indicating no concern supersedes any positive nonclinical results. A positive result in an in vitro phototoxicity test could also, on a case-by-case basis, be negated by tissue distribution data (see text). In the United States, for products applied dermally, a dedicated clinical trial for phototoxicity on the to-be-marketed formulation can be warranted in support of product approval.\n\nClinical evaluation could range from standard reporting of adverse events in clinical studies to a dedicated clinical photosafety trial.\n\nTissue distribution is not a consideration for the phototoxicity of dermal products.\n\nFigure 1: Outline of Possible Phototoxicity Assessment Strategies for Pharmaceuticals Given via Systemic and Dermal Routes\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nVI Endnotes (6)\n\nNote 1:For compounds that absorb at relevant wavelengths, have an MEC value greater than 1000 L mol({}^{\\text{1}}) cm({}^{\\text{-1}}), and are given via ocular routes (e.g., eye drops, intraocular injections), an evaluation of the phototoxicity potential should be undertaken in accordance with the general principles of phototoxicity assessment. Biodistribution of drug in the eye and optical properties of the eye should also be considered. Any available information on the compound or chemical class-related compounds should be considered in the overall assessment.\n\nCompounds that only absorb light at wavelengths below 400 nm and are to be administered as intraocular injections behind the lens (e.g., in the vitreous) are of low concern for retinal phototoxicity, because only light of wavelengths greater than 400 nm reaches the back of the adult eye. However, the lens in children of less than approximately 10 years of age is not completely protective against wavelengths below 400 nm.\n\nNote 2:Testing for photogenotoxicity is not recommended as a part of the standard photosafety testing program. In the past, some regional guidelines (e.g., CPMP/SWP/398/01) have recommended that photogenotoxicity testing be conducted preferentially using a photoclastogenicity assay (chromosomal aberration or micronucleus test) in mammalian cells in vitro. However, experience with these models since the CPMP/SWP guideline was issued has indicated that these tests are substantially oversensitive and even incidences of pseudo-photoclastogenicity have been reported (Ref. 8). Furthermore, the interpretation of photogenotoxicity data regarding its meaning for clinically relevant enhancement of UV-mediated skin cancer is unclear.\n--------------------\nContext title: S10 Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.259760856628418", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section \"2.9 Photosafety Testing\" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: 4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor either species, this design could be adapted to replace the corresponding standard chronic study and a separate juvenile animal study in some circumstances.\n\nThe appropriateness of carcinogenicity testing should be addressed before long-term exposure in pediatric clinical trials. However, unless there is a significant cause for concern (e.g., evidence of genotoxicity in multiple tests, or concern for pro-carcinogenic risk based on mechanistic considerations or findings from general toxicity studies), carcinogenicity studies are not recommended to support the conduct of pediatric clinical trials.\n\nXiii. Immunotoxicity (13)\n\nAs stated in the ICH S8 guidance (Ref. 14), all new human pharmaceuticals should be evaluated for the potential to produce immunotoxicity using standard toxicity studies and additional immunotoxicity studies conducted as appropriate based on a weight-of-evidence review, including immune-related signals from standard toxicity studies. If additional immunotoxicity studies are indicated, these should be completed before exposure of a large population of patients (e.g., phase 3).\n\nXiv. Photosafety Testing (14)\n\nThe appropriateness or timing of photosafety testing in relation to human exposure should be influenced by: (1) the photochemical properties (e.g., photoabsorption and photostability) of the molecule, (2) information on the phototoxic potential of chemically related compounds, (3) tissue distribution, and (4) clinical or nonclinical findings indicative of phototoxicity.\n\nAn initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on a drug's photochemical properties and pharmacological/chemical class should be performed. If assessment of all the available data and the proposed clinical plan indicates a potential for a significant human phototoxicity risk, appropriate protective measures should be taken during outpatient clinical studies. In addition, a subsequent evaluation of the nonclinical drug distribution to skin and eye should be completed to inform further on the human risk and the need for further testing. Then, if appropriate, an experimental evaluation (nonclinical, in vitro or in vivo, or clinical) of phototoxic potential should be undertaken before exposure of large numbers of subjects (phase 3).\n\nAlternatively, instead of the above stepwise approach, a direct assessment of phototoxic potential in a nonclinical or clinical study can be undertaken. If this study is negative, an early assessment of eye/skin distribution studies and clinical protective measures are not called for.\n\nIf the phototoxicity assessment indicates a potential photocarcinogenic risk, the risk can usually be adequately managed in patients by protective measures including a warning statement in the informed consent for clinical trials and in product information for marketing (Note 6).\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor drugs that produce central nervous system activity, regardless of therapeutic indication, it should be considered whether or not an evaluation of abuse liability is warranted. Nonclinical studies should support the design of clinical evaluations of abuse potential, classification/scheduling by regulatory agencies, and product information. There are regional guidance documents on the conduct of nonclinical abuse liability assessment that can be helpful in designing specific abuse liability packages.\n\nNonclinical data collected early in the drug development process can be useful in identification of early indicators of abuse potential. These early indicators would typically be available before first human dose and include the PK/PD profile to identify the duration of action, similarity of chemical structure to known drugs of abuse, receptor binding profile, and behavioural/clinical signs from in vivo nonclinical studies. When no abuse potential is apparent from these early studies, extensive testing in nonclinical abuse liability models might not be warranted. Generally, if the active substance shows signals associated with known abuse liability patterns or the active substance has a novel mechanism of action on the central nervous system, further nonclinical studies are recommended to support large clinical trials (e.g., phase 3).\n\nWhen the metabolite profile and the target for drug activity in rodent are consistent with that of human, the nonclinical abuse liability evaluations should be conducted in rodents. Nonhuman primates should be reserved only for those limited cases where there is clear evidence that they would be predictive of human abuse liability and the rodent model is inadequate. Three types of studies are often completed to evaluate the potential for abuse liability: drug discrimination, self-administration of the compound, and an assessment of withdrawal. When conducted, studies of drug discrimination and self-administration are generally stand-alone. Assessments of withdrawal can sometimes be incorporated within the design of the reversibility arm of a repeated-dose toxicity study. A maximum dose that produces a plasma concentration several-fold higher than that obtained at the therapeutic clinical dose is considered appropriate for these nonclinical abuse assessments.\n\nOther Toxicity Studies (16)\n\nAdditional nonclinical studies (e.g., to identify potential biomarkers, to provide mechanistic understanding) can be useful if previous nonclinical or clinical findings with the product or related products have indicated special safety concerns.\n\nThe approaches for qualifying impurities and degradants are outlined in ICH Q3A and Q3B (Refs. 12 and 13). If specific studies are warranted to qualify an impurity or degradant, generally these studies are not warranted before phase 3 unless there are changes that result in a significant new impurity profile (e.g., a new synthetic pathway, a new degradant formed by interactions between the components of the formulation). In these latter cases, appropriate qualification studies can be warranted to support phase 2 or later stages of development.\n\nCombination Drug Toxicity Testing (17)\n\nThis section covers combination drugs that are intended to be co-packaged or administered in a single dosage form (\"fixed formulation\"). The principles outlined can also apply whendeveloping products that will have product information recommendations for co-use with a specific drug, even if not in a fixed combination, and for which there is minimal clinical information regarding the combination.\n\nCombinations covered might involve: (1) two or more late stage entities (defined as compounds with significant clinical experience (i.e., from phase 3 studies and/ or post marketing))' (2) one or more late stage entity(ies) and one or more early stage entities (defined as compounds with limited clinical experience (i.e., phase 2 studies or less)); or (3) more than one early stage entity. For most combinations which involve two late stage entities and for which there is adequate clinical experience with co-administration, combination toxicity studies would generally not be recommended to support clinical studies or marketing unless there is significant toxicological concern (e.g., similar target organ toxicity). This concern would be modified depending on the margins of safety and the ability to monitor the adverse effects in humans. If a study is being conducted to address a cause for significant toxicological concern, it should generally be completed before carrying out clinical studies with the combination.\n\nWhere there are two late stage products for which there is not adequate clinical experience with co-administration, but there are no causes for significant toxicological concern based on the available data, nonclinical combination studies generally are not recommended to support small-scale, relatively short-duration clinical studies (e.g., phase 2 studies of up to 3 months' duration). Nonclinical combination studies, however, are recommended before large-scale or long-term combination trials, as well as for marketing.\n\nFor combinations of an early stage entity(ies) with clinical experience with a late stage entity(ies), for which there is no significant toxicological concern, combination toxicity studies are not recommended to support clinical proof-of-concept studies of up to one months' duration. The clinical study of the combination should not be longer than the clinical experience of the individual entities. Later stage or longer duration clinical studies should be supported by a nonclinical combination toxicity study.\n\nFor combinations of two early stage entities, nonclinical combination toxicity studies are recommended to support clinical trials.\n\nProvided complete nonclinical development programs are being conducted on the individual entities and a nonclinical combination toxicity study is warranted to support combination clinical trials, the duration of the combination study should be equivalent to that of the clinical trial, up to a maximum duration of 90 days. A 90-day combination toxicity study would also support marketing. A combination toxicity study of shorter duration can also support marketing, depending on the duration of the intended clinical use.\n\nThe design of the nonclinical studies recommended to characterize the combination will depend on the pharmacological, toxicological and PK profiles of the individual entities, the treatment indication(s), the intended patient population, and the available clinical data.\n\nCombination nonclinical studies should generally be limited to a single relevant species. If unexpected toxicity is identified, additional testing can be appropriate.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWhen complete nonclinical development programs are not conducted on the individual entities, then a complete nonclinical toxicology program with the combination only can be appropriate, provided that the individual agents are only intended for use in combination.\n--------------------\nContext title: M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.352623462677002", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section \"2.9 Photosafety Testing\" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: Photosensitization is a general term occasionally used to describe all light-induced tissue reactions. However, in order to clearly distinguish between photoallergy and phototoxicity, the term photosensitization is not used in this guidance.\n\nFor a chemical to demonstrate phototoxicity and/or photoallergy, the following characteristics are critical:\n\nabsorbs light within the range of natural sunlight (290-700 nm)\n\ngenerates a reactive species following absorption of UV-visible light\n\ndistributes sufficiently to light-exposed tissues (e.g., skin, eye)\n\nIf one or more of these conditions are not met, a compound will usually not present a concern for direct phototoxicity. However, increased sensitivity of skin to light can also occur through indirect mechanisms. Such mechanisms are not generally addressed by the testing outlined in this guidance (see also section II.D(2.4)).\n\nII Factors to Consider in the Photosafety Evaluation (2)\n\nPhotochemical Properties (2.1)\n\nThe initial consideration for assessment of photoreactive potential is whether a compound absorbs photons at any wavelength between 290 and 700 nm. A compound that does not have a molar extinction coefficient (MEC) greater than 1000 L mol({}^{-1}) cm({}^{-1}) at any wavelength between 290 and 700 nm (Ref. [3]) is not considered to be sufficiently photoreactive to result in direct phototoxicity (see Note 3 for further details).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nexperience with melanin binding drugs suggests such binding alone does not present a photosafety concern.\n\nA single-dose tissue distribution study, with animals assessed at multiple timepoints after dosing, will generally provide an adequate assessment of relative tissue to plasma concentration ratios, tissue residence time, and the potential for retention and accumulation. Assessment timepoints should be appropriately spaced in such a study to account for the drug half-life.\n\nCompounds activated by visible light and exhibiting long elimination half-lives in internal tissues have been demonstrated to cause injury to those tissues if exposed to intense light during medical procedures. Consequently, for those compounds activated by visible light with potent in vivo phototoxicity or known to be phototoxic based on their mechanism of action, such as photodynamic therapy drugs, distribution to internal tissues should be measured and tissue-specific half-lives estimated. Drugs that only absorb ultraviolet (UV) light or have short tissue elimination half-lives are not likely to present a risk to internal tissues even if they are known to be photoreactive.\n\nMetabolite Considerations (2.3)\n\nMetabolites generally do not warrant separate photosafety assessments, because metabolism does not typically result in chromophores that are substantially different from those in the parent molecule.\n\nPharmacological Properties (2.4)\n\nIn many cases, drug-induced phototoxicity is due to the chemical structure and not the pharmacology. However, certain pharmacologic properties (e.g., immunosuppression, perturbation of heme homeostasis) can enhance susceptibility to light-induced effects, such as skin irritation or UV-induced skin tumor formation. The testing strategies outlined in this document are not designed to detect these types of indirect mechanisms. Some of these indirect mechanisms can be identified and evaluated in other nonclinical pharmacology/toxicity testing; however, phototoxicity related to other indirect mechanisms might only become apparent with human experience.\n\nIII Nonclinical Photosafety Tests (3)\n\nGeneral Considerations (3.1)\n\nCarefully selected conditions that consider both the model system and exposure to a relevant radiation spectrum are critical for nonclinical photosafety testing. Ideally, a nonclinical assay should exhibit both high sensitivity and specificity (i.e., low false negative and low false positive rates). However, to support the assessment strategies described in this document, it is most important that nonclinical photosafety assays show high sensitivity resulting in a low frequency of false negatives (i.e., a high negative predictive value). This is because negative assay results usually do not warrant further photosafety evaluation. The available nonclinical assays, both in vitro and in vivo, are focused primarily on detecting potential phototoxicity, which might or might not translate into clinically relevant phototoxicity.\n\nSelection of irradiation conditions is critical for both in vitro and in vivo assays. Natural sunlight represents the broadest range of light exposure that humans might be exposed to regularly. However, sunlight per se is not well defined and depends on many factors, such as latitude, altitude, season, time of day, and weather. In addition, sensitivity of human skin to natural sunlight depends on a number of individual factors (e.g., skin type, anatomical site and tanning status). Standardized sunlight exposure conditions have been defined by various organizations. Such standards (e.g., CIE-85-1989 (Ref. 5)) should be considered in order to assess suitability of a sunlight simulator light source, and irradiance and irradiation dose should be normalized based on the ultraviolet light A (UVA) part of the applied spectrum. UVA doses ranging from 5 to 20 J/cm({}^{2}) are successfully used in current in vitro and in vivo phototoxicity assays. These UVA doses are comparable to those obtained during prolonged outdoor activities on summer days around noon time, in temperate zones, and at sea level. In humans, sunburn reactions caused by ultraviolet light B (UVB) normally limit total sunlight exposure. In nonclinical phototoxicity assays, however, the amount of UVB should not limit the overall irradiation and might be attenuated (partially filtered) so that relevant UVA doses can be tested without reducing assay sensitivity. Penetration of UVB light into human skin is mainly limited to the epidermis, while UVA can reach capillary blood. Therefore, clinical relevance of photochemical activation by UVB is considered less important than activation by UVA for systemic drugs. However, UVB irradiation is relevant for topical formulations applied to light-exposed tissues.\n\nThe selection and monitoring of appropriate light sources (spectral distribution, irradiance, and dose) and the procedures used should be clearly described in the study methodology (e.g., OECD TG 432 (Ref. 6)).\n\nPhotoreactivity Tests Using Chemical Assays (3.2)\n\nIf a drug developer chooses to assess photoreactivity, the assay should be qualified using pharmaceutical agents under appropriate conditions to demonstrate assay sensitivity. One such assay is an ROS assay (e.g., Ref. 7). Data suggest that this assay has high sensitivity for predicting direct in vivo phototoxicants. However, this assay has a low specificity, generating a high percentage of false positive results. A negative result in this assay, conducted under the appropriate conditions, would indicate a very low probability of phototoxicity, provided a test concentration of 200 (\\mu)M can be achieved, whereas a positive result (at any concentration) would only be a flag for follow-up assessment.\n\nPhototoxicity Tests Using In Vitro Assays (3.3)\n\nA number of in vitro assays have been developed for assessing the phototoxicity potential of chemicals. Some of these assays have not been qualified for use with pharmaceuticals. Some assays involve testing compounds that are dissolved in the culture medium, and such methods are often appropriate for the active ingredient or excipients in drug products, depending on their solubility. Other assays involve direct application to the surface of a tissue preparation and can be appropriate for testing entire formulations intended to be administered topically.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe most widely used in vitro assay for phototoxicity is the 3T3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity test (3T3 NRU-PT) for which an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline (Ref. 6) is available. This is currently considered the most appropriate in vitro screen for soluble compounds.\n\nAlthough the formal European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) validation exercise conducted on this assay indicated a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 84%, experience within the pharmaceutical industry suggests a much lower specificity. The original OECD protocol was not validated for pharmaceuticals specifically. Thus, some modifications to the original OECD protocol have been proposed to address the low specificity observed with drug substances (see Note 4). These proposed changes are appropriate for the testing of pharmaceuticals. The sensitivity of the 3T3 NRU-PT is high, and if a compound is negative in this assay, it would have a very low probability of being phototoxic in humans. However, a positive result in the 3T3 NRU-PT should not be regarded as indicative of a likely clinical phototoxic risk, but rather a flag for follow-up assessment.\n\nThe BALB/c 3T3 cell line is sensitive to UVB, and the initially recommended irradiation conditions (Ref. 6) involve the use of filters to attenuate wavelengths below 320 nm. However, depending on the light source and filters used, the ratio of UVB to UVA can be adjusted such that it is possible to assess UVB-induced phototoxicity in this test. UVB-induced phototoxicity is rarely a problem for pharmaceuticals with systemic exposure because UVB minimally penetrates beyond the epidermis. However, UVB-induced phototoxicity is more relevant for topical products. For components of topically applied products that absorb predominately in the UVB range, and if in vitro assessment is desired, the use of the 3T3 NRU-PT with modified irradiation conditions (see above) can be considered. Alternatively, in vitro skin models, which better tolerate UVB, could be considered.\n--------------------\nContext title: S10 Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.4494520425796509", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals , Section \"2.9 Photosafety Testing\" states that if initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, whe n should nonclinical photosafety studies be conducted? (2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: Tissue distribution is not a consideration for the phototoxicity of dermal products.\n\nFigure 1: Outline of Possible Phototoxicity Assessment Strategies for Pharmaceuticals Given via Systemic and Dermal Routes\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nVI Endnotes (6)\n\nNote 1:For compounds that absorb at relevant wavelengths, have an MEC value greater than 1000 L mol({}^{\\text{1}}) cm({}^{\\text{-1}}), and are given via ocular routes (e.g., eye drops, intraocular injections), an evaluation of the phototoxicity potential should be undertaken in accordance with the general principles of phototoxicity assessment. Biodistribution of drug in the eye and optical properties of the eye should also be considered. Any available information on the compound or chemical class-related compounds should be considered in the overall assessment.\n\nCompounds that only absorb light at wavelengths below 400 nm and are to be administered as intraocular injections behind the lens (e.g., in the vitreous) are of low concern for retinal phototoxicity, because only light of wavelengths greater than 400 nm reaches the back of the adult eye. However, the lens in children of less than approximately 10 years of age is not completely protective against wavelengths below 400 nm.\n\nNote 2:Testing for photogenotoxicity is not recommended as a part of the standard photosafety testing program. In the past, some regional guidelines (e.g., CPMP/SWP/398/01) have recommended that photogenotoxicity testing be conducted preferentially using a photoclastogenicity assay (chromosomal aberration or micronucleus test) in mammalian cells in vitro. However, experience with these models since the CPMP/SWP guideline was issued has indicated that these tests are substantially oversensitive and even incidences of pseudo-photoclastogenicity have been reported (Ref. 8). Furthermore, the interpretation of photogenotoxicity data regarding its meaning for clinically relevant enhancement of UV-mediated skin cancer is unclear.\n\nNote 3:Standardized conditions for determination of MECs are critical. Selection of an adequate solvent is driven by both analytical requirements (e.g., dissolving power, UV-visible light transparency) and physiological relevance (e.g., pH 7.4-buffered aqueous conditions). Methanol is recommended as a preferred solvent and was used to support the MEC threshold of 1000 L mol({}^{\\text{-1}}) cm({}^{\\text{-1}}) (Ref. 3). When measuring UV-visible light spectra, potential limitations (e.g., artifacts due to high concentrations or low solubility, including slow precipitation) should be considered. If the chromophore of the molecule appears to be pH-sensitive (e.g., phenolic structure, aromatic amines, carboxylic acids), an additional spectrum obtained under aqueous, pH 7.4-buffered conditions could add valuable information regarding differences in the shape of the absorption spectrum and in the MECs. If significant differences are seen between measurements obtained in methanol versus pH-adjusted conditions, the MEC threshold of 1000 L mol({}^{\\text{-1}}) cm({}^{\\text{-1}}) cannot be used to obviate further photosafety assessment.\n\nNote 4:A survey of pharmaceutical companies indicated that the 3T3 NRU-PT, as described in OECD TG 432, generates a high percentage of positive results (approximately 50%), the majority of which do not correlate with phototoxicity responses in animals or humans (Ref. 9). Following a retrospective review of data for pharmaceuticals, a reduction of the maximum test concentration from 1000 to 100 (\\upmu)g/mL appears justified (Ref. 10). Compounds without any significant cytotoxicity (under irradiation) up to this limit can be considered as being devoid of relevant phototoxicity. In addition, the category named \"probable phototoxicity\" per OECD TG 432 (i.e.,photoiritation factor (PIF) values between 2 and 5 or mean photo effect (MPE) values between 0.10 and 0.15) is of questionable toxicological relevance for systemic drugs. Compounds in this category generally do not warrant further photosafety evaluations. For compounds with a PIF value between 2 and 5, and for which it is not possible to determine an IC({}_{50}) in the absence of irradiation, it is important to check that the compound is not classified as positive using the MPE calculation (i.e., that the MPE is less than 0.15).\n\nSystemic drugs that are positive in the 3T3 NRU-PT only at in vitro concentrations that are many times higher than drug concentrations likely to be achieved in light-exposed tissues in humans, can, on a case-by-case basis and in consultation with regulatory authorities, be considered to be low risk for phototoxicity in humans, without follow-up in vivo testing.\n\nNote 5: In the United States, for products applied dermally, a dedicated clinical trial for phototoxicity (photoiritation) on the to-be-marketed formulation (API plus all excipients) can be warranted in support of product approval.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nVII Glossary (7)\n\n3T3 NRU-PT:In vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity test.\n\nAssessment:In the context of this document, an assessment is an evaluation of all available information and does not always mean an additional test is conducted.\n\nChromophore:The substructure of a molecule that absorbs visible or ultraviolet light.\n\nDermal Drugs:Products applied topically to the skin.\n\nDirect Phototoxicity:Phototoxicity induced by absorption of light by the drug or excipient.\n\nIndirect Phototoxicity:Phototoxicity due to cellular, biochemical, or physiological alterations caused by the drug or excipient, but not related to photochemical reactivity of the drug or excipient (e.g., perturbation of heme homeostasis).\n\nIrradiance:The intensity of UV or visible light incident on a surface, measured in W/m({}^{2}) or mW/cm({}^{2}).\n\nIrradiation:The process by which an object/subject is exposed to UV or visible radiation.\n\nMec:Molar extinction coefficient (also called molar absorptivity) reflects the efficiency with which a molecule can absorb a photon at a particular wavelength (typically expressed as L mol({}^{-1}) cm({}^{-1})) and is influenced by several factors, such as solvent.\n\nMpe:The mean photo effect is calculated for results of the 3T3 NRU-PT.

(2.12)\n--------------------\nContext: If existing data do not support trials in subjects, nonclinical studies to support a change in the route of administration (e.g., oral to topical) or reformulation of an already approved drug substance may be needed.5 Similarly, if systemic absorption following a change in the route of administration is higher than previously observed, additional pharmacology/toxicology studies may be needed. Sponsors can discuss the need for such studies with the Division of Antiviral Products (DAVP).\n\nFootnote 5: See the guidance for industry and review staff Nonclinical Safety Evaluation of Reformulated Drug Products and Products Intended for Administration by an Alternate Route.\n\niii.1.2 Virology Considerations\n\nNonclinical virology studies can facilitate dose selection and study design to provide proof of concept and data supporting an antiviral claim. Additional recommendations for general antiviral drug development can be found in the guidance for industry Antiviral Product Development -- Conducting and Submitting Virology Studies to the Agency.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nA. Mechanism of action\n\nThe mechanism by which an anti-HSV investigational drug specifically inhibits HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 replication or a virus-specific function should be investigated using cell culture, biochemical, structural, and/or genetic studies that include evaluation of the effect of the drug on relevant stages of the virus life cycle. Mechanism-of-action studies should include appropriate controls for assessing the specificity of anti-HSV activity, which may include assessments of activity against HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 proteins that are targeted by the investigational drug, relevant host proteins, and other viruses.\n\nAntiviral activity in cell culture\n\nHSV-1 and HSV-2 are closely related but distinct viruses, and both cause RHL. The antiviral activity of oral, parenteral, and topical drugs should be characterized in cell culture to assess the anti-HSV-1 and/or anti-HSV-2 activity and to identify a target plasma concentration for the evaluation of oral- or parenteral-administered drug products in HSV-infected subjects. Anti-HSV activity studies should include assessments against several geographically and temporally distinct isolates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 (20 or more of each); the vast majority of which should be U.S. isolates. Sponsors should obtain additional isolates from relevant countries if non-U.S. sites will be used in clinical studies. Sponsors should determine the effective concentration at which virus replication is inhibited by 50 and 90 percent (EC({}{50}) and EC({}{90}) values) for each isolate using a quantitative assay. Sponsors should consider and discuss with the DAVP the merits of developing an investigational drug showing significantly greater activity for HSV-2 compared to HSV-1 given the relative proportions of each in the infected population in the United States.\n\nCytotoxicity and mitochondrial toxicity\n\nThe cytotoxic effects of the drug should be quantified directly in the cells used for assessing anti-HSV activity, and a 50 percent cytotoxic concentration (CC({}{50})), and a therapeutic index (CC({}{50}) value/EC({}_{50}) value) should be calculated. In general, the therapeutic index should be greater than 10. Cytotoxicity should also be assessed using various cell lines and primary cells cultured under proliferating conditions for several cell divisions and nonproliferating conditions. Deoxynucleoside/deoxynucleotide analog inhibitors have been associated with bone marrow precursor cell toxicity, and therefore, sponsors should assess inhibitors for toxicity with appropriate controls.\n\nMitochondrial toxicity for all drugs should be evaluated in a glucose-containing medium and a galactose-containing medium (Marroquin, Hynes, et al., 2007). Sponsors should evaluate mitochondrial toxicity assessments with drug exposures for several cell divisions. Whenever possible, positive controls for mitochondrial toxicity studies should be relevant to the class of the investigational drug. The active triphosphate of nucleoside analog inhibitors also should be evaluated in biochemical assays with mitochondrial DNA and RNA polymerases (Arnold, Sharma, et al., 2012).\n\nSponsors should perform these biochemical and cell-based assessments for potential cellular and mitochondrial toxicity as a complement to in vivo toxicology assessments and not in lieu of in vivo studies. Sponsors should interpret the results from these studies in the context of the in vivo toxicology, nonclinical, and clinical pharmacokinetic data to help assess clinical risk.\n\nd.   Combination antiviral activity\n\nEarly in development, combination antiviral activity relationships of the investigational drug and approved drugs for HSV should be characterized in cell culture to identify any combinations where the antiviral activity is antagonistic if the sponsor anticipates any future combination therapy (e.g., fixed dose combinations, add-on use, co-administration). Each component of a combination drug that will contain at least one novel drug substance should be assessed for antagonism between the components.6 For all combination antiviral activity assessments, sponsors should provide combination index values or synergy scores when the two drugs are combined at their individual EC({}_{50}) values, and studies should include controls for cytotoxicity. Before testing combinations of the drugs in coinfected subjects, combination antiviral activity relationships for nucleos(t)ide and deoxynucleos(t)ide HSV investigational drugs for which there will be systemic exposure should also be assessed with approved drugs for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), as appropriate.\n\ne.   Activity in animal models\n\nDemonstration of HSV-1 and HSV-2 antiviral activity in an animal model is not needed for drug approval. However, if such studies are conducted and provided in support of an HSV therapy program, we recommend including the HSV type, time course plots of viral load data for each animal, and an assessment of resistance development.\n\nf.   Resistance and cross-resistance\n\nAmino acid substitutions associated with the development of resistance to the investigational drug can be identified by genotyping the target gene, and the conferred fold shift in susceptibility can be determined using appropriate cell culture assays. Sponsors can use the results from these studies to: (1) identify resistance pathways; (2) validate resistance assays for use in clinical trials; (3) determine whether the genetic barrier for resistance development is high or low; (4) predict whether the genetic barrier for resistance may vary as a function of concentration of the investigational drug; (5) assess the potential for cross-resistance with other anti-HSV drugs, particularly acyclovir; and (6) support the drug's hypothesized mechanism of action. Resistant viruses selected in cell culture provide important controls for phenotypic assessment of clinical isolates.\n\nResistance studies can include evaluation of the potential for cross-resistance, both to approved drugs and to drugs in development when possible, particularly focusing on those in the same drug class and other classes targeting the same protein or protein complex. The antiviral activity of the investigational drug can be assessed against mutant viruses that are resistant to drugs within the same drug class as the investigational drug as well as assessed against a representative sample of viruses resistant to other approved anti-HSV drugs.\n\nDeoxynucleoside analogs for the treatment of herpes viruses have been found to have antiviral activity against HIV-1 and can select for resistant variants (Tachedjian, Hooker, et al. 1995; McMahon, Siliciano, et al. 2008; Lisco, Vanpouille, et al. 2008). Sponsors of such drugs for HSV should determine the cell culture antiviral activity of the active moiety against HIV-1. If the drug demonstrates antiviral activity, sponsors should determine genotypically and phenotypically the development of resistance to the investigational drug by selecting resistant HIV-1 variants. Resistance studies should include evaluation of cross-resistance to approved nucleo(t)side reverse transcriptase inhibitors for HIV-1.\n\nii.1.3 Early Phase Clinical Considerations\n\nThe extent of this development phase depends on whether the treatment under study is a new molecular entity or a previously approved drug seeking a new indication with or without a new route of administration or a new formulation. In all cases, the DAVP will consult with the Division of Dermatology and Dental Products to assess the need for dermatologic safety studies for drugs being developed for topical administration.\n\na. (\\qquad)Investigational drugs\n\nThe development program for orally or topically administered investigational drugs should include standard phase 1 safety studies as specified in the guidance for industry, investigators, and reviewers Exploratory IND Studies. Following phase 1, the FDA strongly advises sponsors to progress to proof-of-concept and dose-ranging phase 2 trials to establish a sufficiently well-tolerated and active dose for phase 3 trials. The phase 2 trials can be of similar design to phase 3 trials, albeit smaller. The primary objective should be a reduction in the duration of the episode of RHL by at least 1/2 day. The number of phase 2 trials needed to proceed to phase 3 clinical development depends on the treatment under study and the safety and efficacy results observed in at least one such trial.\n\nOf note, a phase 2 dose-response trial is one type of adequate and well-controlled trial that, if measuring appropriate endpoints in appropriate populations, can contribute to substantial evidence of effectiveness (21 CFR 314.126). In addition, dose- or exposure-response analyses within trials can provide additional support for approval of different doses or dosing regimens.\n--------------------\nContext title: Recurrent Herpes Labialis- Developing Drugs for Treatment and Prevention \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.431706428527832"], "When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?\n--------------------\nContext: 14.20 Introducing an intermediate or API, including one that does not conform to standards or specifications, back into the process and reprocessing by repeating a crystallization step or other appropriate chemical or physical manipulation steps (e.g., distillation, filtration, chromatography, milling) that are part of the established manufacturing process is generally considered acceptable. However, if such reprocessing is used for a majority of batches, such reprocessing should be included as part of the standard manufacturing process.\n14.21 Continuation of a process step after an in-process control test has shown that the step is incomplete is considered to be part of the normal process. This is not considered to be reprocessing.\n14.22 Introducing unreacted material back into a process and repeating a chemical reaction is considered to be reprocessing unless it is part of the established process. Such reprocessing should be preceded by careful evaluation to ensure that the quality of the intermediate or API is not adversely impacted due to the potential formation of by-products and over-reacted materials.\n14.3 Reworking\n14.30 Before a decision is taken to rework batches that do not conform to established standards or specifications, an investigation into the reason for non-conformance should be performed.\n14.31 Batches that have been reworked should be subjected to appropriate evaluation, testing, stability testing if warranted, and documentation to show that the reworked product is of equivalent quality to that produced by the original process. Concurrent validation is often the appropriate validation approach for rework procedures. This allows a protocol to define the rework procedure, how it will be carried out, and the expected results. If there is only one batch to be reworked, then a report can be written and the batch released once it is found to be acceptable.\n14.32 Procedures should provide for comparing the impurity profile of each reworked batch against batches manufactured by the established process.

Deviations should be documented and evaluated. Time limits may be inappropriate when processing to a target value (e.g., pH adjustment, hydrogenation, drying to predetermined specification) because completion of reactions or processing steps are determined by in-process sampling and testing.\n\n8.21 Intermediates held for further processing should be stored under appropriate conditions to ensure their suitability for use.\n\nIn-process Sampling and Controls\n\n8.30 Written procedures should be established to monitor the progress and control the performance of processing steps that cause variability in the quality characteristics of intermediates and APIs. In-process controls and their acceptance criteria shouldbe defined based on the information gained during the development stage or historical data.\n\n8.31 The acceptance criteria and type and extent of testing can depend on the nature of the intermediate or API being manufactured, the reaction or process step being conducted, and the degree to which the process introduces variability in the product's quality. Less stringent in-process controls may be appropriate in early processing steps, whereas tighter controls may be appropriate for later processing steps (e.g., isolation and purification steps).\n\n8.32 Critical in-process controls (and critical process monitoring), including the control points and methods, should be stated in writing and approved by the quality unit(s).\n\n8.33 In-process controls can be performed by qualified production department personnel and the process adjusted without prior quality unit(s) approval if the adjustments are made within pre-established limits approved by the quality unit(s).

However, a process is likely to encounter sources of variation that were not previously detected or to which the process was not previously exposed. Many tools and techniques, some statistical and others more qualitative, can be used to detect variation, characterize it, and determine the root cause. We recommend that the manufacturer use quantitative, statistical methods whenever appropriate and feasible. Scrutiny of intra-batch as well as inter-batch variation is part of a comprehensive continued process verification program under SS 211.180(e).\n\nWe recommend continued monitoring and sampling of process parameters and quality attributes at the level established during the process qualification stage until sufficient data are available to generate significant variability estimates. These estimates can provide the basis for establishing levels and frequency of routine sampling and monitoring for the particular product and process. Monitoring can then be adjusted to a statistically appropriate and representative level. Process variability should be periodically assessed and monitoring adjusted accordingly.\n\nVariation can also be detected by the timely assessment of defect complaints, out-of-specification findings, process deviation reports, process yield variations, batch records, incoming raw material records, and adverse event reports. Production line operators and quality unit staff should be encouraged to provide feedback on process performance. We recommend that the quality unit meet periodically with production staff to evaluate data, discuss possible trends or undesirable process variation, and coordinate any correction or follow-up actions by production.\n\nData gathered during this stage might suggest ways to improve and/or optimize the process by altering some aspect of the process or product, such as the operating conditions (ranges and set-points), process controls, component, or in-process material characteristics. A description of the planned change, a well-justified rationale for the change, an implementation plan, and quality unit approval before implementation must be documented (SS 211.100). Depending on how the proposed change might affect product quality, additional process design and process qualification activities could be warranted.19\n\nFootnote 19: Certain manufacturing changes may call for formal notification to the Agency before implementation, as directed by existing regulations (see, e.g., 21 CFR 314.70 and 601.12).\n\nMaintenance of the facility, utilities, and equipment is another important aspect of ensuring that a process remains in control. Once established, qualification status must be maintained through routine monitoring, maintenance, and calibration procedures and schedules (21 CFR part 211,subparts C and D). The equipment and facility qualification data should be assessed periodically to determine whether re-qualification should be performed and the extent of that re-qualification. Maintenance and calibration frequency should be adjusted based on feedback from these activities.\n\nV Concurrent release of PPQ batches\n\nIn most cases, the PPQ study needs to be completed successfully and a high degree of assurance in the process achieved before commercial distribution of a product. In special situations, the PPQ protocol can be designed to release a PPQ batch for distribution before complete execution of the protocol steps and activities, i.e., concurrent release. FDA expects that concurrent release will be used rarely.\n\nConcurrent release might be appropriate for processes used infrequently for various reasons, such as to manufacture drugs for which there is limited demand (e.g., orphan drugs, minor use and minor species veterinary drugs) or which have short half lives (e.g., radiopharmaceutical, including positron emission tomography drugs). Concurrent release might also be appropriate for drugs that are medically necessary and are being manufactured in coordination with the Agency to alleviate a short supply.\n\nConclusions about a commercial manufacturing process can only be made after the PPQ protocol is fully executed and the data are fully evaluated. If Stage 2 qualification is not successful (i.e., does not demonstrate that the process as designed is capable of reproducible performance at commercial scale), then additional design studies and qualification may be necessary. The new product and process understanding obtained from the unsuccessful qualification study(ies) can have negative implications if any lot was already distributed. Full execution of Stages 1 and 2 of process validation is intended to preclude or minimize that outcome.\n\nCircumstances and rationale for concurrent release should be fully described in the PPQ protocol. Even when process performance assessment based on the PPQ protocol is still outstanding, any lot released concurrently must comply with all CGMPs, regulatory approval requirements, and PPQ protocol lot release criteria. Lot release under a PPQ protocol is based upon meeting confidence levels appropriate for each quality attribute of the drug.\n\nWhen warranted and used, concurrent release should be accompanied by a system for careful oversight of the distributed batch to facilitate rapid customer feedback. For example, customer complaints and defect reports should be rapidly assessed to determine root cause and whether the process should be improved or changed. Concurrently released lots must also be assessed in light of any negative PPQ study finding or conclusions and appropriate corrective action must be taken (SSSS 211.100(a), 211.180(e), and 211.192). We recommend that each batch in a concurrent release program be evaluated for inclusion in the stability program. It is important that stability test data be promptly evaluated to ensure rapid detection and correction of any problems.\n\nVI Documentation\n\nDocumentation at each stage of the process validation lifecycle is essential for effective communication in complex, lengthy, and multidisciplinary projects. Documentation is important so that knowledge gained about a product and process is accessible and comprehensible to others involved in each stage of the lifecycle. Information transparency and accessibility are fundamental tenets of the scientific method. They are also essential to enabling organizational units responsible and accountable for the process to make informed, science-based decisions that ultimately support the release of a product to commerce.\n\nThe degree and type of documentation required by CGMP vary during the validation lifecycle. Documentation requirements are greatest during Stage 2, process qualification, and Stage 3, continued process verification. Studies during these stages must conform to CGMPs and must be approved by the quality unit in accordance with the regulations (see SSSS 211.22 and 211.100). Viral and impurity clearance studies, even when performed at small scale, also require quality unit oversight.\n\nCGMP documents for commercial manufacturing (i.e., the initial commercial master batch production and control record (SS 211.186) and supporting procedures) are key outputs of Stage 1, process design. We recommend that firms diagram the process flow for the full-scale process. Process flow diagrams should describe each unit operation, its placement in the overall process, monitoring and control points, and the component, as well as other processing material inputs (e.g., processing aids) and expected outputs (i.e., in-process materials and finished product). It is also useful to generate and preserve process flow diagrams of the various scales as the process design progresses to facilitate comparison and decision making about their comparability.\n\nVII Analytical Methodology\n\nProcess knowledge depends on accurate and precise measuring techniques used to test and examine the quality of drug components, in-process materials, and finished products. Validated analytical methods are not necessarily required during product- and process-development activities or when used in characterization studies. Nevertheless, analytical methods should be scientifically sound (e.g., specific, sensitive, and accurate) and provide results that are reliable. There should be assurance of proper equipment function for laboratory experiments. Procedures for analytical method and equipment maintenance, documentation practices, and calibration practices supporting process-development efforts should be documented or described. New analytical technology and modifications to existing technology are continually being developed and can be used to characterize the process or the product. Use of these methods is particularly appropriate when they reduce risk by providing greater understanding or control of product quality. However, analytical methods supporting commercial batch release must follow CGMPs in parts 210 and 211. Clinical supply production should follow the CGMPs appropriate for the particular phase of clinical studies.\n\nGlossary\n\nCapability of a process:\n\nAbility of a process to produce a product that will fulfill the requirements of that product. The concept of process capability can also be defined in statistical terms. (ISO 9000:2005)\n\nCommercial manufacturing process:\n\nThe manufacturing process resulting in commercial product (i.e., drug that is marketed, distributed, and sold or intended to be sold).

This includes OEMs who reprocess SUDs. The requirement does not apply to OEMs' manufacture of the original, non-reprocessed device, however.\n\nOverview of Validation Data\n\n9. In general, what validation data must be included in a 510(k) for a listed reprocessed SUD under MDUFMA?\n\nMDUFMA requires that 510(k)s for listed reprocessed SUDs include \"validation data, [as] specified by the Secretary, regarding cleaning and sterilization, and functional performance demonstrating that the [SUD] will remain substantially equivalent to a predicate device after the maximum number of times the device is reprocessed as intended by the person submitting the premarket notification.\" MDUFMA section 302(b) (the Act SS 510(o)(1)(A)).\n\n10 How does FDA define \"validation\"?\n\nFDA has defined validation in the context of the Quality System Regulation, 21 CFR Part 820, as follows:\n\nSS 820.3(z) \"Validation means confirmation by examination and provision of objective evidence that the particular requirements for a specific intended use can be consistently fulfilled.\n\nProcess validation means establishing by objective evidence that a process consistently produces a result or product meeting its predetermined specifications.*\n\nDesign validation means establishing by objective evidence that device specifications* conform with user needs and intended use(s).\"\n\n**SS 820.3(y) \"Specification means any requirement with which a product, process, service, or other activity must conform.\"\n\n11 Where can I obtain more information on design and process validation?\n\nDesign and process validation requirements are further detailed in 21 CFR Part 820, Quality System Regulation. An educational guidance document is available for design controls, which include design validation, on FDA's web site at www.fda.gov/cdrh/comp/designgd.html. Also, the Global Harmonization Task Force has an educational guidance document on process validation found at www.ghtf.org/sg3/sg3-final.html. (Note: FDA's Quality System regulation does not permit the use of option E in Figure 1 of the Global Harmonization Task Force's Process Validation Guidance.)\n\n12 How does FDA interpret the scope of validation data required under MDUFMA?\n\nFDA interprets validation data as broad in scope, including information about processing at the point of use to the completion of packaging and sterilization, and other post-process considerations. This guidance provides more discussion on validation data in Section III. Cleaning, sterilization, and functional performance validation of reprocessed SUDs include aspects of both design validation and process validation. Design validation, in this case, should incorporate both the design of the product and the design of the processes to be used in reprocessing the device.\n\nFDA interprets the cleaning process to include all steps to remove, inactivate, or contain contamination, beginning immediately after clinical use of the device, and all subsequent steps to decontaminate and clean a device up to packaging and prior to the first step of the sterilization process. This includes all quality control tests.\n\nA clean device, as specified by the reprocessor, should be the input for the sterilization process. FDA interprets the sterilization process as beginning after packaging and any preconditioning other than cleaning (e.g., prehumidification for ethylene oxide (EO)) to the end of any post-process conditioning.\n\nManufacturers should assess functional performance after the cleaning and sterilization process validations. Successful process validations then support the overall design validation. The results of the cleaning and sterilization validations provide objective evidence that the particular requirements for a specific intended use can be consistently fulfilled and are equivalent to those of the predicate device.\n\n13 What are some general considerations regarding validation of reprocessed SUDs?\n\nProper design validation helps ensure equivalent functional performance of the device for established user needs and intended uses. The design of the product, in part, is dictated by the design of the original device because the manufacturer is starting with an existing device, albeit used at least once. Therefore, it is vital that the manufacturer understand and document the incoming device specifications important to safe and effective use (i.e., those of the original device), in order to understand the effects of any reprocessing, to develop the acceptance criteria for both the processes and the finished product that will be distributed, and to help establishequivalent performance. The design validation must be performed according to established procedures. The established procedures that define device specifications should include processing specifications, operating conditions, and acceptance criteria for both product and processes. See 21 CFR SS 820.30.\n\nThe design validation must also include a risk analysis when appropriate. See 21 CFR SS 820.30(g). The risk analysis should document: the identification of hazards originating from the product, the processes utilized by the manufacturer and the users of the device both before reprocessing and after; the tools utilized to analyze the source(s) of the hazard(s); and the risk estimation. Additionally, the design validation should then address how these risks are managed and shown to be acceptable and equivalent to those of the original device. (For further information and guidance on Risk Management and Risk Analysis, see ISO 14971.)\n\nDesign validation should also encompass a procedure for keeping track of and assessing any\n\nOEM changes in specifications, components, or materials in the original devices. The analysis of changes ensures that the design validation performed originally continues to be valid for the devices being reprocessed. Further, there should be a method that analyzes and demonstrates that any repairs or part replacements are equivalent to the original specifications used as the basis for the reprocessor's design validation.\n\nIn addition, the design validation should specify how many times the particular device being\n\nvalidated can undergo reprocessing. This helps decrease the risk of long-term adverse effects\n\nand helps ensure that the manufacturer can demonstrate after each reprocessing that the device is substantially equivalent to the originally marketed device and meets its intended use and user needs. The maximum number of times the reprocessor recommends that the device be\n\nreprocessed should also play an important role in the cleaning and sterilization process\n\nvalidations.\n\nWhile cleaning and sterilization procedures, materials, and product performance/verification testing are developed and assessed during design, these processes must also undergo process\n\nvalidations, as required by 21 CFR SS 820.75. Traditionally, process validation encompasses a series of installation qualifications, operational qualifications, and performance qualifications.\n\n14 How does MDUFMA affect documentation of validation reports by a reprocessor?\n\nThere is no change to the requirements under the quality system regulation for documentation of validation for a device. Reprocessors must continue to maintain records of their validation activities. See 21 CFR 820.30(j). Prior to MDUFMA, validation data could be requested by FDA on a device-specific basis if FDA believed it was pertinent to a finding of substantial equivalence. MDUFMA adds the requirement that validation data pertaining to cleaning and sterilization, and functional performance must now be submitted with the 510(k) for certain devices identified by FDA.\n\nCan a manufacturer use FDA-recognized standards to reduce the amount of specific validation documentation in a 510(k) submission for a reprocessed SUD?\n\nFDA can not accept a declaration or statement of conformity in lieu of cleaning, sterilization, or functional performance validation data for those reprocessed SUDs listed in the FR because 10 MDUFMA requires the submission of validation data for those device types.\n\nFootnote 10: See 70 FR 56911 (www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/98fr/05-19509.pdf) for a complete listing of all device types subject to the validation data requirement.\n\nSubmission of Validation Data to FDA\n\nWhat is the recommended format and content for 510(k)s subject to the MDUFMA validation data requirements?\n\nA 510(k) for a listed reprocessed SUD should be identified as such and:\n\nFormat for Traditional and Abbreviated 510(k)s. See CDRH's website at www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/1567.html.\n\nshould address information discussed in any relevant FDA device-specific guidance and guidance generally applicable to premarket submissions for medical devices; and\n\nmust contain validation data (MDUFMA SS 302(b)). This should be included in the test report section of the 510(k).\n\nFDA accepts and encourages the submission of electronic copies from any manufacturer that wishes to submit an electronic copy with a premarket submission. (See CDRH's website at entitled, Electronic Copies for Premarket Submissions, at www.fda.gov/cdrh/elecsub.html.)\n\nIf a 510(k) is submitted prior to publication of a MDUFMA list adding that device type and the substantial equivalence (SE) decision is still pending, must the reprocessor submit the validation data before FDA renders its decision?\n--------------------\nContext title: Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, Validation Data in Premarket Notification Submissions (510(k)s) for Reprocessed Single-Use Medical Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.227963924407959", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?\n--------------------\nContext: We recommend that the following parameters as listed in Table 1 should be assessed to assure an overall statistically-based level of product conformance:\n\nresidual WBC content\n\npercent recovery of the original component OR per the manufacturer's specifications.\n\nPlasma components, when manufactured under cGMP, may inherently have a residual WBC content of (<5.0) x (10^{6}) per unit. Currently accepted and validated cell counting procedures may need to be modified for plasma components. Plasma components (including Fresh Frozen Plasma and Cryoprecipitated Antihemophilic Factor) may be\n\nInvestigation of Product Performance Qualification Failure\n\nSection 211.192 (21 CFR 211.192) requires that the failure of a batch or any of its components to meet any of its specifications be thoroughly investigated. If a post-filtration residual WBC count is (\\geq) 5 x 10({}^{6}) ((\\geq) 8.3 x 10({}^{5}) for unpooled Platelets) and/or fails to meet the percent recovery of the original component during validation, you must conduct an investigation of the product performance qualification failure (21 CFR 211.192 and 606.100(c)).\n\nYou must investigate collections that fail to meet the percent Red Blood Cell recovery or Platelet recovery criteria (21 CFR 211.192 and 606.100(c)). However, the component may be released if the actual platelet yield or Red Blood Cell volume is determined to be suitable by the quality control unit and the component is labeled appropriately.\n\nProduct performance qualification failures may occur due to conditions not resulting from a failure of the process. For example, if the observed failure is investigated and found to be due to a donor-specific factor, it does not constitute a process failure and should be excluded from the performance qualification evaluation.\n\nWhen a failure during product performance qualification is investigated and found to be due to an identified donor-specific factor, we encourage you to flag the donor record. Upon a subsequent occurrence of incomplete filtration or inadequate WBC removal, we encourage you to consider not using this donor for future donations of leukocytes reduced components.\n\nRe-Qualification/Re-Validation\n\nExceeding the allowable process failures of the product performance qualification may indicate that the process is not in control. You must investigate and take appropriate follow-up action on the source of this failure (21 CFR 211.192 and 606.100(c)) and should repeat validation.\n\nThe manufacturer may provide re-qualification requirements for the device used in the leukocyte reduction process.\n\nIV Quality assurance and monitoring\n\nQuality assurance (QA) is the sum of activities planned and performed to provide confidence that all systems and system elements that influence the quality of the component are functioning as expected (Ref. [30]). When this is demonstrated, the process is considered to be in a state of control. The determination of whether a process is operating in a state of control is made by analyzing the day-to-day process, performance variability and the data for conformance with the manufacturer's specifications. Please refer to FDA's \"Guideline for Quality Assurance in Blood Establishments\" (Ref. [30]) for assistance in developing a QA and monitoring program. This program is distinct from the initial validation described in section III.\n\nYou must have a QC unit that has the responsibility and authority to approve or reject all components, containers, closures, in-process materials, packing materials, labeling and drug products and the authority to review production records to assure that no errors have occurred or, if errors have occurred, that they have been fully investigated (21 CFR 211.22(a)). Thus, the QC unit's responsibilities include the review of production records, and the review of complaints involving the possible failure of a product to meet its specifications (See, for example, 21 CFR 211.22, 211.192, 211.198, and 606.100(c)). In addition, your laboratory control procedures must include adequate provisions for monitoring the reliability, accuracy, precision and performance of laboratory test procedures and instruments (21 CFR 606.140(b)).\n\nComponent Testing\n\nA QA program should include in-process monitoring of the manufacturing procedures and QC testing (Ref. [16]).\n\nUnder 21 CFR 211.160(b), laboratory controls must include the establishment of scientifically sound and appropriate specifications, standards, sampling plans and test procedures. We will consider statistical plans that confirm a (<5\\%) non-conformance rate with 95% confidence.\n\nOne example of a scientifically sound statistical sampling and analytic plan is based on a two-stage binomial approach. The sampling sizes described in section III.F will confirm with 95% confidence a (<5\\%) non-conformance rate for residual WBC counts. Another example of a scientifically sound plan is based on the hypergeometric distribution (see Appendix). The hypergeometric plan is only for quality control sampling plans and cannot be used for validation. Other statistical plans may also be appropriate, such as the use of scan statistics (Ref. [32]) or a lower confidence limit (e.g., for platelet yields we will consider statistical plans that confirm a (<5\\%) non-conformance rate with 75% confidence).\n\nAs part of your QC procedures, we recommend that you:\n\ndefine a plan which representatively identifies collections to be tested for each component type (Whole Blood, Red Blood Cells, Platelets and Plasma) and ensures testing for each leukocyte reduced method (i.e., each filter type in use or each type of apheresis collection device) as detailed in Table 2;\n\ntest the component (Whole Blood, Red Blood Cells, Plasma, Platelets);\n\ntest for the residual WBC count within 48 hours after collection (Ref. [33]), or per the manufacturer's directions for the cell counting methodology;\n\ntest for percent recovery of the original component for Whole Blood, Red Blood Cells or Platelets or per manufacturer's directions for use (e.g., minimum Red Blood Cell volume);* determine the volume of the collection/component on the day of QC testing, after removal of all samples;\n\ndefine procedures for investigating failures during QC, including the criteria that will categorize a failure as either a process or non-process failure. Incomplete filtration and post-filtration residual WBC counts in excess of the defined standards are to be considered as two distinct types of process failure.\n\nAppendix B Equipment/Ancillary Supplies\n\nEquipment must be observed, standardized, and calibrated on a regularly scheduled basis as prescribed in the Standard Operating Procedures Manual (21 CFR 606.60(a)). Such equipment includes, but may not be limited to the ABCS, cell counting instrument(s), scales, blood shaker and STCD.\n\nSupplies and reagents must be used in a manner consistent with instructions provided by the manufacturer (21 CFR 606.65(e)). In addition, all supplies (including filters) and reagents must meet all of the requirements described in 21 CFR 606.65.\n\nAppendix C Operator Training\n\nOperators must have adequate training, education, experience, or combination thereof, to assure competent performance of their assigned functions (21 CFR 606.20(b)). Control\n\n({}^{*})Multiple units of Platelets are often pooled after storage and prior to filtration, rather than filtered individually prior to storage and pooling. In this instance, the pooled and then filtered product for transfusion should contain (<) 5.0 x 10({}^{6}) residual WBCs. For example, for an adult transfusion recipient, multiple units of Platelets (4-6 units) are pooled into a single platelet dose. The total (4-6 units) should contain (<) 5.0 x 10({}^{6}) residual WBCs. The same recommendation for (<) 5.0 x 10({}^{6}) residual WBCs applies if platelet units are pooled before storage, whether filtered before or after storage.\n\n({}^{***})Or per the device manufacturer\u2019s specifications, if different.\n\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: For blood and blood components (other than Platelets, Pheresis({}^{5})), we recommend the following QC results to be acceptable:over operational variables should be maintained through initial and continued staff training, routine staff participation in leukocyte reduction and periodic assessment of operator performance. We recommend that assessment of operators include scheduled competency assessment and proficiency testing. In addition, we recommend that you develop appropriate training on leukocyte reduction processes and procedures and/or equipment maintenance as updated information becomes available.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures\n\nRequirements for Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) Equipment used for leukocyte reduction must \"perform in the manner for which it was designed\" (21 CFR 606.60(a)). Supplies and reagents must be used in a manner consistent with the instructions provided by the manufacturer (21 CFR 606.65(e)). Written SOPs must be maintained and must include all steps to be followed in the collection, processing, compatibility testing, storage, and distribution of blood and blood components (21 CFR 606.100(b)). Therefore, you must have written SOPs for each step in the collection and processing of leukocytes reduced Whole Blood and blood components.\n--------------------\nContext title: Pre-Storage Leukocyte Reduction of Whole Blood and Blood Components Intended for Transfusion Final Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.425448417663574", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: When considering the information from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , 4.2.4 Is any reprocessing of components or product proposed?\n--------------------\nContext: Other critical activities should be witnessed or subjected to an equivalent control. (8.13)\n\nActual yields should be compared with expected yields at designated steps in the production process. Expected yields with appropriate ranges should be established based on previous laboratory, pilot scale, or manufacturing data. Deviations in yield associated with critical process steps should be investigated to determine their impact or potential impact on the resulting quality of affected batches. (8.14)\n\nAny deviation should be documented and explained. Any critical deviation should be investigated. (8.15)\n\nThe processing status of major units of equipment should be indicated either on the individual units of equipment or by appropriate documentation, computer control systems, or alternative means. (8.16)\n\nMaterials to be reprocessed or reworked should be appropriately controlled to prevent unauthorized use. (8.17)\n\nTime Limits (8.2)\n\nIf time limits are specified in the master production instruction (see 6.40), these time limits should be met to ensure the quality of intermediates and APIs. Deviations should be documented and evaluated. Time limits may be inappropriate when processing to a target value (e.g., pH adjustment, hydrogenation, drying to predetermined specification) because completion of reactions or processing steps are determined by in-process sampling and testing. (8.20)Intermediates held for further processing should be stored under appropriate conditions to ensure their suitability for use. (8.21)\n\nIn-process Sampling and Controls (8.3)\n\nWritten procedures should be established to monitor the progress and control the performance of processing steps that cause variability in the quality characteristics of intermediates and APIs. In-process controls and their acceptance criteria should be defined based on the information gained during the developmental stage or from historical data. (8.30)\n\nThe acceptance criteria and type and extent of testing can depend on the nature of the intermediate or API being manufactured, the reaction or process step being conducted, and the degree to which the process introduces variability in the product's quality. Less stringent in-process controls may be appropriate in early processing steps, whereas tighter controls may be appropriate for later processing steps (e.g., isolation and purification steps). (8.31)\n\nCritical in-process controls (and critical process monitoring), including control points and methods, should be stated in writing and approved by the quality unit(s). (8.32)\n\nIn-process controls can be performed by qualified production department personnel and the process adjusted without prior quality unit(s) approval if the adjustments are made within pre-established limits approved by the quality unit(s). All tests and results should be fully documented as part of the batch record. (8.33)\n\nWritten procedures should describe the sampling methods for in-process materials, intermediates, and APIs. Sampling plans and procedures should be based on scientifically sound sampling practices. (8.34)\n\nIn-process sampling should be conducted using procedures designed to prevent contamination of the sampled material and other intermediates or APIs. Procedures should be established to ensure the integrity of samples after collection. (8.35)\n\nOut-of-specification (OOS) investigations are not normally needed for in-process tests that are performed for the purpose of monitoring and/or adjusting the process. (8.36)\n\nBlending Batches of Intermediates or APIs (8.4)\n\nFor the purpose of this document, blending is defined as the process of combining materials within the same specification to produce a homogeneous intermediate or API. In-process mixing of fractions from single batches (e.g., collecting several centrifuge loads from a single crystallization batch) or combining fractions from several batches for further processing is considered to be part of the production process and is not considered to be blending. (8.40)\n\nOut-of-specification batches should not be blended with other batches for the purpose of meeting specifications. Each batch incorporated into the blend should have been manufactured using an established process and should have been individually tested and found to meet appropriate specifications prior to blending. (8.41)\n\nAcceptable blending operations include, but are not limited to: (8.42)\n\nBlending of small batches to increase batch size\n\nBlending of tailings (i.e., relatively small quantities of isolated material) from batches of the same intermediate or API to form a single batch\n\nBlending processes should be adequately controlled and documented, and the blended batch should be tested for conformance to established specifications, where appropriate. (8.43)\n\nThe batch record of the blending process should allow traceability back to the individual batches that make up the blend. (8.44)\n\nWhere physical attributes of the API are critical (e.g., APIs intended for use in solid oral dosage forms or suspensions), blending operations should be validated to show homogeneity of the combined batch. Validation should include testing of critical attributes (e.g., particle size distribution, bulk density, and tap density) that may be affected by the blending process. (8.45)\n\nIf the blending could adversely affect stability, stability testing of the final blended batches should be performed. (8.46)\n\nThe expiry or retest date of the blended batch should be based on the manufacturing date of the oldest tailings or batch in the blend. (8.47)\n\nContamination Control (8.5)\n\nResidual materials can be carried over into successive batches of the same intermediate or API if there is adequate control. Examples include residue adhering to the wall of a micronizer, residual layer of damp crystals remaining in a centrifuge bowl after discharge, and incomplete discharge of fluids or crystals from a processing vessel upon transfer of the material to the next step in the process. Such carryover should not result in the carryover of degradants or microbial contamination that may adversely alter the established API impurity profile. (8.50)\n\nProduction operations should be conducted in a manner that prevents contamination of intermediates or APIs by other materials. (8.51)\n\nPrecautions to avoid contamination should be taken when APIs are handled after purification. (8.52)\nGeneral (9.1)\n\nThere should be written procedures describing the receipt, identification, quarantine, sampling, examination, and/or testing, release, and handling of packaging and labeling materials. (9.10)\n\nPackaging and labeling materials should conform to established specifications. Those that do not comply with such specifications should be rejected to prevent their use in operations for which they are unsuitable. (9.11)\n\nRecords should be maintained for each shipment of labels and packaging materials showing receipt, examination, or testing, and whether accepted or rejected. (9.12)\n\nPackaging Materials (9.2)\n\nContainers should provide adequate protection against deterioration or contamination of the intermediate or API that may occur during transportation and recommended storage. (9.20)\n\nContainers should be clean and, where indicated by the nature of the intermediate or API, sanitized to ensure that they are suitable for their intended use. These containers should not be reactive, additive, or absorptive so as to alter the quality of the intermediate or API beyond the specified limits. (9.21)\n\nIf containers are reused, they should be cleaned in accordance with documented procedures, and all previous labels should be removed or defaced. (9.22)\n\nLabel Issuance and Control (9.3)\n\nAccess to the label storage areas should be limited to authorized personnel. (9.30)\n\nProcedures should be established to reconcile the quantities of labels issued, used, and returned and to evaluate discrepancies found between the number of containers labeled and the number of labels issued. Such discrepancies should be investigated, and the investigation should be approved by the quality unit(s). (9.31)\n\nAll excess labels bearing batch numbers or other batch-related printing should be destroyed. Returned labels should be maintained and stored in a manner that prevents mix-ups and provides proper identification. (9.32)\n\nObsolete and out-dated labels should be destroyed. (9.33)\n\nPrinting devices used to print labels for packaging operations should be controlled to ensure that all imprinting conforms to the print specified in the batch production record. (9.34)Printed labels issued for a batch should be carefully examined for proper identity and conformity to specifications in the master production record. The results of this examination should be documented. (9.35)\n\nA printed label representative of those used should be included in the batch production record. (9.36)\n\nPackaging and Labeling Operations (9.4)\n\nThere should be documented procedures designed to ensure that correct packaging materials and labels are used. (9.40)\n\nLabeling operations should be designed to prevent mix-ups. There should be physical or spatial separation from operations involving other intermediates or APIs.

For guidance on whether the treated animals can be used for food, you should contact the appropriate individuals in the Bureau of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nSection 58.113 Mixtures of articles with carriers.\n\nDo the GLPs require tests for homogeneity, concentration, and stability on mixtures of control articles used as positive controls?\n\nYes.\n2. Do test or control article concentration assays have to be performed on each batch of test or control article carrier mixture?\n\nNo. The GLPs require only periodic analysis of test or control article carrier mixtures.\n\nWhat is the purpose of periodic analysis requirement for test or control article mixtures? This requirement provides additional assurance that the test system is being exposed to protocol-specified quantities of test article. Whereas, in most instances proper assurance is obtained through adequate uniformity-of-mixing studies, adequate SOPs, and trained personnel, occasionally the mixing equipment can malfunction or other uncontrollable events can occur which lead to improper dosages. These events can be recognized through periodic analysis.\n\nFor acute studies, does the test article carrier mixture have to be analyzed (single dose studies)? Yes, but the analysis need not be done prior to the study provided the mixture is stable in storage.\n\nFor liquid dosing studies where the test article mixture is made by dilution of the highest dose, which dose should be analyzed? The lowest dose would be appropriate since it would confirm the efficacy of the dilution process, however the GLPs do not prohibit the analysis of any of the other doses.\n\nDo homogeneity studies need to be done on solutions and suspensions of test articles used in acute nonclinical laboratory studies? The answers to these questions are yes for suspensions of test articles and no for true solutions of test articles.\n\nThe analysis of test article mixtures that are used in acute studies is problematic. Usually at the stage of product development, the analytical method is not fully developed. Also, getting the analytical department to schedule the analysis is difficult. Stability is not a problem since fresh solutions are used. In view of the fact that acute studies are not pivotal in gaining approval of a research or marketing permit, is it necessary to analyze test article mixtures? Yes. Although acute studies may be of lesser importance in assessing the safety of human drugs, they are important for animal drugs, biological products and certain food additives. For this reason, there must be some assurance that the test system was dosed with protocol specified quantities of test article. The GLPs do not require that the analysis be done prior to the use of the test article mixture provided that the mixture is stable on storage.\n\nSUBPART G PROTOCOL FOR THE CONDUCT OF A NONCLINICAL LABORATORY STUDY\n\nSection 58.120 Protocol.\n\nWhat are the proposed starting and completion dates for a nonclinical laboratory study?\n\nThere is a good deal of confusion on these dates and proper interpretation impacts on several GLP areas. Accordingly, the following clarification is offered: At the time of protocol development, the study director is to propose to management the approximate time frame of the study. Section 58.120(a)(4), therefore, requires that the protocol contain the proposed starting and completion date of the study. These dates are somewhat discretionary provided that They are identified in the protocol.\n\nSuitable identification can be the date of first dosing of the test system to the date of last-dosing, the date of allocation of the test system to the experimental units to the date of necropsy of the last animal on test, the date of receipt of the test system to the date of final histopathological examination, or any combination of these or any other logical starting and completion dates. After this, the protocol is signed by the study director and forwarded for approval to management. Management approves, if indicated, signs and dates and at this point the study becomes a regulated study and must be entered on the Master Schedule Sheet. The study is carried on the Master Schedule Sheet until the study director submits a signed and dated final report. Thus, for Master Schedule Sheet purposes, the starting date of the study is the date of protocol approval by management and the completion date of the study is the date of signature of the final report by the study director. Neither of the foregoing timeframes need be used to define the study terms described in section 58.35(b)(3) and section 58.105(d). For these sections, the traditional terms found in the toxicology literature may be used.\n\nMust an analytical method be totally contained in the protocol?\n\nNo. The protocol must state the type and frequency of tests to be made. Type can be connoted by reference to literature citations or the SOPs as applicable.\n\nDoes each nonclinical laboratory study require a sponsor-approved specific protocol?\n\nYes. However, the laboratory that conducts the study can also qualify as the sponsor of the study.\n\nDo unforeseen circumstances which occur during a study and which necessitate minor operational changes have to be reported as protocol amendments.\n\nUnforeseen circumstances which have only a one time effect (different date of sample collection, animal weighings) need to be reported only in the raw data and the final report. However, such circumstances which result in a systematic change, e.g. in the SOPs or in the protocol, should also be made by a protocol amendment. The protocol amendment need not be made in advance but should be made as rapidly as possible.\n5. Pathologists at a firm would like to take tissues from animals in a nonclinical study which would be used to conduct exploratory research studies. The tissues would not be part of the nonclinical laboratory study design and the results would not necessarily pertain to the study objectives. What would the GLPs require in this case?\n\nThe protocol should state that tissues are to be taken from the experimental animals and that the tissues would be used for exploratory research purposes. If any effects were observed in the exploratory research studies which would influence the interpretation of the results of the nonclinical laboratory study, these effects must be report in the final report.\n6. Does the protocol have to list the SOPs used in a specific study?\n\nThe protocol must list the type and frequency of tests, analyses, and measurements to be made in the study. Where these are covered by SOPs, they should be listed in the protocol.\n7. Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n\nNo. The GLPs require that, if absorption studies are needed to achieve the scientific objectives of the study plan, the protocol should describe the methods to be used to determine absorption. Whether or not absorption studies are required is a scientific issue to be decided by the study scientists.\n8. Who assesses protocol validity (No. of animals, test article dosage, test system, etc.)?\n\nThis is done by the study scientists using the scientific literature, published guidelines, advice from regulatory agencies, and prior experimental work.\n\nSection 58.130 Conduct of a nonclinical laboratory study.\n\nDoes raw data collected in nonclinical laboratory studies have to be\n\ndesigned by a second individual.\n\nNo.\n\nWhat are the GLP requirements that are applicable to computerized\n\ndata - acquisition systems?\n\nAn acceptable system must satisfy the following criteria:\n\n(1) Only authorized individuals can make data entries,\n\n(2) data entries may not be deleted, but changes may be made in\n\nthe form of dated amendments which provide the reason\n\nfor data change,\n\n(3) the data base must be made as tamperproof as possible,\n\n(4) the SOPs should describe the procedures used for ensuring\n\nthe validity of the data, and\n\n(5) either the magnetic media or hard-copy printouts are\n\nconsidered to be raw data.\n\nIn Japan, employees do not sign raw data records but rather they use\n\nan official seal which is unique to the employee. Is this an\nacceptable procedure?\n\nYes.\n\nDo tissue slides have to carry the complete sample labeling\n\ninformation stated in the GLPs?\n\nNo, accession numbers are permitted providing that these numbers can\n\nbe translated into the information required under Section 58.130(c).\n\nIs a positive notation (a statement of what was done in the raw data)\n\nrequired for routine laboratory operations such as:\n\n(a) identifying animals,\n\n(b) shaving or abrading rabbits,\n\n(c) specific dosing procedures, and\n\n(d) fasting of animals?\n\nYes.\n\nDo the GLPs require the entry of raw data into bound notebooks? No.\n\nIs it acceptable to manually transcribe raw data into notebooks if it is verified accurate by signature and date?\n\nTechnically the GLPs do not preclude such an approach. It is not a preferred procedure, however, since the chance of transcription errors would exist. Accordingly, such an approach should be used only when necessary and in this event the raw data should also be retained.\n\nSUBPART J RECORDS AND REPORTS\n\nSection 58.185 Reporting of nonclinical laboratory study results.\n\nDo contributing scientist's reports have to be prepared and appended to final reports or can the contributing scientist's report be included in the final report prepared by the study director and signed by each contributing scientist?\n\nThe signed reports of contributing scientists should be appended to the final report.\n2. Does Section 58.115(a) describe the format for submission of a final report?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.071393609046936", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: Certain contracts specify that a series of nonclinical laboratory studies be done on a single test article. Do the GLPs permit the designation of different study directors for each study under the contract?\n\nYes.\n\nDo the GLPs require that a sponsor approve the study director for a contracted study?\n\nNo. Testing facility management designates the study director.\n\nA firm functions as a primary contractor for nonclinical laboratory studies. The actual studies are then subcontracted to nonclinical laboratories. Is the firm considered to be a \"sponsor?\"\n\nThe GLPs define \"sponsor\" as a person who initiates and supports a nonclinical laboratory study. Sponsorship in the cited example would be determined by the specific provisions of the contract.\n\nWho is responsible for test article characterization - the sponsor or the contractor?\n\nThe GLPs do not assign the responsibility in this area. The matter is a subject of the specific contractual arrangement between the sponsor and the contractor.\n\nDo contract laboratories have to show the sponsor's name on the Master Schedule Sheet or can this information be coded?\n\nThe information can be coded but the code must be revealed to the FDA investigator on request.\n\nA sponsor desires to contract for a nonclinical laboratory study to be conducted in a foreign laboratory. Must the sponsor notify the foreign laboratory that compliance with the U.S. GLPs is required?\n\nYes.\n\nMust a contractor include in the final report information on test article characterization and stability when such information has been collected by the sponsor?\n\nNo. The contractor should identify in its final report which information will be subsequently supplied by the sponsor.\n\nMust a sponsor reveal toxicology data already collected on a test article to a contract laboratory?\n\nNo. If use of the test article involves a potential danger to laboratory personnel, the contract laboratory should be advised so that appropriate precautions can be taken.\n\nSection 58.15 Inspection of a testing facility.\n\nWhat is the usual procedure for the issuance of a form FD-483?\n\nThe FD-483 is the written notice of objectionable\n\npractices or deviations from the regulations that is prepared by the FDA investigator at the end of the inspection. The items listed on the form serve as the basis for the exit discussion with laboratory management at which time management can either agree or disagree with the items and can offer possible corrective actions to be taken.\n\nManagement may also respond to the district office in writing after it has had sufficient time to properly study the FD-483.\n\nWill a laboratory subsequently be notified of GLP deviations not listed on the FD-483?\n\nThis does happen. The FDA investigator prepares an establishment\n\ninspection report (EIR) which summarizes the observations made at the\n\nlaboratory and which contains exhibits concerning the studies audited\n\n(Protocols, SOPs, CV's, etc.). The EIR is then reviewed by District\n\npersonnel as well as headquarters personnel. This review may reveal\n\nadditional GLP deviations that should be and are communicated to\n\nlaboratory management.\n\nWhat kinds of domestic toxicology laboratory inspections does FDA\n\nperform and how frequently are they done?\n\nFDA performs four kinds of inspections related to the GLPs and\n\nnonclinical laboratory studies. These include: A GLP inspection -\n\nan inspection undertaken as a periodic, routine determination of a\n\nlaboratory's compliance with the GLPs, it includes examination of an\n\nongoing study as well as a completed study; A data audit - an\n\ninspection made to verify that the information contained in a final\n\nreport submitted to FDA is accurate and reflected by the raw data; A\n\ndirected inspection - any of a series of inspections conducted for\n\nvarious compelling reasons (questionable data in a final report, tips\n\nfrom informers, etc.); A followup inspection - an inspection made\n\nsometime after a GLP inspection which revealed objectionable\n\npractices and conditions. The purpose of the followup inspection is\n\nto assure that proper corrective actions have been taken. GLP\n\ninspections are scheduled once every two years whereas the other\n\nkinds of inspections are scheduled as needed.\n\nShould GLP investigators comment on the scientific merits of a protocol or the scientific interpretation given in the final report? No. Their function is strictly a noting of observations and verification. Scientific judgments are made by the respective headquarters review units that deal with the test article.\n\nCan a GLP EIR be reviewed by laboratory, management prior to issuance? No. The GLP EIR is an internal agency document which reflects the observations and findings of the FDA investigator. It can not be released to anyone outside the agency until agency action has been completed and the released copy is purged of all trade secret information. Laboratories that disagree with portions of the EIR should write a letter which contains the areas of disagreement to the local FDA District Office. The laboratories can ask that their letters accompany the EIR whenever it is requested under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nCan FDA investigators take photographs of objectionable practices and conditions? It is the agency position that photographs can be taken as a part of the inspection and this position has been sustained by a District Court decision.\n\nThe GLP Compliance Program requires the FDA investigator to select an ongoing study in order to inspect current laboratory operations. What criteria are used to select the study? The studies are selected in accord with agency priorities, i.e. the longest term study on the most significant product.\n\nDoes FDA inspect international nonclinical laboratories once every two years? No. Overseas laboratories are scheduled for inspection on the basis of having submitted to FDA the results of significant studies on important products.\n\nWhat background materials are used by agency investigators to prepare for a GLP inspection? Prior to an inspection, the following materials are usually reviewed:(a) The GLP regulations; (b) The Management Briefings Post-Conference Report; (c) Assorted memoranda and policy issuances; (d) The GLP Compliance Program; (e) The protocol of an ongoing study, if available; (f) The final report of a completed study, if available; (g) The inspection report of the most recent inspection.\n\nHow long does FDA allow a laboratory to effect corrective actions after an inspection has been made? If the results of an inspection reveal that significant deviations from the GLPs exist, the laboratory will be sent a regulatory letter that lists the major deviations and that requests a response within 10 days. The response should describe those actions that the laboratory has taken or plans to take to effect correction. The response should also encompass items that were listed on the FD-483 and those that were discussed during the exit discussion with laboratory management. A specific time table should be given for accomplishing the planned actions. The reasonableness of the time table will be determined by FDA compliance staff, based on the needs of the particular situation. For less significant deviations, the laboratory will be sent a Notice of Adverse Findings letter that also lists the deviations but that requests a response within 30 days. Again, the reasonableness of the response will be determined by FDA staff.\n\nDoes a laboratory's responsibility for corrective action listed on a FD-483 begin at the conclusion of an inspection or upon receipt of correspondence from the originating bureau in which corrective action is requested? The FD-483 lists observations of violative conditions that have the capability to adversely affect nonclinical laboratory studies. Corrective actions should be instituted as soon as possible.\n\nDoes FDA preannounce all GLP inspections? Laboratory management is informed of all routine GLP inspections prior to the inspection, but special compliance or investigative inspections need not be preannounced.\n\nSUSPART B ORGANIZATION AND PERSONNEL\n\nSection 58.29 Personnel.\n\nFor what sequence in the supervisory chain should position descriptions be available?\n\nPosition descriptions should be available for each individual engaged in or supervising the conduct of the study.\n\nShould current summaries of training and experience list attendance at scientific and technical meetings?\n\nYes. The agency considers such attendance as a valuable adjunct to the other kinds of training received by laboratory personnel.\n\nIf certain specialists (pathologists, statisticians, ophthalmologists, etc.) are contracted to conduct certain aspects of a study, need they be identified in the final report?\n\nYes.\n\nDoes the QAU have to be composed of technical personnel?\n\nNo. Management is, however, responsible for assuring that \"personnel clearly understand the functions they are to perform\" (Section 58.31(f)) and that each individual engaged in the study has the appropriate combination of education, training and experience (Section 58.29(a)).\n\nSection 58.31 Testing Facility Management.\n\nCan the study director be the chief executive of a nonclinical laboratory?\n\nNo. The GLPs require that there be a separation of function between the study director and the QAU director. In the example, the QAU director would be reporting to the study director.\n\nSection 58.33 Study director.\n\nThe GLPs permit the designation of an \"acting\" or \"deputy\" study director to be responsible for a study when the study director is on leave. Should study records identify the designated \"deputy\" or \"acting\" study director?\n\nYes.\n\nIs the study director responsible for adherence to the GLPs? Yes.\n\nSection 58.35 Quality Assurance Unit.\n\nAs a QAU person, I have no expertise in the field of pathology. How do I audit pathology findings?\n--------------------\nContext title: Good Laboratory Practice Regulations Questions and Answers \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.7553739547729492", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: [The following pharmacology and toxicology guidance is applicable to all phases of IND development of products covered by this guidance.]\n\n1 Pharmacology and Drug Distribution [21 CFR 312.23(a)(8)(i)]:\n\nThis section should contain, if known: 1) a description of the pharmacologic effects and mechanism(s) of actions of the drug in animals, and 2) information on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretions of the drug. The regulations do not further describe the presentation of these data, in contrast to the more detailed description of how to submit toxicologic data. A summary report, without individual animal records or individual study results, usually suffices. In most circumstances, five pages or less should suffice for this summary. If this information is not known, it should simply be so stated.\n\nTo the extent that such studies may be important to address safety issues, or to assist in evaluation of toxicology data, they may be necessary; however, lack of this potential effectiveness information should not generally be a reason for a Phase 1 IND to be placed on clinical hold.\n\n2 Toxicology: Integrated Summary [21 CFR 312.23(a)(8)(ii)(a)]\n\nPresent regulations require an integrated summary of the toxicologic effects of the drug in animals and in vitro. The particular studies needed depend on the nature of the drug and the phase of human investigation. When species specificity, immunogenicity, or other considerations appear to make many or all toxicological models irrelevant, sponsors are encouraged to contact the agency to discuss toxicological testing.\n\nThe regulations are not specific as to the nature of the report of toxicology data needed in an IND submission and the nature of the study reports upon which the report submitted to the IND is based. The regulations are silent on whether the submitted material should be based on: 1) \"final fully quality-assured\" individual study reports, or 2) earlier, unaudited draft toxicologic reports of the completed study(ies). Most sponsors have concluded that a submission based on final fully quality-assured individual study reports is required, and a substantial delay in submission of an IND for several months is often encountered to complete such final fully quality-assured individual reports from the time the unaudited draft toxicologic reports of the completed studies are prepared.\n\nMoreover, although the regulation does not specifically require individual toxicology study reports to be submitted, referring only to an integrated summary of the toxicologic findings, the requirement at 21 CFR 312.23(a)(8)(ii)(b) for a full tabulation of data from each study suitable for detailed review has led most sponsors to provide detailed reports of each study.\n\nAlthough the GLP and quality assurance processes and principles are critical for the maintenance of a toxicology study system that is valid and credible, it is unusual, as far as FDA is aware, for findings in the unaudited draft toxicologic report of the completed studies to change during the production of the \"final,\" quality-assured individual study reports in ways important to determining whether use in humans is safe.\n\nTherefore, if final, fully quality-assured individual study reports are not available at the time of IND submission, an integrated summary report of toxicologic findings based on the unaudited draft toxicologic reports of the completed animal studies may be submitted. This integrated summary report should represent the sponsor's evaluation of the animal studies that formed the basis for the sponsor's decision that the proposed human studies are safe. It is expected that the unaudited draft reports that formed the basis of this decision might undergo minor modifications during final review and quality assurance auditing. Full toxicology department individual study reports should be available to FDA, upon request, and individual study reports should be available to FDA, upon request, as final, fully quality-assured documents within 120 days of the start of the human study for which the animal study formed part of the safety conclusion basis. These final reports should contain in the introduction any changes from those reported in the integrated summary. If there are no changes, that should be so stated clearly at the beginning of the final, fully quality-assured report.\n\nIf the integrated summary is based upon unaudited draft reports,sponsors should submit an update to their integrated summary by 120 days after the start of the human study(ies) identifying any differences found in the preparation of the final fully quality- assured study reports and the information submitted in the initial integrated summary. If there were no differences found, that should be stated in the integrated summary update.\n\nIn addition, any new finding discovered during the preparation of the final, fully quality-assured individual study reports that could affect subject safety must be reported to FDA under 21 CFR 312.32.\n\nUsually, 10 to 15 pages of text with additional tables (as needed) should suffice for the integrated summary. It should represent the sponsor's perspective on the completed animal studies at the time the sponsor decided human trials were appropriate. Use of visual data displays (e.g., box plots, stem and leaf displays, histograms or distributions of lab results over time) will facilitate description of the findings of these trials.\n\nThe summary document should be accurate contemporaneously with the IND submission (i.e., it should be updated so that if new information or findings from the completed animal studies have become known since the sponsor's decision that the proposed human study is safe, such new information should also be included in the submitted summary).\n\nThe integrated summary of the toxicologic findings of the completed animal studies to support the safety of the proposed human investigation should ordinarily contain the following information:\n\na. A brief description of the design of the trials and any deviations from the design in the conduct of the trials. In addition, the dates of the performance of the trials should be included. Reference to the study protocol and protocol amendments may suffice for some of this information. b. A systematic presentation of the findings from the animal toxicology and toxicokinetic studies. Those findings that an informed and experienced expert would reasonably consider as possible signals of human risk should be highlighted. The format of this part of the summary may be approached from a \"systems review\" perspective: (e.g., CNS, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, genitourinary, hematopoietic and immunologic, and dermal). If a product's effects on a particular body system have not been assessed, that should be so noted. If any well-documented toxicological \"signal\" is not considered evidence of human risk, the reason should be given. In addition, the sponsor should note whether these findings are discussed in the investigator's brochure.\n* Identification and qualifications of the individual(s) who evaluated the animal safety data and concluded that it is reasonably safe to begin the proposed human study. This person(s) should sign the summary attesting that the summary accurately reflects the animal toxicology data from the completed studies.\n* A statement of where the animal studies were conducted and where the records of the studies are available for inspection, should an inspection occur.\n* As required under 21 CFR 312.23(a)(8)(iii), a declaration that each study subject to good laboratory practices (GLP) regulations was performed in full compliance with GLPs or, if the study was not conducted in compliance with those regulations, a brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance and the sponsor's view on how such noncompliance might affect the interpretations of the findings.\n\nNOTE: The information described in paragraphs \"c\", \"d\", and \"e\" may be supplied as part of the integrated summary or as part of the full data tabulations described below.\n\n3 Toxicology - Full Data Tabulation [21 CFR 312.23(a)(8)(ii)(b)]:\n\nThe sponsor should submit, for each animal toxicology study that is intended to support the safety of the proposed clinical investigation, a full tabulation of data suitable for detailed review. This should consist of line listings of the individual data points, including laboratory data points, for each animal in these trials along with summary tabulations of these data points. To allow interpretation of the line listings, accompanying the line listingsshould be either: 1) a brief (usually a few pages) description (i.e., a technical report or abstract including a methods description section) of the study or 2) a copy of the study protocol and amendments.\n\n4 Toxicology - GLP Certification [21 CFR 312.23(a)(8)(iii)]:\n\nSee section III.G.2.e. above.\n\n5 Monitoring of Effects of these Clarifications:\n\nAt the end of the first two to three years of this new procedure, FDA will assemble and examine the instances in which the early and later animal study individual reports differed to determine if such differences made a material difference in the safe conduct of human trials. Depending on the outcomes, the acceptability of this approach to reporting toxicology studies to INDs may be re-examined.\n\nPrevious Human Experience with the Investigational Drug [21 CFR 312.23(a)(9)]:\n\nPresent regulations require this information only if there has been previous human experience with the investigational drug. If there has been no previous human experience, the submission should so state.\n\nWhen there has been previous human experience, such experience may be presented in an integrated summary report. Individual study reports should not be routinely submitted.\n\n21 CFR 312.23(a)(10), (11) and (b), (c), (d), and (e) :\n\nNo clarifications.\n\nReferences\n--------------------\nContext title: Content and Format of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-derived Products Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.543602466583252", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: 2. Animal toxicology studies\n\nWhen planning toxicity testing for mAb, the following should be considered:\n\na. If the test article is an unconjugated antibody and there is no animal model of disease activity or animal that carries the relevant antigen, and cross-reactivity studies with human tissues are clearly negative, toxicity testing may not be necessary.\n\nb. When a relevant animal model is available, an attempt should be made to study the dose-dependence of pharmacodynamic effects. The use of a broad range of doses, including high doses may allow a better prediction of the therapeutic index.\n\nc. The properties of a relevant antigen in the animal should be comparable to those in humans in biodistribution, function, and structure. For example, studies of CD34({}^{+}) progenitor cells in the baboon are useful because the same cell fractions in both species express the CD34({}^{+}) antigen and produce hematopoietic engraftment. Absolute equivalence of antigen density or affinity for the mAb, however, is not necessary for an animal model to be useful. Differences in binding, for example, may be compensated for by alterations in the dose or dosing frequency. Differences between the animal and human in antigen number, the affinity of a mAb for the antigen, or the cellular response to mAb binding, should be identified. This will allow more accurate extrapolation of safe human starting dose and estimation of the margin of safety.\n\nRoutine assessments of mutagenicity are not generally needed for mAb.\n\ne.\n\nReproductive and developmental studies including teratogenicity in an appropriate animal species should be carried out in instances in which the product is intended for repeat or chronic administration to women of childbearing potential. Results of such peri- and post-natal developmental studies should be submitted for marketing approval. Evaluation of male fertility, when appropriate, should be completed before phase 3 trials.\n\n3. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics\n\nA pharmacokinetic model may aid in the interpretation of preclinical activity and toxicity, and in the recommendation of an appropriate dosing regimen and thereby improve the design of clinical trials. Such studies should aim at determining pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints. Of particular importance to the selection of clinical dosage is determining the relationship activity to area under the curve (AUC) of tissue or blood concentration over time. In considering the relationship of activity to AUC, factors related to the pharmacodynamics of the monoclonal antibody should be used in evaluating potential clinical effects. These factors include pathophysiologic status, threshold for effects as well as molecular events like the rates of association and dissociation for the site of action. Studies of biodistribution may provide the initial evidence for inappropriate tissue targeting by a mAb or explain toxicities that are observed in animals. Interpretation of data should consider species of origin, isotype, whether the mAb is an intact immunoglobulin, a fragment or an immunoconjugate, method of labeling, stability of the immunoconjugate, level of antigen expression in the recipient, binding to serum proteins, and route of administration. Even if antigen is expressed in an animal model, the mAb may bind the human target antigen and its animal counterpart with different affinities. MAb half-life may also be affected by glycosylation, susceptibility to proteases, presence of circulating antigen, and host immune response. The presence of antibodies to the product may alter biodistribution and elimination. In some cases, informative pharmacokinetic studies may be obtained in animal models which do not express specific antigenic determinants, depending upon the role played by antigen binding in product biodistribution,otransformation and excretion.\n\nSelection of the animal species for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic testing should be guided by the following considerations:\n\ni. Preference should always be given to study of a mAb in an animal model in a species that shares a cross-reactive or identical target antigen with humans, whenever such a species is available. For unconjugated mAb directed at human antigens not expressed in animal models or foreign antigens (bacterial, viral, etc.), studies in animal species lacking the target antigen may not be necessary unless they are designed to address manufacturing issues (see Section II.E. on Product Comparability).\n\nii. Study of non-human primates is appropriate for unconjugated mAb when there are antigen binding data that indicate that primates are the most relevant species. iii. Normal rodent and murine xenograft models should be critically evaluated for their likelihood of predicting accurately human pharmacokinetic behavior of mAb. Xenograft models may be more useful in evaluating the ability of mAb to bind to human tumors in vivo.\n\nb. Changes in manufacturing or formulation may result in significant changes in biological activity. Therefore, it is recommended that the material used in the preclinical studies be manufactured using the same procedures as used or intended for use in manufacturing material for clinical trials. In some cases it may be appropriate to modify the components of the formulation for preclinical testing. For example, substitution of the homologous animal serum albumin for human serum albumin that is used as a carrier will prevent the formation of anti-albumin antibodies in animal studies and thereby increase the relevance of preclinical testing.\n\nc. Pharmacokine parameters should be defined using one or more assay methods (e.g., a radiolabeled mAb should be assayed by ELISA and by measurement of radioactivity). In the case of immunoconjugates of any type, intact conjugate should be distinguished from free mAb and free ligand (e.g. toxin, drug, or radionuclide). Pharmacokine parameters that are most important for product characterization, as well as most useful for determining product comparability include T({}{\\text{max}}), C({}{\\text{max}}), T({}_{1/2}) and AUC.\n\nd. The development of anti-immunoglobulin antibodies greatly complicates study and interpretation of the effects of repeat dosing in animals. Murine antibodies are non-immunogenic in mice but are immunogenic in humans, making it difficult to extrapolate the results of repeat dose studies in mice to planned repeat dose administration in humans. The reciprocal problem will occur with fully human, chimeric or \"humanized\" mAb. Repeat dose studies in rodents in this case may be of little value.\n\n**4. Preclinical in vivo studies with immunoconjugates\n\nImmunoconjugates should be tested for stability in vivo.\n\ni. Individual components of an immunoconjugate should be measured during pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution studies in animals and compared to the distribution of unconjugated antibody. ii. The target tissues for the various components and the potential toxicities that they may cause should be established.\n\nb. Immunoconjugates containing radionuclides, toxins, or drugs should undergo animal toxicity testing even when the target antigen is not present in an animal species, because of possible conjugate degradation or activity in sites that are not the result of mAb targeting. Depending upon the nature of the components of the immunoconjugate and the stability of the conjugate itself, separate studies of the components may be warranted. The toxicity profile of each component should adequately describe the incidence and severity of possible adverse effects. Results should be correlated closely with studies of conjugate stability. Studies of the immunoconjugate should be performed in a species with the relevant target antigen or disease model, whenever available and generally in rodents if a target antigen-positive species is not available. Toxicity testing of free toxin or nuclide may be performed in a different species.\n\nc. For immunoconjugates containing radionuclides:i. Animal biodistribution data may be used for initial human dose estimation.\n\nii. Animal models that express the targeted antigen, whenever such models are available, are more likely to reveal the effects of antigen \"sinks\" or tissues with unexpected antigen expression on biodistribution and/or toxicity.\n\niii. Xenograft models may evaluate tissue targeting and antigen non-specific radioimmunoconjugate distribution problems, but are not helpful at identifying areas of normal tissue cross-reactivity.\n\niv. An adequate number of animals should be studied to achieve radiation dose estimates with an acceptable coefficient of variation (usually less than 20%).\n\nv. There should be complete accounting of the metabolism of the total dose of administered radioactivity and an adequate number of time points to determine early and late elimination phases.\n\nvi. Radioimmunoconjugates should be tested for stability in vitro by incubation in serum or plasma (see Section II.C.7.). Methods should be developed to estimate the percent radioactivity in each of the three species of concern: free isotope, conjugated mAb, and labeled, non-mAb substances.\n\nIV. Clinical Studies\n\nMAb administered to humans have usually been well-tolerated. Instances of serious or fatal adverse events have generally resulted from intended or unintended binding of mAb to specific antigens. These events emphasize the importance of screening tissues for mAb cross-reactivity, particularly when relevant-antigen animal models are not available. The results of preclinical tests may alert physicians to potential toxicities and may indicate that more conservative dosing schemes are justified during dose escalation.\n\nA. Clinical Considerations for Phase 1 and 2 Studies\n\n1. General\n--------------------\nContext title: Points to Consider in the Manufacture and Testing of Monoclonal Antibody Products for Human Use \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.861084461212158", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: In the following paragraphs some general principles are set out which should be taken into consideration in the design of individual studies.\n\nIt should be noted that for those toxicity studies whose performance is subject to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) the concomitant toxicokinetics must also conform to GLP. Toxicokinetic studies retrospectively designed to generate specific sets of data under conditions which closely mimic those of the toxicity studies should also conform to GLP when they are necessary for the evaluation of safety.\n\nB. Quantification of exposure (3.2)\n\nThe quantification of systemic exposure provides an assessment of the burden on the test species and assists in the interpretation of similarities and differences in toxicity across species, dose groups and sexes. The exposure might be represented by plasma (serum or blood) concentrations or the AUC's of parent compound and/or metabolite(s). In some circumstances, studies may be designed to investigate tissue concentrations. When designing the toxicity studies, the exposure and dose-dependence in humans at therapeutic dose levels (either expected or established), should be considered in order to achieve relevant exposure at various dose levels in the animal toxicity studies. The possibility that there may be species differences in the pharmacodynamics of the substance (either qualitative or quantitative) should also be taken into consideration.\n\nPharmacodynamic effects or toxicity might also give supporting evidence of exposure or even replace pharmacokinetic parameters in some circumstances.\n\nToxicokinetic monitoring or profiling of toxicity studies should establish what level of exposure has been achieved during the course of the study and may also serve to alert the toxicologist to non-linear, dose-related changes in exposure (Note 3) which may have occurred. Toxicokinetic information may allow better interspecies comparisons than simple dose/body weight (or surface area) comparisons.\n\nC. Justification of time points for sampling (3.3)The time points for collecting body fluids in concomitant toxicokinetic studies should be as frequent as is necessary, but not so frequent as to interfere with the normal conduct of the study or to cause undue physiological stress to the animals.4 In each study, the number of time points should be justified on the basis that they are adequate to estimate exposure [see III.B. (3.2)]. The justification should be based on kinetic data gathered from earlier toxicity studies, from pilot or dose range-finding studies, from separate studies in the same animal model or in other models allowing reliable extrapolation.\n* Contribution to the setting of dose levels in order to produce adequate exposure (3.4) The setting of dose levels in toxicity studies is largely governed by the toxicology findings and the pharmacodynamic responses of the test species. However, the following toxicokinetic principles may contribute to the setting of the dose levels.\n* Low dose levels (3.4.1) At the low dose, preferably a no-toxic-effect dose level5, the exposure in the animals of any toxicity study should ideally equal or just exceed the maximum expected (or known to be attained) in patients. It is recognized that this ideal is not always achievable and that low doses will often need to be determined by considerations of toxicology; nevertheless, systemic exposure should be determined.\n* Intermediate dose levels (3.4.2) Exposure at intermediate dose levels should normally represent an appropriate multiple (or fraction) of the exposure at lower (or higher) dose levels dependent upon the objectives of the toxicity study.\n* High dose levels (3.4.3) The high dose levels in toxicity studies will normally be determined by toxicological considerations. However, the exposure achieved at the dose levels used should be assessed. Where toxicokinetic data indicate that absorption of a compound limits exposure to parent compound and/or metabolite(s)6, the lowest dose level of the substance producing the maximum exposure should be accepted as the top dose level to be used (when no other dose-limiting constraint applies[7]).\n\nVery careful attention should be paid to the interpretation of toxicological findings in toxicity studies (of all kinds) when the dose levels chosen result in nonlinear kinetics.[3] However, nonlinear kinetics should not necessarily result in dose limitations in toxicity studies or invalidate the findings; toxicokinetics can be very helpful in assessing the relationship between dose and exposure in this situation.\n\nE.\n\nExtent of exposure assessment in toxicity studies (3.5)\n\nIn toxicity studies, systemic exposure should be estimated in an appropriate number of animals and dose groups[8] to provide a basis for risk assessment.\n\nConcomitant toxicokinetics may be performed either in all or a representative proportion of the animals used in the main study or in special satellite groups (Notes 1 and 5). Normally, samples for the generation of toxicokinetic data may be collected from main study animals, where large animals are involved, but satellite groups may be required for the smaller (rodent) species.\n\nThe number of animals to be used should be the minimum consistent with generating adequate toxicokinetic data. Where both male and female animals are utilized in the main study it is normal to estimate exposure in animals of both sexes unless some justification can be made for not so doing.\n\nToxicokinetic data are not necessarily required from studies of different duration if the dosing regimen is essentially unchanged [see also IV.C. (4.3)].\n\nF.\n\nComplicating factors in exposure interpretation (3.6)\n\nAlthough estimating exposure as described above may aid in the interpretation of toxicity studies and in the comparison with human exposure, a few caveats should be noted.\n\nSpecies differences in protein binding, tissue uptake, receptor properties and metabolic profile should be considered. For example, it may be more appropriate for highly protein bound compounds to have exposure expressed as the free (unbound) concentrations. In addition, the pharmacological activity of metabolites, the toxicology of metabolites and antigenicity of biotechnology products may be complicating factors. Furthermore, it should be noted that even at relatively low plasma concentrations, high levels of the administered compound and/or metabolite(s) may occur in specific organs or tissues.\n* Route of administration (3.7) The toxicokinetic strategy to be adopted for the use of alternative routes of administration, for example by inhalation, topical or parenteral delivery, should be based on the pharmacokinetic properties of the substance administered by the intended route. It sometimes happens that a proposal is made to adopt a new clinical route of administration for a pharmaceutical product; for example, a product initially developed as an oral formulation may subsequently be developed for intravenous administration. In this context, it will be necessary to ascertain whether changing the clinical route will significantly reduce the safety margin. This process may include a comparison of the systemic exposure to the compound and/or its relevant metabolite(s) (AUC and C({}{\\max})) in humans generated by the existing and proposed routes of administration. If the new route results in increased AUC and/or C({}{\\max}), or a change in metabolic profile, the continuing assurance of safety from animal toxicology and kinetics should be reconsidered. If exposure is not substantially greater, or different, by the proposed new route compared to that for the existing route(s) then additional nonclinical toxicity studies may focus on local toxicity.\n* Determination of metabolites (3.8) A primary objective of toxicokinetics is to describe the systemic exposure to the administered compound achieved in the toxicology species. However, there may be circumstances when measurement of metabolite concentrations in plasma or other body fluids is especially important in the conduct of toxicokinetics.[9]\n* When the administered compound acts as a \"pro-drug\" and the delivered metabolite is acknowledged to be the primary active entity.\n\nWhen the compound is metabolized to one or more pharmacologically or toxicologically active metabolites which could make a significant contribution to tissue/organ responses.\n* When the administered compound is very extensively metabolized and the measurement of plasma or tissue concentrations of a major metabolite is the only practical means of estimating exposure following administration of the compound in toxicity studies.[10]\n\nI. Statistical evaluation of data (3.9)\n\nThe data should allow a representative assessment of the exposure. However, because large intra- and inter-individual variation of kinetic parameters may occur and small numbers of animals are involved in generating toxicokinetic data, a high level of precision in terms of statistics is not normally needed. Consideration should be given to the calculation of mean or median values and estimates of variability, but in some cases the data of individual animals may be more important than a refined statistical analysis of group data.\n\nIf data transformation (e.g., logarithmic) is performed, a rationale should be provided.\n\nJ. Analytical methods (3.10)\n\nIntegration of pharmacokinetics into toxicity testing implies early development of analytical methods for which the choice of analytes and matrices should be continually reviewed as information is gathered on metabolism and species differences.\n\nThe analytical methods to be used in toxicokinetic studies should be specific for the entity to be measured and of an adequate accuracy and precision. The limit of quantification should be adequate for the measurement of the range of concentrations anticipated to occur in the generation of the toxicokinetic data.\n--------------------\nContext title: S3A Toxicokinetics- The Assessment of Systemic Exposure in Toxicity Studies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.198126792907715", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations , Do the GLPs require that absorption studies be done on each test article?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCheck \"Yes\" if item is present, \"N/A\" if it is not needed and \"No\" if it is not included but needed.\n\nSubmitters including the checklist with their submission should identify the page numbers where requested information is located.

You should take appropriate corrective action when indicated by the evaluation or when other events warrant.\n\nBiological and Biotechnological Products\n\nvi.2.1 General Considerations\n\nThe manufacturing process is critical to ensure the correct composition, quality, and safety of biological and biotechnology products. For these products, it can be difficult to distinguish changes in quality attributes, or predict the impact of observed changes in quality attributes on safety. This is especially true for phase 1 clinical trials where knowledge and understanding of a phase 1 investigational drug is limited and where comprehensive product characterization is often unavailable, especially for products that are difficult to characterize. Therefore, it is critical to carefully control and record the manufacturing process in conjunction with appropriate testing to reproduce a comparable phase 1 investigational drug as may be necessary. Properly stored retained samples (e.g., API or drug substance, in-process material, phase 1 investigational drug) that can be subsequently analyzed for comparison, can provide important links in reproducing comparable biological and biotechnological products.\n\nYou should have in place appropriate equipment and controls in manufacturing to ensure that unit operations with safety-related functions (e.g., viral clearance, virus/toxin attenuation, pasteurization) perform their function with a high degree of assurance. Specific testing may also serve to complement these functions. In manufacturing, you should use testing for safety-related purposes such as viral loads, bioburden, detoxification of bacterial toxins, virus clearance (i.e., removal or inactivation), and removal of residual substances (e.g., antibiotics, chemicals) as appropriate (see section VI.2.2).\n\nvi.2.2 Adentitious Agent Control\n\nWhen evaluating the manufacturing environment for biological and biotechnology phase 1 investigational drugs, it is of particular importance to evaluate for susceptibility to contaminate the environment with biological substances, including microbial adventitious agents (e.g., bacterial, viral, mycoplasma), that may remain from previous research or manufacturing activities.\n\nSome biological and biotechnology phase 1 investigational drugs, including those made from pathogenic microorganisms, spore-forming microorganisms, transgenic animals and plants, live viral vaccines, and gene therapy vectors, warrant additional containment considerations. We encourage you to discuss such containment issues with the applicable Center within FDA (i.e., product and facility group with responsibility for the product) prior to engaging in manufacturing.\n\nIn addition to the recommendation in section VI.1, multi-product facilities should have in place cleaning and testing procedures that ensure prevention and/or detection of contamination by adventitious agents. To the extent possible, we recommend the use of dedicated equipment and/or disposable parts (e.g., tubing) for this reason. For multi-product areas, you should establish procedures to prevent cross-contamination, and to demonstrate removal of the previously manufactured product from shared equipment and work surfaces, especially if live viral and vector processing occurs in a manufacturing area.\n\nii.2.3 Gene Therapy and Cellular Therapy Products\n\nDue to the wide variety and unique manufacturing aspects of investigational gene and cellular therapy products, manufacturers should consider the appropriateness of additional or specialized controls. Although you should manufacture phase 1 investigational cell and gene therapy products following the recommendations in this guidance, we recognize that it may not be possible to follow each recommendation. For example, with some cellular products, it may be impossible to retain samples of the final cellular product due to the limited amounts of material available. Therefore, we recommend that you include your justification for adopting additional controls or alternative approaches to the recommendations in this guidance in the records on the phase 1 investigational drug.\n\nIn some cases, investigational gene and cellular therapy products may be manufactured as one batch per subject in phase 1 clinical trials (e.g., gene vector modified autologous cell products, autologous cell products). Manufacture of multiple batches will allow manufacturing and testing information to accumulate in an accelerated manner as compared to more conventional products. As manufacturing methods and assays used for testing can be novel for these products, it is important to monitor manufacturing performance to ensure product safety and quality.\n\nWhen manufacturing multiple batches of the same phase 1 investigational drug, we recommend that manufacturers periodically conduct and document internal performance reviews. We recommend that this review assess whether the manufacturing process is optimal to ensure overall product quality. Based on the review, appropriate modifications and corrective actions can be taken to control procedures and manufacturing operations.\n\nSterile Products/Aseptically Processed Products\n\nBecause product sterility is a critical element of human subject safety, you should take special precautions for phase 1 investigational drugs that are intended to be sterile. You should give thorough consideration to implementing appropriate controls for aseptic processing to ensure a sterile phase 1 investigational drug. The guidance issued by FDA on aseptic processing is a good reference when using aseptic processing (Ref. [7]). Particular manufacturing controls include:\n\nConducting aseptic manipulation in an aseptic workstation (e.g., laminar air flow workbench, biosafety cabinets, or barrier isolator system) under laminar airflow conditions that meet Class A, ISO 5. You should perform all manipulations of sterile products and materials under aseptic conditions.\n\nConducting a process simulation using bacterial growth media to demonstrate that the aseptic processing/controls and production environment are capable of producing a sterile drug\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPerforming environmental monitoring of the aseptic workstation during processing to ensure appropriate microbiological control. Such monitoring may include microbial monitoring by settling plates or by active air monitoring.\n\nDisinfecting the entire aseptic workstation as appropriate to the nature of the operations (e.g., before aseptic manipulation, or between different operations during the same day)\n\nEnsuring proper workstation installation and placement (e.g., workstations sufficiently separated to allow appropriate airflow) and ensuring that items within a laminar airflow aseptic workstation do not interrupt the unidirectional airflow\n\nDisinfecting gloves or changing them frequently when working in the laminar flow hood\n\nDisinfecting the surface of nonsterile items (e.g., test tube rack, and the overwrap for sterile syringes and filters) with sterile disinfectant solution before placing them in the laminar flow hood\n\nDocumenting and following all procedures intended to maintain the sterility of the components, in-process materials, and final phase 1 investigational drug\n\nDemonstrating that the test article does not interfere with the sterility tests (e.g., USP <71>)\n\nEmploying aseptic technique and control of microbiological impurities in components designed to prevent microbial and endotoxin contamination\n\nTraining personnel in using aseptic techniques\n\nVerifying that the equipment is suitable for its intended use, i.e., sterilization (e.g., autoclave, hot air oven); performing appropriate calibration of temperature probes used to monitor the sterilization cycle; using suitable and qualified biological indicators; and retaining maintenance and cycle run log records\n\nDemonstrating that the sterilization method for sterile components and disposable equipment (e.g., filters, bags, containers/ stoppers) is suitable and creating documentation that supports the appropriate use and shelf life of sterile components and equipment\n\nEnsuring that release of the final phase 1 investigational drug by the QC unit, or designated individual, includes an acceptable review of manufacturing records that demonstrate aseptic procedures and precautions were followed\n\nEnsuring that final phase 1 investigational drugs are not released until acceptable results of sterility testing are known. We understand that you may have to release a phase 1 investigational drug with a short shelf-life (e.g., radiopharmaceutical, cellular product) based on results from relevant tests (e.g., assessment of sterile filtration by bubble point filter integrity test, cell product -- an in-process test result and a negative gram stain, or other rapid microbial detection test and negative endotoxin test on the final product) while results of the sterility test are pending. When you obtain positive results or other relevant results from sterility testing, we recommend that you perform an investigation todetermine the cause of contamination followed by corrective action, if warranted. You should notify the person responsible for the associated clinical trials so appropriate action can be taken.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n6 Glossary\n\nAcceptance Criteria means numerical limits, ranges, or other suitable measures of test results necessary to determine acceptance of the drug substance, drug products, or materials at stages of their manufacture.\n--------------------\nContext title: Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Phase 1 Investigational Drugs Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.706736087799072", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.3.5 Environmental Monitoring\n\nAn environmental monitoring program should be established that routinely ensures acceptable microbiological quality of air, surfaces, and gloves (or half-suits) as well as particle levels, within the isolator. Nutrient media should be cleaned off of surfaces following a contact plate sample. Air quality should be monitored periodically during each shift. For example, we recommend monitoring the exit port for particles to detect any unusual results. Media used for environmental monitoring should not be exposed to decontamination cycle residues, as recovery of microorganisms would be inhibited.\n\n3.3.6 Personnel\n\nAlthough cleanroom apparel considerations are generally reduced in an isolator operation, the contamination risk contributed by manual factors can not be overlooked. Isolation processes generally include periodic or even frequent use of one or more gloves for aseptic manipulations and handling of material transfers into and out of the isolator. One should be aware that locations on gloves, sleeves, or half suits can be among the more difficult to reach places during decontamination, and glove integrity defects might not be promptly detected. Traditional aseptic processing vigilance remains critical, with an understanding that contaminated isolator glovescan lead to product nonsterility. Accordingly, meticulous aseptic technique standards must be observed (211.113), including appropriate use of sterile tools for manipulations.\n\nAppendix 2 Blow-fill- seal technology\n\nBlow-fill-seal (BFS) technology is an automated process by which containers are formed, filled, and sealed in a continuous operation. This manufacturing technology includes economies in container closure processing and reduced human intervention and is often used for filling and packaging ophthalmics, respiratory care products, and, less frequently, injectables. This appendix discusses some of the critical control points of this technology. Except where otherwise noted below, the aseptic processing standards discussed elsewhere in this document should apply to blow-fill-seal technology.\n\nEquipment Design and Air Quality\n\nMost BFS machines operate using the following steps.\n\nHeat a plastic polymer resin\n\nExtrude it to form a parison (a tubular form of the hot resin)\n\nCut the parison with a high-temperature knife\n\nMove the parison under the blow-fill needle (mandrel)\n\nInflate it to the shape of the mold walls\n\nFill the formed container with the liquid product\n\nRemove the mandrel\n\nSeal\n\nThroughout this operation, sterile-air is used, for example, to form the parison and inflate it prior to filling. In most operations, the three steps with the greatest potential for exposure to particle contamination and/or surrounding air are those in which (1) the parison is cut, (2) the parison is moved under the blow-fill mandrel, and (3) the mandrel is removed (just prior to sealing).\n\nBFS machinery and its surrounding barriers should be designed to prevent the potential for extraneous contamination. As with any aseptic processing operation, it is critical that product contact surfaces be sterile. A validated steam-in-place cycle, or equivalent process, should be used to sterilize the equipment path through which the product is conveyed. In addition, any other surface that represents a potential contamination risk to the sterile product should be sterile.\n\nThe classified environment surrounding BFS machinery should generally meet Class 100,000 (ISO 8), or better, standards, depending on the design of the BFS machinery and the surrounding room. HEPA-filtered or sterile air provided by membrane filters should be used during the steps when sterile products or materials are exposed (e.g., parison formation, container molding or filling steps). Air in the critical area should meet Class 100 (ISO 5) microbiological standards during operations. A well-designed BFS system should also normally achieve Class 100 (ISO 5) airborne particle levels. Only personnel who have been qualified and appropriately gowned should enter the classified environment surrounding the BFS machinery. Refer to Section V of this document for guidance on personnel training, qualification, and monitoring.\n\nBFS equipment design typically calls for use of specialized measures to reduce particle levels that can contaminate the exposed product. In contrast to nonpharmaceutical applications usingBFS machinery, control of air quality (i.e., particles) is critical for sterile drug product manufacture. Particles generated during the plastic extrusion, cutting, and sealing processes should be controlled. Provisions for carefully controlled airflow can protect the product by forcing generated particles outward while preventing any ingress from the adjacent environment. Furthermore, equipment designs that separate the filling zone from the surrounding environment provide additional product protection. Barriers, pressure vacuums, microenvironments, and appropriately directed high velocities of sterile air have been found useful in preventing contamination (Ref. [15]). Smoke studies and multi-location particle data can provide valuable information when performing qualification studies to assess whether proper particle control dynamics have been achieved throughout the critical area.\n\nIn addition to suitable design, it is important to establish an adequate preventative maintenance program. For example, because of its potential to contaminate the sterile drug product, the integrity of the cooling, heating and other utility systems associated with the BFS machine should be maintained and routinely monitored.\n\nValidation/Qualification\n\nAdvantages of BFS processing are known to include rapid container closure processing and minimized aseptic interventions. However, only a properly functioning process can realize these advantages. We recommend affording special attention to setup, troubleshooting of equipment, and related aseptic personnel procedures. Equipment sterilization, media fills, polymer extrusion/sterilization, product-plastic compatibility, forming and sealing integrity, and unit weight variation are among the key issues to address in validation and qualification studies.\n\nData gathered during such studies should ensure that BFS containers are sterile and, if used for parenteral drugs, nonpyrogenic. This can generally be achieved by validating that time temperature conditions of the extrusion process are effective against endotoxin or spore challenges in the polymeric material.\n\nThe choice of appropriate polymer material for a BFS operation includes assessing if a material is pharmaceutical grade, safe, pure, and passes appropriate criteria (Ref. [17]) for plastics. Polymer suppliers should be qualified and monitored for raw material quality.\n\nBatch Monitoring and Control\n\nVarious in-process control parameters (e.g., container weight variation, fill weight, leakers, air pressure) provide information to monitor and facilitate ongoing process control. It is essential to monitor the microbial air quality. Samples should be taken according to a comprehensive sampling plan that provides data representative of the entire filling operation. Continuous monitoring of particles can provide valuable data relative to the control of a blow-fill-seal operation.\n\nContainer closure defects can be a major problem in control of a BFS operation. It is critical that the operation be designed and set-up to uniformly manufacture integral units. As a final measure, the inspection of each unit of a batch should include a reliable, sensitive, final product examination that is capable of identifying defective units (e.g., leakers). Significant defects due to heat or mechanical problems, such as wall thickness, container or closure interface deficiencies, poorly formed closures, or other deviations should be investigated in accordance with SSSS 211.100 and 211.192.\n\nAppendix 3: Processing Prior to Filling and Sealing Operations\n\nThe purpose of this appendix is to supplement the guidance provided in this document with information on products regulated by CBER or CDER that are subject to aseptic processing at points early in the manufacturing process, or that require aseptic processing through the entire manufacturing process because it is impossible to sterile filter the final drug product. The scope of this appendix includes aseptic processing activities that take place prior to the filling and sealing of the finished drug product. Special considerations include those for:\n\nAseptic processing from early manufacturing steps\n\nSome products undergo aseptic processing at some or all manufacturing steps preceding the final product closing step. With other products, there is a point in the process after which they can no longer be rendered sterile by filtration. In such cases, the product would be handled aseptically at all steps subsequent to sterile filtration. In other instances, the final drug product cannot be sterile-filtered and, therefore, each component in the formulation would be rendered sterile and mixed aseptically. For example, products containing aluminum adjuvant are formulated aseptically because once they are alum adsorbed, they cannot be sterile-filtered.\n\nWhen a product is processed aseptically from the early stages, the product and all components or other additions are rendered sterile prior to entering the manufacturing process. It is critical that all transfers, transports, and storage stages be carefully controlled at each step of the process to maintain sterility of the product. In some cases, bulk drug substances or products should be tested for sterility.24\n\nFootnote 24: See 21 CFR 610.12 for general biological product standards for sterility.\n--------------------\nContext title: Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing \u2014 Current Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.875184535980225", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: Cleanrooms are normally designed as functional units with specific purposes. The materials of construction of cleanrooms ensure ease of cleaning and sanitizing. Examples of adequate design features include seamless and rounded floor to wall junctions as well as readily accessible corners. Floors, walls, and ceilings should be constructed of smooth, hard surfaces that can be easily cleaned. Ceilings and associated HEPA filter banks should be designed to protect sterile materials from contamination. Cleanrooms also should not contain unnecessary equipment, fixtures, or materials.\n\nProcessing equipment and systems should be equipped with sanitary fittings and valves. With rare exceptions, drains are considered inappropriate for classified areas of the aseptic processing facility other than Class 100,000 (ISO 8) areas. It is essential that any drain installed in an aseptic processing facility be of suitable design.\n\nEquipment should be appropriately designed (SS 211.63) to facilitate ease of sterilization. It is also important to ensure ease of installation to facilitate aseptic setup. The effect of equipment design on the cleanroom environment should be addressed. Horizontal surfaces or ledges that accumulate particles should be avoided. Equipment should not obstruct airflow and, in critical areas, its design should not disturb unidirectional airflow.\n\nDeviation or change control systems should address atypical conditions posed by shutdown of air handling systems or other utilities, and the impact of construction activities on facility control. Written procedures should address returning a facility to operating conditions following a shutdown.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nV Personnel Training, Qualification, & Monitoring\n\n21 CFR 211.22(a) states that \"There shall be a quality control unit that shall have the responsibility and authority to approve or reject all components, drug product containers, closures, in-process materials, packaging material, labeling, and drug products, and the authority to review production records to assure that no errors have occurred or, if errors have occurred, that they have been fully investigated. The quality control unit shall be responsible for approving or rejecting drug products manufactured, processed, packed, or held under contract by another company.\"\n\n21 CFR 211.22(c) states that \"The quality control unit shall have the responsibility for approving or rejecting all procedures or specifications impacting on the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug product.\"\n\n21 CFR 211.25(a) states that \"Each person engaged in the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of a drug product shall have education, training, and experience, or any combination thereof, to enable that person to perform the assigned functions. Training shall be in the particular operations that the employee performs and in current good manufacturing practice (including the current good manufacturing practice regulations in this chapter and written procedures required by these regulations) as they relate to the employee's functions. Training in current good manufacturing practice shall be conducted by qualified individuals on a continuing basis and with sufficient frequency to assure that employees remain familiar with CGMP requirements applicable to them.\"\n\n21 CFR 211.25(b) states that \"Each person responsible for supervising the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of a drug product shall have the education, training, and experience, or any combination thereof, to perform assigned functions in such a manner as to provide assurance that the drug product has the safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity that it purports or is represented to possess.\"\n\n21 CFR 211.25(c) states that \"There shall be an adequate number of qualified personnel to perform and supervise the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of each drug product.\"\n\n21 CFR 211.28(a) states that \"Personnel engaged in the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of a drug product shall wear clean clothing appropriate for the duties they perform. Protective apparel, such as head, face, hand, and arm coverings, shall be worn as necessary to protect drug products from contamination.\"\n\n21 CFR 211.28(b) states that \"Personnel shall practice good sanitation and health habits.\"\n\n21 CFR 211.28(c) states that \"Only personnel authorized by supervisory personnel shall enter those areas of the buildings and facilities designated as limited-access areas.\"\n\n21 CFR 211.28(d) states that \"Any person shown at any time (either by medical examination or supervisory observation) to have an apparent illness or open lesions that may adversely affect the safety or quality of drug products shall be excluded from direct contact with components, drug product containers, closures, in-process materials, and drug products until the condition is corrected or determined by competent medical personnel not to jeopardize the safety or quality of drug products. All personnel shall be instructed to report to supervisory personnel any health conditions that may have an adverse effect on drug products.\"\n\n21 CFR 211.42(c) states, in part, that \"Operations shall be performed within specifically defined areas of adequate size. There shall be separate or defined areas or such other control systems for the firm's operations as are necessary to prevent contamination or mixups during the course of the following procedures: *** (10) -- A specific processing, which includes as appropriate: *** (iv) A system for monitoring environmental conditions *** *.\"\n\n21 CFR 211.113(b) states that \"Appropriate written procedures, designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile, shall be established and followed. Such procedures shall include validation of any sterilization process.\"\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPersonnel\n\nA well-designed, maintained, and operated aseptic process minimizes personnel intervention. As operator activities increase in an aseptic processing operation, the risk to finished product sterility also increases. To ensure maintenance of product sterility, it is critical for operators involved in aseptic activities to use aseptic technique at all times.\n\nAppropriate training should be conducted before an individual is permitted to enter the aseptic manufacturing area. Fundamental training topics should include aseptic technique, cleanroom behavior, microbiology, hygiene, gowning, patient safety hazards posed by a nonsterile drug product, and the specific written procedures covering aseptic manufacturing area operations. After initial training, personnel should participate regularly in an ongoing training program. Supervisory personnel should routinely evaluate each operator's conformance to written procedures during actual operations. Similarly, the quality control unit should provide regular oversight of adherence to established, written procedures and aseptic technique during manufacturing operations.\n\nSome of the techniques aimed at maintaining sterility of sterile items and surfaces include:\n\nContact sterile materials only with sterile instruments Sterile instruments should always be used in the handling of sterilized materials. Between uses, sterile instruments should be held under Class 100 (ISO 5) conditions and maintained in a manner that prevents contamination (e.g., placed in sterilized containers). Instruments should be replaced as necessary throughout an operation. After initial gowning, sterile gloves should be regularly sanitized or changed, as appropriate, to minimize the risk of contamination. Personnel should not directly contact sterile products, containers, closures, or critical surfaces with any part of their gown or gloves.\n\nMove slowly and deliberately Rapid movements can create unacceptable turbulence in a critical area. Such movements disrupt the unidirectional airflow, presenting a challenge beyond intended cleanroom design and control parameters. The principle of slow, careful movement should be followed throughout the cleanroom.\n\nKeep the entire body out of the path of unidirectional airflow Unidirectional airflow design is used to protect sterile equipment surfaces, container-closures, and product. Disruption of the path of unidirectional flow air in the critical area can pose a risk to product sterility.\n\nApproach a necessary manipulation in a manner that does not compromise sterility of the productTo maintain sterility of nearby sterile materials, a proper aseptic manipulation should be approached from the side and not above the product (in vertical unidirectional flow operations). Also, operators should refrain from speaking when in direct proximity to the critical area.\n\nMaintain Proper Gown Control Prior to and throughout aseptic operations, an operator should not engage in any activity that poses an unreasonable contamination risk to the gown.\n\nOnly personnel who are qualified and appropriately gowned should be permitted access to the aseptic manufacturing area. The gown should provide a barrier between the body and exposed sterilized materials and prevent contamination from particles generated by, and microorganisms shed from, the body. The Agency recommends gowns that are sterilized and nonshedding, and cover the skin and hair (face-masks, hoods, beard/moustache covers, protective goggles, and elastic gloves are examples of common elements of gowns). Written procedures should detail the methods used to don each gown component in an aseptic manner. An adequate barrier should be created by the overlapping of gown components (e.g., gloves overlapping sleeves). If an element of a gown is found to be torn or defective, it should be changed immediately. Gloves should be sanitized frequently.\n--------------------\nContext title: Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing \u2014 Current Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -8.236917495727539", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: (a)(2) The place and month and year of manufacture:\n\n(i) The place of manufacture may be expressed in code provided the manufacturer has previously supplied the Director, Center for Devices and Radiological Health with the key to such code.__Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n(ii) The month and year of manufacture shall be provided clearly and legibly, without abbreviation, and with the year shown as a four-digit number as follows:\n\nManufactured: (Insert Month and Year of Manufacture.)\n\n(b) In the case of products for which it is not feasible to affix identification labeling in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, upon application by the manufacturer, the Director, Center for Devices and Radiological Health may approve an alternate means by which such identification may be provided.\n\n(c) Every manufacturer of an electronic product to which a standard under this subchapter is applicable shall provide to the Director, Center for Devices and Radiological Health a list identifying each brand name which is applied to the product together with the full name and address of the individual or company for whom each product so branded is manufactured.\n\nManufacturers must place identification information on their cabinet x-ray system which is either permanently affixed as a tag or a label or is inscribed on the product. This information must be legible, written in English, and readily accessible to view when the product is fully assembled. The identification information must include:\n\nThe full name and address of the manufacturer. 1. If the product is sold under a different name, then the full name and address of the individual or company selling the product may appear instead if information to identify the manufacturer has been previously provided to CDRH in a product report [21 CFR 1002.10] or supplemental report [21 CFR 1002.11]. 2. See 21 CFR 1010.3(a)(1) for the details on acceptable abbreviations in the manufacturer's name.\n\nThe place of manufacture. 3. The month and year of manufacture. 1. The month and year must not be abbreviated.\n\n4 Requirements of the Federal Radiation Safety\n\nPerformance Standard for Cabinet X-ray Systems\n\nManufacturers are required to certify [21 CFR 1010.2] that their products sold in the U.S. comply with the radiation safety performance standard for cabinet x-ray systems [21 CFR 1020.40]. The applicability of the performance standard is discussed above in the definitions of the terms 'cabinet x-ray system' and 'analytical x-ray system.'\n\nEmission Limit [21 CFR 1020.40(c)(1)(i)]: Radiation emitted from the cabinet x-ray system shall not exceed an exposure of 0.5 milliRoentgen in one hour at any point five centimeters outside the external surface.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThis requirement does not limit the rate of x-ray emission. It limits the total emission possible in any one hour. Consider the factors that will result in the maximum x-ray emission from the external surface of your product when designing your test program. The system must be tested at the settings and operating conditions resulting in the highest output to assure that this limit can not be exceeded [21 CFR 1010.2].\n\nThe amount of time x-ray can be on (x-ray on time) in any one-hour period, the duty cycle, is a factor in meeting this requirement. X-ray on time can be limited by physical system properties or interlocks. Total emissions must not exceed an exposure of 0.5 mR in one hour even when x-ray on time is at its maximum.\n\nCabinet x-ray systems with ports often use lead curtains to reduce the emissions. Most lead curtains are composed of multiple strips of leaded material. These strips of leaded material are deflected as items pass through creating intermittent gaps. A cabinet x-ray system with ports covered by lead curtains must meet the emission limit at the plane of any port even during an hour when items are being loaded into the system as fast as the system allows. A check of the condition of lead curtains should be included on the maintenance schedule [21 CFR 1020.40(c)(9)(i)] to assure the system remains compliant with the performance standard.\n\nTest and Measurement[21 CFR 1020.40(c)(1)(ii)]: Compliance with the exposure limit in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section shall be determined by measurements averaged over a cross-sectional area of ten square centimeters with no linear dimension greater than 5 centimeters, with the cabinet x-ray system operated at those combinations of x-ray tube potential, current, beam orientation, and conditions of scatter radiation which produce the maximum x-ray exposure at the external surface, and with the door(s) and access panel(s) fully closed as well as fixed at any other position(s) which will allow the generation of x radiation.\n\nThe standard states that compliance is determined by measurements averaged over a cross-sectional area of 10 square centimeters with no linear dimension greater than 5 centimeters. This means that when FDA makes a measurement to determine if a product complies with the emission limit, our test procedure will use a meter that meets that criteria or a test procedure that produces equivalent results. When selecting instrumentation and designing test procedures, manufacturers should be able to justify the equivalence of their results.\n\nYou should explain any correction factors used in your test and subsequent calculations in your procedure and your product report.\n\nThe measurement from the point of the highest emission reading must be less than the.5 mR emission limit [21 CFR 1020.40(c)(1)(i)]. An average of all emission measurements that is less than 0.5 mR in one hour is not sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the performance standard.\n\nYou should set the rejection limit for your test to determine compliance with the emission limit conservatively to account for the inherent error from measurement methods andinstrument accuracy. A rejection limit set at the emission limit might result in false certification of a product that does not comply but appeared to comply with the performance standard.\n\nFor your records, you need to write the measured exposure as a numerical measurement of the worst case emission from every system that you test. You must provide a summary of these test results as a histogram in your annual report [21 CFR 1002.30; see Guide for Filing Annual Reports for X-ray Components and Systems (July 1980)\n\n(http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/radhlth/pdf/xrcrypt0a.pdf)].\n\nInstrumentation\n\nThin walled Geiger-Mueller (GM) meters are very useful in making a qualitative measurement to identify the location of the largest amount of radiation emission on a cabinet x-ray system's external surface. GM meters cannot be adequately calibrated for making quantitative measurements of x-ray emission. X-ray tubes produce radiation that contains a spectrum of different energies. GM meters do not have a linear response to radiation at different energies. GM meters respond to the number of ionizing events occurring in their measurement volume; however, they produce no information about the energy associated with each ionization event. Therefore, GM meters do not respond with equal count rates to equal exposure rates from photons of different energies. You should not assume that because a GM meter's readout scale is scribed in exposure rate units that the meter will accurately measure that quantity. More information about instrument selection criteria can be found in National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) reports 57 and 112 (available from http://www.ncrponline.org).\n\nIon chambers are usually appropriate instruments for making quantitative measurements of radiation emission from cabinet x-ray systems. You should calibrate instruments as recommended by their manufacturers. Calibration should be done for an appropriate energy range for your product. Calibrating a meter with a Cesium 137 source (beta 511 keV and gamma 662 keV) and using it to measure a 120 kVp x-ray spectrum will lead to error that may be significant.\n\nFloors[21 CFR 1020.40(c)(2)]:\n\nA cabinet x-ray system shall have a permanent floor. Any support surface to which a cabinet x-ray system is permanently affixed may be deemed the floor of the system.\n\nWhen a space is occupied below the floor where a cabinet x-ray system is located, the floor may need additional shielding to assure that the emission below the floor meets the requirements of 21 CFR 1020.40(c)(1).\n\nPorts and Apertures[21 CFR 1020.40(c)(3)]:\n\n(i) The insertion of any part of the human body through any port into the primary beam shall not be possible. (ii) The insertion of any part of the human body through any aperture shall not be possible.\n\nThis requirement is intended to prevent accidental and routine operator exposure to the primary x-ray beam. Under this provision, insertion of any body part into a port must not be a standard operating procedure. This requirement is not intended to prevent people from intentionally attempting to defeat system safety features to reach the primary beam.\n\nContorting to reach into, crawling into, or riding through the port into the system are examples of intentional defeat of safety systems.\n--------------------\nContext title: Compliance Guide for Cabinet X-Ray Systems       September 2007\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -8.383581161499023", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Looking at the guidelines in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , How were locations of dosimeters selected for dose mapping studies?\n--------------------\nContext: An OAI inspection classification occurs when significant objectionable conditions or practices were found and regulatory action is warranted to address the establishment's lack of compliance with statutes and regulations. Examples of findings that would result in an OAI classification include, but are not limited to:\n\nTotal failure to establish a quality control and testing program capable of ensuring radiation safety of the product or compliance with applicable performance standards.\n\nAny single observation of a condition that poses an immediate radiation hazard to health and safety.\n\nObservations of any conditions that include radiation safety defects or failures to comply with applicable mandatory FDA radiation safety performance standards which, without correction, could pose a radiation hazard if the issue or defect is not addressed.\n\nA VAI inspection classification occurs when objectionable conditions or practices were found that do not meet the threshold of regulatory significance or do not pose an immediate radiation hazard to health and safety.\n\nA NAI inspection classification occurs when no objectionable conditions or practices were found during the inspection or the significance of the documented objectionable conditions found does not justify further regulatory actions.\n\nConsult CDRH if additional guidance is needed. If the inspection also covered firm compliance with medical device Quality Systems requirements, Compliance Program 7382.845, Part V, Quality System/GMP Regulatory/Administrative Follow-Up should be consulted for appropriate regulatory and administrative follow-up.\n\nC. REGULATORY ACTION To determine the appropriate regulatory action the ORA Division (Direct Reference only) and CDRH should consider inspection and test findings; the public health significance of objectionable conditions; the firm's history; the firm's responsiveness to observations; and whether the problem is widespread and continuing. Available actions include notification letters (21 CFR SS 1003.11 - a notification letter often results in a mandatory corrective action (21 CFR part 1004)), civil penalties, injunctions, and seizures. Informal consultation with the Center at an early stage in the development of a regulatory action is encouraged; contact CDRH at RadHealth(r)fda.hhs.gov.\n\nTimeframes for action Immediately notify CDRH and State and local health authorities about any product that poses an immediate radiation hazard to health and safety because of a defect or failure to comply. State and Local health authorities should be notified through a Radiological Health Representative (RHR). For all inspections and field tests that may require issuance of a notification letter, the EIR should be provided to CDRH through the ORA Division compliance officer to allow sufficient time to review, draft, and secure approval for the letter. The recommended timeframes for clearance of letters are provided in Chapter 4 of the Regulatory Procedures Manual (RPM): https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/compliance-manuals/regulatory-procedures-manual.\n\nNotification letters The Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (Section 535) and related regulations (21 CFR 1003.11) require the Agency to immediately notify manufacturers in writing upon determining that an electronic product fails to comply with an applicable performance standard or has a defect (21 CFR 1003.2). If the notified manufacturer does not submit a refutation (21 CFR 1003.11(a)(3)) or request an exemption from notification (21 CFR 1003.30(a)) or if the refutation or exemption request are denied by CDRH, then the notification will result in a mandatory corrective action (21 CFR 1004) for products which have left the place of manufacturer. Also, manufacturers should be made aware that they may not initiate any entries into commerce of electronic products that have known failures to comply. Issuance of all letters should follow Chapter 4 of the RPM. For electronic products that are also medical devices, notification letters may incorporate verbiage from Warning/Untitled Letters (and vice versa), in circumstances where there are both failures to comply with EPRC regulations as well as violations of medical device statutes.\n\nCDRH has direct reference authority to issue most EPRC letters. When there are FDA-483 observations and/or \"Discussion with Management\" items involving the EPRC regulations, ORA forwards the report with exhibits and recommended action to CDRH for review and follow-up. CDRH copies the accomplishing ORA Division on any letters issued and consultson regulatory and enforcement strategy when needed.\n\nNotification - Options and Details\n\nNotifications must include at least one defect (21 CFR 1003.2) or one failure to comply with applicable performance standards. The applicable performance standards are the general performance standard (21 CFR 1010) and at least one specific performance standard (21 CFR 1020 - 1050). The general performance standard only applies to electronic products subject to a specific performance standard. Defects may be cited for products subject to performance standards but only if the safety issue of concern is not also a failure to comply with those standards. If no specific performance standard applies then defect is the only option available to cite in a notification letter.\n\nA manufacturer's failure to fulfill applicable reporting and record keeping requirements (21 CFR 1002) is unlawful; however, it is not a failure to comply with a performance standard. Failures related to reports and record keeping may be included as additional violations that the manufacturer must correct in addition to other actions and responses required by the notification letter.\n\nA manufacturer that discovers, or is notified of, a failure to comply with a performance standard must immediately cease entry into commerce of affected electronic products. It is unlawful for a manufacturer to introduce an electronic product into commerce if it fails to comply with applicable performance standards. Before resuming entry into commerce a manufacturer must: 1) correct the design, manufacturing, or assembly issue that caused the failures to comply; 2) if there are any affected products that have not left the place of manufacture they must be modified to assure they fully comply with the performance standards; and 3) submit any required radiation safety reports, or report supplements, that document the changes made to assure new products will fully comply with the performance standards. The above actions are independent of a manufacturer's corrective action plan for affected electronic products that have left the place of manufacture.\n--------------------\nContext title: CPGM 7386.001\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -8.75288200378418"], "Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:1]\n\nTable of Contents\n\nI INTRODUCTION**\n\nII BACKGROUND**\n\nIII DISCUSSION**\n\nIII.

It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the appropriate FDA staff. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThis guidance provides to you, medical device manufacturers of communicable disease tests, information about performing studies to support modifying the indication for use to include testing of cadaveric blood specimens to screen donors of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps). This guidance makes recommendations about:\n\nSensitivity and specificity studies\n\nReproducibility studies\n\nNumber of test kit lots to include in studies\n\nPlasma dilution issues\n\nInformation about specimen collection times to be included\n\nThis document contains information which has been provided in Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research's (CBER's) letters to manufacturers of communicable disease tests. We, FDA, continue to encourage manufacturers of communicable disease tests to evaluate these tests for cadaveric HCT/P donor use and seek such labeling.\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the FDA's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA's guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nRecognizing the need for appropriately evaluated and labeled test kits, we issued letters in 1995 to manufacturers of donor screening tests introducing the subject of expanding the indication for use of blood donor screening tests to include testing of cadaveric blood specimens and suggesting a minimum protocol. In the Federal Register of July 29, 1997 (62 FR 40429), we issued a final rule, \"Human Tissue Intended for Transplantation,\" (the tissue final rule) which requires \"certain infectious disease testing, donor screening, and recordkeeping to help prevent the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis viruses through human tissue used in transplantation\" (62 FR 40429 at 40429) (Ref. 1). Additionally, the tissue final rule requires that \"FDA licensed screening tests labeled for cadaveric specimens must be used when available\" (21 Code of Federal Regulations 1270.21(d)). Also, in the Federal Register of July 29, 1997 (62 FR 40536), we announced the availability of a \"Guidance for Screening and Testing of Donors of Human Tissue Intended for Transplantation,\" dated July 1997, which further discussed the use of donor screening tests (Ref. 2).\n\nWe approved two biologic license supplements with the modified indication for use to include testing of cadaveric blood specimens. On December 28, 1999, FDA approved the Genetic Systems Corporation's Supplement to its Product License Application for Antibody to Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (Mouse Monoclonal) Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay to modify the intended use of the Genetic Systems HBsAg EIA 2.0 and the Genetic Systems HBsAg Cap Confirmatory Assay 2.0 to include the testing of cadaveric serum samples. On February 9, 2000, FDA approved the Genetic Systems Corporation's Supplement to their Product License Application for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Types 1 and 2 (Synthetic Peptide) to modify the intended use of the Genetic Systems HIV-1/HIV-2 Peptide EIA to include the testing of cadaveric serum samples. These approved tests detect antibodies to Hepatitis B Surface Antigen and antibodies to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2, respectively, in a cadaveric donor's serum.\n\nIn June 2000, we issued a \"Guidance for Industry: Availability of Licensed Donor Screening Tests Labeled for Use with Cadaveric Blood Specimens\" (the June 2000 guidance), which informed establishments of the availability of these two licensed donor screening tests labeled for use with cadaveric blood specimens (Ref. 3). In the Federal Register of May 25, 2004 (69 FR 29786), we issued a final rule \"Eligibility Determination for Donors of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products\" (Ref. 4) which requires that donors of cells and tissue be tested for evidence of infection due to relevant communicable disease agents or diseases. Those relevant communicable disease agents include HIV, types 1 and 2; hepatitis B virus; and hepatitis C virus, and, for certain donors, Human T-Lymphotrophic Virus, types I and II. Manufacturers of tests used to screen blood donors for communicable diseases have requested information on studies to support modifying the indication for use to include testing of cadaveric blood specimens from donors of HCT/Ps.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nWe recommend you address the following areas when preparing a protocol to modify the indication for use to include testing of cadaveric blood specimens.\n\nA. What data about specificity and sensitivity are recommended when matched pairs of pre- and post-mortem serum/plasma specimens are available?\n\nSpecificity We recommend that you test at least 50 paired specimens (1 pre- and 1 post-mortem specimen from the same donor). 1. Clinical Specificity Clinical specificity is a measure of how often the test is negative in non-diseased donors. We recommend that you determine if a statistically significant difference exists between pre- and post-mortem specimens based on frequency of false positive results. 2. Analytical Specificity Analytical specificity measures a test's ability to exclusively identify a target substance rather than different substances. We recommend that you determine if a statistically significant difference exists between pre- and post-mortem specimens based on signal strength.\n\nSensitivity We recommend that you test at least 50 paired reactive specimens (1 pre- and 1 post-mortem specimen from the same donor). 1. Clinical Sensitivity is a measure of how often the test is positive in diseased donors. We recommend that you determine if a statistically significant difference exists between pre- and post-mortem specimens based on frequency of false negative results.\n\nAnalytical Sensitivity Analytical sensitivity measures a test's ability to detect a low concentration of a given substance. We recommend that you determine if a statistically significant difference exists between pre- and post-mortem specimens based on signal strength and endpoint dilutions of positive specimens.\n\nWhat data about specificity and sensitivity are recommended when matched pairs of pre- and post-mortem serum/plasma specimens are not available?\n\nSpecificity We recommend that you concurrently test at least 50 cadaveric (post-mortem) specimens from 50 different cadaveric donors and an equal number of random living donor specimens (unmatched pre-mortem specimen) with the same test kit lots.\n\nClinical Specificity We recommend that you determine if a statistically significant difference exists between the cadaveric specimens and the random living donor specimens based on the frequency of false positive results, i.e., the number of pre-mortem nonreactives/post mortem reactives.\n\nAnalytical Specificity We recommend that you determine if a statistically significant difference exists between the cadaveric specimens and the random living donor specimens based on signal strength.\n\nAnalytical Sensitivity We recommend that you concurrently test at least 50 nonreactive cadaveric specimens from 50 different cadaveric donors with an equal number of random living donor specimens with the same kit lots, with both types of specimens spiked with the infectious disease marker at a potency near the assay's cutoff. You should use a minimum of 5 individual positive sources for the spiking experiment.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Recommendations for Obtaining a Labeling Claim for Communicable Disease Donor Screening Tests Using Cadaveric Blood Specimens from Donors of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT:Ps) Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.391577959060669", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: a. For which there may be a risk of transmission by an HCT/P, either to the recipient of the HCT/P or to those people who may handle or otherwise come in contact with the HCT/P, such as medical personnel, because the disease agent or disease:\n\ni. is potentially transmissible by an HCT/P; and\n\nii. either (1) has sufficient incidence and/or prevalence to affect the potential donor population (SS 1271.3(r)(2)(i)(B)(1)), or (2) may have been released accidentally or intentionally in a manner that could place potential donors at risk of infection (SS 1271.3(r)(2)(i)(B)(2));\n\nb. That could be fatal or life-threatening, could result in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to body structure, or could necessitate medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of body function or permanent damage to a body structure (SS 1271.3(r)(2)(ii)); and\n\nc. For which appropriate screening measures have been developed and/or an appropriate screening test for donor specimens has been licensed, approved, or cleared for such use by FDA and is available (SS 1271.3(r)(2)(iii)).\n\nIn summary, FDA considers: (1) Risk of transmission, (2) severity of effect, and (3) availability of appropriate screening measures or tests, in accordance with SS 1271.3(r)(2), as factors in determining whether a communicable disease or disease agent, not listed under SS 1271.3(r)(1), is relevant. The importance of these factors in determining relevance may be based on the clinical significance of the disease agent or disease. For example, Ureaplasma urealyticum, although highly prevalent and transmissible, is not considered a relevant communicable disease agent because its pathogenicity toreproductive cell and tissue recipients has low clinical significance. However, we require screening for TSEs and screening or testing for HIV-2, although less prevalent, because they pose extremely significant health risks.\n\nWhat communicable disease agents or diseases, not listed in SS 1271.3(r)(1), have been determined to be relevant?\n\nWe have determined the following communicable disease agents and diseases, not specifically listed under SS 1271.3(r)(1), to be relevant under SS 1271.3(r)(2). This determination was based on the risk of transmission, severity of effect, and availability of appropriate screening measures or tests as described in section 3.3. of this document. A brief discussion of these factors is provided under each relevant disease and agent listed. Additional background information is provided in the appendix, as indicated.\n\nWest Nile Virus (WNV)\n\nRisk of Transmission: There is a risk of transmission of WNV by HCT/Ps. This is supported by observations of WNV transmission via organ transplantation, and via blood and blood product transfusion. Although it is not possible to predict the incidence or severity of future WNV epidemics, our experience with the transmission pattern of WNV and the rapid geographic spread of the disease epidemic suggests that all or most of the United States would be at risk for exposure to the illness each year. WNV activity in birds and mosquitoes has been documented year-round in states with warm winter climates. Human infection in these areas is a theoretical risk at all times of the year (Ref. 5). (See Appendix 6).\n\nSeverity of Effect: WNV could be fatal or life-threatening, result in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure, and/or necessitate medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure.\n\nAvailability of Appropriate Screening and/or Testing Measures: Appropriate screening measures have been developed for WNV, such as the medical history interview and clinical evidence (see Refs. 5, 6, and 7 for further information regarding the background and rationale for WNV deferral). (Screening measures for WNV are discussed in sections 4.5. and 4.6. of this document.) A donor screening test for WNV, using NAT technology, has been licensed for use in living and cadaveric HCT/P donors. IND studies are also ongoing for the development of other NAT screening tests for WNV (see section 4.5. and Appendix 6).\n\nSepsis\n\nRisk of Transmission: There is a risk of transmission by HCT/Ps of any agent that could cause sepsis. The agents that cause sepsis include various bacterial, fungal, and viral agents. These agents have sufficient incidence and/or prevalence to affect the potential HCT/P donor population and are potentially transmissible. For the purpose of this document, sepsis includes, but is not limited to, bacteremia, septicemia, sepsis syndrome, systemic infection, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or septic shock (see Appendix 6).\n\nSeverity of Effect: Sepsis could be fatal or life-threatening, result in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure, and/or necessitate medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure. Mortality from sepsis is substantial, as sepsis is now among the top ten leading causes of death in the United States (see Appendix 6).\n\nAvailability of Appropriate Screening and/or Testing Measures: Appropriate screening measures have been developed for detection of sepsis, such as the medical history interview, and clinical and physical evidence. (Screening measures for sepsis are discussed in sections IV.E., IV.F. and IV.G. of this document.)\n\nVaccinia\n\nRisk of Transmission: There is a risk of transmission of vaccinia (the virus used in smallpox vaccine) by HCT/Ps. Vaccinia has sufficient incidence and/or prevalence to affect the potential donor population, especially in light of current small pox vaccination programs. Although there are no documented cases of transmission of vaccinia virus through implantation, transplantation, infusion, or transfer of HCT/Ps into a human recipient, two different investigators reported that vaccinia virus could sometimes be isolated from a patient's blood 3 to10 days after vaccination (Ref. 8). These studies did not use the less virulent New York City Board of Health (NYCBOH) strain of vaccinia virus that comprises currently available vaccines in the United States. Other investigators using the NYCBOH strain of vaccinia virus were only able to detect virus in the blood of patients with disseminated infection, but not in patients who only had localized lesions (Refs. 9 and 10). These studies are of limited value, however, because of their small size. Studies are now underway to determine the presence and frequency of vaccinia virus in the blood after vaccination (see Appendix 6).\n\nSeverity of Effect: Vaccinia virus could be fatal or life-threatening, result in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure, and/or necessitate medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure. Historically, for every million people vaccinated in the past, up to 52 people have had a life-threatening reaction to smallpox vaccine and up to two people per million vaccinated have died (Refs. 10 and 11).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe potential consequences of vaccinia infection include severe complications (see Appendix 4). These consequences are more likely to occur in HCT/P recipients who are immunocompromised or who have burns or other serious skin conditions. Vaccinia virus infection rarely causes severe complications such as encephalitis and severe generalized vaccinia in otherwise healthy people. Also, the route of infection could influence the severity of the disease, so that it is possible that vaccinia infection transmitted via HCT/Ps could result in different or more severe infections than when acquired percutaneousally (Ref. 12).\n\nAvailability of Appropriate Screening and/or Testing Measures: There are appropriate screening measures, such as the medical history interview, and clinical and physical evidence (see Ref. 12 for further information regarding the background and rationale for vaccinia deferral). (Screening measures for vaccinia are discussed in sections IV.E., IV.F. and IV.G. of this document.)\n\nE. How will FDA handle other emerging infectious diseases in regard to HCT/P donor eligibility?\n\nWe intend to notify you through a guidance, if we determine that an infectious disease meets the definition of a relevant communicable disease under SS 1271.3(r)(2). The guidance would include our comments or recommendations for donor screening and testing. We also intend to notify you through a guidance, if we conclude that a disease identified as \"relevant\" under SS 1271.3(r)(2), no longer meets the criteria as a \"relevant\" disease for purposes of the donor eligibility regulations. In suitable situations, we will hold public meetings or consult with advisory committees to help us identify communicable disease agents or diseases for which donor screening and testing must be performed under SSSS 1271.75, 1271.80, and 1271.85.\n\nF. What procedures must I establish and maintain?\n\nYou must establish and maintain procedures for all steps that you perform in testing, screening, determining donor eligibility, and complying with all other requirements of part 1271, subpart C (SS 1271.47(a)). A responsible person must review and approve all procedures before their implementation (SS 1271.47(b)). These procedures must be readily available to personnel in the area where the procedures are performed, or if this is not practical, in a nearby area (SS 1247(c)).\n--------------------\nContext title: Eligibility Determination for Donors of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.6464998722076416", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nMedical records;\n\nCoroner and autopsy reports; and\n\nRecords or other information received from any source pertaining to risk factors for relevant communicable disease (e.g., social behavior, clinical signs and symptoms of relevant communicable disease, and treatments related to medical conditions suggestive of risk for relevant communicable disease). Examples of these records include: medical examiner reports, police records, and information from other tissue or medical establishments, if applicable.\n\nYou should make inquiries into these records and other information when the circumstances indicate that follow-up information might be relevant for screening a potential cell or tissue donor. For example, when reviewing the relevant medical records, including the medical/social history interview, the tissue bank might find information to suggest that the donor might have been incarcerated, pursued by the police, or been under police investigation, or that the cause of death resulted in a police report (e.g., fatal gunshot wound). If that is the case, the tissue bank should make inquiries to obtain all relevant information regarding the eligibility of the donor, which is available from and disclosable by the police department.\n\nWe define \"available\" to mean that a record or information exists, or is pending, and can be obtained through due diligence, within a reasonable amount of time. A \"reasonable\" amount of time is a period of time that would allow for the collection of important information without compromising the utility of the tissue. Examples of these terms are as follows:\n\nExample 1: A living donor brings his medical records with him to the screening site. These records are available, and you would review them.\n\nExample 2: A cadaveric donor dies as a result of an event that leads to the creation of a police report. If the police report was disclosable to you within a reasonable period of time, you would review it.\n\nExample 3: You know that an autopsy report will be prepared on a cadaveric donor, but the report will not be complete for several weeks. If waiting several weeks to review the autopsy report would compromise the utility of the tissue, perhaps because your HCT/P (e.g., cornea) needs to be released within a limited timeframe, then the report could not be obtained in a reasonable time period. Under these circumstances, it might not be necessary to wait to review the final report of autopsy results before distribution of the HCT/P. If this is the case, you should use the available information when considering the donor's eligibility, including the presumed cause of death and other relevant preliminary autopsy findings and all other information obtained about the donor. Also, you should review the final autopsy report when it becomes available. If any new information in the final report indicates that the donor is ineligible, you should consider notifying the consignees of the distributed HCT/Ps and submit to FDA an HCT/P deviation report within 45 days, if applicable.\n\nAppendix D When may I perform an abbreviated donor screening procedure?\n\nSection 1271.75(e) states, \"If you have performed a complete donor screening procedure on a living donor within the previous 6 months, you may use an abbreviated donor screening procedure on repeat donations. The abbreviated procedure must determine and document any changes in the donor's medical history since the previous donation that would make the donor ineligible, including relevant social behavior.\"\n\nIf you perform an abbreviated screening:\n\nYou do not need to conduct a new physical examination or a new review of relevant medical records.\n\nYou should remind the donor about behaviors that could put him/her at risk of a relevant communicable disease. If any new behavioral risk has been identified in the interval since the last donation, you should also address that new behavioral risk.\n\nWe do not require that this information be presented in any specific way. Possible methods include the use of a pamphlet or a wall chart, or other effective means of communication.\n\nYou should then ask the donor if there have been any changes in donor history or risk factors since the previous donation.\n\nIf you wish to perform an abbreviated donor screening procedure, you must have conducted a complete donor screening procedure on the living donor (including donor history questionnaire, physical examination, and review of any new medical records, if applicable) within 6 months prior to the abbreviated procedure (SS 1271.75(e)).\n\nAppendix E What risk factors or conditions do I look for when screening a donor?\n\nFor all donors, you must review the relevant medical records and ask questions about the donor's medical history and relevant social behavior, including risk factors for relevant communicable disease agents and diseases, and communicable disease risks associated with xenotransplantation (SS 1271.75(a)).\n\nFollowing is a list of conditions and behaviors that increase the donor's relevant communicable disease risk. Except as noted in this section, and in accordance with SS 1271.75(d), you should determine to be ineligible any potential donor who exhibits one or more of the following conditions or behaviors.\n\nMen who have had sex with another man in the preceding 5 years (Refs. 17 through 46) (risk factor for HIV and Hepatitis B).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPersons who have injected drugs for a non-medical reason in the preceding 5 years, including intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injections (Refs. 18, 21, 22, 25, 27, 29, 33, 34, 36, 38, 42, and 45 through 59) (risk factor HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C).\n\nPersons with hemophilia or other related clotting disorders who have received human-derived clotting factor concentrates in the preceding 5 years (Refs. 18 and 60) (risk factor for HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C). A donor who received clotting factors once to treat an acute bleeding event more than 12 months ago may be eligible to donate.\n\nPersons who have engaged in sex in exchange for money or drugs in the preceding 5 years (Refs. 18, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 29, 33, 34, 38, 40, 44, 45, 46, 61, 62, and 63) (risk factor for HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C).\n\nPersons who have had sex in the preceding 12 months with any person described in criteria 1 through 4 of this section or with any person who has HIV infection, including a positive or reactive test for HIV virus (Refs. 17 and 18), hepatitis B infection (Ref. 64), or clinically active (symptomatic) hepatitis C infection (Refs. 65 and 66).\n\nPersons who have been exposed in the preceding 12 months to known or suspected HIV, HBV, and/or HCV-infected blood through percutaneous inoculation (e.g., needle stick) or through contact with an open wound, non-intact skin, or mucous membrane (Refs. 18 and 64).\n\nChildren born to mothers with or at risk for HIV infection:\n\nIf 18 months of age or younger, or\n\nIf breast-fed within the preceding 12 months.\n\nNote: We do not recommend deferral of a donor who is a child born to a mother with or at risk for HIV infection if the child is over 18 months of age and has not been breast-fed within the preceding 12 months, provided that the child's HIV antibody tests, physical examination, and medical records do not indicate evidence of HIV infection (Ref. 18).\n\nPersons who have been in juvenile detention, lock up, jail or prison for more than 72 consecutive hours in the preceding 12 months (Refs. 29, 67, and 68) (risk factor for HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C).\n\nPersons who have lived with (resided in the same dwelling) another person who has hepatitis B or clinically active (symptomatic) hepatitis C infection in the preceding 12 months (Ref. 69).\n\nPersons who have undergone tattooing, ear piercing or body piercing in the preceding 12 months, in which sterile procedures were not used, e.g., contaminated instruments and/or ink were used, or shared instruments that had not been sterilized between uses were used (Ref. 69).\n\nPersons who have had a past diagnosis of clinical, symptomatic viral hepatitis after their 11th birthday (Refs. 70 and 71), unless evidence from the time of illness documents that the hepatitis was identified as being caused by hepatitis A virus, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), or cytomegalovirus (CMV).\n\nPersons who are deceased and have a documented medical diagnosis of sepsis or have documented clinical evidence consistent with a diagnosis of sepsis that is not explained by other clinical conditions at the time of death. For example, if a statement such as \"rule-out sepsis\" is noted in the medical records, and subsequent notations indicate a diagnosis other than sepsis, a potential donor might still be eligible.\n\nPersons who have had smallpox vaccination (vaccinia virus) in the preceding 8 weeks (Ref. 12) should be evaluated as follows:\n\nFor persons who had no vaccinia complications (see Appendix 4 for definition of vaccinia complication):\n\n(\\bullet) You should defer the donor until after the vaccination scab has separated spontaneously, or for 21 days post-vaccination, whichever is the later date, and until the physical examination or physical assessment includes a confirmation that there is no scab at the vaccination site.\n\n(\\bullet) In cases where a scab was removed before separating spontaneously, you should defer the donor for two months after vaccination.\n\nNote: We do not recommend deferral of a cadaveric donor who was vaccinated at least 21 days ago and who has no visible scab, if you are unable to obtain a history of how the scab separated.\n\nb. For persons who have experienced vaccinia complications (see Appendix 4), you should defer the donor until 14 days after all vaccinia complications have completely resolved.\n--------------------\nContext title: Eligibility Determination for Donors of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.484640598297119", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nExample 3 - A sponsor conducted a randomized two-arm unblinded study comparing a wound-healing device to the standard of care with a primary endpoint of time to drain removal. At study initiation, there was uncertainty about the variability in the estimated difference in mean time to drain removal (i.e., the standard error of the difference), so the sponsor chose to design the study to proceed until the estimated standard error for the difference in mean time to drain removal reached a certain agreed-upon threshold. As a result, the study needed to be conducted only until the pre-determined amount of information was acquired.. A similar approach could be taken in a study with a performance goal where the standard deviation is not known at the outset.\n\nExample 4 - A sponsor conducts a diagnostic clinical study, in which the sponsor compares their investigational imaging system for detecting solid tumors, using an already-approved device as a comparator plus a reference standard. The goal is to establish non-inferiority to the already approved device. The primary comparisons will involve both sensitivity and specificity of the new device in comparison to the old device. The ability to anticipate sample size is limited, because it will depend on whether both new and old devices misclassify the same cases or different ones, as well as prevalence of the target condition of interest (a tumor present or absent). So an interim analysis can be used to determine if (a) a stop for futility is warranted or (b) additional subjects need to be enrolled.\n\nExample 5 - A sponsor designs a group sequential trial for a surgical device so that at each interim analysis there are separate tests for effectiveness in diabetics and non-diabetics as well as overall. At one interim analysis, according to pre-specified rules, the device does not appear to be effective in diabetic patients. Further enrollment into the study is restricted to non-diabetic patients and the device gains approval for non-diabetic patients only. This is referred to as \"adaptive enrichment\" and is discussed further in Section 6.H.\n\n2.3.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAdaptive designs can use either frequentist or Bayesian statistical methodology. However, underlying principles discussed in this guidance regarding issues such as bias control, blinding, and operating characteristics of the study design are the same regardless of the statistical methods used.\n\nAdvantages of Adaptive Designs\n\nAn adaptive study design can have several distinct advantages when compared to a fixed (non-adaptive) design.\n\nIt can be more efficient, saving time, money, and resources. This can occur in several ways. A trial with interim analyses could stop early for effectiveness in a preplanned way. A trial with two or more investigational arms could plan to drop one of them based on accumulating data. A single or multi-arm trial with a preplanned interim analysis could be stopped early for futility.\n\nAdaptive designs can improve the chance of trial success by employing sample size reassessment (SSR), whether for a superiority or a non-inferiority study. Based on accumulating data in the trial, planned SSR could lead to an adjustment in sample size, converting an underpowered study likely to fail into a study more likely to succeed. This approach allows for mid-course correction in trials where there is a treatment effect that is meaningful but smaller than originally anticipated. This facilitates the timely assessment and marketing of medical devices demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.\n\nAdaptive design may facilitate transition from premarket to postmarket follow-up. For example, a preplanned interim analysis that demonstrates favorable short-term study outcomes may result in a successful marketing application with continued follow-up relegated to the post-market stage. For further information see the FDA_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nGuidance \"Balancing Premarket and Postmarket Data Collection for Devices Subject to Premarket Approval.\"3 Footnote 3: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM393994.pdf\n* In some cases, planned modifications can occur without inflating the false positive error rate, provided there is a sufficiently strong blind to outcomes by treatment groups.\n* Certain types of adaptive designs can enhance patient protection by increasing the probability that a patient is assigned to the treatment most likely to result in a better outcome for that patient.\n* Adaptive designs can include a plan to modify the patient population during the study, converting what would otherwise be a failed study to one with, for example, a more targeted indication for which there are data to support both safety and effectiveness. This adaptation could help identify patients more likely to have a favorable benefit-risk profile from the use of a device. Such an adaptation effectively enriches the study population, which should be considered when interpreting the study results.\n* Adaptive studies can improve decision-making at milestones during product development or increase the chance of a successful study with the potential to improve time-to-market.\n\nOverall, adaptive designs may enable more timely device development decision-making and therefore, more efficient investment in resources in a clinical study. From an ethical standpoint, adaptive designs may optimize the treatment of subjects enrolled in the study and safeguard their welfare from ineffective or unsafe treatments and interventions at the earliest possible stage.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe following are some of the possible limitations associated with an adaptive design study:\n\nPreplanned study design modifications can require more effort at the design stage, although this investment can pay great dividends during the study conduct. Adaptive study designs that are overly complicated can be difficult to plan, cost more, be logistically difficult to carry out, and provide overall results that are difficult to interpret.\n\nIf not done correctly, adaptive designs can introduce operational or statistical bias, making it difficult to characterize the true effect of the investigational device. See Section 2.1. for additional details.\n\nA change to the study due to an adaptation may lead to results before the adaptation that are not sufficiently similar to those after the adaptation; this may confound the interpretation of the study results. (See Section 2.2.2.)\n\nThe maximum sample size and/or study duration may be greater than a non-adaptive design.\n\nFor an in-depth discussion of the various types of planned modifications or adaptations, and their advantages and limitations, see Section 2.2.\n\n2.2.2 Adaptive Studies as a Learning Paradigm\n\nAn adaptive design can allow for learning from the results of the study during its course and for preplanned changes to the study based on the accumulating outcome data. Such adaptation is a natural process during early feasibility studies in device development but for pivotal studies and some late feasibility studies such adaptation needs to be well-planned. Adaptive studies can be especially useful in the pivotal stage if there are uncertainties about one or two aspects of the study. In some cases, an adaptive design can obviate the need for a feasibility study (or a second feasibility study), and instead can allow the uncertainties to be scientifically addressed in an adaptive pivotal study. Generally, an adaptive study allows the planners to learn, during the study conduct, about a small numberof uncertainties and make preplanned, scientifically-valid changes based on accumulating data while maintaining study integrity. However, if there are numerous uncertainties, an adaptive design may be difficult to plan and implement. In such cases, it may actually be more efficient and increase the overall likelihood of success to conduct one (or more) additional feasibility studies to resolve some of these uncertainties before embarking on a pivotal trial.\n\nMedical devices are often developed in a linear fashion, i.e., feasibility followed by pivotal explorations regarding clinical performance. Early feasibility studies may have a number of modifications that occur during the study, which may be unplanned. For these studies, it may not be necessary to apply formal statistical principles in order to draw useful conclusions for device development. In contrast, for some traditional (later stage) feasibility studies and for most pivotal studies, robust statistical validity is important, and unplanned modifications can undermine the study's purpose. For more general information on pivotal clinical investigations, see the FDA Guidance \"Design Considerations for Pivotal Clinical Investigations for Medical Devices.\"4\n\nFootnote 4: http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/u cm373750.htm\n\nWhile most of the adaptations described in this guidance are more useful and appropriate for pivotal studies, adaptive designs can apply to some late feasibility studies. For example, an adaptive feasibility study could increase the statistical rigor and lead to a more accurate estimate of device performance and hence enhance decision-making and the likelihood of later success at the pivotal stage. As outlined in Section 6.K., the planning of adaptations at the feasibility stage can also facilitate seamless feasibility-pivotal study transition. Sponsors may be able to productively utilize information from feasibility studies to help guide the appropriate design of pivotal studies, whether adaptive or not.\n\n(\\mathrm{F}). Study Design Changes That Are Not Adaptive\n\n2.3.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe following are examples of changes that are not adaptive:\n--------------------\nContext title: Adaptive Designs for Medical Device Clinical Studies Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.402544021606445", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: Medical Intervention\n\n13.1 If a health care provider notices that a medical device is malfunctioning (i.e., not performing as intended) and intervenes before the malfunctioning device can harm the patient (i.e., can cause or contribute to a serious injury or death), is this reportable?\n\nThe event would be reportable as a malfunction if the malfunction would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. If the device malfunctions but the user intervenes before there is any harm to the patient, the event should be reported as a malfunction if the manufacturer concludes that the malfunction is likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction returned. Your investigation of the event should also confirm and document that in this instance; the device malfunction did not cause or contribute to any change in the patient's condition that would be considered a reportable serious injury (see section 2.13 of this guidance for the definition of \"serious injury\").\n\nPatient Information\n\n14.1 It is very difficult to obtain patient information due to patient confidentiality in the health care setting. Is this information always necessary?\n\nIt is necessary to attempt to obtain the patient information required by 21 CFR 803.52, including patient identification, especially if the event involved a death or serious injury. However, we request that the patient be identified only by code, not by an actual patient name.18 This will protect the privacy of the patient. Other required information about the patient (e.g., age, gender, and weight) generally can be provided without affecting patient confidentiality.\n\nFootnote 18: See Instructions for FDA Form 3500A \u2013 Section A: Patient Information, A1: Patient identifier.\n\nExactly what constitutes an MDR reportable event involving my radiation therapy device where there was incorrect treatment but no demonstrable patient injury?\n\nA radiation therapy or other radiation-emitting device (e.g., CT scanner, fluoroscope) intended for medical use is capable of causing or contributing to a radiation-related death or serious injury. An event in which a person receives a radiation injury, such as a tissue reaction, would be reportable if the device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or it has failed to perform as intended (malfunctioned) and would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur.\n\nAt this time, we have not adopted a radiation exposure or dose threshold for such injuries. A malfunction or problem related to a radiation treatment or planning system would have to be evaluated to determine if the expected outcome of the device failure or problem would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury to the patient if it were to recur.\n\n4.16 Reports Based On Literature\n\n.16.1 Must I investigate and submit reports on MDR reportable events reported in literature sources?\n\nYes, if the information in the literature source is made known to you or to any of your employees (i.e., you or they become aware of this information) and the information reasonably suggests that a reportable event or events may have occurred, then you must comply with the requirements of the MDR regulation and make a reasonable attempt to investigate each event [21 CFR 803.3(a)(1) and 21 CFR 803.18(e)]. The regulation identifies professional, scientific, or medical facts, observations, or opinions to be information that may reasonably suggest that a reportable event has occurred. [21 CFR 803.20(c)].\n\n16.2 What guidance can you provide concerning how to report events found in scientific articles and other literature?\n\nYou must investigate each event reported in the literature source to determine if the information represents an MDR reportable event [21 CFR 803.18(e)]. If the information in the literature source and/or your investigation of the cited events reveals specific information about all or some of the reportable events, then you will need to report these events as individual reports. For example, you could contact the author of the literature source and request information about all or some of the patient and/or device-related events.\n\nYou should also try to determine if the events in the literature source match events otherwise made known to your firm, and whether the events may have been previously reported to us. If they do, then you do not have to submit a second initial report, but you do need to consider whether or not you are in receipt of additional information that should be submitted as a supplement [21 CFR 803.56] (see section 2.22 of this guidance).\n\nWe do realize that information from literature sources may not provide specifics about some or all of the events discussed and you may be able to provide us with only very limited information about each reportable event. For this reason, we would consider accepting one report for multiple reportable events where the source of the information is a literature document and, after investigation, you cannot obtain enough information about each identified patient and/or device mentioned, in order to provide a complete report for each reportable event.\n\nOur instructions for completing Form 3500A address submission of a report for reportable events where the source of the information is a literature review (see instructions for Block G-3). In addition, we recommend the following for all reportable events identified in literature sources (published or unpublished) when there is limited information about the device and/or the patient and follow up is not possible:\n\nSubmit an individual report for each event type if more than one is identified. For example, if the literature source includes information about patient deaths, serious injuries and reportable malfunction events, you should submit three individual reports (one for each of these three event types).\n\nSubmit an individual report for each device identified if the generic names of the devices are different. For example, if a literature source identifies your suspect devices as catheters and pacemakers, then you should submit two reports to cover these two different devices. You would also need to account for different event types (death, serious injury, or malfunction), as noted in the bullet above.\n\nYou should provide the following information in your submission:\n\nThe most representative data available. For example, you should report the average patient age and weight, as well as the gender of the majority of patients involved. The date of the event should be reported as the date of the literature source, and the date of the report should be reported as the date that the literature first came to the attention of you or one of your employees.\n\nAll the events covered by the report can be summarized in an ExcelEXCEL(tm) spreadsheet and attached to your report. You should include the following information in your summary:\n\nDevice identification information (brand name, model, or catalog number);\n\nPatient and device problem codes; and\n\nManufacturer device evaluation and conclusion codes.\n\nYou should either attach a copy of the literature source to your report or provide the web address location for the article.\n\n5 Questions Concerning Completion of the MDR Report\n\nNOTE: There are instructions for completing Form 3500A and a website that identifies the codes to be used for specific blocks on the form.\n\nThe instructions for completing the form can be obtained at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/DownloadForms/UCM\n\n387002.pdf.\n\nA detailed description of Event Problem Code terminology can be found at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/PostmarketRequirements/ReportingAdverseEvents/EventProblemCodes/ucm134751.htm.\n\nThe information in this Section is intended to clarify certain issues and answer questions about completion of the form. It is not intended to change or modify, in any way, Form 3500A or instructions for completing the form.\n\nNote: The information required to be provided in the MDRs from manufacturers is described in 21 CFR 803.52. This information generally corresponds to the information required by the FDA Form 3500A. MDRs must be submitted to FDA in an electronic format in accordance with [SS803.12(a) and SS803.20, unless granted an exemption under SS803.19].\n\nInformation about electronic reporting can be obtained at eMDR - Electronic Medical Device Reporting.\n\nGeneral Questions\n\nWhen submitting my initial report why can't I just fill in the parts of the form for which I have the information requested, and leave the rest of the form blank?\n\nIf the fields are left blank, we cannot determine what information was unknown to you or what information was simply overlooked. By completing each requested data element, you assure us that all elements were considered and reviewed. Please see the instructions for completing reports at:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/DownloadForms/UCM\n\n387002.pdf, or the information for electronic reporting at eMDR - Electronic Medical Device Reporting.\n\nWhat are the most common problems you see in the way manufacturers fill out Form 3500A?\n\nThe most common problems that we encounter are as follows:\n\nDuplicate report sequence numbers provided in the Manufacturer Report Number box and Block G-9. Each report must have its own sequence number to avoid confusion. [See 21 CFR 803.3 for the definition of \"manufacturer report number.\"] You should not use the same sequence number on more than one report in any given year.\n--------------------\nContext title: Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.7239484786987305", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Taking into account the content of Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Can you provide examples of how Factors 2 and 3 are applied?\n--------------------\nContext: devices that might have had a bearing\n\nattention to a possible association\n\nhad been returned to the manufacturer.\n\non the adverse event being reported.\n\nbetween a serious injury or death and a\n\nSeveral comments suggested that the\n\nmedical device.\n\nagency should advise user facilities to\n\nemand the form to specify other\n\nFDA, an its own initiative, has\n\nremul allegedly faulty devices to\n\nmedications or devices that might have\n\nchanged the caption of section D.1 from\n\nmanufacturers.\nhad an impact on the event.

This section describes the:\n\nRegulatory framework applicable to the design of clinical studies that support pre-market submissions for medical devices;\n\nStatutory standard for approval of a PMA;\n\nRegulatory requirements that apply to clinical and other data used to meet the statutory standard for approval of a PMA;\n\nHow FDA evaluates the data to assess the risks and benefits of a device;\n\nBasic information about Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) applications; and\n\nFDA's current thinking on good regulatory practice as identified in the least burdensome concept.\n\nThis guidance reflects the Agency's consideration of standards for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve the participation of human subjects. Related international documents include the \"Declaration of Helsinki\" and are further explained in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 14155:2011, Clinical investigation of medical devices for human subjects - Good clinical practice and through the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance. FDA regulations under 21 CFR Parts 50, 54, 56, and 812 articulate good clinical practice (GCP) requirements applicable to clinical investigations of medical devices. In addition, FDA guidance documents describe FDA's current thinking on GCP and the conduct of clinical studies.3 Compliance with GCP, as applicable to medical devices, protects the rights, safety, and well-being of human subjects, ensures appropriate scientific conduct of the clinical investigation and the credibility of the results, defines the responsibilities of the sponsor and the clinical investigator, and assists sponsors, investigators, institutional review boards (IRBs), other ethics committees, regulatory authorities, and other bodies involved in the development and review of medical devices.\n\nFootnote 3: A list of FDA\u2019s GCP guidance documents is available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm122046.htm.\n\nIf a clinical investigation of a device is conducted in the United States it must comply with the applicable regulations found in 21 CFR Part 56 (IRBs), Part 50 (informed consent), and Part 812 (investigation device exemption (IDE)). If the clinical investigation of the device is conductedoutside of the United States, submitted in support of a PMA, and conducted under an IDE, the study shall comply with 21 CFR Part 812. 21 CFR 814.15(a). If a clinical investigation of a device is conducted completely outside the United States and not conducted under an IDE, FDA will accept studies submitted in support of a PMA, if the data are valid and the investigator has conducted the studies in conformance with the \"Declaration of Helsinki\" or the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever accords greater protection to the human subjects, in accordance with 21 CFR 814.15. A PMA based solely on foreign clinical data may be approved if the foreign data are applicable to the United States population and medical practice; the studies have been performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence; if an inspection is needed, FDA can validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means; and the application otherwise meets the criteria for approval. 21 CFR 814.15(d). The sponsor must be able to show that the foreign clinical data are adequate to support approval of the device in the United States, under applicable standards. Section 569B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act or the Act). We encourage you to meet with FDA in a Pre-Submission meeting if you intend to seek approval based on foreign data, or based on a combination of foreign and U.S. data.\n\nThe Statutory Standard for Approval of a PMA: Reasonable Assurance of Safety and Effectiveness\n\nAs indicated by Sections 513(a)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act, a PMA must provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device. FD&C Act Section 513(a)(2) states:\n\n[T]he safety and effectiveness of a device are to be determined:--\n\n(A) with respect to the persons for whose use the device is represented or intended,\n\n(B) with respect to the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the\n\nlabeling of the device, and\n\n(C) weighing any probable benefit to health from the use of the device against any\n\nprobable risk of injury or illness from such use.\n\nIn addition, FDA has, through regulation, interpreted the statutory standard for approval of a PMA as follows:\n\n21 CFR 860.7(d)(1). There is reasonable assurance that a device is safe when it can be determined, based upon valid scientific evidence, that the probable benefits to health from use of the device for its intended uses and conditions of use, when accompanied by adequate directions and warnings against unsafe use, outweigh any probable risks. The valid scientific evidence used to determine the safety of a device shall adequately\n\ndemonstrate the absence of unreasonable risk of illness or injury associated with the use of the device for its intended uses and conditions of use.\n\n_21 CFR 860.7(e)(1). There is reasonable assurance that a device is effective when it can be determined, based upon valid scientific evidence, that in a significant portion of the target population, the use of the device for its intended uses and conditions of use, when accompanied by adequate directions for use and warnings against unsafe use, will provide clinically significant results._These statutory and regulatory provisions specify that a finding of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness must be supported by data relevant to the target population, and evaluated in light of the device labeling. Further, a determination of whether the standard of approval for a PMA has been met is based on balancing probable benefit to health with probable risk.\n\nValid Scientific Evidence\n\nThe regulations state that the safety and effectiveness of a device will be determined on the basis of valid scientific evidence. 21 CFR 860.7(c)(1). Valid scientific evidence is defined through regulation as follows:\n\n21 CFR 860.7(c)(2) Valid scientific evidence is evidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience with a marketed device, from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device under its conditions of use. The evidence required may vary according to the characteristics of the device, its conditions of use, the existence and adequacy of warnings and other restrictions, and the extent of experience with its use. Isolated case reports, random experience, reports lacking sufficient details to permit scientific evaluation, and unsubstantiated opinions are not regarded as valid scientific evidence to show safety or effectiveness. Such information may be considered, however, in identifying a device the safety and effectiveness of which is questionable.\n\nFDA regulations also consider which types of evidence support reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness:\n\n21 CFR 860.7(d)(2) Among the types of evidence that may be required, when appropriate, to determine that there is reasonable assurance that a device is safe are investigations using laboratory animals, investigations involving human subjects, and nonclinical investigations including in vitro studies.\n--------------------\nContext title: Design Considerations for Pivotal Clinical Investigations for Medical Devices Guidance for Industry, Clinical Investigators, Institutional Review Boards and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.2234416007995605", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What is a study?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 35: See pages 7-8 of FDA\u2019s \u201cGuidance for Industry Investigator Responsibilities \u2013 Protecting the Rights, Safety, and Welfare of Study Subjects,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/investigator-responsibilities-protecting-rights-safety-and-welfare-study-subjects.\n\nIf contact information changes during the clinical investigation, then the new contact information must be provided to the subject (21 CFR 50.25(a)(7)). This may be done through a variety of ways, for example, a card providing the relevant contact information for the clinical investigation may be given to the subject during a visit or mailed to the subject in an envelope to protect the subject's privacy.\nA statement that participation is voluntary, that refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled, and that the subject may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled.

Language that limits the subject's right to decline to participate or withdraw from the clinical investigation must not be used. If special procedures should be followed for the subject to withdraw from the clinical investigation, the consent process must outline and explain the procedures (21 CFR 50.25(b)(4); see section III.C.4, \"Consequences of Subject's Decision to Withdraw\"). Written withdrawal from the study by the subject is not a requirement. When possible, the site staff should document the withdrawal and the date it occurred. Note, when a subject withdraws from a study conducted under an investigational new drug application (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE), the data collected on the subject to the point of withdrawal remains part of the study database and may not be removed.36\n\nFootnote 36: See, \u201cGuidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs; Data Retention When Subjects Withdraw from FDA-Regulated Clinical Trials,\u201d at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/data-retention-when-subjects-withdraw-fda-regulated-clinical-trials.\n\nAppendix C Additional Elements of Informed Consent\n\nFDA regulations identify six additional elements of informed consent to be provided to each subject, when appropriate.

FDA recommends that any additional cost that may be charged to the subject, the subject's insurance, or other reimbursement mechanism be explained as part of the informed consent process. Subjects should be made aware that insurance or other reimbursement mechanisms might not fund the medical care they receive as a result of participating in a clinical investigation even when the care is the standard care they would otherwise receive if not participating in a clinical investigation.38\n\nFootnote 38: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act added section 2709 to the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg-8). Among other things, this provision prohibits a group health plan or health insurance issuer in the group and individual health insurance market from denying certain individuals\u2019 participation in certain clinical trials and from denying or limiting coverage of routine patient costs for items or services furnished in connection with participation in such trials.\n\nAdditionally, insurance or other forms of reimbursement might not pay for care related to complications or injuries arising from participation in a clinical investigation (see section3.6, \"Compensation and Medical Treatments in Event of Injury\"). If the subject's insurance is charged and there are deductibles or copayments, the subject should be informed of whether they will be responsible for these costs. If funds will be available to cover costs not covered by insurance or other forms of reimbursement, the consent form should describe how these funds will be made available to subjects or direct subjects on how to obtain further information. Because these issues may be complex, it may be appropriate to refer the subject to a knowledgeable financial counselor or reimbursement specialist to explain the costs and the insurance and reimbursement issues prior to signing the consent form.\n\nIn some cases, the cost of an investigational product may be charged to the subject. In clinical investigations involving investigational devices, the sponsor is permitted to recover the costs of research, development, manufacture, and handling of investigational devices (see 21 CFR 812.7(b)). FDA may authorize sponsors in certain clinical investigations of drugs to recover the direct costs of making the investigational drug available, such as costs to manufacture, ship, and handle (e.g., store) the drug (see 21 CFR 312.8).39 When these costs are passed to the subject, the consent process must identify these costs (21 CFR 50.25(b)(3)).\n\nFootnote 39: See \u201cGuidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Charging for Investigational Products,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/charging-investigational-products, and \u201cGuidance for Industry, Charging for Investigational Drugs Under an IND \u2013 Questions and Answers,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/charging-investigational-drug-under-ind-questions-and-answers. Also, sponsors of expanded access INDs and treatment protocols that meet certain requirements may recover other costs than these direct costs. See 21 CFR 312.8(d)(2).\n\nBeyond the costs directly related to participation in the research, it may be appropriate to identify additional costs that may be incurred, such as any costs associated with participation in the clinical investigation, e.g., time off from work, child or elder care, or transportation costs. To aid the prospective subject in understanding these additional costs, the consent process should describe the protocol requirements in sufficient detail (e.g., number and duration of study site visits and procedures) to enable subjects to appreciate how much time they may need to take away from work, child care, or elder care. Prospective subjects should be made aware of direct and indirect costs of participation and informed as to what extent these costs will be covered by the sponsor versus paid by the subject (see sectionIII.1.2, \"Coercion and Undue Influence\").\n\niv.1.4 Consequences of Subject's Decision to Withdraw\n\nThe consequences of a subject's decision to withdraw from the research and procedures for orderly termination of participation by the subject. (21 CFR 50.25(b)(4))\n\nWhen appropriate, the consent process must describe the consequences of a subject's decision to withdraw from the clinical investigation and the procedures for orderly termination of participation by the subject (21 CFR 50.25(b)(4)). For example, when withdrawal from a clinical investigation may adversely affect the subject, the informed consent process must explain the withdrawal procedures that are recommended in order to ensure the subject's safety and should specifically state why the withdrawal procedures are important to the subject's welfare. For some clinical investigations, an intervention should be withdrawn gradually, or the investigator may recommend follow-up to ensure the subject's safety when an investigational intervention is prematurely terminated due to a subject's withdrawal. In these cases, the consent process must explicitly inform the subject of the potential adverse effects of premature termination of the investigational intervention. Prospective subjects should be made aware of the number of visits and approximate time required for participation in the study to help them determine if they are able to make the commitment to complete the study. When appropriate, it may be reasonable to counsel prospective subjects that they should not participate in the trial if they do not foresee staying in the study. If applicable, the consent process must explain whether a subject who withdraws early will receive future study payments.40 The subject should also be informed as to how the data that have already been collected will be handled (see also sectionIII.2.8, \"Voluntary Participation\").\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nProviding Significant New Findings to Subjects\n\nA statement that significant new findings developed during the course of the research which may relate to the subject's willingness to continue participation will be provided to the subject.

A well-controlled study permits a comparison of subjects treated with the new agent with a suitable control population, so that the effect of the new agent can be determined and distinguished from other influences, such as spontaneous change, \"placebo\" effects, concomitant therapy, or observer expectations. FDA regulations [21 CFR 314.126] cite five different kinds of controls that can be useful in particular circumstances:\n\nplacebo concurrent control\n\ndose-comparison concurrent control\n\nno-treatment concurrent control\n\nactive-treatment concurrent control, and\n\nhistorical control\n\nNo general preference is expressed for any one type, but the study design chosen must be adequate to the task. Thus, in discussing historical controls, the regulation notes that, because it is relatively difficult to be sure that historical control groups are comparable to the treated subjects with respect to variables that could effect outcome, use of historical control studies has been reserved for special circumstances, notably cases where the disease treated has high and predictable mortality (a large difference from this usual course would be easy to detect) and those in which the effect is self-evident (e.g., a general anesthetic).\n\nPlacebo control, no-treatment control (suitable where objective measurements are felt to make blinding unnecessary), and dose-comparison control studies are all study designs in which a difference is intended to be shown between the test article and some control. The alternative study design generally proposed to these kinds of studies is an active-treatment concurrent control in which a finding of no difference between the test article and the recognized effective agent (active-control) would be considered evidence of effectiveness of the new agent. There are circumstances in which this is a fully valid design. Active-controls are usually used in antibiotic trials, for example, because it is easy to tell the difference between antibiotics that have the expected effect on specific infections and those that do not. In many cases, however, the active-control design may be simply incapable of allowing any conclusion as to whether or not the test article is having an effect.\n\nThere are three principal difficulties in interpreting active-control trials. First, active-control trials are often too small to show that a clinically meaningful difference between the two treatments, if present, could have been detected with reasonable assurance; i.e., the trials have a high \"beta-error.\" In part, this can be overcome by increasing sample size, but two other problems remain even if studies are large. One problem is that there are numerous ways of conducting a study that can obscure differences between treatments, such as poor diagnostic criteria, poor methods of measurement, poor compliance, medication errors, or poor training of observers. As a general statement, carelessness of all kinds will tend to obscure differences between treatments. Where the objective of a study is to show a difference, investigators have powerful stimuli toward assuring study excellence. Active-control studies, however, which are intended to show no significant difference between treatments, do not provide the same incentives toward study excellence, and it is difficult to detect or assess the kinds of poor study quality that can arise. The other problem is that a finding of no difference between a test article and an effective treatment may not be meaningful. Even where all the incentives toward study excellence are present, i.e., in placebo-controlled trials, effective drugs are not necessarily demonstrably effective (i.e., superior to placebo) every time they are studied. In the absence of a placebo group, a finding of no difference in an active-control study therefore can mean that both agents are effective, that neither agent was effective in that study, or that the study was simply unable to tell effective from ineffective agents. In other words, to draw the conclusion that the test article was effective, one has to know with assurance that the active-control would have shown superior results to a placebo, had a placebo group been included in the study.\n\nFor certain drug classes, such as analgesics, antidepressants or antianxiety drugs, failure to show superiority to placebo in a given study is common. This is also often seen with antihypertensives, anti-angina drugs, anti-heart failure treatments, antihistamines, and drugs for asthma prophylaxis. In these situations, active-control trials showing no difference between the new drug and control are of little value as primary evidence of effectiveness and the active-control design (the study design most often proposed as an alternative to use of a placebo) is not credible.\n\nIn many situations, deciding whether an active-control design is likely to be a useful basis for providing data for marketing approval is a matter of judgment influenced by available evidence. If, for example, examination of prior studies of a proposed active-control reveals that the test article can very regularly (almost always) be distinguished from placebo in a particular setting (subject population, dose, and other defined parameters), an active-control design may be reasonable if it reproduces the setting in which the active-control has been regularly effective.\n\nIt is often possible to design a successful placebo-controlled trial that does not cause investigator discomfort nor raise ethical issues. Treatment periods can be kept short; early \"escape\" mechanisms can be built into the study so that subjects will not undergo prolonged placebo-treatment if they are not doing well. In some cases randomized placebo-controlled therapy withdrawal studies have been used to minimize exposure to placebo or unsuccessful therapy; in such studies apparent responders to a treatment in an open study are randomly assigned to continued treatment or to placebo. Subjects who fail (e.g., blood pressure rises, angina worsens) can be removed promptly, with such failure representing a study endpoint.\n\nIRBs may face difficult issues in deciding on the acceptability of placebo-controlled and active-control trials. Placebo-controlled trials, regardless of any advantages in interpretation of results, are obviously not ethically acceptable where existing treatment is life-prolonging. A placebo-controlled study that exposes subjects to a documented serious risk is not acceptable, but it is critical to review the evidence that harm would result from denial of active treatment, because alternative study designs, especially active-control studies, may not be informative, exposing subjects to risk but without being able to collect useful information.\n--------------------\nContext title: Drug Study Designs Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.5846052169799805", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, What is a study?\n--------------------\nContext: of investigations or a particular investigation.\n\n4. Inspections (21 CFR 812.145)\n\nInvestigators are required to permit FDA to inspect and copy any records pertaining to the investigation including, in certain situations, those which identify subjects.\n\n5. Submitting Reports (21 CFR 812.150)\n\nAn investigator shall prepare and submit the following complete, accurate, and timely reports:\n\na. To the sponsor and the IRB:\n\n(1) Any unanticipated adverse device effect occurring during an\n\ninvestigation. (Due no later than 10 working days after the investigator first learns of the effect.)\n\n(2) Progress reports on the investigation. (These reports must be provided at regular intervals, but in no event\n\nless often than yearly. If there is a study monitor, a copy of the report should also be sent to the monitor.)(3) Any deviation from the investigational plan made to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency. (Report is due as soon as possible but no later than 5 working days after the emergency occurs. Except in emergency situations, a protocol deviation requires prior sponsor approval; and if the deviation may affect the scientific soundness of the plan or the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects, prior FDA and IRB approval are required.)\n\n(4) Any use of the device without obtaining informed consent. (Due within 5 working days after such use.)\n\n(5) A final report. (Due within 3 months following termination or completion of the investigation or the investigator's part of the investigation. For additional guidance, see the discussion under the section entitled \"Annual Progress Reports and Final Reports.\")\n\n(6) Any further information requested by FDA or the IRB about any aspect of the investigation.\n\nb. To the Sponsor:\n\n(1) Withdrawal of IRB approval of the investigator's part of an investigation. (Due within 5 working days of such action).\n\n6. Investigational Device Distribution and Tracking\n\nThe IDE regulations prohibit an investigator from providing an investigational device to any person not authorized to receive it (21 CFR 812.110(c)). The best strategy for reducing the risk that an investigational device could be improperly dispensed (whether purposely or inadvertently) is for the sponsor and the investigators to closely monitor the shipping, use, and final disposal of the device(s). Upon completion or termination of a clinical investigation (or the investigator's part of an investigation), or at the sponsor's request, an investigator is required to return to the sponsor any remaining supply of the device or otherwise to dispose of the device as the sponsor directs (21 CFR 812.110(e)). Investigators must also maintain complete, current and accurate records of the receipt, use, or disposition of investigational devices (21 CFR 812.140(a)(2)). Specific investigator recordkeeping requirements are set forth at 21 CFR 812.140(a).\n\n7. Prohibition of Promotion and Other Practices (21 CFR 812.7)\n\nThe IDE regulations prohibit the promotion and commercialization of a device that has not been first cleared or approved for marketing by FDA. This prohibition is applicable to sponsors and investigators (or any person acting on behalf of a sponsor or investigator), and encompasses the following activities:\n\na. Promotion or test marketing of the investigational device\n\nb. Charging subjects or investigators for the device a price larger than is necessary to recover the costs of manufacture, research, development, and handling c. Unduly prolonging an investigation beyond the point needed to collect data required to determine whether the device is safe and effective, and d. Representing that the device is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is being investigated.\n8. Annual Progress Reports and Final Reports\n\nThe IDE regulations do not specify the content of the annual progress or final reports. With respect to reports to the IRB, the IRB itself may specify what information it wishes to be included in these reports. Because FDA does require the information listed below, it is suggested that, at a minimum, the annual progress and final reports to the sponsor and the IRB also include the following items:\n\na. IDE number\n\nb. Device name\n\nc. Indications for use\n\nd. Brief summary of study progress in relation to investigational plan\n\ne. Number of investigators and investigational sites\n\nf. Number of subjects enrolled\n\ng. Number of devices received, used, and the final disposition of unused devices\n\nh. Brief summary of results and conclusions\n\ni.

A \"covered clinical study\" means any study of a drug (including a biological product) or device in humans submitted in a marketing application or reclassification petition that the applicant or FDA relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an effective product), or any study in which a single investigator makes a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety. This would, in general, not include phase 1 tolerance studies or pharmacokinetic studies, most clinical pharmacology studies (unless they are critical to an efficacy determination), large open safety studies conducted at multiple sites, treatment protocols, and expanded access protocols. (21 CFR SSS 54.2 and 54.3.) ANDAs are subject to 21 CFR part 54 (21 CFR SS 314.94(a)(13)), as are 510(k)s (21 CFR SS 807.87(i)). In addition, applications for biological products, including applications submitted under 351(k) of the Public Health Services Act, are also subject to the regulation.\n* Q:: Does the regulation apply to studies in support of labeling changes?\n\nA:: The regulation applies to studies submitted in a supplement when those studies meet the definition of a covered clinical study. The definition includes studies to support safety labeling changes where individual investigators make a significant contribution to the safety information. Studies to support the effectiveness of a new claimed indication are also included. (21 CFR SSS 54.2 and 54.3.)\n* Q:: Do actual use and labeling comprehension studies conducted to support a request to switch a drug product from prescription to over-the-counter (OTC) status fit the definition of covered clinical study?\n\nA:: Applicants who file supplements requesting that FDA approve a switch of a prescription drug to OTC status or who file a new drug application for OTC use often conduct actual use and labeling comprehension studies. These may be intended to demonstrate that the product is safe and effective when used without the supervision of a licensed practitioner; in other cases, they may test labeling comprehension or other aspects of treatment by consumers. Actual use studies performed to support these applications are considered covered clinical studies if they are used to demonstrate effectiveness in the OTC setting or if they represent a safety study where any investigator makes a significant contribution (21 CFR SSS 54.2 and 54.3). Labeling comprehension studies would not be considered covered studies.\n\nQ: Are clinical investigators of in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) covered under this regulation?\n\nYes. Applicants who submit marketing applications for IVDs that include covered clinical studies must provide the appropriate financial certification or disclosure information (21 CFR SS 54.3). Although IVD studies may only involve specimens, under 21 CFR SS 812.3(p), \"subject\" is defined as a \"human who participates in an investigation, either as an individual on whom or on whose specimen an investigational device is used or as a control.\" Under 21 CFR SS 812.3(h), an \"investigation\" is defined as a clinical investigation or research involving one or more subjects to determine the safety or effectiveness of a device.\" Thus, if an investigation of an IVD is used to support a marketing application and it meets the definition of a covered clinical study, it would be subject to this regulation (21 CFR SS 54.3).\n\nFDA REVIEW\n\nQ: Under what circumstances relating to financial disclosure would FDA refuse to file an application?\n\nFDA may refuse to file any marketing application supported by covered clinical studies that does not contain, for each clinical investigator who is not an employee of the sponsor, a certification that no financial interest or arrangement specified in 54.4(a)(3) exists, a disclosure statement identifying the specified financial interests or arrangements and the steps taken to minimize bias, or a certification that the applicant has acted with due diligence to obtain the required information but was unable to do so and stating the reason (21 CFR SS 54.4(c)). In general, if, during the filing review, an FDA reviewer identifies missing information, an attempt will be made to contact the applicant to obtain the missing information; however, applicants should take reasonable steps to ensure that applications are complete upon submission. Applicants are encouraged to discuss their concerns on particular matters about financial information with FDA.\n\nQ: Who will review a disclosure of the specified financial interests and arrangements when such information is submitted in a marketing application?\n\nFDA review staff, which may include project managers, consumer safety officers, medical officers, and/or others with regulatory or scientific expertise or supervisory authority, will evaluate financial disclosure information.\n\nQ: What will FDA reviewers consider when evaluating the financial disclosure information?\n\nFDA reviewers will evaluate the information disclosed about each covered clinical study in an application to determine the impact of any disclosed financial interests or arrangements on the reliability of the data. See 21 CFR SS 54.5(a). FDA may consider many factors in making its evaluation (21 CFR SSS 54.5(a) and (b)).\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPart 54 does not categorically prohibit financial interests or arrangements, but it does require applicants to submit a list of clinical investigators who are full-time and part-time employees of the sponsor and to disclose or certify with respect to other investigators so that FDA can assess the possibility of bias. The type of financial interest or arrangement disclosed is important because some financial interests and arrangements are of greater concern than others when assessing the reliability of the data. For example, outcome payments (that is, payment that is dependent on the outcome of the study) elicit the highest concerns, followed by proprietary interests in the test article (such as patents, royalties, etc.). With respect to equity interests and/or SPOOS, the amount and nature of the equity interests and payments may be considered.\n\nWhen a clinical investigator has disclosable financial interests or arrangements, the FDA reviewer will carefully consider the steps taken by the sponsor to minimize bias19 as described in the attachment to the FORM FDA 3455. These steps may include study design, use of multiple clinical investigators and study sites, and replication of study results. The agency also gives careful scrutiny to data from clinical investigators who are full-time or part-time employees of the sponsor, because of the possibility of significant financial interests in the outcome of studies. (Hereafter, we refer to these investigator types jointly as \"disclosing investigators.\") Investigators for whom the applicant is not able to disclose or certify, despite exercising due diligence, will be considered on a case by case basis.\n\nFootnote 19: See Question A.2 for a discussion of methods to minimize bias.\n\nThe FDA reviewer may consider elements of the study design, including the method of randomization, the level of blinding (double-blind, single-blind), the presence or absence of a control group, whether placebo or active, the nature of the primary and secondary endpoints (objective, subjective), the method of endpoint assessment, the method of evaluation (including whether someone other than the disclosing investigator measured the endpoints), and whether many investigators, most of whom were not disclosing investigators, participated in the study. The FDA reviewer may also consider the total number of investigators and subjects in the study, the number and percentage of subjects enrolled by the disclosing investigator, information obtained from on-site inspections, and the data (including adverse events) of the disclosing investigator compared to other investigators in the study. The reviewer may look at a re-analysis of the data performed either by the applicant or FDA that excludes the disclosing investigator's results, other relevant types of reanalysis, and/or whether the results were replicated over multiple studies.\n\nFootnote 22: FDA also recognizes that subjects participating in a clinical trial may be interested in the financial interests/arrangements of the clinical investigator at the site where the subject is considering participation. The Department of Health and Human Services Guidance Document, \u201cFinancial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidance for Human Subject Protection,\u201d which is applicable to FDA regulated research, recommends that consideration be given to providing potential subjects with information about the financial interests and arrangements of the parties involved in the research. This guidance is available at http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/guid.pdf.\n\nAppendix I Recorokkeeping\n\nQ: What are the recordkeeping requirements for financial disclosure information?\n\nThe recordkeeping requirements for applicants are described in 21 CFR SS 54.6. Applicants must retain certain information on clinical investigators' financial interests and arrangements (21 CFR SS 54.6(a)) and permit FDA employees to have access to the information and to copy the records at reasonable times (21 CFR SS 54.6(b)(2)). Records are to be maintained for two years after the date of approval of the application (21 CFR SS 54.6(b)(1)).\n\nAdditionally, IND and IDE sponsors are required to maintain complete and accurate records of financial disclosure information as part of the records for the investigation (21CFR SSS 312.57(b) and 812.140(b)(3)) and to retain the records pursuant to the required retention periods identified in the IND and IDE regulations (21 CFR SSS 312.57(c) and 812.140(d)).\n--------------------\nContext title: Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Industry,and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.199829578399658"], "From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: Cotains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nQ7: How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n\nA7: Where alternate tools are not available, insufficient, or otherwise will not satisfy the need for an inspection, FDA will use a risk-based approach to prioritize inspections, which includes consideration for (a) how product availability could impact public health; (b) investigator safety; and (c) travel restrictions and/or advisories associated with the location of the facility or site (e.g., country or region/state/province within the country, U.S. state, county, or territory). FDA will also seek to minimize, though not necessarily avoid, missing additional application goal dates due to travel restrictions during the COVID-19 public health emergency. These objectives will also be balanced with the effort to reduce any backlog of assigned inspections.\n\nAppendix B Manufacturing and Supply Chain Change Requests\n\nThe following questions and answers are intended to provide information regarding common queries related to changes in manufacturing facilities for approved pharmaceutical products.\n\nQ8: How do I add or change a facility in my application in response to supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nA8: Refer to the established guidance documents listed in section V. References, for changing or adding a facility to your application.\n\nIf your marketing application19 relates to the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 or to a drug that is on FDA's drug shortage list,20 the cover letter to the submission should clearly state \"Priority Review Requested\" and should include information to support your priority review designation request. If the product could enter, or is currently in drug shortage, also contact CDER DRUG SHORTAGES (DRUGSHORTAGES(rFDA.HHS.GOV). See https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/drug-shortages for more information. For products regulated by CBER, contact cbershortage(r)fda.hhs.gov. Except as described above, FDA intends to continue following the procedures outlined in relevant Manuals of Policies and Procedures (MAPPs) and Standard Operating Procedures and Policies (SOPPs).21\n\nQ9: What data are required to support manufacturing process or facility changes needed to address disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nA9: Refer to the Agency's existing guidance documents on making changes to an approved marketing application, as well as scale-up and postapproval change guidance documents for specific dosage forms (see section V. References). Should circumstances resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic warrant atypical or flexible submission strategies, for CDER-regulated products, contact CDER-OPQ-Inquiries@fda.hhs.gov; for CBER-regulated products, contact the office responsible for the product's regulation for further assistance.\n\nQ10: How can the implementation of postapproval manufacturing changes to an ANDA, NDA, or BLA for products needed during the COVID-19 pandemic be accelerated?\n\nA10: FDA is using multiple tools to facilitate implementation of manufacturing changes such as risk-based reduction in supplement reporting categories and flexible assessment practices.\n\nConsistent with FDA's regulations for marketing applications related to postapproval chemistry, manufacturing, and controls changes, FDA may consider available information and approaches to mitigate the risk to product quality associated with the change to support a reporting category for certain supplements that is lower than what otherwise would be most suitable (if such information and risk-mitigation approaches were not provided). During this public health emergency, FDA is willing to consider requests from applicants to submit certain changes using a lower reporting category based on such risk-mitigation information for marketing applications related to products in shortage or intended to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent COVID-19.\n\nBefore submitting a supplement with a lower reporting category, applicants should contact FDA for feedback and concurrence. For CDER-regulated products, applicants should contact CDER-OPO-Inquiries@fda.hhs.gov. For CBER-regulated products, applicants should contact the office responsible for the product's regulation.\n\nIf the product could enter, or is currently in, drug shortage, include CDER DRUG SHORTAGES (DRUGSHORTAGES((\\underline{\\text{DRUGSHORTAGES}})@FDA.HHS.GOV) for products regulated by CDER and cbershortage@fda.hhs.gov for products regulated by CBER.\n\nApplicants wishing to request a lower supplement reporting category should clearly provide (1) their rationale, (2) supporting information, and (3) risk-mitigation approaches, because this information is needed to consider a reduction in reporting category.\n\nFDA may additionally implement flexible assessment practices such as expediting assessment of supplements, adjusting submission data requirements as part of a risk-benefit assessment, and using additional tools when determining the need for inspections.\n\nCan I submit an application if it includes facilities in regions that are impacted by COVID-19-related travel restrictions?\n\nYes. Reference in an application to a facility in a region impacted by COVID-19 travel restrictions does not preclude submission to FDA.\n\nIV For Additional Information\n\nFor additional questions about manufacturing and supply chain changes, contact CDER-OPO-Inquiries_a_fda.hhs.gov, or for CBER, contact the office responsible for the product's regulation. Include \"COVID-19 inquiry\" in the subject line of the email.\n\nV References [22, 23, 24] Draft and Final Guidances\n\n[1]Changes to an Approved Application for Specified Biotechnology and Specified Synthetic Biological Products (July 1997)\n\n[2]Changes to an Approved Application: Biological Products (July 1997)\n\n[3]Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA; Questions and Answers (January 2001)\n\n[4]Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA (April 2004)\n\n[5]CMC Postapproval Manufacturing Changes To Be Documented in Annual Reports (March 2014)\n\n[6]Changes to an Approved Application: Biological Products: Human Blood and Blood Components Intended for Transfusion or for Further Manufacture (December 2014)\n\n[7]CMC Postapproval Manufacturing Changes for Specified Biological Products To Be Documented in Annual Reports (August 2017)25_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_\n\nChemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved Application: Certain Biological Products (December 2017)26 Footnote 26: When final, this guidance will represent the FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nRemote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (April 2021)\n\nScale-Up and Postapproval Changes Guidances\n\nImmediate Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms; Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls, In Vitro Dissolution Testing, and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation (November 1995)\n\nSUPAC-IR: Questions and Answers about SUPAC-IR Guidance (February 1997)\n\nNonsterile Semisolid Dosage Forms; Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Release Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation (May 1997)\n\nSUPAC-MR: Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms; Scale-Up and Postapproval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Dissolution Testing and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation (September 1997)\n\nSUPAC: Manufacturing Equipment Addendum (December 2014)\n\nManual of Policies and Procedures\n\nMAPP 5240.3 Rev. 5 Prioritization of the Review of Original ANDAs, Amendments, and Supplements\n\nMAPP 5310.3 Rev. 1 Requests for Expedited Review of New Drug Application and Biologics License Application Prior Approval Supplements Submitted for Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes\n\nStandard Operating Procedures and Policies\n\nSOPP 8401 Administrative Processing of Original Biologics License Applications (BL4) and New Drug Applications (NDA)\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.641761302947998", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry\n\nThis guidance is intended to remain in effect until November 7, 2023, unless superseded by a revised final guidance before that date.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nFDA plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats such as emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to describe how we will request and conduct voluntary remote interactive evaluations at facilities2 where drugs3 are manufactured, processed, packed, or held; facilities covered under FDA's bioresearch monitoring (BIMO) program; and outsourcing facilities registered under section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\nFootnote 2: In this guidance, the term facility covers persons, sites, and establishments subject to FDA drug manufacturing and bioresearch monitoring regulations and statutory authority.\n\nFootnote 3: In this guidance, the term drug includes biologics.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]\n\nconduct an evaluation. In this guidance, we refer to our use of any combination of these interactive tools as a remote interactive evaluation. FDA may request to conduct a remote interactive evaluation prior to or following other types of regulatory oversight activities (e.g., an inspection or a request for records or other information).7\n\nFootnote 7: A remote interactive evaluation is not the same as an inspection as described in section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act or a request for records or other information in advance of or in lieu of an inspection, as described in section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act. Similarly, a remote interactive evaluation or a request under section 704(a)(4) does not constitute an inspection for purposes of section 510(h)(3) of the FD&C Act. Section 704(a)(4) does not apply to every inspection program covered by this guidance (e.g., section 704(a)(4) does not apply to the BIMO inspection program). Failure to cooperate with either an inspection or a 704(a)(4) request for records or other information may constitute a limiting of inspection and as a result, FDA may deem the relevant drugs manufactured at these establishments adulterated. See the guidance for industry Circumstances that Constitute Delaying, Denying, Limiting, or Refusing a Drug Inspection (October 2014) for further information.\n\nIII Planning a Remote Interactive Evaluation\n\nFDA may request to conduct a remote interactive evaluation whenever a program office determines it is appropriate based on mission needs and any travel limitations. FDA conducts inspections for many purposes and programs, and we will consider each of those inspection program areas as possible candidates for a remote interactive evaluation. This policy applies to all drug inspection programs including, but not limited to:\n\nPre-Approval Inspections (PAIs) and Pre-License Inspections (PLIs): FDA may perform a PAI or PLI to assess a marketing application. FDA uses these inspections to ensure that any facility named or referenced in support of an application can perform the proposed manufacturing operations in conformance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements, to verify conformance with the application, and to confirm that data submitted in the application are accurate and complete.\n\nPost-Approval Inspections (PoAIs): PoAIs focus on a specific drug and changes to its manufacturing operations, the evaluation of process validation, any changes submitted to the application, and the execution of supporting activities according to application commitments and CGMP requirements.\n\nSurveillance Inspections: Surveillance drug quality inspections examine overall operations, including controls that ensure manufacturing processes produce quality drugs, thereby reducing the risk of adulterated or misbranded drugs reaching consumers and patients. FDA uses surveillance inspections to evaluate the CGMP compliance of manufacturing operations. Surveillance inspections are performed at active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product manufacturing facilities, as well as outsourcing facilities that have registered with FDA under section 503B of the FD&C Act.\n\nFollow-Up and Compliance Inspections: When a specific drug quality problem or facility issue comes to FDA's attention, we may initiate a follow-up or compliance drug quality inspection. For example, FDA may conduct an inspection to investigate: (1) product safety, effectiveness, or quality concerns arising from defect reports; (2) information provided by an informant about a facility; (3) violata facility that were discovered during the inspection of another facility; or (4) corrective actions undertaken by a facility in response to, for example, a warning letter or regulatory meeting.\n--------------------\nContext title: Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.820199489593506", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n\nThis guidance is intended to remain in effect until November 7, 2023.

FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.\n\nFDA is issuing this guidance to provide answers to frequently asked questions about regulatory and policy issues related to inspections, pending drug applications, and changes in manufacturing facilities for approved pharmaceutical products.1 This document updates the guidance of the same title issued in August 2020, and revised in January 2021.\n\nFootnote 1: In this guidance, the terms drug and pharmaceutical product include biological products.\n\nThis policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS) (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]\n\nFDA has issued guidance on how to implement manufacturing process and facility changes; relevant guidances that describe the process for reporting changes to an application can be found in section V. References. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), and the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) remain fully capable of continuing daily activities, such as application assessments, including facility evaluation and certain inspection activities, while responding to public health needs related to the current COVID-19 pandemic. As this remains an evolving and very dynamic situation, FDA will continue to be flexible and as transparent as possible.\n\nInspections\n\nThe following questions and answers are intended to provide information regarding common queries related to inspections for facilities manufacturing pharmaceutical products and sites involved in the conduct of clinical, analytical, and nonclinical studies.\n\nQ1: How are inspections impacted by COVID-19?\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA has continued, on a case-by-case basis, to conduct mission-critical inspections and other activities to ensure that FDA-regulated pharmaceutical products are meeting applicable FDA requirements.\n\nIn the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA announced that it was temporarily postponing all domestic and foreign routine surveillance facility inspections. Similarly, routine surveillance inspections in support of the Bioresearch Monitoring (BIMO) program were postponed.\n\nBeginning the week of July 20, 2020, FDA resumed prioritized domestic inspections, as described in the FDA statement \"Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA prepares for resumption of domestic inspections with new risk assessment system\" issued on July 10, 2020.4 As explained in this statement, FDA uses its COVID-19 Advisory Rating system to determine what categories of regulatory activity can take place in a given geographic region. Based on this determination, FDA is either continuing, on a case-by-case basis, to conduct only \"mission-critical\" inspections,5 or, where possible to do so safely, resuming prioritized domestic inspections, which generally include preapproval, pre-license, surveillance, and for-cause inspections. For the foreseeable future, prioritized domestic inspections will be pre-announced to FDA-regulated businesses.6 This helps ensure the safety of the investigator and the firm's employees, providing the safest possible environment to accomplish FDA's regulatory activities, while also ensuring the appropriate staff are on-site to assist FDA staff with inspection activities.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCurrently, certain inspections (e.g., foreign preapproval, surveillance, and for-cause inspections that are not deemed mission-critical) remain temporarily postponed.\n\nWhile inspections that can be conducted by FDA during the public health emergency are limited due to factors including travel restrictions, FDA intends to continue using alternative tools, when appropriate, to evaluate facilities. This includes requesting existing inspection reports from other trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements,7 requesting information from applicants, requesting records and other information directly from facilities and other inspected entities, and conducting remote interactive evaluations8 where appropriate.\n\nFootnote 7: For existing FDA mutual recognition agreements with the European Union and the United Kingdom, this includes the use of official inspection reports issued by a recognized authority for manufacturing facilities located inside and outside the territory of the issuing authority. For more information visit: https://www.fda.gov/international-programs/international-arrangements/mutual-recognition-agreement-mra.\n\nFootnote 8: See FDA guidance for industry Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (April 2021).\n\n2.2.2 What types of inspections would be deemed \"mission-critical\"?\n\nA2: FDA's assessment of whether an inspection is mission-critical considers many factors related to the public health benefit of U.S. patients having access to the product subject to inspection. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether the product has received breakthrough therapy designation, orphan-drug designation, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation; is included in the Drug Shortage or CBER-Regulated Products Shortage list; is used for critical care or as a medical countermeasure; is used to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a serious disease or medical condition, including COVID-19, for which there is no other appropriate and available treatment. Therefore, for-cause (including follow-up and where a specific drug quality problem or facility issues come to FDA's attention), preapproval, and pre-license inspections can be deemed mission-critical. When determining whether to conduct a mission-critical inspection, FDA also takes into account concerns about the safety of its investigators, employees at a site or facility, and where applicable, clinical trial participants and other patients at investigator sites.\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.3687413930892944", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: FDA plans to *approve\n\nthe application if\n\nAvailable information, including information obtained from the use of alternate tools, supports the adequacy of the facilities and sites named in a pending application, no other deficiencies have been identified, and the application otherwise satisfies the requirements for approval.15 Footnote 15: See 21 CFR 314.50, 314.94, and 601.2.\n\nIn this case, the need for an inspection could be sufficiently mitigated by the FDA's use of alternate tools, including a firm's responses to outstanding issues identified from the use of alternate tools (see Q5/A5).\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter with facility- or site-related deficiencies\n\nAvailable information from a prior FDA or mutual recognition agreement inspection or the use of alternate tools identifies concerns about the adequacy of a facility or site, and an inspection needed to address those concerns cannot be completed during the review cycle, or\n\nResponses to outstanding issues identified from requested records and other alternate sources (see Q5/A5) are not sufficient to address the issues identified for a facility or site.\n\nIn this case, FDA intends to inform the applicant of the facility or site issues as soon as possible during the review cycle.

The scheduling will be based on public health need and other factors.

FDA will also seek to minimize, though not necessarily avoid, missing additional application goal dates due to travel restrictions during the COVID-19 public health emergency. These objectives will also be balanced with the effort to reduce any backlog of assigned inspections.\n\nAppendix B Manufacturing and Supply Chain Change Requests\n\nThe following questions and answers are intended to provide information regarding common queries related to changes in manufacturing facilities for approved pharmaceutical products.\n\nQ8: How do I add or change a facility in my application in response to supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nA8: Refer to the established guidance documents listed in section V.

These factors include, but are not limited to, whether the product has received breakthrough therapy designation, orphan-drug designation, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation; is included in the Drug Shortage or CBER-Regulated Products Shortage list; is used for critical care or as a medical countermeasure; is used to diagnose, treat, mitigate, cure, or prevent a serious disease or medical condition, including COVID-19, for which there is no other appropriate and available treatment. Therefore, for-cause (including follow-up and where a specific drug quality problem or facility issues come to FDA's attention), preapproval, and pre-license inspections can be deemed mission-critical. When determining whether to conduct a mission-critical inspection, FDA also takes into account concerns about the safety of its investigators, employees at a site or facility, and where applicable, clinical trial participants and other patients at investigator sites.\n\n2.3 Does FDA determine what is \"mission-critical\" using the same factors for both domestic and foreign inspections?\n\nA3: Yes, the determination is made considering the same factors regardless of whether the site is domestic or foreign.\n\n2.2.4 How will FDA ensure the quality of imported products while inspections are limited?\n\nA4: During this interim period, FDA is expanding the use of other tools and approaches for assessing manufacturing facilities, when appropriate, to help ensure the quality of the drug products imported into the United States. These may include physical examinations of products arriving at U.S. borders or product sampling and testing before release into commerce, reviewing the compliance histories of facilities, using information shared by trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements, requestingrecords directly from facilities \"in advance of or in lieu of\" certain drug inspections,9 and conducting remote interactive evaluations where appropriate. If a product appears not to meet applicable standards for safety, effectiveness, or quality based on these approaches, FDA has the authority to refuse admission of the product into the United States.10\n\nFDA continues to work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to target products intended for importation into the United States that violate applicable legal requirements for FDA-regulated products. FDA has the ability to use a risk-based analytics tool (Predictive Risk-based Evaluation for Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT)) to electronically screen regulated shipments imported or offered for import into the United States.11 PREDICT uses automated data mining, pattern discovery, and automated queries of FDA databases to determine the potential risk of a shipment. It takes into consideration the inherent risk of a product and also information about the previous history of importers, manufacturers, and shippers.\n\nFootnote 9: See section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 10: See section 801(a) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFootnote 11: For more details visit FDA\u2019s Entry Screening Systems and Tools page at https://www.fda.gov/industr/import-systems/entry-screening-systems-and-tools.\n\nQ5: How will travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency affect my application?\n\nA5: During the COVID-19 public health emergency, FDA is using all available tools and sources of information to support regulatory decisions on applications12 that include sites impacted by travel restrictions due to COVID-19. For example, FDA will continue the assessment of all applications per normal assessment operations for all disciplines, where all manufacturing facilities will be evaluated using a risk-based approach consistent with existing guidelines. Similarly, the need for and selection of sites for BIMO inspections will continue to be risk-based, considering application and site-specific factors. During this interim period, FDA is using alternative tools, where available, to determine or mitigate the need for an inspection and to support the application assessment. This includes reviewing a firm's previous compliance history, using information sharing from trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements, requesting records \"in advance of or in lieu of\" facility inspections13 or voluntarily from facilities and sites, and conducting remote interactive evaluations where appropriate.\n\nFootnote 12: See 21 CFR 314.50(d), 314.94(a), and 601.20(d).\n\nCDER and CBER are continuing to evaluate applications, strategically applying a holistic approach in the decision-making process to determine if an inspection is warranted or if an inspection is no longer needed due to information gained through the use of the alternative tools mentioned above. FDA will continue to work directly with the applicants of those impacted applications.\n\nFDA is also working directly with facilities to communicate any issues identified through a review of records or other information requested. For example, for both CDER- and CBER-regulated products, interim processes have been implemented to communicate with manufacturing facilities regarding issues identified following a review of records or other information requested \"in advance of or in lieu of\" a preapproval or pre-license inspection. Responses from the facility regarding these issues will, as feasible, be considered before taking an action on a pending application.\n\nThe Agency encourages applicants to be in communication with all their facilities and sites to ensure timely responses to any inquiries to support application assessment.\n\nQ6: If my application includes sites that cannot be inspected because of travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency will my application automatically receive a complete response letter?\n\nA6: No, FDA will not automatically issue a complete response (CR) letter if FDA cannot conduct an inspection because of travel restrictions resulting from the public health emergency.14 Decisions regarding applications will be based on the totality of the information available to FDA, including information obtained from use of the alternative tools as described in Q5/A5.\n\nFootnote 14: For mission-critical and prioritized domestic inspections needed to support application approval, FDA aims to conduct those inspections during the review of the application. However, in cases where travel restrictions due to the public health emergency prevent FDA from performing those inspections during the review clock, recommendations in Q6/A6 are applicable.\n\nBased on an assessment of the product information provided in the application and based on available information about the facility or site, FDA will take one of the following actions:\n\nFDA plans to *approve\n\nthe application if\n\nAvailable information, including information obtained from the use of alternate tools, supports the adequacy of the facilities and sites named in a pending application, no other deficiencies have been identified, and the application otherwise satisfies the requirements for approval.15 Footnote 15: See 21 CFR 314.50, 314.94, and 601.2.\n\nIn this case, the need for an inspection could be sufficiently mitigated by the FDA's use of alternate tools, including a firm's responses to outstanding issues identified from the use of alternate tools (see Q5/A5).\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter with facility- or site-related deficiencies\n\nAvailable information from a prior FDA or mutual recognition agreement inspection or the use of alternate tools identifies concerns about the adequacy of a facility or site, and an inspection needed to address those concerns cannot be completed during the review cycle, or\n\nResponses to outstanding issues identified from requested records and other alternate sources (see Q5/A5) are not sufficient to address the issues identified for a facility or site.\n\nIn this case, FDA intends to inform the applicant of the facility or site issues as soon as possible during the review cycle. Specifically, FDA intends to inform the applicant that an inspection will be needed before the application can be approved\nand that the inspection may not be conducted before the action date due to restrictions on travel. * FDA generally intends to issue a CR letter, including a deficiency related to the facility or site, if the inspection has not been conducted by the action date.\n\nFDA plans to issue a *CR letter without facility or site deficiencies\n\nAn inspection is necessary because there is insufficient information currently available to make a determination on the acceptability of a facility or site16,17 and other deficiencies have been identified.\n--------------------\nContext title: Manufacturing, Supply Chain, and Drug and Biological Product Inspections During COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.2061554193496704", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\n--------------------\nContext: Guidance for Industry Circumstances that Constitute Delaying, Denying, Limiting, or Refusing a Drug Inspection\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nOffice of Regulatory Affairs (ORA)\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nCenter for Veterinary Medicine (CVM)\n\nOctober 2014Guidance for Industry Circumstances that Constitute Delaying, Denying, Limiting, or Refusing a Drug Inspection\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Policy and Risk Management\n\nOffice of Regulatory Affairs\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\n12420 Parklawn Drive, rm. 4138\n\nRockville, MD 20857\n\nTel: 301-796-5300; Fax: 301-827-3670; E-mail: FDASIAImplementationORA@fda.hhs.gov\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm122044.htm.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nOffice of Regulatory Affairs (ORA)\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nCenter for Veterinary Medicine (CVM)\n\nOctober 2014\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nCircumstances that Constitute Delaying, Denying, Limiting or Refusing a Drug Inspection\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) in cooperation with Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), and Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThis guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic.

Section 707 of FDASIA adds 501(j) to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to deem adulterated a drug that \"has been manufactured, processed, packed, or held in any factory, warehouse, or establishment and the owner, operator, or agent of such factory, warehouse, or establishment delays, denies, or limits an inspection, or refuses to permit entry or inspection.\" Section 707(b) of FDASIA requires the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue guidance that defines the circumstances that would constitute delaying, denying, or limiting inspection, or refusing to permit entry or inspection, for purposes of section 501(j).\n\nThis guidance covers facilities that are subject to inspection under section 704 of the FD&C Act.2 This guidance defines the types of actions, inaction, and circumstances that the FDA considers to constitute delaying, denying, or limiting inspection, or refusing to permit entry or inspection for the purposes of section 501(j).3 The examples used in this guidance are not intended to serve as an exhaustive list; rather, they illustrate the most common situations that FDA has encountered in preparing for and conducting inspections as well as situations that FDA anticipates may occur. FDA does not interpret the four terms describing prohibited behavior (delay, deny, limit, refuse) necessarily to be mutually exclusive. Therefore, the behaviorsdescribed in the following scenarios may be examples of more than one type of prohibited behavior. Also note that, for purposes of this guidance, the term facility is intended to include all establishments, factories, and warehouses covered by section 501(j).\n\nSection 704 of the FD&C Act authorizes FDA to conduct inspections at reasonable times, within reasonable limits, and in a reasonable manner. Although the FD&C Act does not specifically define \"reasonable,\" FDA has long maintained that the inspection authority under Section 704 of the FD&C Act \"extends to what is reasonably necessary to achieve the objective of the inspection.\"4 FDA intends to work with facilities to conduct inspections and procure the information necessary to achieve the objective of the inspection. FDA will consider reasonable explanations for behavior that may otherwise be considered to be delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing an inspection.\n\nFootnote 4: FDA, Investigations Operations Manual, Section 2.2.1.1, Authority to Enter and Inspect (2014).\n\nFDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\n2 Background\n\nSection 704(a) of the FD&C Act provides FDA authority for inspections, specifically providing authority for duly designated officers or employees of the FDA to enter, at reasonable times, and inspect, at reasonable times and within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, facilities subject to regulation under the FD&C Act.5 An FDA inspection is a \"careful, critical, official examination of a facility to determine its compliance with certain laws and regulations administered by the FDA.\"6 Section 706 of FDASIA amended section 704(a) of the FD&C Actby adding 704(a)(4), which allows FDA to request, in advance of or in lieu of an inspection, within a reasonable timeframe, within reasonable limits, and in a reasonable manner, records or information that FDA may inspect under section 704(a).\n\nFacilities that are required to register under section 510 of the FD&C Act7 and that voluntarily register as outsourcing facilities under section 503B of the FD&C Act8 are required to submit certain information to FDA. FDA uses registration information for many purposes, including scheduling inspections. It is imperative that drug facilities register under section 510 when required, and that all registered facilities provide the information required by statute and our regulations to avoid creating confusion or complicating the scheduling and conduct of inspections. We also strongly encourage facilities to update point of contact e-mail information submitted to the Agency promptly if a change occurs after an annual registration submission.9\n\nFootnote 7: See also 21 C.F.R. 207. For additional information, see Guidance for Industry, Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format \u2013 Drug Establishment Registration and Drug Listing.\n\nFootnote 8: In December 2013, FDA issued draft Guidance for Industry, Registration for Human Drug Compounding\n\nFootnote 9: Some facilities subject to inspection under section 704 of the FD&C Act, such as compounding pharmacies, may not be required to register under section 510 because they fall within an exception in section 510(g) and may not have elected to register as outsourcing facilities. Such facilities are not required to provide a point of contact e-mail address to FDA, but the Agency may refer to a point of contact designated in a state license in preparing for inspections or for other purposes, and we therefore encourage such firms to ensure that any point of contact provided in a state license is valid.\n\nIt is a prohibited act under sections 301(e) and 301(f) of the FD&C Act to refuse to permit entry or inspection or refuse to permit access to or copying of certain specified records.10 New section 501(j) of the FD&C Act, as added by FDASIA section 707, now deems a drug to be adulterated if \"...it has been manufactured, processed, packed, or held in any factory, warehouse, or establishment and the owner, operator, or agent of such factory, warehouse, or establishment delays, denies, or limits an inspection, or refuses to permit entry or inspection.\"\n\nFootnote 10: Section 301 (21 U.S.C. 331) provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe following acts and the causing thereof are hereby prohibited:... (e) The refusal to permit access to or copying of any record as required by section... 704(a).... (f) The refusal to permit entry or inspection as authorized by section 704.\u201d Section 303 (21 U.S.C 333) provides penalties for violations of Section 301.\n\n3 Delay of Inspections\n\nDelays may occur for many reasons, some of which are beyond the control of the facility. However, where an owner, operator, or agent causes the delay of an inspection, this may cause the drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act.\n\n4 Delay Scheduling Pre-announced Inspections\n\nThe FD&C Act does not require FDA to pre-announce its inspections. Therefore, FDA usually does not pre-announce for-cause and routine surveillance inspections. It is, however, FDA'sgeneral practice to contact the firm before an investigator arrives at the inspection site for pre-approval and pre-license inspections, and most inspections of foreign facilities of drug products. This pre-announcement, although not required, is intended to facilitate the inspection process and ensure that appropriate records and personnel will be made available.\n\nFDA's efforts to schedule pre-announced inspections include sending correspondence to the facility's point of contact e-mail address, including the facility's U.S. agent if the facility is a foreign facility. FDA will make reasonable accommodations for local conditions, such as weather or security situations, holidays, and other non-work days, and, where appropriate, scheduled manufacturing campaigns. Examples of delay in scheduling a pre-announced inspection that may cause drugs to be adulterated under section 501(j) of the FD&C Act include, but are not limited to:\n--------------------\nContext title: Circumstances that Constitute Delaying, Denying, Limiting, or Refusing a Drug Inspection Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.5849515199661255"], "Given the context of Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , Does the scope of section 13 of the PBRER only include controlled clinical trials?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , Does the scope of section 13 of the PBRER only include controlled clinical trials?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.9.2 Presentation\n\nThe recommended table of contents, including section numbering, for the PBRER is provided below:\n\nTitle Page\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nWorldwide Marketing Approval Status\n\nActions Taken in the Reporting Interval for Safety Reasons\n\nChanges to Reference Safety Information\n\nEstimated Exposure and Use Patterns 5.1 Cumulative Subject Exposure in Clinical Trials 5.2 Cumulative and Interval Patient Exposure from Marketing Experience\n\nData in Summary Tabulations 6.1 Reference Information 6.2 Cumulative Summary Tabulations of Serious Adverse Events from Clinical Trials 6.3 Cumulative and Interval Summary Tabulations from Post-Marketing Data Sources\n\nSummaries of Significant Findings from Clinical Trials during the Reporting Period 7.1 Completed Clinical Trials 7.2 Ongoing Clinical Trials7.3 Long-Term Follow-up 7.4 Other Therapeutic Use of Medicinal Product 7.5 New Safety Data Related to Fixed Combination Therapies\n8 Findings from Non-Interventional Studies\n9 Information from Other Clinical Trials and Sources\n10 Non-Clinical Data\n11 Literature\n12 Other Periodic Reports\n13 Lack of Efficacy in Controlled Clinical Trials\n14 Late-Breaking Information\n15 Overview of Signals: New, Ongoing, or Closed\n16 Signal and Risk Evaluation\n16.1 Summary of Safety Concerns\n16.2 Signal Evaluation\n16.3 Evaluation of Risks and New Information\n16.4 Characterisation of Risks\n16.5 Effectiveness of Risk Minimisation (if applicable)\n17 Benefit Evaluation\n17.1 Important Baseline Efficacy/Effectiveness Information\n17.2 Newly Identified information on Efficacy/Effectiveness\n17.3 Characterisation of Benefits\n18 Integrated Benefit-Risk Analysis for Approved Indications\n18.1 Benefit-Risk Context - Medical Need and Important Alternatives\n18.2 Benefit-Risk Analysis Evaluation\n19 Conclusions and Actions\n20 Appendices\n\n3 Guidance on Contents of the PBRER\n\nAll sections should be completed, and when no information is available, this should be stated.

Often, higher risk subgroups and patients with concomitant illnesses that require use of other drugs are excluded from clinical trials, and long-term treatment data are limited. Moreover, patients in trials are closely monitored for evidence of adverse events. In clinical practice, monitoring is less intensive, a broader range of patients are treated (age, co-morbidities, drugs, genetic abnormalities), and events too rare to occur in clinical trials may be observed (e.g., severe liver injury). These factors underlie the need for continuing analysis of relevant safety, efficacy,1 and effectiveness1 information throughout the lifecycle of a medicinal product - promptly, as important findings occur - and periodically - to allow an overall assessment of the accumulating data. Although the majority of new information will be safety-related, new information about effectiveness, limitations of use, alternative treatments, and many other aspects of the drug's place in therapy may be pertinent to its benefit-risk assessment.\n\nFootnote 1: The terms efficacy and effectiveness are not standardised, and have different meanings across some regions. See Section 2.6\n\nThe ICH Guideline E2C, Clinical Safety Data Management: Periodic Safety Update Reports for Marketed Drugs, achieved Step 4 in 1996, and was intended to harmonise the periodic reporting requirements to regulatory authorities and to provide, in a common format, the worldwide interval safety experience of a medicinal product at defined times post-approval. At that time, the focus of the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) was on relevant new safety information in the context of patient exposure, to determine if changes were needed to the Reference Safety Information* (RSI) in order to optimise the continued safe use of the product. The Guideline was revised in 2003, to provide needed clarification, guidance and flexibility.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.9729984402656555", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , Does the scope of section 13 of the PBRER only include controlled clinical trials?\n--------------------\nContext: Study ID (e.g., protocol number or other identifier);\n\nStudy title (abbreviated study title, if applicable);\n\nStudy type (e.g., randomized clinical trial, cohort study, case-control study);\n\nPopulation studied (including country and other relevant population descriptors, e.g., paediatric population or trial subjects with impaired renal function);* Study start (as defined by the MAH) and projected completion dates;\n\nOngoing (clinical trial has begun);\n\nCompleted (clinical study report is finalised).\n\n3.7.1 Completed Clinical Trials\n\nSection 7.1 of the PBRER should provide a brief summary of clinically important emerging efficacy and safety findings obtained from clinical trials completed during the reporting interval.

While starting material manufacturing processes typically contain purification operations, addition of purification steps prior to a proposed starting material in order to avoid defining an earlier, upstream compound as the starting material would not be considered appropriate.\n\nAfter these considerations, if the evaluation would result in only a small number of chemical transformation steps, then it is generally appropriate to include one or more additional chemical transformation steps in Section 3.2.S.2.2. This is to ensure that enough steps are conducted under GMPto appropriately mitigate risks associated with contamination and future changes to the synthetic route or supplier of the starting material. The following paragraphs provide further clarification on this risk mitigation and should be considered together.\n\nAlthough ICH Q11 does not specify how many steps should be performed under GMP, ICH Q11 recommends the inclusion of \"multiple chemical transformation steps\" in Section 3.2.S.2.2 in order to reduce the risk of contamination and support the effective implementation of the control strategy throughout the product lifecycle. When there would be a small number of steps, there is an increased risk of contamination that needs to be addressed by the applicant in their starting material justification, and will often be best mitigated by including one or more additional steps in Section 3.2.S.2.2.\n\nPotential risks from future changes to the starting material synthesis should also be considered (see Q&A 5.16). There is an increased risk that impurities generated as a result of a change to the manufacturing process upstream of the starting material may not be detected or purged appropriately if the starting material is only a small number of steps from the drug substance. In order to determine how many additional steps to include, the applicant may also consider other approaches to risk mitigation; for example, inclusion of analytical methodologies in the specification of the proposed starting material that are designed to detect a wide range of possible impurities based on different physical and chemical separation and detection principles.

For critical components that affect the mechanics of the overall performance of the device but do not contact either the patient (mouth or nose) or the formulation, a qualitative approach for control of the extractable profile may suffice. The extractable profiles of the specified container, closure, and pump components should be established and documented under defined experimental conditions. The documentation should include the sample size, type and amount of solvents, temperature, duration, extraction procedures, analysis procedures, and data. Solvents of various polarities should be used for initial determination of the profiles (e.g., water and appropriate organic solvents).\n\nExtraction studies should be performed, and the profile of each extract should be evaluated both analytically and toxicologically. The application should provide adequate analytical information, obtained using a variety or combination of procedures (e.g., chromatography with mass spectroscopy), to identify and quantify each extractable and establish appropriate acceptance criteria. A toxicological evaluation should be made of the extractables from the container, closure, and critical pump components, and the results submitted in the application. For critical components that only affect the mechanics of the overall performance of the pump, a toxicological evaluation of extractables is not necessary. The appraisal should include appropriate in vitro and in vivo tests and can also be supported by applicable citations and additional safety data. The results of USP Biological Reactivity Tests (USP (<)87(>) and (<)88(>)) should be submitted. A rationale, based on available toxicological information, should be provided to support acceptance criteria for components in terms of the extractable profiles. Special attention should be paid to elastomeric components because of the potential for release of additional leachables (e.g., PNAs (polynuclear aromatics), nitrosamines, vulcanization accelerators) into the formulation, which can alter the toxicological profile of the drug product. Since some extractables may be carcinogenic, appropriate risk assessment models may be warranted to establish acceptance criteria. Applicants are encouraged to contact the responsible review division for further guidance.\n\nRoutine Extraction\n\nBased on the analytical and toxicological evaluation of the extractables from the control extraction studies, the applicant should establish discriminatory test procedures and set appropriate acceptance criteria for the extractable profiles for routine testing for each critical component of the container closure system. This testing will provide continued assurance of the batch-to-batch consistency of the composition and purity of the container and closure components. An extraction test should be performed on every incoming component batch using water and other suitable solvents selected from the control extraction studies, to determine the individual and total extractables. For nasal spray drug products, if the level of extractables for each component is relatively low, it may be appropriate to establish a limit only for the total weight of extractables from each individual critical component.\n\nIf a correlation is established between the extractables from the raw materials used for fabrication of the container and closure components and those emanating from the molded components, and assurance is provided that no additional additives are introduced during the fabrication process, then routine extraction studies can be performed on each raw material batch, with a reduced testing schedule of individual component batches.\n\nTest procedures and analytical sampling plans (i.e., number of samples tested, individual or composite samples specified, number of replicate analyses per sample) should be provided. The specificity, linearity, range, accuracy, precision, detection limit, quantitation limit, and robustness of the proposed validated test procedures, including system suitability testing, should be documented with proper standards during validation in the control extraction studies.13\n\nFootnote 13: Guidance relating to validation of analytical procedures is available in the ICH guidances (Q2A) Text on Validation of Analytical Procedures(March 1995) and Q2B Validation of Analytical Procedures: Methodology (November 1996) and CDERs guidance on Submitting Samples and Analytical Data for Methods Validation (February 1987). CDERs 1987 guidance will be superseded by the guidance on Analytical Procedures and Methods Validation, when finalized. A notice of availability for a draft version of this guidance published in the Federal Register on August 30, 2000 (65 FR 52776).\n\nAcceptance Criteria\n\nThe application should include specifications for the container, closure, each component of the pump, the assembled pump, labels, adhesives, ink, and protective packaging, as applicable. The specifications should include\n\ndimensional measurements, particulate matter, physicochemical parameters, and individual and total extractables as outlined above in #3 under the discussion of the routine extraction studies. In addition, the specifications should include\n\nperformance attributes of the pump (e.g., functionality, pump or spray weight\n\ndelivery, particle/droplet size distribution, spray pattern, minimum actuation force\n\nto achieve desired spray characteristics). Data should be collected using defined\n\nactuation parameters (e.g., force, speed, hold and return times). All proposed\n\nacceptance criteria should reflect the test results of the pumps used in the\n\nsubmitted drug product batches (e.g., critical clinical, primary stability, biobatch,\n\nand production batches, all using same pumps). If the information outlined above\n\nis generated by the pump manufacturer through authorized DMFs and is reported\n\nby certificate of analysis, applicants should also develop or have access to the\n\nanalytical and other procedures to verify the reliability of the suppliers test results\n\nat appropriate intervals (21 CFR 211.84).\n\nFor the extractables profiles and the physicochemical parameters, a reduced\n\nacceptance testing schedule can be considered once the applicant establishes the\n\nreliability of the suppliers test results. If a reduced acceptance testing schedule is\n\nproposed, the applicant should confirm the supplier's results by testing multiple\n\nincoming batches of individual components (e.g., container, closure, pump\n\ncomponents), some of which were used in preparing the submitted drug product\n\nbatches (e.g., critical clinical, primary stability, biobatch, production). Also, a\n\ncommitment should be provided to test a predetermined number of batches of\n\neach component used in preparing postapproval drug product batches.\n\nSemipermeable Container Closure Systems\n\nProtective packaging (e.g., foil overwrap) is recommended for inhalation drug\n\nproducts packaged in semipermeable containers (e.g., low density polyethylene\n\n(LDPE)). The protective packaging mitigates conditions such as ingress of\n\nforeign contaminants, loss of solvent, exposure to oxygen. Furthermore, labeling\n\nof these products by embossing or debossing is recommended to avoid the\n\npotential ingress from other types of labels (e.g., volatile organic chemicals from\n\ninks, paper, adhesive components). The levels of the leachables originating from\n\nindirect exposure to labels or related materials should be determined with\n\nvalidated methodology that has suitable detection and quantitation limits for the\n\npotential leachables. The levels of leached compounds should be appropriately\n\nqualified and documented and acceptance criteria established.14\n\nFootnote 14: A draft guidance is under development and will publish soon. When finalized, this guidance will provide additional information on inhalation drug products packaged in semipermeable container closure systems.\nStability studies provide a means for checking the physical and chemical stability of the drug product at various storage conditions, including the compatibility of the formulation with the components of the device, as well as performance of nasal and inhalation spray drug products. The application should contain (1) a complete, detailed stability protocol, (2) stability report and data, and (3) information regarding the suitability of the test procedures employed.\n\nProtocols, Commitment, and Data Reporting\n\nA stability protocol is a detailed plan described in an application that is used to generate and analyze stability data to support the retest or expiration dating period for a drug substance or the expiration dating period for a drug product.\n\nThe applicant should verify and ensure continued stability of the drug product by placing production batches into the applicant's routine stability testing program. The applicant should provide appropriate statements in the stability protocol committing to conduct and/or complete prescribed studies on production batches of a drug after approval.\n\nFor detailed information on the stability protocol, commitment, and data reporting, refer to Submitting Documentation for the Stability of Human Drugs and Biologics (the stability guidance) (February 1987).15 For nasal spray and inhalation solution, suspension, and spray drug products, the stability report should also include the grade, batch number, and source of critical and novel excipients.\n--------------------\nContext title: Nasal Spray and Inhalation Solution, Suspension, and Spray Drug Products--Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Documentation Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.663946628570557", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , For release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nDraft--Not for Implementation\n\nof the concentration-time profile), the applicant intends to gather additional information to evaluate clinical effect of these differences.18\n\nFootnote 18: For further information, see the draft guidance for industry Bioavailability Studies Submitted in NDAs or INDs \u2014 General Considerations(February 2019). When final, this guidance will represent the FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nBridging From One Autoinjector (Prototype 1) to Another Autoinjector (Prototype 2) for the Same Drug; After Phase 3 Studies Have Been Completed but Before NDA Submission\n\nIn this hypothetical case example, the applicant developed an autoencoder for Drug Product X, which was used through completion of its phase 3 clinical studies. During the course of development for submission, the applicant decided to make modifications to the TBM autoinjector (Prototype 2) to improve its functionality; however, the applicant does not intend to modify the device performance specifications (e.g., dose accuracy, injection time). In this case, the primary container closure in direct contact with the drug (i.e., barrel, plunger, and needle) remains the same. The assembly process used during manufacture to form the autoencoder remains the same. The drug formulation remains the same. The route of administration is the same (subcutaneous). The user interface is the same.\n\nUsing the stepwise framework, the applicant's gap analysis identifies the following:\n\nStep 1. The applicant identifies the differences between the clinically studied autoencoder (Prototype 1) presentation and the TBM autoinjector (Prototype 2) presentation. The dimensions and materials of the internal components of the rear and front shell subassemblies of the combination product were modified to improve the functionality for the combination product without changing the user interface.\n\nIn considering the potential effect of the individual and aggregate differences on safety and effectiveness introduced by the device modifications, the applicant identifies the following considerations:\n\nThe revision of the autoinjector would not be expected to change the quality considerations for the drug constituent part if the container closure in direct contact with the drug and the formulation remains the same. The manufacturing process for Prototype 2 is comparable to that for Prototype 1, so the manufacturing process for the revision of the autoinjector would not be expected to affect the quality of the drug constituent part. However, differences in functional performance of the device constituent part, if any, may affect the drug constituent part.\n\nDevice changes may affect the PK profile of the drug. For example, changing the dimensions and materials of the rear and front shell subassemblies' internal components may lead to differences including consistency or variability of injection angle, tissue depth (potentially associated with the rate of drug delivery as determined by the injection time), and completeness of the injection.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nDraft--Not for Implementation\n\nStep 2. The applicant did not gather new clinical data for the TBM product, but as reflected in Step 3 conducted verification testing on the TBM autoinjector (Prototype 2) to confirm that device performance remains unchanged between the clinically studied (Prototype 1) and TBM (Prototype 2) versions of the device. This included testing in accordance with relevant standards as well as an assessment of certain performance requirements that the applicant has identified as potentially affected by the modifications to the components and that, if affected, could adversely affect the device's operations. In this case, the following performance requirements were included in the verification testing of the TBM device (Prototype 2):\n\n[\\bullet] Dose accuracy\n\n[\\bullet] Injection depth (needle extension)\n\n[\\bullet] Injection time\n\n[\\bullet] Activation force\n\n[\\bullet]\n\nThe applicant is aware that the above are examples of factors that could affect the drug delivery and should be assessed over combination product shelf life. The applicant has compared the identified performance requirements for both autoinjector prototypes (1 and 2) and determined that the performance requirements remain unchanged between the clinically studied (Prototype 1) and TBM (Prototype 2) versions of the device.\n\nStep 3. The applicant previously conducted phase 3 studies with Prototype 1 of the autoinjector presentation. The applicant has also performed design verification testing and completed HF validation testing on the clinically studied autoinjector (Prototype 1). The applicant identifies the following information that can be applied to the modified TBM autoinjector (Prototype 2) presentation:\n\n[\\bullet] As noted above, testing confirmed that the dose accuracy, delivery time, injection depth, injection angle and site of injection are the same for Prototype 1 and TBM Prototype 2 bridging that information for these presentations; therefore, the applicant has determined that the PK studies conducted using Prototype 1 of the autoinjector can be leveraged.\n\n[\\bullet] The user interface is not changing. Additionally, the activation force and injection time remain the same; therefore, the applicant has determined that the HF data between Prototype 1 and 2 can be bridged. Accordingly, the HF data collected for the combination product using the Prototype 1 autoinjector can be leveraged for the combination product using the Prototype 2 autoinjector presentation.\n\n[\\bullet] The proposed indication, dosage, and administration are the same and, as noted previously, there is no change to the delivery of the drug (e.g., dose accuracy, injection time, injection depth). Therefore, the applicant has determined that the nonclinical, toxicity, and safety and effectiveness data gathered in the existing clinical program using the Prototype 1 autoinjector presentation can be bridged to the Prototype 2 autoinjector presentation and leveraged.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nDraft--Not for Implementation\n\nThe primary container closure is the same for both Prototype 1 and Prototype 2 autoinjectors, and the applicant can demonstrate that the autoinjector components and materials used during manufacture and storage of the combination product do not come in direct contact with the drug. Therefore, the applicant has determined that the CMC information for the drug constituent part and leachable profile gathered using the Prototype 1 autoinjector presentation can be bridged to the Prototype 2 autoinjector presentation and leveraged.\n\nThe primary container closure remains the same and the injection time remains unchanged from the clinically studied Prototype 1 autoencoder to the TBM Prototype 2 autoinjector. Therefore, the applicant has determined that it is possible to bridge information regarding the products and leverage the drug-device compatibility study from Prototype 1.\n\nThe applicant determines that there is no other existing information that may be leveraged.\n\nThe applicant believes no new information needs to be generated beyond that described above. The applicant intends to support the assessment through submission of data demonstrating comparability between the designs, including through submission of full design verification data for the TBM Prototype 2 to demonstrate that device performance is comparable to Prototype 1. In addition, the applicant intends to include a side-by-side comparison of the user interface for the combination product using Prototype 1, which was evaluated in the HF validation study, and the combination product using Prototype 2 as part of the NDA submission to facilitate review to demonstrate that there are no differences in the user interface.\n\nC. Bridging of Data From Combination Product That Employs the Same Device Combined With a Different Drug\n\nIn this hypothetical case example, the applicant previously developed Combination Product A, which was approved by FDA in an NDA and includes a prefilled drug cartridge attached to a metered-dose inhaler. Combination Product A is indicated for the prevention and relief of bronchospasm in patients 18 years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease.\n\nThe applicant is now early in the development of Combination Product B, which combines an 483 NME drug constituent part with the same metered-dose inhaler as in Combination Product A.\n\nFor Combination Product B, the applicant is seeking an indication of prevention and relief of bronchospasm in patients 4 years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease.\n\nThe same route of administration applies to Combination Products A and B. Both combination products require the same actuation force to administer an inhalation. Both combination products are intended for use in an emergency-use scenario to rapidly reverse bronchospasm.\n\nUsing the stepwise framework, the applicant's gap analysis identifies the following:Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nDraft--Not for Implementation\n\nStep 1. The applicant identifies the differences between Combination Products A and B. The key differences are the change in the drug constituent part and the inclusion of a pediatric age group.\n\nStep 2. The applicant has not yet developed any information for Combination Product B and, therefore, will have to either leverage existing information on the device constituent part or develop new data.\n--------------------\nContext title: Bridging for Drug-Device and Biologic-Device Combination Products Draft Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.698638439178467", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: From what I've read in CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols - Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information for New Animal Drugs , For release profiles, how does the product achieve the desired profile?\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTherefore, study stopping rules do not necessarily terminate a trial. Well-designed stopping rules allow sponsors to assess and address risks identified as the trial proceeds, and to assure that risks to subjects remain reasonable.\n\nV Meetings with Octgt\n\nOCTGT encourages prospective sponsors to meet with FDA review staff. Meeting with OCTGT can be especially beneficial for sponsors who have little experience with the IND process, and for sponsors developing a product for the treatment of a rare disease. In such meetings, OCTGT can provide advice that may increase the likelihood that an IND submission will be sufficient to support a proposed trial, or that the overall development program will be sufficient to support a marketing application.\n\nThe FDA guidance document entitled \"Guidance for Industry: Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants\" dated May 2009 (Ref. 12), describes the process for requesting and preparing for a meeting. One type of formal meeting is the pre-IND meeting. A pre-IND meeting is intended to help ensure that appropriate work has or will be done to support a planned IND. The sponsor's pre-IND briefing package should include a clinical protocol or synopsis. In addition to discussions of preclinical studies and manufacturing issues, appropriate clinical topics for such a meeting could include the following:\n\nthe adequacy of the available or planned safety and proof-of-concept information to justify the risks of the proposed trial;\n\nthe choice of study population;\n\nthe doses to be administered;\n\nthe dosing schedule;\n\nclinical issues related to any invasive administration procedures;\n\nthe treatment plan for the control group, if one is proposed;\n\nstaggering plans;\n\nthe safety monitoring plan, including long-term follow-up;\n\nany special safety assessments;\n\nstopping rules;\n\nselection of trial endpoints; and\n\nthe overall clinical development program.\n\nVI Guidance on submitting an IND\n\nThe requirements with respect to what needs to be submitted in support of an IND can be found in the FDA regulations, 21 CFR 312.23, and recommendations with respect to these submissions can be found in the FDA guidance document entitled, \"Guidance for Industry: Content and Format of Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Phase 1 Studies of Drugs, Including Well-Characterized, Therapeutic, Biotechnology-derived Products\" dated November 1995 (Ref. 13). Information on the preparation of the CMC section of an IND for a CGT product can be found in the FDA guidances entitled \"Guidance for FDA Reviewers and Sponsors:Content and Review of Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) Information for Human Somatic Cell Therapy Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs)\" dated April 2008 (Ref. 1) and \"Guidance for FDA Reviewers and Sponsors: Content and Review of Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) Information for Human Gene Therapy Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs)\" dated April 2008 (Ref. 2). As noted previously, information on the preparation of the preclinical section of an IND for a CGT product can be found in the FDA guidance entitled \"Guidance for Industry: Preclinical Assessment of Investigational Cellular and Gene Therapy Products\" dated November 2013 (Ref. 3).\n\nThe IND submission for an early-phase trial must include a summary of previous human experience known to the applicant with the investigational product, along with detailed information about such experience that is relevant to the safety of the proposed investigation or to the investigator's rationale (21 CFR 312.23(a)(9)). The submission also should include a summary of previous human experience with similar or closely related products. OCTGT recommends that the submission include discussion of any of the issues raised in Sections III and IV of this guidance that are applicable to the proposed trial.\n\nSponsors also may find it prudent to develop an overall product development plan early in the course of development (prior to clinical trial initiation). Such a plan should be sufficiently flexible to accommodate adaptation based on data acquired through product development. One potential approach to planning development is known as a Target Product Profile (TPP). FDA has published a draft guidance for comment that discusses how this particular planning tool might be used (Ref. 14). When finalized, the TPP guidance will represent our current thinking on this topic.\n\nFDA has developed additional resources that sponsors may find useful when preparing an IND for CGT products, including guidances relevant to the development of CGT products for selected specified conditions.3,9,10,11 Likewise, information on manufacturing, preclinical, and clinical topics related to development of CGT products, including discussion of IND submissions and meeting requests, is available in the OCTGT Learn webinars on the OCTGT website:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/newsevents/ucm232821.htm.\n\nFootnote 9: \u201cGuidance for Industry: Considerations for Allogeneic Pancreatic Islet Cell Products\u201d dated September 2009, http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/CellularandGeneTherapy/ucm182440.htm.\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/CellularandGeneTherapy/ucm164265.htm.\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/CellularandGeneTherapy/ucm164265.htm.\n\nLikewise, information on manufacturing, preclinical, and clinical topics related to development of CGT products, including discussion of IND submissions and meeting requests, is available in the OCTGT Learn webinars on the OCTGT website:\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/newsevents/ucm232821.htm.\n\nVII References\n\n[1] Guidance for FDA Reviewers and Sponsors: Content and Review of Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) Information for Human Somatic Cell Therapy Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs); dated April 2008, http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/G uidances/Xenotransplantation/ucm074131.htm.\n\n[2] Guidance for FDA Reviewers and Sponsors: Content and Review of Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) Information for Human Gene Therapy Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs); dated April 2008, http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/G uidances/CellularandGeneTherapy/ucm072587.htm.\n\n[3] Guidance for Industry: Preclinical Assessment of Investigational Cellular and Gene Therapy Products; dated November 2013, http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/G uidances/CellularandGeneTherapy/ucm376136.htm\n\n[4] Raper S.E., N.

Therefore, the development program for these NRT drug products may include several trials to identify and refine the proper dosing regimen and self-help materials before undertaking the real-world or actual-use trial that would support approval.\n\nThe sponsor should develop a label that it believes may be close to the to-be-marketed Drug Facts label and test that label in a label comprehension study. The label comprehension testing process should be iterative and should lead to the development of the best understood label.25 If the drug product has instructions for use, these should be tested in a human factors study to demonstrate that consumers can understand the instructions on how to use the drug product.26\n\nFootnote 25: See the guidance for industry Label Comprehension Studies for Nonprescription Drug Products (August 2010).\n\nLabel comprehension and human factors studies should be conducted at the early stages of development because if the NRT drug product package (e.g., product/regimen, self-help materials) does not perform as expected, the source of failure may be difficult to determine. Furthermore, subsequent changes to the drug product may require retesting in additional clinical trials.\n\nSponsors should then provide clinical trial subjects with a package containing the NRT drug product with the planned Drug Facts label, along with any instructions or self-help materials that are intended to be marketed with the drug product. An efficacy trial that features assistance from trial staff to ensure that the subjects follow directions on the label provides evidence that the drug product, when properly used, is effective. However, at least one efficacy trial should involve an all-comers population (e.g., any person who self-selects to use the product) where no training and education on how to use the drug product is provided by the clinical trial staff. This real-world or actual-use trial is intended to provide evidence that consumers can use the drug product effectively and safely based on the label without assistance.\n\nIn general, it is desirable that the nonprescription development program proceeds in the following incremental and sequential fashion: formative label comprehension study; formative human factors study (if relevant); clinical trial with training/education from trial staff; pivotal label comprehension and human factors studies with the refined labeling utilizing clinical trial results; actual-use trial with no training or education from trial staff. One or more self-selection studies may also be necessary at some point in development to evaluate if the drug product use would be limited to the intended population (such as those looking to quit smoking, rather than nonsmokers) and/or to populations for whom a drug product would not be contraindicated.27 Note that depending on the particulars of the drug product, the sponsor may be able to incorporate a self-selection component into a real-world or actual-use trial.\n\nFootnote 27: See the guidance for industry Self-Selection Studies for Nonprescription Drug Products (April 2013).\n\niii.2.3 Study Population\n\nIn general, phase 3 clinical trials for an NRT drug product indicated for smoking cessation should study active smokers 18 years of age and older who wish to quit smoking, including subjects with comorbidities similar to those of the target population for the NRT drug product. In some circumstances, sponsors can consider setting study inclusion criteria that subjects use a certain minimum number of cigarettes per day at baseline. This may be the case, for example, if an investigational NRT drug product provides a nicotine dose that exceeds the nicotine delivered by light smoking. Efficacy trials for certain indications may need a population of recent quitters, regardless of the method used. For discussion of studies in pediatric populations, see section III.4.1, Pediatric Populations.\n\nPlease refer to the draft guidance for industry Diversity Plans to Improve Enrollment of Participants From Underrepresented Racial and Ethnic Populations in Clinical Trials (April 2022)28 for recommendations on developing a Race and Ethnicity Diversity Plan to enroll representative numbers of participants from underrepresented racial and ethnic populations in the United States in clinical trials.\n\nFootnote 28: When final, this guidance will represent the FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\niii.2.4 Cessation Efficacy Endpoints\n\nThe endpoint for a smoking cessation trial is the proportion of subjects who are abstinent from cigarette use over the entire efficacy ascertainment period.29 A trial is considered to demonstrate effectiveness if significantly more subjects achieve abstinence when treated with the investigational NRT drug product as compared to subjects treated with the placebo. However, FDA will take the size of the effect into consideration during its benefit-risk assessment.\n\nIn general, abstinence is defined as no cigarette use over the entire course of the efficacy ascertainment period by subject self-report and biological verification at intervals of approximately 1 to 2 weeks. A longer interval between self-reporting and verification visits may be acceptable in some instances (e.g., trials that are more than 3 months long). For trials with longer efficacy ascertainment periods of 6 or 12 months, sponsors can consider defining abstinence to incorporate a maximum allowable number of cigarettes.30 The efficacy ascertainment period generally runs from the first day of treatment to the last day of treatment. The duration of the efficacy ascertainment period should be sufficient to justify the intended duration of treatment. Thus, an investigational NRT drug product that a sponsor intends to label as a 6-month course of treatment should be supported by 6 months of documented abstinence. If the effect of the treatment is not expected to result immediately upon initiation of the drug product because of the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, or other factors, then efficacy ascertainment can take place over a period that begins after a protocol-specified grace period. The sponsor should justify the duration of any such grace period.\n\nFootnote 30: See, for example, the Russell Standard as described in Robert West et al., 2005, \u201cOutcome Criteria in Smoking Cessation Trials: Proposal for a Common Standard,\u201d Addiction, 100(3):299\u2013303.\n\nFDA recommends a minimum 4-week period of efficacy ascertainment. The proportion of subjects abstaining for less than 4 weeks is not considered informative because such short periods of abstinence are not known to confer health benefits. Similarly, a floating period of efficacy ascertainment (e.g., any 4 consecutive weeks) is not considered informative because subjects who relapse while still on treatment cannot be viewed as successful quitters.\n\nSubjects reporting use of non-study nicotine or smoking cessation products should be adjudicated as nonresponders (e.g., nonquitters) for the purposes of evaluating the therapeutic effect of the study drug under the relevant protocol.\n\n4.2.5 Other Efficacy Endpoints\n\n[\\text{a.}\\qquad\\text{Reduction in risk of relapse}]\n\nSponsors seeking a reduction in risk of relapse indication should provide evidence from clinical trials showing that recent quitters (i.e., smokers who have quit within the past month), regardless of the method used, even without the use of NRT or other medications (cold turkey), can benefit from a course of treatment with the NRT drug product to reduce the risk of relapse. The clinical trials intended to support this maintenance indication should have the definition of relapse\n\nprespecified in the protocol, an ascertainment window, at a minimum, of 6 months to 1 year, and use the proportion of trial subjects not relapsing as the primary endpoint.31\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor example, these clinical trials could have a double-blind, placebo-controlled design in which recent quitters are randomized to treatment or placebo, then followed for the efficacy ascertainment period for evaluation of relapse. Alternatively, a randomized withdrawal design could be employed, in which responders to an open label period of treatment with the drug product are randomized to continue on the drug product or to blindly switch to a matching placebo, then followed for the efficacy ascertainment period for evaluation of relapse.\n\nb. Reduction in urge to smoke and relief of cue-induced craving in former smokers\n\nFormer smokers, even those with a long period of successful abstinence from smoking, can have episodes in which they experience uncomfortable feelings of a desire to smoke. These episodes may be provoked by circumstances or cues that have been previously associated with smoking. Even in successful abstainers at low risk for relapse, the experience of these provoked urges or cravings are unpleasant and can be a target for treatment.\n\nDrug products that have already demonstrated effectiveness in smoking cessation or reduction in risk of relapse may be able to include information in labeling about effectiveness in relieving the urge to smoke and cue-induced cravings in populations of former smokers based on suitable trials. Sponsors should identify or develop fit-for-purpose PRO instruments and recruit former smokers who report experiencing urges or cravings and who are interested in finding ways to relieve this symptom.32\n\nc.

Office of the Commissioner, Office of Clinical Policy and Programs, Office of Clinical Policy, Office of Good Clinical Practice\n\nThe interrelationship and interaction between the research sponsor (e.g., drug, biologic and device manufacturers), the clinical investigator and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) may be very complex. The regulations do not prohibit direct sponsor-IRB contacts, although, the sponsor-IRB interaction customarily occurs through the investigator who conducts the clinical study. The clinical investigator generally provides the communication link between the IRB and the sponsor. Such linkage is agreed to by the sponsors and investigators when they sign forms FDA-1571 and FDA-1572, respectively, for drug and biologic studies or an investigator agreement for device studies. There are occasions when direct communication between the IRB and the sponsor may facilitate resolution of concerns about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The clinical investigator should be kept apprised of the discussion.\n\nSponsor Assurance that IRBs Operate in Compliance with 21 CFR Part 56\n\nFDA regulations [21 CFR 312.23(a)(1)(iv)] require that a sponsor assure the FDA that a study will be conducted in compliance with the informed consent and IRB regulations [21 CFR parts 50 and 56]. This requirement has been misinterpreted to mean that it is a sponsor's obligation to determine IRB compliance with the regulations. This is not the case. Sponsors should rely on the clinical investigator, who assures the sponsor on form FDA-1572 for drugs and biologics or the investigator agreement for devices that the study will be reviewed by an IRB. Because clinical investigators work directly with IRBs, it is appropriate that they assure the sponsor that the IRB is functioning in compliance with the regulations.\n\nAn IRB must notify an investigator in writing of its decision to approve, disapprove or request modifications in a proposed research activity [21 CFR 56.109(e)]. This correspondence should be made available to the sponsor by the clinical investigator. In the Agency's view, this required documentation provides the sponsor with reasonable assurance that an IRB complies with 21 CFR part 56 and that it will be responsible for initial and continuing review of the study. Also, the sponsor and, in fact, anyone who is interested, mayobtain an Establishment Inspection Report from an FDA inspection of an IRB. These reports summarize the conditions observed during the IRB inspection. FDA, however, does not certify IRBs.\n\nSponsor Access to Medical Records\n\nThe IRB is responsible for ensuring that informed consent documents include the extent to which the confidentiality of medical records will be maintained [21 CFR 50.25(a)(5)]. FDA requires sponsors (or research monitors hired by them) to monitor the accuracy of the data submitted to FDA in accordance with regulatory requirements. These data are generally in the possession of the clinical investigator. Each subject must be advised during the informed consent process of the extent to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained and of the possibility that the FDA may inspect the records. While FDA access to medical records is a regulatory requirement, subject names are not usually requested by FDA unless the records of particular individuals require a more detailed study of the cases, or unless there is reason to believe that the records do not represent actual cases studied or actual results obtained. The consent document should list all other entities (e.g., the sponsor) who will have access to records identifying the subject. The extent to which confidentiality will be maintained may affect a subject's decision to participate in a clinical investigation.\n\nConfidentiality of Sponsor Information\n\nThe IRB's primary responsibility with respect to protecting confidentiality is to the research subject. IRBs should, however, respect the sponsor's need to maintain confidentiality of certain information about products under development. IRB members and staff should be aware that information submitted for review may be confidential, trade secret, and of commercial interest and should recognize the need for maintaining the confidentiality of the review materials and IRB records. It is advisable for IRBs to have policies that address this issue.\n\nNonsignificant Risk Device Studies\n\n\"A sponsor's preliminary determination that a medical device study presents an NSR is subject to IRB approval.\" The effect of the IRB's NSR decision is important to research sponsors and investigators because significant risk (SR) studies require sponsors to file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with FDA before they may begin. NSR studies, however, may begin as soon as the IRB approves the study. The sponsor, usually through the clinical investigator, provides the IRB with information necessary to make a judgment on the risk of a device study. While the investigational plan and supporting materials usually contain sufficient information to make a determination, the IRB can request additional information if needed [21 CFR 812.150(b)(10)]. If the IRB believes that additional information is needed, it may contact the sponsor directly, but it should keep the clinical investigator apprised of the request. While making the SR/NSR determination, any of the three parties may ask FDA to provide a risk assessment. See FDA Information Sheet: \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies\" for further information.\n\nDisagreements\n\nThe sponsor may choose not to conduct, to terminate, or to discontinue studies that do not conform with the sponsor's wishes. For example, the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB may reach an impasse about study procedures or specific wording in an informed consent document. The FDA will not mediate such disagreements. The Agency's policy of decentralized ethical review of clinical investigations allows such decisions to be made by local IRBs, and any disagreements between a sponsor, IRB, and clinical investigator should be resolved through appropriate communication among those parties.\n\nSubmit Comments\n\nSubmit comments on this guidance document electronically via docket ID: FDA-2013-S-0610\n\n(https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2013-S-0610) - Specific Electronic Submissions Intended For FDA's Dockets Management Staff (i.e., Citizen Pettitions, Draft Proposed Guidance Documents, Variances, and other administrative record submissions)\n\nIf unable to submit comments online, please mail written comments to:\n\nDockets Management Food and Drug Administration 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061 Rockville, MD 20852\n\nAll comments should be identified with the title of the guidance.\n\n[] Search for FDA Guidance Documents (/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents)\n--------------------\nContext title: Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.2373576164245605", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 64: See section IV.A.4 for guidance regarding identification of the most up-to-date version of the informed consent form.\n\niv.2.4 Identification of Revised Consent Forms\n\nThe IRB should ensure that there is a way to identify a revised consent form so that continued use of a previously approved version does not occur. While not required by FDA regulations, the use of date stamps is one possible mechanism for ensuring use of the most recently approved version of the consent form.\n\nThe Clinical Investigator\n\nThe clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects during a clinical investigation, and for ensuring that, unless an exception applies, legally effective informed consent is obtained from each subject or the subject's LAR before that subject takes part in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.20(a), 312.60, and 812.100). Legally effective informed consent includes meeting all applicable Federal, State, and local laws that require additional information in the informed consent form beyond what FDA regulations require. Sponsors and investigators may wish to seek legal guidance regarding specific local consent requirements applicable to their research.\n\nThe clinical investigator should notify the IRB regarding the consent process, including who (e.g., the investigator or another study team member) will conduct the consent discussion. Any information that will be given to subjects to review and discuss as part of informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)). An investigator may not begin the informed consent process with prospective subjects until the IRB reviews and approves the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process (21 CFR 50.20, 50.27, and 56.109).\n\nThe clinical investigator's institution may have standard language or a standard format for consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation). FDA recognizes that investigators may also need to identify and meet institutional requirements and incorporate them into the consent form for the IRB's initial review of the clinical investigation.\n\nDuring the clinical investigation, the investigator may need to revise the consent form to address new information that might arise during the conduct of the trial, such as a change to the protocol or new safety information. The investigator will need to obtain IRB review and approval of the revised consent form (21 CFR 50.27 and 56.109). In addition, because the consent form is being modified to reflect new information that might affect the willingness of already enrolled and actively participating subjects to continue in the clinical investigation, the IRB should determine the need to inform the previously enrolled subjects of the new information and determine their willingness to continue in the research (see\n\nFrequently Asked Questions #16).\n\nAny new information that is part of the consent process must be reviewed and approved by the IRB as a change in approved research before it is initiated, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject (see 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)). In the rare event that urgent safety information is provided to the subject prior to IRB approval, the IRB should promptly be notified of both the safety issue and the notification of subjects.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the clinical investigator:\n\niv.2.1 Delegation of Consent Discussion\n\nFDA regulations require that the investigator obtain the legally effective informed consent of subjects (21 CFR 50.20, 312.60 and 812.100). If the investigator delegates this responsibility, FDA expects that the individual to whom the responsibility is delegated be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform this activity. The individual obtaining informed consent should be knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and have the appropriate training and credentials to be able to address any questions or concerns the subject may have about the study and/or alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject. The investigator should have a detailed plan for the supervision and training of staff, and oversight of the clinical investigation, including the informed consent process.65 Even when a task is delegated to another individual, the investigator remains responsible for ensuring that legally effective informed consent is obtained for all subjects in accordance with 21 CFR part 50.\n\niv.2.2 Financial Relationships and Interests\n\nThe clinical investigator should consider whether information related to financial relationships or interests should be provided to subjects.66 Clinical investigators should consider the potential effects that a financial relationship might have on the clinical investigation or on interactions with subjects. When there are financial relationships or interests, clinical investigators should consider the following actions:\n\nFootnote 66: See the HHS guidance document, \u201cFinancial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidance for Human Subject Protection,\u201d available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/financial-conflict-of-interest/index.html#.\n\nIncluding information in the informed consent form, such as:\n\nThe source of funding and funding arrangements for the conduct and review of the clinical investigation, or\n\nInformation about a financial arrangement or interest (e.g., stock in the study sponsor, patent on the investigational product) of an institution or an investigator and how it is being managed.\n\nUsing special measures to modify the informed consent process when a potential or actual financial conflict exists, such as:\n\nHaving another individual who does not have a potential or actual conflict of interest involved in the consent process, especially when a potential or actual conflict of interest could influence the tone, presentation, or type of information presented during the consent process.\n\nUsing independent monitoring of the consent process.\n\nAlthough the clinical investigator should consider these issues regarding financial relationships and interests, IRBs have the final responsibility of determining whether subjects should be provided with information regarding the source of funding, funding arrangements, or financial interests of parties involved in the clinical investigation as part of the informed consent process (see 21 CFR 56.109 and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).\n\nThe Sponsor\n\nSponsors often provide clinical investigators with a model consent form that may be adapted by the clinical investigator to meet local needs. When the consent form for studies that require an IND or IDE application is submitted to FDA for review, FDA's comments are generally directed to the sponsor (see sectionIV.4.1, \"Investigational New Drugs and Biologics,\" and sectionIV.4.2, \"Investigational Medical Devices\"). The sponsor should promptly provide the clinical investigator with any necessary modifications required to satisfy the regulations at 21 CFR 50.25 so that changes can be made to the consent forms. A modified model consent form reflecting the changes may be used to convey the necessary edits. Because the clinical investigator must receive IRB approval before starting the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 312.66 and 21 CFR 812.110(a)), the sponsor should work closely with the clinical investigator to make certain the modified consent form is reviewed and approved by the IRB. The clinical investigator should provide the sponsor with a copy of the consent form approved by the IRB.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the sponsor:\n\niv.3.1 Considerations for Multicenter Clinical Investigations\n\nFor multicenter clinical investigations, changes may need to be made to the consent form to address local and institutional requirements. For multicenter clinical investigations reviewed by more than one IRB, when local IRB review results in substantive modifications to the consent form, i.e., changes that affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects, FDA expects the sponsor to share the revisions with all investigators and their IRBs. In this situation it may be more efficient to share the changes with the sites using a modified model consent form, when appropriate. If the multicenter clinical investigation has a central IRB cooperating with local IRBs or human research protection offices, the revisions should be forwarded to the central IRB.67 Alternatively, local issues may be addressed by the central IRB depending on the review agreement between the local IRB(s) and central IRB. Note that for medicaldevice studies that require submission of an IDE application, such changes must be submitted to FDA.68\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 812.35(a).\n\nFootnote 69: The 2018 Common Rule requires that any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States, unless the research is not subject to the provision (45 CFR 46.114(b)). The compliance date for research subject to this provision was January 20, 2020. On September 28, 2022, FDA issued a proposed rule to harmonize with this requirement to the extent practicable and consistent with statutory provisions (see https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/28/2022-21089/institutional-review-boards-cooperative-research). The January 19, 2017, final rule revising the Common Rule is available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/finalized-revisions-common-rule/index.html.\n\n.4.2 Sponsor Personnel\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.608599662780762", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: As a consequence of new information, the investigator may need to revise the consent form to include the new information for new enrollees and obtain IRB review and approval before it is used (see 21 CFR 50.27(a) and 56.109). Because the consent form is being modified to reflect the new information, the IRB should determine whether the investigator should provide currently enrolled subjects with the new information either with the revised informed consent document or an alternative method such as a consent addendum or information sheet describing the new information.\n\nWhen a revised consent form is used to inform enrolled subjects of new information and to document their willingness to continue in the trial, the investigator may use a prepared summary of the change(s) to reduce confusion about the change(s) and aid in presenting the new information. After the discussion of the new information and an acknowledgement of understanding by the enrolled subject, the enrolled subject should be asked to sign and date the revised consent document if they are willing to continue participating in the research. When an alternative method is used, such as a consent addendum or information sheet, the enrolled subject should be asked to sign and date the consent addendum or information sheet.94 FDA recommends that a copy of the signed and dated consent addendum or information sheet be provided to the subject.\n\nIn general, FDA does not believe it is necessary for subjects who have completed their active participation in the study to be informed of new information unless the new information relates to risks that may manifest after such participation. In this situation, it may be appropriate to provide previously enrolled subjects with counseling regarding any risk that may be warranted. Similarly, FDA does not believe it is necessary to inform subjects who are still actively participating of new information when the change will not likely affect their decision to continue in the study (e.g., an increase in the number of study subjects). However, IRBs may recommend that the investigator provide the above-discussed summary to all subjects (previously and currently enrolled subjects) for their awareness.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.568290948867798", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Based on the information from Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n--------------------\nContext: 2.3 Step 1 - Determine That There is Sufficient Justification to Enroll the Subject Without Using a Translated Long Form to Document the Subject's Informed Consent\n\nThe investigator, in consultation with the IRB chairperson (or another IRB member designated by the chairperson, hereafter referred to as designee) whenever feasible, determines that there is sufficient justification (e.g., due to a limited therapeutic window) for obtaining the subject's consent without waiting for a translated long form to be reviewed and approved by the IRB prior to enrollment of the subject. In making a decision to allow enrollment of a subject who does not understand English into a research protocol without waiting for a written translation of the long form, the investigator (and whenever feasible the IRB chairperson or designee) should consider whether the consent process, under this circumstance, will provide the subject with sufficient opportunity to understand the information being presented. If consent is sought and the investigator believes that the prospective subject has not understood the information presented, then the individual should not be enrolled in the research.\n\n2.4 Step 2 - Obtain and Document the Subject's Informed Consent in Accordance with FDA Regulations at 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 50.25 and 21 CFR 50.27 Using a Translated Short Form and the English Language Version of the Long Form as the Written Summary\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of 21 CFR 50.27(b)(2), informed consent is documented using a short form that has been translated into a language understandable to the prospective subject and approved by the IRB. As a prerequisite to using this procedure, the investigator must have available a short form written in a language understandable to the prospective subject or LAR and previously approved by the IRB (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.27(a)). To meet this prerequisite, the IRB mustrequire that the sponsor or investigator arrange for translation of a generic short form into a language understandable by the prospective subject or LAR, and the IRB must have approved the prospective use of such short forms for enrollment of subjects who do not understand English, as needed. Additionally, the IRB must approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The IRB-approved English long form often serves as this written summary. The translator should be fluent in both English and in the subject's language. It may be appropriate to have a translator available for all subsequent study visits to relay information between the subject and study personnel.\n\nThe procedure for obtaining and documenting the subject's informed consent with a translated short form and an English version of the long form includes the following:\n\nThe investigator (or their designee) obtaining informed consent, with the assistance of an interpreter if needed (e.g., if the investigator is not bilingual), provides orally to the subject the elements of informed consent required by FDA regulations at 21 CFR 50.25 and any additional pertinent information included in the IRB-approved English version of the long form. This presentation may be an oral translation of the IRB-approved English version of the long form. The oral presentation must be in language understandable to the subject (21 CFR 50.20). The investigator, with the assistance of an interpreter if needed, answers any questions from the prospective subject. There must be a witness to the oral presentation who must not be the person obtaining informed consent (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). Furthermore, FDA strongly recommends the witness be fluent in the language of the oral presentation. The witness must, at a minimum, have sufficient proficiency in the language of the oral presentation to be able to attest to the information that was to the presented orally to the prospective participant (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2).) In addition, if possible, the witness should not be related to the subject.\n\nAt the time informed consent is sought, the subject is given the IRB-approved translated short form and a copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form, which serves as the written summary.\n\nThe short form is signed and dated by the subject or LAR.\n\nThe witness signs both the short form and the copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form. (Note that when an interpreter assists the person obtaining consent, the interpreter may serve as the witness, but is not required to do so.)\n\nThe person actually obtaining consent signs the copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form.\n\nStep 3 - Take Additional Actions Following Subject Enrollment\n\nAfter the subject has been enrolled in the research, the investigator takes the following additional actions:1. If a subject was enrolled in the research using an untranslated long form to serve as the written summary, and if the investigator did not consult with the IRB chairperson (or designee) prior to enrollment of the subject who does not understand English, the investigator should promptly notify the IRB chairperson (or designee) that such a subject was enrolled.\n2. The investigator must obtain a translated copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form that served as the written summary, which should be done promptly. The investigator promptly submits it to the IRB for review and approval. Once the translated long form/written summary is approved by the IRB, the investigator must provide it to the subject or LAR and should do so as soon as possible. FDA considers this step essential to the requirement that informed consent be documented by the use of a written consent document and that the subject be provided a copy (21 CFR 50.27). Many of the clinical investigations regulated by FDA involve ongoing interventions and may involve long-term follow-up. For this reason, translation of the long form is critically important as a means of providing subjects or their LAR an ongoing source of information understandable to them.\n\nAdditionally, as noted above in Frequently Asked Question#3, FDA recommends that whenever subjects who do not understand English are involved in research, appropriate interpreter services be made available throughout the course of the research.\n\nix.1.6 What should be considered when enrolling subjects with low literacy and numeracy?\n\nAlthough a competent person who does not read and write well can give informed consent and enroll in a clinical investigation, the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB should consider whether any modifications to the informed consent process are necessary to ensure that the informed consent process is understandable.\n\nFor subjects with apparent low literacy and/or low numeracy, oral presentation of the information contained in the consent document is especially important. When the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject or the subject's LAR, the IRB may want to consider approving the use of a short form and written summary (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)), which includes a witness to the oral presentation of the informed consent elements who also signs the consent document (see _section_III.E.4.b, \"Short Form\"). It should be noted that, even if the information is presented orally, the subject or the subject's LAR is required to sign the consent form (whether the long form or short form is used) unless the IRB has waived documentation of informed consent under 21 CFR 56.109(c).\n\nSubjects who cannot write can indicate their consent by \"making their mark\" on the consent document, in lieu of signing and dating the consent form when consistent with applicable law. In these situations, a note should be included in subject case histories required to be maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21CFR 812.140(a)(3) indicating the reason for the lack of a signature and date as required by 21 CFR 50.27(a). The date consent was obtained should be recorded in this note.\n\nvi.2.7 What should be considered when enrolling subjects with physical or sensory disabilities?\n\nA person with physical or sensory disabilities (for example, physically unable to talk or write or has hearing or visual loss) can enroll in a clinical investigation if competent and able to signal consent consistent with applicable law. Enrolling such subjects into a clinical investigation does not require a LAR to be involved with the informed consent process or to sign the consent document unless required by State or local law. The records relating to the clinical investigation must include documentation of the informed consent process (21 CFR 50.27) unless excepted under 21 CFR 56.109(c). FDA recommends including in subject case histories required under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3) a description of the specific means by which the prospective subject communicated agreement to take part in the clinical investigation and how questions were answered. FDA recommends that investigators provide reasonable modifications and auxiliary aids and services when necessary to meet the specific needs of the study population.80 For example, for subjects with vision disabilities, the investigator could use an audio recording of the contents of the consent form or a consent form with enlarged font, depending on the degree of impairment.\n\nFootnote 80: FDA strongly encourages stakeholders to ensure that informed consent documents are accessible to individuals with disabilities. To the extent an organization receives Federal financial assistance from HHS, the organization must comply with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This guidance provides information to assist IRBs, clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA\u2019s informed consent regulations for clinical investigations.

The responsibilities of sponsors and investigators are described in subpart D of 21 CFR part 312 and in related guidance documents, for example, in the guidance for industry Investigator Responsibilities--Protecting the Rights, Safety, and Welfare of Study Subjects.\n\nFootnote 8: For additional information about FDA\u2019s IND safety reporting requirements, please see the guidance for industry and investigators Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies.\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe informed consent requirements in 21 CFR part 50 apply to treatment provided to patients under expanded access INDs, and informed consent must be obtained before initiating treatment, including in the case of emergency use, unless one of the exceptions found in part 50 applies.9 Additionally, the institutional review board (IRB) requirements found in 21 CFR part 56 apply (see SS 312.305(c)(4)), and IRB approval must be obtained before starting treatment under an expanded access IND unless it is for emergency use (in which case the IRB must be notified of the emergency expanded access use within 5 working days of treatment (SS 56.104(c)).10 Upon request, FDA intends to allow for waivers of the requirement for review and approval at a convened IRB meeting for individual patient expanded access INDs where the IRB chairperson or another designated IRB member provides concurrence, as described in the next paragraph.\n\nFootnote 9: For information on informed consent in general, see the draft guidance for IRBs, clinical investigators, and sponsors Informed Consent Information Sheet. When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic. For additional information on the part 50 informed consent exceptions, see the guidance for institutional review boards, clinical investigators, and sponsors Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research.\n\nFootnote 10: An IRB means any board, committee, or other group formally designated by an institution to review, to approve the initiation of, and to conduct periodic review of biomedical research involving human subjects. The primary purpose of IRB review is to assure that the rights and welfare of human subjects are protected, including by determining that informed consent is obtained in accordance with and to the extent required by Federal requirements. Institutions may have their own IRB to oversee human subjects research conducted within the institution or by the staff of the institution. If the physician does not have access to a local IRB, an independent IRB may be used. The Department of Health & Human Services\u2019 Office for Human Research Protections maintains a database of registered IRBs.

However, a physician submitting an individual patient expanded access IND using Form FDA 1571 may include a separate waiver request with the application.\n\nForm FDA 3926 and accompanying instructions may be found on FDA's website at https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/default.htm.\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Forms/default.htm.\n\nIV Procedures and Timeline for Processing Form FDA 3926\n\nIn a non-emergency situation, after receiving Form FDA 3926 (i.e., the IND), FDA will assign an individual IND number to the IND and will either allow the treatment use to proceed or put the application on clinical hold (see SS 312.42). The IND will go into effect (i.e., treatmentwith the investigational drug may proceed) after FDA notifies the physician or, if no notification occurs, 30 days after FDA receives the completed Form FDA 3926. FDA generally provides the sponsor with notification acknowledging the complete submission. If the treatment use is not allowed to proceed, FDA generally will notify the physician of this decision initially by telephone (or other rapid means of communication) and will follow up with a written letter that details the reasons for FDA's decision to place the IND on clinical hold.\n\nIf there is an emergency and authorization of the expanded access use is requested before a written submission can be made, the physician must explain how the expanded access use will meet the criteria of SSS 312.305(a) and 312.310(a), as described previously in section II. In these situations, FDA may authorize the expanded access use of the investigational drug, and treatment may begin before FDA's receipt of the written submission (including the LOA), but the physician must agree to submit an expanded access submission within 15 working days of FDA's authorization of the expanded access use (SS 312.310(d)). When treatment involves the emergency use of an investigational drug and approval from an IRB cannot be obtained before treatment, treatment may begin without prior IRB approval provided the IRB is notified of the emergency expanded access use within 5 working days of treatment (SS 56.104).\n\nSecure email between FDA and sponsors is useful for informal communications when confidential information may be included in the message (e.g., confidential patient information).

FDA generally will not copy records that include the subject's name unless there is reason to believe the records do not represent the actual cases studied or results obtained. When FDA requires subject names, FDA will treat such information as confidential. On rare occasions, FDA may be required to disclose this information to third parties, such as to a court of law (see 21 CFR 20.63(a) and 20.83(a) and (b)). Therefore, the consent process should not promise or imply absolute confidentiality by FDA.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor systems that are interoperable or fully integrated, sponsors and clinical investigators should have a detailed understanding of data flow and data visibility to allow for a clear description in the informed consent of the parties granted access to the patient's data.\n\nVI Inspection, recordkeeping, and record retention requirements\n\nFDA must have access to records and may inspect and copy all records pertaining to a clinical investigation in accordance with 21 CFR 312.62, 312.68, 812.140, and 812.145. All relevant information in the EHR pertaining to the clinical investigation must be made available to FDA for review upon request (21 CFR 312.62(b), 312.68, 812.140(a), and 812.145).20 This information should be made available and viewable to FDA as original records in the EHR or as certified copies. During an inspection, FDA may also request other paper or electronic records to support data in the eCRF (e.g., case histories, other data pertaining to the clinical investigation) (see 21 CFR 312.62(b), 312.68, 812.140(a)(3), and 812.145).

Sponsors should contact the appropriate review division to discuss such situations.\n\nGlossary\n\nDisproportionate drug metabolite -- A metabolite present only in humans or present at higher plasma concentrations in humans than in the animals used in nonclinical studies. In general, these metabolites are of interest if they account for plasma levels greater than 10 percent of total drug-related exposure, measured as area under the curve at steady state.\n\nMetabolite -- A compound derived from the parent drug through phase 1 and/or phase 2 metabolic pathways.\n\nPharmacologically active metabolite -- A metabolite that has pharmacological activity at the target receptor. The activity may be greater than, equal to, or less than that of the parent drug.\n\nAppendix A Decision Tree Flow Diagram\n\nAppendix B Case examples of drug metabolites\n\nCase 1.\n\nFrom an initial mass balance study, a metabolite represented 1 to 2 percent of total radioactive dose in rat plasma, 5 percent in dogs, and 20 percent in humans (radioactivity of this metabolite in urine and/or feces was minimal). Based on the up-to-20-fold greater exposure in humans than in animals, nonclinical safety testing was recommended.\n\nHowever, the data generated in the general toxicology studies with the parent drug in the rat and dog suggested that the maximum doses tested produced metabolite exposures that represented at least the therapeutic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose. Also, the plasma concentrations of this metabolite measured in the in vivo genetic toxicity study, embryo-fetal development toxicity study, and carcinogenicity studies conducted with the parent drug provided adequate exposure and characterization of the metabolite. Therefore, no additional testing with the metabolite was needed.\n\nCase 2.\n\nTwo primary hydroxylated metabolites, M1 and M2, were shown to undergo further oxidation to form secondary metabolites M3 and M4 using hepatic microsomes and hepatocytes from human, monkey, rat, dog, rabbit, and mouse. This metabolic profile was later confirmed by in vivo data. The results showed the following:\n\nM1 and M4 were the predominant metabolites in human, monkey, and dog microsomes, whereas rat, mouse, and rabbit formed M2 and M3\n\nM4 was formed in humans at 4-fold higher levels than the parent drug and 75 percent of the total drug-related exposure, but M4 was formed at very low levels in rodents and only represented 20 percent of the total drug-related exposure in monkey (see Table 1)\n\nSevere drug-related and novel target organ toxicities were observed with the parent drug in monkeys but not in rats\n\nM4 was pharmacological inactive at the drug target receptors\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \\hline  & Human (MRHD)* & Monkey & Rat \\ \\hline Total drug- & 10,220 & 24,240 & 15,135 \\ related exposure & & & \\ \\hline Parent Exposure & 1,800 & 15,000 & 12,500 \\ \\hline \\hline M4 Exposure & 7,700 & 5,000 & 135 \\ \\hline \\multicolumn{4}{l}{ AUC = area under the curve;} \\ \\multicolumn{4}{l}{MRHD = maximum recommended human dose} \\ \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: AUC({}_{0_24hr}) at the Maximum Dose\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe following additional studies were done with M4:\n\nSubchronic toxicity study: 3 months in rats\n\nEmbryo-fetal development study in the rats\n\nIn vitro genotoxicity testing: M4 was positive for point mutation and chromosomal aberration; the parent drug was negative\n\nBecause of the positive genotoxicity, a carcinogenicity study that included M4 was recommended\n\n4.2.3 Case 3.\n\nM2 is a phase 1 oxidative metabolite that formed up to 50 percent of total drug-related exposure in humans, 10 percent of total drug-related exposure in mice, 15 percent of total drug-related exposure in dogs, and only trace amounts in rats. In vitro metabolism studies in these species supported the in vivo findings. Based on structure activity relationship analyses, there was no reason to anticipate any difference or exaggeration in toxicity of the metabolite compared with the parent molecule. The parent drug showed no significant toxicity or identifiable target organ of toxicity in any of the animal species tested in safety assessment studies. Because disproportionate human exposure was identified, further safety testing was needed. When M2 was tested in a short-term tolerance study in the dog, it produced unexpected and significant cardiotoxicity at all doses and in all of the dogs. M2 was pharmacologically inactive at the therapeutic target receptor.\n--------------------\nContext title: Safety Testing of Drug Metabolites \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.22452916204929352", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: Evaluation of Drug Metabolites (4.3)\n\nIn some cases, metabolites that have been identified in humans have not been qualified in nonclinical studies. For these metabolites, a separate evaluation is generally not warranted for patients with advanced cancer.\n\nEvaluation of Impurities (4.4)\n\nIt is recognized that impurity standards have been based on a negligible risk, as discussed in ICH Q3A and Q3B. Exceeding the established limits for impurities identified in these ICH guidances could be appropriate for anticancer pharmaceuticals, and a justification should be provided in the marketing application. The justification could include the disease being treated and the patient population, the nature of the parent pharmaceutical (pharmacologic properties, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, etc.), duration of treatment, and the impact of impurity reduction on manufacturing. Further, the qualification assessment could include consideration of either the dose or concentration tested in nonclinical study relative to clinical levels. For genotoxic impurities, several approaches have been used to set limits based on increase in lifetime risk of cancer. Such limits are not appropriate for pharmaceuticals intended to treat patients with advanced cancer, and justifications described above should be considered to set higher limits. Impurities that are also metabolites present in animal and/or human studies are generally considered qualified.\n\nV Notes (5)\n\nFor nonrodent studies, dose groups usually consist of at least 3 animals/sex/group, with an additional 2/sex/group for recovery, if appropriate (see section II.D (2.4)). Both sexes should generally be used, or justification should be given for specific omissions.\n\nA common approach for many small molecules is to set a start dose at 1/10 the severely toxic dose in 10% of the animals (STD 10) in rodents. If the nonrodent is the most appropriate species, then 1/6 the highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) is considered an appropriate starting dose. The HNSTD is defined as the highest dose level that does not produce evidence of lethality, life-threatening toxicities or irreversible findings.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \\hline \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Clinical Schedule} & \\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Examples of Nonclinical Treatment Schedule1,2,3,4} \\ \\hline Once every 3-4 weeks & Single dose \\ \\hline Daily for 5 days every 3 weeks & Daily for 5 days \\ \\hline Daily for 5-7 days, alternating weeks (2-dose cycles) \\ weeks & Daily for 5-7 days, alternating weeks (2-dose cycles) \\ \\hline Once a week for 3 weeks, 1 week off & Once a week for 3 weeks \\ \\hline Two or three times a week & Two or three times a week for 4 weeks \\ \\hline Daily & Daily for 4 weeks \\ \\hline Weekly & Once a week for 4-5 doses \\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Examples of Treatment Schedules for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals to Support Initial Clinical Trials\n--------------------\nContext title: S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.3564799427986145", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 21: See guidances for industry ICH M3(R2) and Nonclinical Safety Evaluation of Drug or Biologic Combinations.\n\nIn general, nonclinical combination studies of an investigational DAA plus an approved DAA, IFN, or RBV are not needed. Therefore, unless data from nonclinical studies of an investigational DAA suggest a potential for serious synergistic toxicity with an approved therapeutic drug, combination toxicology studies are not anticipated.\n\nSponsors should submit carcinogenicity studies for HCV products that are expected to be used chronically. The DAVP allows the sponsor of products for serious and life-threatening indications (such as HCV) to begin carcinogenicity studies (with written agreement) before submitting an NDA and to submit the studies during the postmarketing period under section 505(o)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.22 Because of the likelihood of retreatment for patients who fail therapy (an intermittent chronic, recurrent dosing paradigm23), generally sponsors that have clinical indications for HCV DAAs with treatment durations of 24 or more weeks should conduct carcinogenicity studies.\n\nFootnote 22: See also the guidance for industry Postmarketing Studies and Clinical Trials \u2014 Implementation of Section 505(o)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPharmacokinetic Considerations a. Pharmacokine assessments Trials conducted in HCV-infected patients should include an assessment of pharmacokinetics and the relationship between drug exposure (e.g., minimum or maximum plasma concentration (C({}{\\text{min}}) or C({}{\\text{max}})), area under curve) and virologic success and toxicity in all patients.\n\nSponsors can use a combination of intensive and sparse sampling throughout development to characterize the pharmacokinetics of investigational drugs. For example, sponsors should implement an intensive sampling schedule in early phase 1 monotherapy trials. In longer term trials, however, an intensive sampling schedule might not be feasible. Alternatively, sponsors can combine sparse sampling from these trials with intensive PK data from earlier trials for analysis. Sponsors should obtain sparse PK samples at the time of key virologic assessments. These data can then be subjected to appropriate population PK analysis. Documenting dosing times and plasma sampling times is important.\n\nSponsors can use the following two broad approaches to characterize the relationship between exposure and viral kinetics or virologic success of the investigational drug, depending on the development stage and purpose of the analysis. Both approaches should account for differences in response between relevant viral subtypes and allow for exploration of relevant covariates. For these analyses, sponsors should consider virologic relapse and the development of resistance to the investigational drug when assessing differences between treatment regimens. When applicable, sponsors should use the developed exposure-response relationships to support proposed dosing and treatment duration for subsequent trials.\n\nTo aid the design of phase 2b and phase 3 trials, with respect to dose, duration, regimen choice, and population, a mechanistic approach relating drug concentrations and viral kinetics is most appropriate\n\nWhen sufficient SVR12 data are available, a simplified analysis relating the proportion of patients with virologic success and the appropriate exposure variable (e.g., C({}_{\\text{min}}), area under curve) can be used to support evidence of effectiveness and justify dose selection\n\nIn exposure-response safety analyses, sponsors should consider the toxicities that are related to the investigational drug, and infrequent but severe safety events in order to inform dose selection and dose adjustments. The appropriate exposure parameter and modeling approach depends on the investigational drug and toxicity.\n\nSpecific pharmacokinetic evaluation\n\nWe strongly encourage PK evaluation in patients with renal impairment and hepatic impairment, to inform the need for dose modifications, early in drug development, so these patients can be enrolled into phase 2 and phase 3 trials as appropriate. In general, we recommend that sponsors conduct these trials with the final regimen rather than the individual components separately.\n\nSponsors can find specific recommendations related to trial design and data analysis in the relevant FDA clinical pharmacology guidances.\n\n3. Clinical Virology Considerations a. HCV RNA assessments and data reporting\n\nFor antiviral activity and efficacy trials, sponsors should measure HCV RNA levels using a sensitive and specific quantitative assay. Clinical trial protocols should describe the HCV RNA assay or assays to be used, including a brief description of assay performance characteristics. Protocols or final reports should include the names and addresses of the laboratories conducting HCV RNA assessments (e.g., central laboratory, assay vendor).\n\nIn clinical trial protocols, final reports, and HCV RNA datasets, sponsors should use clear and consistent language to describe low-level HCV RNA results following guidelines for reporting HCV RNA levels as described in FDA-approved assay package inserts. Specifically, HCV RNA detected but less than the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) should be reported as \"(<) {LLOQ value in IU/mL} Detected,\" and HCV RNA not detected should be reported as \"Target Not Detected\" or \"HCV RNA Not Detected.\" We do not recommend using terms such as undetectable or greater than the limit of detection or less than the limit of detection (LOD) (\"(>) LOD\" or \"(<) LOD,\" respectively), even if the validated assay LOD and LLOQ are equal, because HCV RNA levels can still be detected at a certain rate depending on the actual HCV RNA concentration.\n\nA detected or not detected HCV RNA cutoff can be problematic for trial endpoints or treatment decision-making because it is inherently less reproducible compared to an HCV RNA cutoff that is within the validated quantitative range of the assay. Therefore, we encourage sponsors to use the assay LLOQ (or other quantitative HCV RNA threshold as appropriate) as the HCV RNA cutoff for treatment futility rules and trial endpoints including SVR, virologic relapse, and virologic breakthrough. See also Appendix: Study Population Terms and Treatment Response Definitions for recommended terms and definitions related to virologic response and treatment history.\n\nb. HCV genotype or subtype determination\n\nA validated assay with accuracy that is comparable to HCV genotyping or subtyping reference methods (Smith, Bukh, et al. 2014) should be used for HCV genotype or subtype screening and randomization of patients; we also recommend using an FDA-approved assay. Clinical trial protocols should describe the HCV genotype or subtype assay or assays to be used, and include a brief description of assay performance characteristics. Genotyping or subtyping assays (or historical data) based only on nucleotide sequence analysis of the 5'-noncoding region of the HCV genome should be avoided because of poor performance in distinguishing between certain HCV genotypes and subtypes 1a and 1b (Chevaliez, Bouvier-Alias, et al. 2009). Clinical assays used for HCV genotype or subtype determination may not resolve HCV subtypes other than 1a and 1b. Therefore, in patients with nongenotype 1 HCV infections, sponsors should perform retrospective analyses to identify HCV subtypes based on reference methods (Smith, Bukh, et al., 2014) or phylogenetic analyses of the drug target sequence or sequences.\n\nResistance analyses\n\nFor efficacy trials, sponsors should perform treatment-emergent resistance testing for patients who do not achieve SVR. Treatment-emergent genotypic and phenotypic resistance analyses should focus on samples collected while patients are on the investigational drug; if on-treatment HCV RNA levels are not adequate for analysis, then sponsors should analyze the first available follow-up sample with adequate HCV RNA. Any changes, including mixtures, in the amino acid coding sequence of the targeted genome region present in on-treatment or follow-up samples, but not in the baseline sample, should be reported as having developed during therapy. Enrichment of substitutions from mixtures at baseline should also be reported; how these data are considered in treatment-emergent resistance analyses may depend on clinical trial design and nucleotide sequencing methods. Sponsors should conduct similar treatment-emergent resistance analyses for all patients in early-phase monotherapy trials.\n\nSponsors should analyze pretreatment samples from clinical trial patients to identify HCV genetic polymorphisms in DAA target genes, and sponsors should also evaluate the effect of HCV polymorphisms on treatment response. These analyses should consider both the investigational DAA or DAAs and any background DAA or DAAs evaluated in combination. Sponsors should determine the prevalence of HCV populations carrying detectable resistance-associated polymorphisms, both in the full trial population and in the U.S. trial patient population specifically.\n\nSponsors should follow patients who have detectable resistance-associated substitutions at treatment cessation or follow-up for an extended period (at least 1 year after treatment cessation or until the initiation of alternative HCV therapies) to assess the persistence of resistance-associated substitutions. The potential persistence of resistance-associated substitutions should be characterized for patients enrolled in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials so that preliminary long-term follow-up data are obtained by the time of completion of phase 3 trials. Genotyping methodology should be capable of assessing the quantity of resistant viruses during the outgrowth of a wild-type virus.\n--------------------\nContext title: Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection- Developing Direct-Acting Antiviral Drugs for Treatment Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.3951249122619629", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: [MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\n2 Metabolites\n\n[5]June 2011 Is the metabolite exposure data provided from the single dose radiolabeled human Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) study sufficient for comparison to the exposures observed in animal toxicity studies without evaluation of steady state levels which can not be done with radiolabel clinically? An evaluation of whether a metabolite is 10% of the total drug-related exposure can be based on single dose data in humans. It is not generally feasible to measure AUC of all metabolites by non-radiolabeled methods, particularly for those drugs that have many metabolites. In such cases, a single dose radiolabeled study provides a reasonable estimate of human total drug-related exposure and is an adequate basis for calculating whether a metabolite exceeds 10%. (A metabolite can not be more than 10% of the total drug-related material if non-radiolabeled methods indicate that a metabolite is less than 10% of the parent or of any drug-related component(s). For example, P+M+M+M+...M= total; if M is less than 10% of P or M is less than 10% of any M then M is less than 10% of the total. In this case, no further assessment of that metabolite is warranted. If during development exposure data normally collected from multiple dose human studies indicate that steady state levels of a metabolite exceed 10%, then additional nonclinical evaluation of the metabolite should be considered. Generally, exposure data from nonclinical studies and single dose clinical studies can be compared to determine if further metabolite toxicity characterization is warranted. For those metabolites that have been determined to exceed 10% of drug-related material in humans only after repeated dosing, steady state levels (clinical and nonclinical) should be used to assess the adequacy of the exposure margins.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]\n\nLast Update : 5 March 2012\n\nM3(R2) Q&As (R2)\n\nDate of\n\nApproval\n\nmultiples.)\n\nA toxicity study that includes a terminal non-dosing period is generally not warranted when the toxicity:\n\ncan be readily monitored in humans at an early stage before the toxicity becomes severe; or\n\nis known to be irrelevant to humans (e.g., rodent Harderian gland toxicity); or\n\nis only observed at high exposures not considered clinically relevant (see 2 above for exception); or\n\nis similar to that induced by related agents, and the toxicity based on prior clinical experience with these related agents is considered a manageable risk.\n\nIf a study of reversibility is called for, it should be available to support clinical studies of a duration similar to those at which the adverse effects were seen nonclinically. However, a reversibility study is generally not warranted to support clinical trials of a duration equivalent to that at which the adverse effect was not observed nonclinically.\n--------------------\nContext title: M3_R2_Q&As_R2_Q&As_0\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.7480931282043457", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: reflected by this document is meant to be an extension and update\n\nof the two references above, and the drug developer should use this\n\ndocument, and direct guidance from DAVDP reviews, as specific\n\nguidance for developing drugs to be reviewed by DAVDP.\n\nAll nonclinical toxicity studies conducted for the purpose of\n\nsupporting INDs or NDAs must be conducted in accordance with Good\n\nLaboratory Practices (21 CFR 58) and use drug substance prepared\n\naccording to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (21 CFR 210\n\nand 211). The drug used in nonclinical studies should preferably\n\nbe in the same form (the final formulation of the drug product) as\n\nthat intended for human use, especially in those circumstances in\n\nwhich the effect of the final formulation of the drug is or could\n\nbe a major determinant of the drug's toxicity.\n\nb. Pharmacokinetics\n\nThe absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME)\n\nof a drug should be adequately studied as part of its preclinical development. In general, the sponsor should develop analytical methodology for quantifying systemic and tissue levels of the drug and its primary metabolites. The drug's ADME profile should be a primary determinant of the design and interpretation of animal toxicity studies for that drug, including the choice of test spc_dies, route of administration, dose-range and schedule of administration, histopathology and clinical pathology measurements, and the need to include additional observations in the study design. As discussed below, ADME data are important for justifying the route of administration used in animal toxicity studies when the investigator plans to use a route of administration other than that proposed for human use.\n\nFor topically applied drugs, the systemic absorption of the drug product should be determined in animals using models representative of the clinical use of the topical drug preparation.\n\nc. Single-dose acute toxicity studies\n\nTo support first-time use of a new drug in humans the single-dose acute toxicity of the drug should be determined in at least three animal species, at least one being a non-rodent. Acute toxicity studies are intended to provide information about the toxicity produced by a single administration of the drug. As discussed above, these are not classical LD-50 or acute lethality tests.\n\nThe drug should be administered by the same route of administration as that intended for use in humans, in addition to IV administration if that is not the intended route of administration.\n\nd. Repeat-dose Toxicity Studies\n\nTo support clinical studies in which a new drug will be given in repeated administrations for up to one month, the drug's toxicity should be evaluated in repeat-dose toxicity studies of at least 4-weeks duration. Two animal species should be tested, at least one being a non-rodent. The dose-range used in these studies should be chosen to enable each toxicity study to identify the highest non-toxic dose as well as allow a thorough qualitative and quantitative characterization of the drug's toxicity. Usually, a minimum of three doses are used for these studies, with the highest dose producing overt toxicity and the lowest showing no toxicity. The middle dose should be chosen to best facilitate calculating the dose-response relationship of the drug's toxicity.\n\nThe route of administration used for repeat-dose animal toxicity studies should be the same as that proposed for human use of the drug. If the human route of administration can not be duplicated in the animal, then alternative routes can be proposed to DAVDP. As discussed above, supporting ADME data for the test species are often necessary for justifying that the ADME profile resulting from the alternative route of administration will be adequate for the purposes of studying the drug's toxicity.\n\nAnother important point to consider is the schedule of administration of the drug. If the drug is expected to be administered to humans in multiple daily doses, then the dosing schedule in animal toxicity studies should reflect this. The schedule dependency of a drug's toxicity should be a primary consideration in the design of toxicity studies since the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of a drug may change significantly according to its schedule of administration during repeated dosing. If single daily dosing in animals does not allow an adequate characterization of the drug's toxicity to be made, then such studies might not support clinical studies in which the drug is to be used in multiple daily administrations since the toxicity study did not adequately describe the potential toxicity of the drug under conditions similar to its proposed clinical use. Additionally, an accurate description of the drugs's schedule-specific toxicity greatly facilitates choosing the starting dose and schedule for clinical trials.\n\nTo support repeated administration of the drug to humans for longer than one month, the sponsor should evaluate the drug's toxicity in repeat-dose animal toxicity studies of at least 3 months duration in at least two animal species, with at least one being a non-rodent. The same general considerations discussed above for the 4-week repeat-dose toxicity studies also apply to 3-month repeat-dose toxicity studies.\n\nFor topical drug preparations, toxicity studies specifically addressing the drug's potential to produce dermal irritation and sensitization should be conducted. Additionally, because of the potential for topically applied drugs to get into the eyes, ophthalmic irritation studies should also be conducted. The overall design of dermal toxicity studies should reflect the manner in which the drug will be used in humans.\n\ne. Immunotoxicology\n\nAn evaluation of the drug's effects on the immune system may be necessary as part of the preclinical development of the new drug. To evaluate the immunotoxicity of a drug, a tiered approach such as that developed by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) can be used (Luster et al., Fundamental and Applied Toxicology 10:2-19 1988). The NTP's tiered approach for evaluating immunotoxicity uses a battery of assays in which the first-tier assays constitute a preliminary screen for detecting functional and pathologic effects on the major components of the mammalian immune system.\n\nIt is expected that for most new drugs only the first-tier studies would be needed prior to Phase I studies.\n\nf. Genetic Toxicology\n\nThe genetic toxicity of the drug should be evaluated in a battery of genetic toxicity tests. Because of ongoing developments in the field of genetic toxicology, drug developers are urged to contact DAVDP reviewers for specific guidance concerning genetic toxicity studies for a particular drug so that the current state of scientific knowledge can be applied. In general, however, it is anticipated that no single test will be sufficient to adequately characterize the potential genetic toxicity or carcinogenicity of a new drug. The drug should be tested in a battery of short-term assays that are relevant to the various mechanisms by which genetic damage can occur.\n\ng. General Pharmacology\n\nAn evaluation of the drug's general pharmacological or physiological activity should be performed. This evaluation can be accomplished using established in vitro and in vivo assays that screen for the major types of pharmacological or physiological responses that can be produced as side effects of drugs, such as effects on the central nervous system, autonomic nervous system and cardiovascular system. Because the general pharmacology studies measure drug-induced effects which may not be detected in the other toxicity studies, they are needed to complete the overall profile of the drug's potential toxicity and are intended to complement the animal toxicity studies described above.\n\nHUMAN CLINICAL DATA\n\nIn certain instances, data from prior human use of the drug may exist. Whenever possible these data should be submitted for review by FDA by inclusion in the IND or NDA. Depending on the scientific quality of the data and its relevance to the proposed clinical use, DAVDP may modify the nonclinical toxicology requirements on a case by case basis.\n--------------------\nContext title: Reference Guide for the Nonclinical Toxicity Studies of Antivial Drugs Indicated for the Treatment of N:A Non-Life Threatening Disease Evaluation of Drug Toxicity Prior to Phase I Clinical Studies \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.4676778316497803", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals  Does the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) apply to a prodrug (i.e., when a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity)?\n--------------------\nContext: No. The ICH Q11 general principles for selection of starting materials do not include a recommendation that all steps involving mutagenic reagents or impurities should be included in the process description in section 3.2.S.2.2. Similarly, the general principles do not include a recommendation that all steps that establish regio- or stereochemical configurations (which can therefore result in regio- or stereoisomerism) should be included in section 3.2.S.2.2. However, it is expected that the other ICH Q11 general principles on impurities (see Q&As 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9) and inclusion of enough of the manufacturing process (see Q&A 5.11) be applied when deciding whether steps that involve mutagenic reagents, impurities, or establish regio- or stereochemical configurations, need to be included. As an example, a mutagenic compound could be introduced prior to the starting material, or be the starting material itself, provided the ICH Q11 general principles are addressed.\n\nQ11. ICH Q11 states that \"enough of the drug substance manufacturing process should be described in the application...\" What considerations should an applicant apply in the selection of the proposed starting materials to assure that enough of the drug substance manufacturing process will be described in the process description in section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application? (5.11)\n\nIn deciding whether enough of the drug substance manufacturing process is described in section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application, the following considerations should be applied.\n\nThe applicant should first evaluate which chemical transformation steps in the manufacturing process impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. These steps should normally be included in section 3.2.S.2.2 (see Q&As 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9).\n\nNext, the applicant should examine the steps immediately upstream of those steps that impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. These steps should normally also be included in section 3.2.S.2.2 if:\n\nThey need to be carefully controlled (e.g., within narrow parameter ranges) to prevent generation of impurities that would otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance.\n\nThey include a unit operation that has been added to the manufacturing process to control specific impurities that would otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. While starting material manufacturing processes typically contain purification operations, addition of purification steps prior to a proposed starting material in order to avoid defining an earlier, upstream compound as the starting material would not be considered appropriate.\n\nAfter these considerations, if the evaluation would result in only a small number of chemical transformation steps, then it is generally appropriate to include one or more additional chemical transformation steps in section 3.2.S.2.2. This is to ensure that enough steps are conducted under GMP to appropriately mitigate risks associated with contamination and future changes to the synthetic route or supplier of the starting material. The following paragraphs provide further clarification on this risk mitigation and should be considered together.\n\nAlthough ICH Q11 does not specify how many steps should be performed under GMP, ICH Q11 recommends the inclusion of \"multiple chemical transformation steps\" in section 3.2.S.2.2 in order to reduce the risk of contamination and support the effective implementation of the control strategy throughout the product lifecycle. When there would be a small number of steps, there is an increased risk of contamination that needs to be addressed by the applicant in their starting material justification, and will often be best mitigated by including one or more additional steps in section 3.2.S.2.\n\nPotential risks from future changes to the starting material synthesis should also be considered (see Q&A 5.16). There is an increased risk that impurities generated as a result of a change to the manufacturing process upstream of the starting material may not be detected or purged appropriately if the starting material is only a small number of steps from the drug substance. In order to determine how many additional steps to include, the applicant may also consider other approaches to risk mitigation; for example, inclusion of analytical methodologies in the specification of the proposed starting material that are designed to detect a wide range of possible impurities based on different physical and chemical separation and detection principles. Appropriate acceptance criteria for unspecified impurities should be included in the specification.\n\nThe applicant should include in their justification of the proposed starting material a comprehensive description as to what factors were considered in deciding whether enough of the drug substance manufacturing process is provided in section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application to ensure that risks are appropriately mitigated.\n\nWhat considerations are important for a starting material specification? (5.12)\n\nApplicants should provide and justify a specification (which includes a list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and appropriate acceptance criteria) for all proposed starting materials as part of the drug substance control strategy.\n\nThe specification of a starting material should include tests for identity and purity (e.g., controls on impurities) and, where applicable, could include acceptance criteria for assay, specified, unspecified and total impurities, residual solvents, reagents, elemental impurities and mutagenic impurities. The analytical procedures used should be suitably validated. The tests and acceptance criteria should be based on process knowledge and the drug substance control strategy. The justification of the specification should include an evaluation of the risks and the ability of the subsequent steps to adequately control and/or purge impurities.\n\nFor starting materials that are not commercially available chemicals, what information should be provided on the synthetic route? (5.13)\n\nInformation on how the proposed starting material is made (e.g., a flow chart of the starting material manufacturing process, showing all reagents, catalysts and solvents used) should be provided to help justify the controls applied to the starting material. Information about the actual and potential impurities in the proposed starting material should be provided.\n\nWhat information should be included in the application about a starting material that is a commercially available chemical? (5.14)\n\nAn applicant generally need not justify the use of a commercially available chemical as a starting material (see ICH Q11 section 5.2.1). However, the applicant should provide basic information on the starting material (chemical name, chemical formula, and molecular weight), information on the impurity profile of the starting material, and how the control strategy for the drug substance manufacturing process justifies the starting material specification.\n\nIf the drug substance manufacturer needs to perform additional purification steps to ensure the consistent quality of a commercially available starting material, ICH Q11 also recommends that these steps should be included in section 3.2.S.2.2 as part of the drug substance manufacturing process.\n\nThe applicant should set appropriate controls and should justify the proposed specification for the actual and potential impurities that are reasonably expected in a proposed starting material, based on the scientific knowledge and available information.\n\nICH M7 states: \"For starting materials that are introduced late in the synthesis of the drug substance (and where the synthetic route of the starting material is known) the final steps of the starting material synthesis should be evaluated for potential mutagenic impurities.\" In the case where the starting material is a commercially available chemical, then this evaluation would be used to determine the appropriate control strategy.\n\nFor all starting materials, applicants should set appropriate controls and be able to justify the proposed specifications.\n\nCan the Life cycle Management section of ICH Q11 (section 9) apply to starting materials? (5.15)\n\nYes. In addition to what is submitted in the application, changes upstream of the defined starting material should be managed under the applicant's Pharmaceutical Quality System (PQS), which should address residual risks to the drug substance quality.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe Lifecycle Management section of ICH Q11 reinforces management's responsibility described in Pharmaceutical Quality Systems (ICH Q10), which is applicable to starting material lifecycle management. ICH Q10 section 2.7 (Management of Outsourced Activities and Purchased Materials) recommends that\n\nThe pharmaceutical quality system, including the management responsibilities described in this section, extends to the control and review of any outsourced activities and quality of purchased materials. The pharmaceutical company is ultimately responsible to ensure processes are in place to assure the control of outsourced activities and quality of purchased materials.\n\nICH Q7 sections 7 (Materials Management) and 13 (Change Control), ICH Q7 Q&A document sections 7 and 13, as well as ICH Q10 section 2.7 (Management of Outsourced Activities and Purchased Materials) provide guidance that can be applied to the management of starting materials and starting material suppliers.\n\nICH Q9 and its Annexes provide guidance on the use of principles for quality risk management which can be applied to changes related to the starting materials (e.g., new starting material suppliers, manufacturing processes, or specifications).\n\nQ16. Does ICH Q11 include specific guidance for post-approval changes to steps upstream of the starting material (e.g., changes in synthetic route, reagents, solvents, starting material supplier)?

In making a decision to allow enrollment of a subject who does not understand English into a research protocol without waiting for a written translation of the long form, the investigator (and whenever feasible the IRB chairperson or designee) should consider whether the consent process, under this circumstance, will provide the subject with sufficient opportunity to understand the information being presented.

As a prerequisite to using this procedure, the investigator must have available a short form written in a language understandable to the prospective subject or LAR and previously approved by the IRB (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.27(a)). To meet this prerequisite, the IRB mustrequire that the sponsor or investigator arrange for translation of a generic short form into a language understandable by the prospective subject or LAR, and the IRB must have approved the prospective use of such short forms for enrollment of subjects who do not understand English, as needed. Additionally, the IRB must approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the LAR (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). The IRB-approved English long form often serves as this written summary. The translator should be fluent in both English and in the subject's language.

This presentation may be an oral translation of the IRB-approved English version of the long form. The oral presentation must be in language understandable to the subject (21 CFR 50.20). The investigator, with the assistance of an interpreter if needed, answers any questions from the prospective subject. There must be a witness to the oral presentation who must not be the person obtaining informed consent (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). Furthermore, FDA strongly recommends the witness be fluent in the language of the oral presentation. The witness must, at a minimum, have sufficient proficiency in the language of the oral presentation to be able to attest to the information that was to the presented orally to the prospective participant (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2).) In addition, if possible, the witness should not be related to the subject.\n\nAt the time informed consent is sought, the subject is given the IRB-approved translated short form and a copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form, which serves as the written summary.\n\nThe short form is signed and dated by the subject or LAR.\n\nThe witness signs both the short form and the copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form. (Note that when an interpreter assists the person obtaining consent, the interpreter may serve as the witness, but is not required to do so.)\n\nThe person actually obtaining consent signs the copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form.\n\nStep 3 - Take Additional Actions Following Subject Enrollment\n\nAfter the subject has been enrolled in the research, the investigator takes the following additional actions:1. If a subject was enrolled in the research using an untranslated long form to serve as the written summary, and if the investigator did not consult with the IRB chairperson (or designee) prior to enrollment of the subject who does not understand English, the investigator should promptly notify the IRB chairperson (or designee) that such a subject was enrolled.\n2. The investigator must obtain a translated copy of the IRB-approved English version of the long form that served as the written summary, which should be done promptly. The investigator promptly submits it to the IRB for review and approval. Once the translated long form/written summary is approved by the IRB, the investigator must provide it to the subject or LAR and should do so as soon as possible. FDA considers this step essential to the requirement that informed consent be documented by the use of a written consent document and that the subject be provided a copy (21 CFR 50.27). Many of the clinical investigations regulated by FDA involve ongoing interventions and may involve long-term follow-up. For this reason, translation of the long form is critically important as a means of providing subjects or their LAR an ongoing source of information understandable to them.\n\nAdditionally, as noted above in Frequently Asked Question#3, FDA recommends that whenever subjects who do not understand English are involved in research, appropriate interpreter services be made available throughout the course of the research.\n\nix.1.6 What should be considered when enrolling subjects with low literacy and numeracy?\n\nAlthough a competent person who does not read and write well can give informed consent and enroll in a clinical investigation, the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB should consider whether any modifications to the informed consent process are necessary to ensure that the informed consent process is understandable.\n\nFor subjects with apparent low literacy and/or low numeracy, oral presentation of the information contained in the consent document is especially important. When the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject or the subject's LAR, the IRB may want to consider approving the use of a short form and written summary (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)), which includes a witness to the oral presentation of the informed consent elements who also signs the consent document (see _section_III.E.4.b, \"Short Form\"). It should be noted that, even if the information is presented orally, the subject or the subject's LAR is required to sign the consent form (whether the long form or short form is used) unless the IRB has waived documentation of informed consent under 21 CFR 56.109(c).\n\nSubjects who cannot write can indicate their consent by \"making their mark\" on the consent document, in lieu of signing and dating the consent form when consistent with applicable law. In these situations, a note should be included in subject case histories required to be maintained under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21CFR 812.140(a)(3) indicating the reason for the lack of a signature and date as required by 21 CFR 50.27(a). The date consent was obtained should be recorded in this note.\n\nvi.2.7 What should be considered when enrolling subjects with physical or sensory disabilities?\n\nA person with physical or sensory disabilities (for example, physically unable to talk or write or has hearing or visual loss) can enroll in a clinical investigation if competent and able to signal consent consistent with applicable law. Enrolling such subjects into a clinical investigation does not require a LAR to be involved with the informed consent process or to sign the consent document unless required by State or local law. The records relating to the clinical investigation must include documentation of the informed consent process (21 CFR 50.27) unless excepted under 21 CFR 56.109(c). FDA recommends including in subject case histories required under 21 CFR 312.62(b) or 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3) a description of the specific means by which the prospective subject communicated agreement to take part in the clinical investigation and how questions were answered. FDA recommends that investigators provide reasonable modifications and auxiliary aids and services when necessary to meet the specific needs of the study population.80 For example, for subjects with vision disabilities, the investigator could use an audio recording of the contents of the consent form or a consent form with enlarged font, depending on the degree of impairment.\n\nFootnote 80: FDA strongly encourages stakeholders to ensure that informed consent documents are accessible to individuals with disabilities. To the extent an organization receives Federal financial assistance from HHS, the organization must comply with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This guidance provides information to assist IRBs, clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA\u2019s informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. It does not provide guidance on how to comply with any regulatory obligations stemming from a source outside of the statutes FDA administers and FDA\u2019s regulations.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.367149353027344", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: As noted in the previous answer, on April 24, 2001, FDA issued an interim final rule, Additional Protections for Children, as subpart D to 21 CFR Part 50. Informed consent of children who participate in clinical trials is addressed in subpart D. This interim final rule and its preamble are available at Additional Protections for Children (/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/additional-protections-children).\n\n49 Who should be listed on the consent as the contact to answer questions?\n\n21 CFR 50.25(a)(7) requires contacts for questions about the research, the research subject's rights and in case of a research-related injury. It does not specify whom to contact. The same person may be listed for all three. However, FDA and most IRBs believe it is better to name a knowledgeable person other than the clinical investigator as the contact for study subject rights. Having the clinical investigator as the only contact may inhibit subjects from reporting concerns and/or possible abuses.\n\nMay the \"compensation\" for participation in a trial offered by a sponsor include a coupon good for a discount on the purchase price of the product once it has been approved for marketing?No. This presumes, and inappropriately conveys to the subjects, a certainty of favorable outcome of the study and prompt approval for marketing. Also, if the product is approved, the coupon may financially coerce the subject to insist on that product, even though it may not be the most appropriate medically.\n\n51. Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n\nThe signed informed consent document is the written record of the consent interview. Study subjects are given a copy of the consent to be used as a reference document to reinforce their understanding of the study and, if desired, to consult with their physician or family members about the study.\n\nIn order to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, the consent document must be in language understandable to the subject. When the prospective subject is fluent in English, and the consent interview is conducted in English, the consent document should be in English. However, when the study subject population includes non-English speaking people so that the clinical investigator or the IRB anticipates that the consent interviews are likely to be conducted in a language other than English, the IRB should assure that a translated consent form is prepared and that the translation is accurate.\n\nA consultant may be utilized to assure that the translation is correct. A copy of the translated consent document must be given to each appropriate subject. While a translator may be used to facilitate conversation with the subject, routine ad hoc translation of the consent document may not be substituted for a written translation.\n\nAlso see FDA Information Sheets: \"A Guide to Informed Consent Documents\" and \"Informed Consent and the Clinical Investigator\"\n\n52. Is it acceptable for the consent document to say specimens are \"donated\"?\n\nWhat about a separate donation statement? It would be acceptable for the consent to say that specimens are to be used for research purposes. However, the word \"donation\" implies abandonment of rights to the \"property\". 21 CFR 50.20 prohibits requiring subjects to waive or appear to waive any rights as a condition for participation in the study. Whether or not the wording is contained in \"the actual consent form\" is immaterial. All study-related documents must be submitted to the IRB for review. Any separate \"donation\" agreement is regarded to be part of the informed consent documentation, and must be in compliance with 21 CFR 50.\n\n53. Do informed consent forms have to justify fees charged to study subjects?\n\nFDA does not require the consent to contain justification of charges.\n\nVII. Clinical Investigations\n\n54. Does a physician, in private practice, conducting research with an FDA regulated product, need to obtain IRB approval?Yes. The FDA regulations require IRB review and approval of regulated clinical investigations, whether or not the study involves institutionalized subjects. FDA has included non-institutionalized subjects because it is inappropriate to apply a double standard for the protection of research subjects based on whether or not they are institutionalized. An investigator should be able to obtain IRB review by submitting the research proposal to a community hospital, a university/medical school, an independent IRB, a local or state government health agency or other organizations.\n\n55. Does a clinical investigation involving a marketed product require IRB review and approval?\n\nYes, if the investigation is governed by FDA regulations [see 21 CFR 56.101, 56.102(c), 312.2(b)(1), 361.1, 601.2, and 812.2]. Also, see the information sheet entitled \"Off-label' and Investigational Use of Marketed Drugs and Biologics\" for more information.\n\nVIII. General Questions\n\nWhich FDA office may an IRB contact to determine whether an investigational new drug application (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE) is required for a study of a test article?\n\nFor drugs, the IRB may contact the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Office of Communications, Division of Drug Information at (301) 796-3400.\n\nFor biological products, contact the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Office of Communication, Outreach and Development, at (800)-835-4709 or (301) 827-1800.\n\nFor medical devices, contact the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) Staff, Office of Device Evaluation, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), at (301) 796-5640.\n\n57. What happens during an FDA inspection of an IRB?\n\nFDA field investigators interview institutional officials and examine the IRB records to determine compliance with FDA regulations. Also, see the information sheet entitled \"FDA Institutional Review Board Inspections\" for a complete description of the inspection process.\n\n58. Does a treatment IND/IDE [21 CFR 312.34/812.36 ] require prior IRB approval?\n\nTest articles given to human subjects under a treatment IND/IDE require prior IRB approval, with two exceptions. If a life-threatening emergency exists, as defined by 21 CFR 56.102(d), the procedures described in 56.104(c) (\"Exemptions from IRB Requirement\") may be followed. In addition, FDA may grant the sponsor or sponsor/investigator a waiver of the IRB requirement in accord with 21 CFR 56.105. An IRB may still choose to review a study even if FDA has granted a waiver. For further information see the information sheets entitled\"Emergency Use of an Investigational Drug or Biologic,\" \"Emergency Use of Unapproved Medical Devices,\" \"Waiver of IRB Requirements\" and \"Treatment use of Investigational Drugs and Biologics.\"\n\n59. How have the FDA policies on enrollment of special populations changed?\n\nOn July 22, 1993, the FDA published the Guideline for the Study and Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Drugs, in the Federal Register [58 FR 39406]. The guideline was developed to ensure that the drug development process provides adequate information about the effects of drugs and biological products in women. For further information, see the information sheet entitled \"Evaluation of Gender Differences in Clinical Investigations.\"\n\nOn December 13, 1994, FDA published a final rule on the labeling of prescription drugs for pediatric populations [59 FR 64240]. The rule [21 CFR 201.57] encourages sponsors to include pediatric subjects in clinical trials so that more complete information about the use of drugs and biological products in the pediatric population can be developed.\n\n6o. What is a medical device?\n\nA medical device is any instrument, apparatus, or other similar or related article, including component, part, or accessory, which is: (a) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopeia, or any supplement to them; (b) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in humans or other animals; or (c) intended to affect the structure or any function of the human body or in animals; and does not achieve any of its principal intended purposes through chemical action within or on the human body or in animals and is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its principal intended purposes.\n\nApproximately 1,700 types of medical devices are regulated by FDA. The range of devices is broad and diverse, including bandages, thermometers, ECG electrodes, IUDs, cardiac pacemakers, and hemodialysis machines. For further information, see the information sheets entitled \"Medical Devices,\" \"Frequently Asked Questions about IRB Review of Medical Devices\" and \"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies.\"\n\n61. Are in vitro diagnostic products medical devices?\n\nYes. The definition of a \"device\" includes in vitro diagnostic products - devices that aid in the diagnosis of disease or medical/physiological conditions (e.g., pregnancy) by using human or animal components to cause chemical reactions, fermentation, and the like. A few diagnostic products are intended for use in controlling other regulated products (such as those used to screen the blood supply for transfusion-transmitted diseases) and are regulated as biological products.\n\n62. What are the IRB's general obligations towards intraocular lens (IOL) clinical investigations?An IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of all IOL clinical investigations. Each individual IOL style is subject to a separate review by the IRB. This does not, however, preclude the IRB from using prior experience with other IOL investigations in considering the comparative merits of a new lens style. All IOL studies are also subject to FDA approval.\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.946074485778809", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: How do you obtain informed consent from someone who speaks and understands English but cannot read? Illiterate persons who understand English may have the consent read to them and \"make their mark,\" if appropriate under applicable state law. The 21 CFR 50.27(b)(2) requirements for signature of a witness to the consent process and signature of the person conducting consent interview must be followed, if a \"short form\" is used. Clinical investigators should be cautious when enrolling subjects who may not truly understand what they have agreed to do.\n\nThe IRB should consider illiterate persons as likely to be vulnerable to coercion and undue influence and should determine that appropriate additional safeguards are in place when enrollment of such persons is anticipated, see 21 CFR 56.111(b).\n\n41. Must a witness observe the entire consent interview or only the signature of the subject?\n\nFDA does not require the signature of a witness when the subject reads and is capable of understanding the consent document, as outlined in 21 CFR 50.27(b)(1). The intended purpose is to have the witness present during the entire consent interview and to attest to the accuracy of the presentation and the apparent understanding of the subject. If the intent of the regulation were only to attest to the validity of the subject's signature, witnessing would also be required when the subject reads the consent.\n\n42. Should the sponsor prepare a model informed consent document?\n\nAlthough not required by the IND regulations, the sponsor provides a service to the clinical investigator and the IRB when it prepares suggested study-specific wording for the scientific and technical content of the consent document. However, the IRB has the responsibility and authority to determine the adequacy and appropriateness of all of the wording in the consent, see 21 CFR 56.109(a), 111(a)(4) and 111(a)(5). If an IRB insists on wording the sponsor cannot accept, the sponsor may decide not to conduct the study at that site. For medical device studies that are conducted under an IDE, copies of all forms and informational materials to be provided to subjects to obtain informed consent must be submitted to FDA as part of the IDE, see 21 CFR 812.25(g).\n\n43. Is the sponsor required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to make sure all FDA requirements are met?\n\nFor investigational devices, the informed consent is a required part of the IDE submission. It is, therefore, approved by FDA as part of the IDE application. When an IRB makes substantive changes in the document, FDA reapproval is required and the sponsor is necessarily involved in this process.\n\nFDA regulations for other products do not specifically require the sponsor to review IRB approved consent documents. However, most sponsors do conduct such reviews to assure the wording is acceptable to the sponsor.\n\n44. Are there alternatives to obtaining informed consent from a subject?\n\nThe regulations generally require that the investigator obtain informed consent from subjects. Investigators also may obtain informed consent from a legally authorized representative of the subject. FDA recognizes that a durable power of attorney might suffice as identifying a legally authorized representative under some state and local laws. For example, a subject might have designated an individual to provide consent with regard to health care decisions through a durable power of attorney and have specified that the individual also has the power to make decisions on entry into research. FDA defers to state and local laws regarding who is a legally authorized representative. Therefore, the IRB should assure that the consent procedures comply with state and local laws, including assurance that the law applies to obtaining informed consent for subjects participating in research as well as for patients who require health care decisions.\"\n\nAlternatives 1 and 2 are provided for in the regulations and are appropriate. Alternative 3 allows a designated individual to provide consent for a patient with regard to health care decisions and is appropriate when it specifically includes entry into research. FDA defers to state and local laws regarding substituted consent. Therefore, the IRB must assure itself that the substituted consent procedures comply with state and local law, including assurance the law applies to obtaining informed consent for subjects participating in research as well as for patients who require health care decisions.\n\n45 When should study subjects be informed of changes in the study?\n\nProtocol amendments must receive IRB review and approval before they are implemented, unless an immediate change is necessary to eliminate an apparent hazard to the subjects (21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)). Those subjects who are presently enrolled and actively participating in the study should be informed of the change if it might relate to the subjects' willingness to continue their participation in the study (21 CFR 50.25(b)(5)). FDA does not require reconsenting of subjects that have completed their active participation in the study, or of subjects who are still actively participating when the change will not affect their participation, for example when the change will be implemented only for subsequently enrolled subjects.\n\n61 Informed Consent Document Content\n\nMay an IRB require that the sponsor of the study and/or the clinical investigator be identified on the study's consent document?\n\nYes. The FDA requirements for informed consent are the minimum basic elements of informed consent that must be presented to a research subject [21 CFR 50.25]. An IRB may require inclusion of any additional information which it considers important to a subject's decision to participate in a research study [21 CFR 56.109(b)].\n\n63 Does FDA require the informed consent document to contain a space for assent by children?\n\nNo, however, many investigators and IRBs consider it standard practice to obtain the agreement of older children who can understand the circumstances before enrolling them in research. While the FDA regulations do not specifically address enrollment of children (other than to include them as a class of vulnerable subjects), the basic requirement of 21 CFR 50.20 applies, i.e., the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative must be obtained before enrollment. Parents, legal guardians and/or others may have the ability to give permission to enroll children in research, depending on applicable state and local law of the jurisdiction in which the research is conducted. (Note: permission to enroll in research is not the same as permission to provide medical treatment.) IRBs generally require investigators to obtain the permission of one or both of the parents or guardian (as appropriate) and the assent of children who possess the intellectual and emotional ability to comprehend the concepts involved. Some IRBs require two documents, a fully detailed explanation for parents and older children to read and sign, and a shorter, simpler one for younger children. [For research supported by DHHS, the additional protections at 45 CFR 46 Subpart D are also required. The Subpart D regulations provide appropriate guidance for all other pediatric studies.] On April 24, 2001, FDA issued an interim final rule, Additional Protections for Children, as subpart D to 21 CFR Part 50. Assent by children is addressed in subpart D. This interim final rule and its preamble are available at Additional Protections for Children (/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/additional-protections-children).\n\n48 Does FDA require the signature of children on informed consent documents?\n\nAs indicated above, researchers may seek assent of children of various ages. Older children may be well acquainted with signing documents through prior experience with testing, licensing and/or other procedures normally encountered in their lives. Signing a form to give their assent for research would not be perceived as unusual and would be reasonable. Younger children, however, may never have had the experience of signing a document. For these children requiring a signature may not be appropriate, and some other technique to verify assent could be used. For example, a third party may verify, by signature, that the assent of the child was obtained.\n\nAs noted in the previous answer, on April 24, 2001, FDA issued an interim final rule, Additional Protections for Children, as subpart D to 21 CFR Part 50. Informed consent of children who participate in clinical trials is addressed in subpart D. This interim final rule and its preamble are available at Additional Protections for Children (/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/additional-protections-children).\n\n49 Who should be listed on the consent as the contact to answer questions?\n\n21 CFR 50.25(a)(7) requires contacts for questions about the research, the research subject's rights and in case of a research-related injury. It does not specify whom to contact. The same person may be listed for all three. However, FDA and most IRBs believe it is better to name a knowledgeable person other than the clinical investigator as the contact for study subject rights. Having the clinical investigator as the only contact may inhibit subjects from reporting concerns and/or possible abuses.\n\nMay the \"compensation\" for participation in a trial offered by a sponsor include a coupon good for a discount on the purchase price of the product once it has been approved for marketing?No. This presumes, and inappropriately conveys to the subjects, a certainty of favorable outcome of the study and prompt approval for marketing. Also, if the product is approved, the coupon may financially coerce the subject to insist on that product, even though it may not be the most appropriate medically.\n--------------------\nContext title: Institutional Review Boards Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.059796333312988", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 64: See section IV.A.4 for guidance regarding identification of the most up-to-date version of the informed consent form.\n\niv.2.4 Identification of Revised Consent Forms\n\nThe IRB should ensure that there is a way to identify a revised consent form so that continued use of a previously approved version does not occur. While not required by FDA regulations, the use of date stamps is one possible mechanism for ensuring use of the most recently approved version of the consent form.\n\nThe Clinical Investigator\n\nThe clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects during a clinical investigation, and for ensuring that, unless an exception applies, legally effective informed consent is obtained from each subject or the subject's LAR before that subject takes part in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.20(a), 312.60, and 812.100). Legally effective informed consent includes meeting all applicable Federal, State, and local laws that require additional information in the informed consent form beyond what FDA regulations require. Sponsors and investigators may wish to seek legal guidance regarding specific local consent requirements applicable to their research.\n\nThe clinical investigator should notify the IRB regarding the consent process, including who (e.g., the investigator or another study team member) will conduct the consent discussion. Any information that will be given to subjects to review and discuss as part of informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)). An investigator may not begin the informed consent process with prospective subjects until the IRB reviews and approves the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process (21 CFR 50.20, 50.27, and 56.109).\n\nThe clinical investigator's institution may have standard language or a standard format for consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation). FDA recognizes that investigators may also need to identify and meet institutional requirements and incorporate them into the consent form for the IRB's initial review of the clinical investigation.\n\nDuring the clinical investigation, the investigator may need to revise the consent form to address new information that might arise during the conduct of the trial, such as a change to the protocol or new safety information. The investigator will need to obtain IRB review and approval of the revised consent form (21 CFR 50.27 and 56.109). In addition, because the consent form is being modified to reflect new information that might affect the willingness of already enrolled and actively participating subjects to continue in the clinical investigation, the IRB should determine the need to inform the previously enrolled subjects of the new information and determine their willingness to continue in the research (see\n\nFrequently Asked Questions #16).\n\nAny new information that is part of the consent process must be reviewed and approved by the IRB as a change in approved research before it is initiated, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject (see 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)). In the rare event that urgent safety information is provided to the subject prior to IRB approval, the IRB should promptly be notified of both the safety issue and the notification of subjects.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the clinical investigator:\n\niv.2.1 Delegation of Consent Discussion\n\nFDA regulations require that the investigator obtain the legally effective informed consent of subjects (21 CFR 50.20, 312.60 and 812.100). If the investigator delegates this responsibility, FDA expects that the individual to whom the responsibility is delegated be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform this activity. The individual obtaining informed consent should be knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and have the appropriate training and credentials to be able to address any questions or concerns the subject may have about the study and/or alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject. The investigator should have a detailed plan for the supervision and training of staff, and oversight of the clinical investigation, including the informed consent process.65 Even when a task is delegated to another individual, the investigator remains responsible for ensuring that legally effective informed consent is obtained for all subjects in accordance with 21 CFR part 50.\n\niv.2.2 Financial Relationships and Interests\n\nThe clinical investigator should consider whether information related to financial relationships or interests should be provided to subjects.66 Clinical investigators should consider the potential effects that a financial relationship might have on the clinical investigation or on interactions with subjects. When there are financial relationships or interests, clinical investigators should consider the following actions:\n\nFootnote 66: See the HHS guidance document, \u201cFinancial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidance for Human Subject Protection,\u201d available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/financial-conflict-of-interest/index.html#.\n\nIncluding information in the informed consent form, such as:\n\nThe source of funding and funding arrangements for the conduct and review of the clinical investigation, or\n\nInformation about a financial arrangement or interest (e.g., stock in the study sponsor, patent on the investigational product) of an institution or an investigator and how it is being managed.\n\nUsing special measures to modify the informed consent process when a potential or actual financial conflict exists, such as:\n\nHaving another individual who does not have a potential or actual conflict of interest involved in the consent process, especially when a potential or actual conflict of interest could influence the tone, presentation, or type of information presented during the consent process.\n\nUsing independent monitoring of the consent process.\n\nAlthough the clinical investigator should consider these issues regarding financial relationships and interests, IRBs have the final responsibility of determining whether subjects should be provided with information regarding the source of funding, funding arrangements, or financial interests of parties involved in the clinical investigation as part of the informed consent process (see 21 CFR 56.109 and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).\n\nThe Sponsor\n\nSponsors often provide clinical investigators with a model consent form that may be adapted by the clinical investigator to meet local needs. When the consent form for studies that require an IND or IDE application is submitted to FDA for review, FDA's comments are generally directed to the sponsor (see sectionIV.4.1, \"Investigational New Drugs and Biologics,\" and sectionIV.4.2, \"Investigational Medical Devices\"). The sponsor should promptly provide the clinical investigator with any necessary modifications required to satisfy the regulations at 21 CFR 50.25 so that changes can be made to the consent forms. A modified model consent form reflecting the changes may be used to convey the necessary edits. Because the clinical investigator must receive IRB approval before starting the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 312.66 and 21 CFR 812.110(a)), the sponsor should work closely with the clinical investigator to make certain the modified consent form is reviewed and approved by the IRB. The clinical investigator should provide the sponsor with a copy of the consent form approved by the IRB.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the sponsor:\n\niv.3.1 Considerations for Multicenter Clinical Investigations\n\nFor multicenter clinical investigations, changes may need to be made to the consent form to address local and institutional requirements. For multicenter clinical investigations reviewed by more than one IRB, when local IRB review results in substantive modifications to the consent form, i.e., changes that affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects, FDA expects the sponsor to share the revisions with all investigators and their IRBs. In this situation it may be more efficient to share the changes with the sites using a modified model consent form, when appropriate. If the multicenter clinical investigation has a central IRB cooperating with local IRBs or human research protection offices, the revisions should be forwarded to the central IRB.67 Alternatively, local issues may be addressed by the central IRB depending on the review agreement between the local IRB(s) and central IRB. Note that for medicaldevice studies that require submission of an IDE application, such changes must be submitted to FDA.68\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 812.35(a).\n\nFootnote 69: The 2018 Common Rule requires that any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States, unless the research is not subject to the provision (45 CFR 46.114(b)). The compliance date for research subject to this provision was January 20, 2020. On September 28, 2022, FDA issued a proposed rule to harmonize with this requirement to the extent practicable and consistent with statutory provisions (see https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/28/2022-21089/institutional-review-boards-cooperative-research). The January 19, 2017, final rule revising the Common Rule is available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/finalized-revisions-common-rule/index.html.\n\n.4.2 Sponsor Personnel\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.1354899406433105", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 58: See 21 CFR 56.109(b).\n\nInvestigators must use an IRB-approved written consent form when documenting informed consent, in accordance with 21 CFR 50.27, except as provided in 21 CFR 56.109(c). Thus, the IRB should review the adequacy and appropriateness of all wording in the consent materials, as well as the overall length and presentation of information. Consent forms that are long, complex, legalistic, and have a high reading level may overwhelm prospective subjects and may inhibit reading of the full document and understanding of the relevant information.\n\nThe IRB should ensure that technical and scientific concepts and terms are explained, or common terms substituted, so that the anticipated subject population can understand all provided information (see 21 CFR 50.20).59 Pictures, diagrams, or other visual aids may be used to improve understanding of medical terms or how an investigational product functions. IRBs may wish to evaluate, through subject discussions, how well the consent materials communicate critical information. Additional guidance on the requirements at 21 CFR 50.20 can be found in section 1.1.2, \"General Requirements for Informed Consent\" above.\n\nFootnote 59: Various strategies exist to improve communication with patients, for example, see Doak CC, Doak LG, Friedell GH, Meade CD. Improving comprehension for cancer patients with low literacy skills: strategies for clinicians. CA Cancer J Clin. 1998 May-Jun;48(3):151-62. doi: 10.3322/canjclin.48.3.151. PMID: 9594918.\n\n1.1.2 Use of Standardized Language\n\nInstitutions may develop standard language or a standard format to use in portions of all consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation) to meet certain FDA regulatory requirements, as well as institutional and other Federal, State, or local requirements.\n\n5.3.2 Review of the Consent Process\n\nThe investigator should notify the IRB of the consent process to be used. The process may be described in the protocol, or the investigator may provide a brief document describing the process to be used. The materials and procedures used for subject recruitment, which typically include advertisements, must be reviewed and approved by the IRB to ensure that these materials are appropriate, as described in section4.1, \"Review of All Informed Consent Materials\" (see 21 CFR 56.109(b) and 56.111(a)(4)).60 The IRB must determine that investigators will seek consent from prospective subjects under circumstances that minimize the possibility of coercion and undue influence (21 CFR 50.20 and 56.111(a)(4)). FDA considers this to include ensuring that the consent process described by the investigator allows sufficient time for prospective subjects to consider the information, provides time and opportunity for the subjects to ask questions and have those questions answered, and allows time and opportunity for the subjects to consider fully whether to participate.\n\nFootnote 60: For further information, see the FDA Information Sheet \u201cRecruiting Study Subjects,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects.\n\nTo approve a clinical investigation, the IRB must find that informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's LAR and that informed consent will be appropriately documented, in accordance with and to the extent required by 21 CFR part 50 (21 CFR 56.111(a)(4) and (5)). FDA recommends that the IRB inquire as to who will conduct the consent discussion and what procedures will be followed. If procedures other than a face-to-face consent discussion are proposed, such as by telephone, the IRB should consider whether the procedures will provide effective communication and accomplish the goals of the informed consent process. Alternative procedures may be of special concern when the clinical investigation involves complex procedures or when risks may be difficult to comprehend.\n\nFDA regulations authorize the IRB to observe or have a third party observe the consent process, as well as the research (21 CFR 56.109(f)). IRBs should consider using this authority when it may be appropriate61 or enhance the protection provided to subjects (for example, when the investigator is alsothe treating physician for a prospective subject, when the person conducting the consent interview is relatively inexperienced, or when the clinical investigation involves vulnerable subjects). In addition to observing a sample of consent discussions, the IRB could interview subjects to assess the consent process and evaluate the subjects' understanding of the clinical investigation.\n\n3.3.3 IRB Review of Updated Informed Consent Documents\n\nAll information given to subjects as part of the consent process is to be reviewed and approved by the IRB (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).62 During the clinical investigation, new information about the research or changes to the clinical investigation may arise that affect the rights or welfare of subjects. FDA recommends that IRBs have procedures in place for the timely, efficient, and effective review of such new information or changes. This would include procedures for the clinical investigator and/or sponsor to notify the IRB of any significant new findings that arise during the clinical investigation relevant to a subject's decision to continue participation (see section3.3.5, \"Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects\", and (\\mathtt{Frequently\\ Asked\\ Question}#16)). When new information or changes in the clinical investigation warrant revisions of the consent form (and any accompanying changes to the protocol), such revisions must be reviewed and approved by the IRB before the revisions are initiated, except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to subjects (21 CFR 56.108(a)(3)-(4)).\n\nFootnote 62: This would include all addenda to the consent form and other materials used in the consent process.\n\nSome changes may be reviewed and approved by expedited means, as provided for by 21 CFR 56.110. For example, an IRB may decide expedited review is appropriate for changes to the consent form that reflect minor changes in the protocol or recruitment plan (e.g., new advertising for subjects following initiation of the clinical investigation when the advertisement incorporates wording from the approved consent form). When expedited review is used, if the IRB reviewer is unsure whether the change qualifies for expedited review under 21 CFR 56.110(b), FDA recommends that the reviewer (if other than the IRB chair) consult with the IRB chair. If doubts persist as to whether the change qualifies for expedited review, then the change should be reviewed at a convened meeting of the IRB.63\n\nFootnote 63: As indicated at section4.2, when new information is added to the consent form that might affect the willingness of already enrolled and actively participating subjects to continue in the clinical investigation, the IRB should determine the need to inform the previously enrolled subjects of the new information and determine their willingness to continue in the research.\n\nAdministrative changes, such as the correction of typographical and spelling errors, and changes in telephone numbers, may be submitted to the IRB at any time, including during continuing review, and do not require formal review and approval. Although such changes do not need IRB review, updatedversions of the consent form should be sent to the IRB so that they have current copies of the informed consent form on file.64\n\nFootnote 64: See section IV.A.4 for guidance regarding identification of the most up-to-date version of the informed consent form.\n\niv.2.4 Identification of Revised Consent Forms\n\nThe IRB should ensure that there is a way to identify a revised consent form so that continued use of a previously approved version does not occur. While not required by FDA regulations, the use of date stamps is one possible mechanism for ensuring use of the most recently approved version of the consent form.\n\nThe Clinical Investigator\n\nThe clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects during a clinical investigation, and for ensuring that, unless an exception applies, legally effective informed consent is obtained from each subject or the subject's LAR before that subject takes part in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.20(a), 312.60, and 812.100). Legally effective informed consent includes meeting all applicable Federal, State, and local laws that require additional information in the informed consent form beyond what FDA regulations require. Sponsors and investigators may wish to seek legal guidance regarding specific local consent requirements applicable to their research.\n\nThe clinical investigator should notify the IRB regarding the consent process, including who (e.g., the investigator or another study team member) will conduct the consent discussion. Any information that will be given to subjects to review and discuss as part of informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)). An investigator may not begin the informed consent process with prospective subjects until the IRB reviews and approves the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process (21 CFR 50.20, 50.27, and 56.109).\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.6870163679122925", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Must informed consent documents be translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English?\n--------------------\nContext: III FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b \"Short Form\" for more details). If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For \"applicable clinical trials\" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, \u201cElement of Informed Consent for \u2018Applicable Clinical Trials.\u201d\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n\nNo informed consent, whether oral or written, may include any exculpatory language through which the subject or the representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence.\n\nii.2.1 Exceptions to Informed Consent\n\nInformed consent is required for participation in FDA-regulated clinical investigations except under limited circumstances as described in 21 CFR 50.23 (involving certain life-threatening situations, military operations, or public health emergencies) and 21 CFR 50.24 (involving emergency research16) (see 21 CFR 50.20). We note that, to implement statutory changes made to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C) Act by section 3024 of the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act), FDA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would allow IRBs responsible for the review, approval, and continuing review of clinical investigations to approve an informed consent procedure that waives or alters certain informed consent elements or that waives the requirement to obtain informed consent for certain minimal risk clinical investigations.17({}^{,})18 In addition, FDA issued guidance explaining that until the Agency promulgates regulations implementing the Cures Act amendments to the FD&C Act, FDA does not intend to object to an IRB approving a consent procedure that does not include, or that alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set forth in 21 CFR 50.25, or to an IRB waiving the requirements to obtain informed consent for certain minimal risk clinical investigations under the circumstances described in the guidance.19 Nothing in FDA's informed consent regulations is intended to limit the authority of a physician to provide emergency medical care to the extent the physician is permitted to do so under applicable Federal, State, or local law (21 CFR 50.25(e)).\n\nFootnote 16: See \u201cGuidance for Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors; Exception from Informed Consent Requirements for Emergency Research,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/exception-informed-consent-requirements-emergency-research.\n\nFootnote 17: See section 3024 of the Cures Act, Pub. L. 114-255, available at https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ255/PLAW-114publ255.pdf.\n\nFootnote 18: See \u201cInstitutional Review Board Waiver or Alteration of Informed Consent for Minimal Risk Clinical Investigations,\u201d (83 FR 57378, November 15, 2018) at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2018-11-15/pdf/2018-24822.pdf.\n\nii.2.2 Coercion and Undue Influence\n\nThe conditions under which informed consent is sought and the relationship between the subject and the person obtaining consent should be carefully considered to minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence (21 CFR 50.20). According to the Belmont Report, \"Coercion occurs when an overt threat of harm is intentionally presented by one person to another in order to obtain compliance. Undue influence,by contrast, occurs through an offer of an excessive, unwarranted, inappropriate or improper reward or other overture in order to obtain compliance.\"20\n\nFootnote 20: The Belmont Report was written by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The Commission, created as a result of the National Research Act of 1974, was charged with identifying the basic ethical principles that should underlie the conduct of biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects and developing guidelines to assure that such research is conducted in accordance with those principles. See Belmont Report, available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html.\n\nFor example, if an employer seeks to enroll employees in a clinical investigation sponsored or conducted by the employer, the informed consent process should contain safeguards to ensure that participation is voluntary and that the possibility of undue influence or coercion by supervisors, peers, or others is minimized. Similarly, because of a potential conflict of interest and the nature of the physician-patient relationship,21 when the investigator is also the prospective subject's physician, for example, the-investigator should ensure that the prospective subject understands that enrollment in the clinical investigation is voluntary, and that a decision to forgo enrollment will not adversely affect their medical care, in accordance with 21 CFR 50.25(a)(8). The consent process and form should emphasize that an individual's participation is truly voluntary.\n\nNote that coercion and undue influence may be situational, and can affect any population, not just subject populations seen as vulnerable to coercion or undue influence. For example, in a clinical investigation involving the collection of extra tissue samples during a planned surgical procedure, waiting to obtain informed consent until the prospective subject is in the preoperative area would generally fail to minimize the possibility of undue influence. The possibility of undue influence could be addressed by first discussing the study with the prospective subject during a preoperative visit as part of the informed consent process. The prospective subject could be told that the study will be reviewed with them again prior to the procedure and, after all questions are resolved, they will be asked to sign a consent form acknowledging their willingness to participate in the study at that time.\n\nIn addition, statements that claim investigational drugs and devices are safe or effective for the purposes for which they are being investigated are prohibited (21 CFR 312.7(a) and 21 CFR 812.7(d)). Likewise, statements that overstate the possibility of benefit may unduly influence prospective subjects by leading them to incorrectly assume that it is known that the investigational product will be of benefit to them, influencing them to agree to participate when they might not have otherwise chosen to do so. For example, wording that refers to the clinical investigation as a \"therapeutic trial\" could contribute to a prospective subject's misunderstanding that the trial will offer a direct benefit for their disease or condition.\n\nFurthermore, we generally recommend against including statements such as \"FDA has given permission for the clinical investigation to proceed\" or \"FDA has approved the clinical investigation\" in the informed consent process, because such statements may suggest to subjects that the investigation has FDA's endorsement. In addition, these statements may not be accurate for the particular clinical investigation at issue (see, e.g., 21 CFR 312.40(b) and 21 CFR 812.2(b)).\n\nFDA does not consider reimbursement for reasonable travel expenses to and from the clinical trial site (e.g., airfare, gas, tolls), and associated costs, such as parking and lodging, to raise issues related to coercion or undue influence. Reimbursement for other expenses may be considered by an IRB on a case-by-case basis, and IRBs should consider whether the proposed remuneration could be an undue influence. Payment for participation in research should be just and fair.

While increases in QT/QTc to >500 ms or of >60 ms over baseline are commonly used as thresholds forpotential discontinuation, the exact criteria chosen for a given trial will depend on the risk-tolerance level considered appropriate for the indication and patient group in question.\n\nThe Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nThe 'thorough QT/QTc study' is intended to determine whether the drug has a threshold pharmacologic effect on cardiac repolarization, as detected by QT/QTc prolongation. The threshold level of regulatory concern, discussed further below, is around 5 ms as evidenced by an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval around the mean effect on QTc of 10 ms. The study is typically carried out in healthy volunteers (as opposed to individuals at increased risk of arrhythmias) and is used to determine whether or not the effect of a drug on the QT/QTc interval in target patient populations should be studied intensively during later stages of drug development. It is not intended to identify drugs as being pro-arrhythmic. Although data are limited, it is not expected that the results of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' would be affected by ethnic factors.\n\nThe 'thorough QT/QTc study' would typically be conducted early in clinical development to provide maximum guidance for later trials, although the precise timing will depend on the specifics of the drug under development. It would usually not be the first study, as it is important to have basic clinical data for its design and conduct, including tolerability and pharmacokinetics. Some drugs might not be suitable for study in healthy volunteers because of issues related to tolerability (e.g., neuroleptic agents, chemotherapeutics).\n\nThe results of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' will influence the amount of information collected in later stages of development:\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.03098156675696373", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , In the ICH E14 guidance, the recommended metric to analyze for a crossover study is the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period. Please discuss the most appropriate metric to assess a drug's effect on QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study (i.e., when there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient). (4.1)\n--------------------\nContext: The ICH E14 guidance currently recommends either fully manual or manual adjudication approaches for clinical trials in which the assessment of ECG safety is an important objective, such as the thorough QT/QTc study. When the thorough QT study is positive, fully manual or manual adjudication methods are currently recommended for an adequate sample of patients in late phase studies (see section II.C (2.3) in the E14 guidance). When the thorough QT/QTc study is negative, routine ECG safety assessments in late phase clinical trials using fully automated reading methods will be adequate.\n\nQ3.: The ICH E14 guidance contains the following statement: \"If well-characterized data validating the use of fully automated technologies become available, the recommendations in the guidance for the measurement of ECG intervals could be modified.\" What would be expected of a sponsor that wished to validate and apply an automated reading method for regulatory submissions? (1.3)\n\nEfforts to develop more sophisticated and reliable methods for automated ECG readings for both QT interval and T wave morphology assessment are encouraged. There are at present no large-scale studies to validate the use of fully automated reading methods in patients; however, there are examples of thorough QT/QTc studies in healthy volunteers in which automated methods have been used and validated for QT interval measurements against manual methods.\n\nQT Interval measurement\n\nThere are at present no clear and widely accepted criteria for validation of new semi-automated or automated methods, but it is expected that each would be validated independently for its ability to detect the QT/QTc prolongation effects of drugs that are near the threshold of regulatory concern. Data supporting the validation of a new method should be submitted and could include descriptive statistics, Bland-Altman plots of agreement, superimposed plots of the baseline- and placebo-adjusted QTc and the RR as a function of time, together with data from any trials that have employed the method.\n\nT wave morphology assessment\n\nThe suitability of automated ECG reading techniques for the assessment of morphological abnormalities has not yet been demonstrated. If a sponsor intends to develop a fully automated approach, without visual assessment for morphological changes, validation studies should include a demonstration that the automated method is capable of reading and interpreting a test set of abnormal ECGs correctly (e.g., abnormalities of T wave morphology, overlapping U waves). As with methods for QT interval determination, there are at present no clear and widely accepted criteria for validation of novel methods.\n\nBecause changes in morphology can affect interval measurement, fully manual or manual adjudication (as defined in Question Q2 (1.2)) techniques should be performed if treatment-emergent changes in morphology are observed. If, on the other hand, no morphology changes are observed, this would support the use of automated methodologies, provided they have been validated.\n\nHow does a sponsor incorporate new technology or validate new methodology into the measurement and/or analysis of the QT interval? (1.4)\n\nThe ICH process is better suited to the determination of regulatory policy once the science in a particular area has become more or less clear. In general, it is not well-suited to the qualification or validation of new technology.\n\nSections II.E.1 (2.5.1) and II.E.2 (2.5.2) of the ICH E14 guidance are rather discouraging about methodology outside conventional carts and human-determined measurements. Since ICH E14 was issued, 12-lead continuous recording devices have largely supplanted cart recorders in thorough QT studies without a formal validation process because of their performance in the context of a positive control. The impact of other innovative technologies can be assessed in studies incorporating a positive control. Although some technologies could be assessed using other techniques in the absence of a positive control, this topic is more complex and beyond the scope of this question and answer.\n\nTwelve-lead continuous recording devices and other new technologies can be used in late phase clinical trials. Even though a positive control is not used in late stage studies, the new technology could be validated in other studies (such as the thorough QT study). In cases where a thorough QT study is not done, a sponsor can provide alternative methods for validating the technology.\n\nThe ICH E14 guidance states that QT interval corrected by Fridericia's and Bazett's correction should be submitted in all applications; is this still necessary? Is there a recommended approach to QT correction that is different from that specified in ICH E14? (1.5)\n\nChanges in heart rate could variably influence a drug's effect on repolarization (i.e., QT interval), and correction methods with different characteristics are often applied. The principles set below would be applicable in all clinical studies (thorough QT or other studies).\n\nIn adults, Bazett's correction has been clearly shown to be an inferior method of correcting for differences in heart rate among and within subjects. Therefore, QT interval data corrected using Bazett's corrections is no longer warranted in all applications unless there is a compelling reason for a comparison to historical Bazett's corrected QT data. Presentation of data with a Fridericia's correction is likely to be appropriate in most situations, but other methods could be more appropriate. There is no single recommended alternative (see Question Q4 (1.4) on Incorporating New Technologies), but the following are some considerations:\n\nAnalyses of the same data using different models for correcting QT can generate discordant results. Therefore, it is important that the method(s) of correction, criteria for the selection of the method of correction, and rationale for the components of the method of correction be specified prior to analysis to limit bias. Model selection should be based on objective criteria and should consider the uncertainty in parameter estimates. Alternative methods of correction should be used only if the primary method fails the pre-specified criteria for selection of the method of correction.\n\nCorrections that are individualized to a subject's unique heart rate QT dynamic are not likely to work well when the data are sparse or when the baseline data upon which the correction is based do not cover at least the heart rate range observed in patients on the study drug.\n\nII Gender (2)\n\nQ6. There are recognized differences in the baseline QTc between men and women. These were noted in early versions of the guidance. In the E14 guidance, however, it is recommended that outliers be categorized as (>450), (>480), and (>500) milliseconds (ms), regardless of gender. Can you say why there is no gender difference in the recommendation? (2.1)\n\nThe 450, 480, and 500 ms categories refer to the values the E14 guidance suggests sponsors might use in characterizing outliers. The numbers that were specified previously for males and females referred to \"normal\" QTc values, which may differ for men and women. This section was not included in the final guidance, however, and such considerations would be largely irrelevant to larger durations (e.g., 480 and 500 ms). As the thorough QT/QTc study is designed to examine the propensity of a drug to prolong the QTc interval, it is appropriate to perform the study in healthy male or female volunteers.\n\nShould we enroll both sexes in a thorough QT study, and does the study need to be powered for independent conclusions about each sex? (2.2)\n\nPost-pubertal males have lower heart-rate corrected QT intervals than do pre-pubertal males or females generally. Women are generally smaller than men, so their exposure to a given fixed dose of a drug will generally be higher, and if a drug prolongs QT, it can be expected to prolong it more in women because of the higher exposure. It is not settled whether and how often there are sex differences in response to QT-prolonging drugs that are not explained by exposure alone.\n\nThe thorough QT study is primarily intended to act as a clinical pharmacology study in a healthy population using a conservative primary objective defining the drug's effect on QT. It is unlikely that any of a variety of baseline demographic parameters would introduce a large difference in QT response to a drug in subpopulations defined by factors such as age, co-morbidity, and gender that is not explained by exposure.\n\nIt is encouraged, but not mandatory, to include both men and women in the thorough QT study. Analyses of Concentration-Response Relationship by sex can be helpful for studying the effect of the drug on QT/QTc interval in cases where there is evidence or mechanistic theory for a gender difference. However, the primary analysis of a thorough QT study should be powered and conducted on the pooled population. If the primary analysis is negative and if there is no other evidence suggesting gender differences, subgroup analysis by sex is not expected.\n\nIII Positive control (3)\n\nThe ICH E14 guidance emphasizes the importance of assay sensitivity and recommends the use of a positive control. In order to accept a negative thorough QT/QTc study, assay sensitivity should be established in the study by use of a positive control with a known QT-prolonging effect. Please clarify how to assess the adequacy of the positive control in the thorough QT study.

There are at present no large-scale studies to validate the use of fully automated reading methods in patients; however, there are examples of thorough QT/QTc studies in healthy volunteers in which automated methods have been used and validated for QT interval measurements against manual methods.\n\nQT Interval measurement\n\nThere are at present no clear and widely accepted criteria for validation of new semi-automated or automated methods, but it is expected that each would be validated independently for its ability to detect the QT/QTc prolongation effects of drugs that are near the threshold of regulatory concern. Data supporting the validation of a new method should be submitted and could include descriptive statistics, Bland-Altman plots of agreement, superimposed plots of the baseline- and placebo-adjusted QTc and the RR as a function of time, together with data from any trials that have employed the method.\n\nT wave morphology assessment\n\nThe suitability of automated ECG reading techniques for the assessment of morphological abnormalities has not yet been demonstrated. If a sponsor intends to develop a fully automated approach, without visual assessment for morphological changes, validation studies should include a demonstration that the automated method is capable of reading and interpreting a test set of abnormal ECGs correctly (e.g., abnormalities of T wave morphology, overlapping U waves). As with methods for QT interval determination, there are at present no clear and widely accepted criteria for validation of novel methods.\n\nBecause changes in morphology can affect interval measurement, fully manual or manual adjudication (as defined in Question Q2 (1.2)) techniques should be performed if treatment-emergent changes in morphology are observed. If, on the other hand, no morphology changes are observed, this would support the use of automated methodologies, provided they have been validated.\n\nHow does a sponsor incorporate new technology or validate new methodology into the measurement and/or analysis of the QT interval? (1.4)\n\nThe ICH process is better suited to the determination of regulatory policy once the science in a particular area has become more or less clear. In general, it is not well-suited to the qualification or validation of new technology.\n\nSections II.E.1 (2.5.1) and II.E.2 (2.5.2) of the ICH E14 guidance are rather discouraging about methodology outside conventional carts and human-determined measurements. Since ICH E14 was issued, 12-lead continuous recording devices have largely supplanted cart recorders in thorough QT studies without a formal validation process because of their performance in the context of a positive control. The impact of other innovative technologies can be assessed in studies incorporating a positive control. Although some technologies could be assessed using other techniques in the absence of a positive control, this topic is more complex and beyond the scope of this question and answer.\n\nTwelve-lead continuous recording devices and other new technologies can be used in late phase clinical trials. Even though a positive control is not used in late stage studies, the new technology could be validated in other studies (such as the thorough QT study). In cases where a thorough QT study is not done, a sponsor can provide alternative methods for validating the technology.\n\nThe ICH E14 guidance states that QT interval corrected by Fridericia's and Bazett's correction should be submitted in all applications; is this still necessary? Is there a recommended approach to QT correction that is different from that specified in ICH E14? (1.5)\n\nChanges in heart rate could variably influence a drug's effect on repolarization (i.e., QT interval), and correction methods with different characteristics are often applied. The principles set below would be applicable in all clinical studies (thorough QT or other studies).\n\nIn adults, Bazett's correction has been clearly shown to be an inferior method of correcting for differences in heart rate among and within subjects. Therefore, QT interval data corrected using Bazett's corrections is no longer warranted in all applications unless there is a compelling reason for a comparison to historical Bazett's corrected QT data. Presentation of data with a Fridericia's correction is likely to be appropriate in most situations, but other methods could be more appropriate. There is no single recommended alternative (see Question Q4 (1.4) on Incorporating New Technologies), but the following are some considerations:\n\nAnalyses of the same data using different models for correcting QT can generate discordant results. Therefore, it is important that the method(s) of correction, criteria for the selection of the method of correction, and rationale for the components of the method of correction be specified prior to analysis to limit bias. Model selection should be based on objective criteria and should consider the uncertainty in parameter estimates. Alternative methods of correction should be used only if the primary method fails the pre-specified criteria for selection of the method of correction.\n\nCorrections that are individualized to a subject's unique heart rate QT dynamic are not likely to work well when the data are sparse or when the baseline data upon which the correction is based do not cover at least the heart rate range observed in patients on the study drug.\n\nII Gender (2)\n\nQ6. There are recognized differences in the baseline QTc between men and women. These were noted in early versions of the guidance. In the E14 guidance, however, it is recommended that outliers be categorized as (>450), (>480), and (>500) milliseconds (ms), regardless of gender. Can you say why there is no gender difference in the recommendation? (2.1)\n\nThe 450, 480, and 500 ms categories refer to the values the E14 guidance suggests sponsors might use in characterizing outliers. The numbers that were specified previously for males and females referred to \"normal\" QTc values, which may differ for men and women. This section was not included in the final guidance, however, and such considerations would be largely irrelevant to larger durations (e.g., 480 and 500 ms). As the thorough QT/QTc study is designed to examine the propensity of a drug to prolong the QTc interval, it is appropriate to perform the study in healthy male or female volunteers.\n\nShould we enroll both sexes in a thorough QT study, and does the study need to be powered for independent conclusions about each sex? (2.2)\n\nPost-pubertal males have lower heart-rate corrected QT intervals than do pre-pubertal males or females generally. Women are generally smaller than men, so their exposure to a given fixed dose of a drug will generally be higher, and if a drug prolongs QT, it can be expected to prolong it more in women because of the higher exposure. It is not settled whether and how often there are sex differences in response to QT-prolonging drugs that are not explained by exposure alone.\n\nThe thorough QT study is primarily intended to act as a clinical pharmacology study in a healthy population using a conservative primary objective defining the drug's effect on QT. It is unlikely that any of a variety of baseline demographic parameters would introduce a large difference in QT response to a drug in subpopulations defined by factors such as age, co-morbidity, and gender that is not explained by exposure.\n\nIt is encouraged, but not mandatory, to include both men and women in the thorough QT study. Analyses of Concentration-Response Relationship by sex can be helpful for studying the effect of the drug on QT/QTc interval in cases where there is evidence or mechanistic theory for a gender difference. However, the primary analysis of a thorough QT study should be powered and conducted on the pooled population. If the primary analysis is negative and if there is no other evidence suggesting gender differences, subgroup analysis by sex is not expected.\n\nIII Positive control (3)\n\nThe ICH E14 guidance emphasizes the importance of assay sensitivity and recommends the use of a positive control. In order to accept a negative thorough QT/QTc study, assay sensitivity should be established in the study by use of a positive control with a known QT-prolonging effect. Please clarify how to assess the adequacy of the positive control in the thorough QT study.

Please discuss the most appropriate metric to assess a drug's effect on QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study (i.e., when there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient). (4.1)\n--------------------\nContext: 2.2.5 Alternative Strategies to Assess QT/QTc Interval Effects\n\nAlternatives to the use of the 'thorough QT/QTc study' are under active investigation. Examples include evaluating the relationship between concentration and QT/QTc effects or more intensively evaluating ECGs, based on data collected during early phase clinical studies.\n\nClinical Trial Evaluation After the 'Thorough QT/QTc Study'\n\nIf the 'thorough QT/QTc study' is negative (see section 2.2), the collection of baseline and periodic on-therapy ECGs in accordance with the current investigational practices in each therapeutic field is almost always sufficient evaluation during subsequent stages of drug development.\n\nIf the 'thorough QT/QTc study' is positive, additional evaluation in subsequent clinical studies should be performed. One objective of this evaluation should be to fully describe the effect of the drug on the QT/QTc interval in the target patient population with particular attention to dose- and concentration-related effects. It is important to include patients in these analyses exposed to the full range of potential doses and patients with additional risk factors for TdP. These analyses would ordinarily focus on outliers as well as on changes in mean QT/QTc. Depending on the size of the effect seen in the 'thorough QT/QTc study', more intense monitoring of patients with additional risk factors for TdP might be needed.\n\nWhile what constitutes adequate ECG assessment to accomplish this is not fully established, additional ECGs collected appropriately in substantial numbers of patients in late phase clinical trials could provide this information. In this case, it would be important to collect ECGs at the anticipated time of peak drug effects, as determined in the 'thorough QT/QTc study' and pharmacokinetic information about the patient population.\n\nAnother objective of this evaluation should be to collect information on the adverse events that occur in the trials following the positive 'thorough QT/QTc study'. This would include patients who develop marked QT/QTc prolongation (e.g., >500 ms) or experience a serious cardiovascular adverse event that suggests an arrhythmia (e.g., TdP). Such patients should be evaluated closely for risk factors that might have contributed to this event (e.g., genotyping for Long QT Syndromes, see section 4.3).\n\nIf the 'thorough QT/QTc study' is positive, analyses of the ECG and adverse event data from certain patient sub-groups are of particular interest, such as:\n\nPatients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia);\n\nPatients with congestive heart failure;\n\nPatients with impaired drug metabolizing capacity or clearance (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment, drug interactions);\n\nFemale patients;\n\nPatients aged <16 and over 65 years.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.9879128336906433", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , In the ICH E14 guidance, the recommended metric to analyze for a crossover study is the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period.

In such cases, the 'thorough QT/QTc study' can often be conducted in patient populations. When this is not possible, the importance of detecting and modifying this safety risk means that other ways of detecting effects on the QT/QTc interval need to be developed. These might include the collection of ECGs at multiple timepoints under tightly controlled settings that target a broad range of doses early in development.\n\nCollection, Assessment and Submission of Electrocardiographic Data\n\nThe recommendations below are most relevant to the 'thorough QT/QTc study' and to any studies investigating a drug with a known effect on cardiac repolarization and when the 'thorough QT/QTc study' cannot be performed.\n\n2.5.1 Collection and Assessment of Standard 12-Lead ECGs\n\nThe clinical ECG database is typically derived from the collection of 12-lead surface ECGs, although ambulatory ECG techniques show promise (see section 2.5.2). The quality of the ECG database can depend on the use of modern equipment with the capacity for digital signal processing. Such equipment should be recently serviced and calibrated. Machine calibration records and performance data should be maintained on file. In the case of multicentre trials, training sessions are encouraged to ensure consistency of operator technique (e.g., skin preparation, lead placement, patient position) and data acquisition practices.\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.0676860809326172", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As explained in E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT:QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs , In the ICH E14 guidance, the recommended metric to analyze for a crossover study is the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period. Please discuss the most appropriate metric to assess a drug's effect on QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study (i.e., when there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient). (4.1)\n--------------------\nContext: Detailed patient narratives should be provided for all serious cardiac adverse events, as would be the case for any serious event or events leading to discontinuation. In assessing the possible causal relationship of drug-induced QT/QTc interval prolongation to the event, attention should be directed to considerations such as temporal relationship and ECG results collected at the time of the event. As the QT/QTc interval is subject to considerable fluctuation, a possible role for QT/QTc interval prolongation should not be dismissed on the basis of normal on-therapy ECG measurements performed prior to, or near the time of the adverse event. In addition to an appropriate adverse reaction report, patients with marked QT/QTc prolongation or an episode of TdP might provide useful information on risk management. When identified, they should therefore be examined closely for other risk factors (e.g., genetic predisposition, see section 4.3). Rechallenge with the investigational drug under appropriately monitored conditions can provide useful information on dose- and concentration-response relationships.\n\nIn evaluating the safety database of a new drug, consideration should be given to the extent to which the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient eligibility might have influenced the study population with respect to the risk of QT/QTc interval prolongation and associated adverse events (e.g., exclusion of patients with cardiac comorbidities or renal/hepatic impairment, prohibition of diuretics as concomitant medications). Ideally, the major clinical studies should include an adequate representation of female and elderly patients, as well as patients with co-morbidities and concomitant medications typical of the expected user population.\n\nIf a subject experiences symptoms or ECG findings suggestive of an arrhythmia during a clinical trial, immediate evaluation by a cardiac specialist is recommended, both for the purposes of treating the patient and for discussions related to continuation/ re-institution of the therapy.\n\nPremature Discontinuuations or Dosage Reductions\n\nParticular attention should be directed to subjects or patients who are discontinued from clinical trials due to QT/QTc interval prolongation. Information should be provided on the basis for premature discontinuation of the patient (e.g., a QT/QTc interval value in excess of a protocol-defined upper limit, occurrence of QT/QTc interval prolongation in association with symptoms of arrhythmia), as well as the dose and duration of treatment, plasma levels if available, demographic characteristics, and the presence or absence of risk factors for arrhythmia.\n\nDosage reductions prompted by QT/QTc interval prolongation should also be documented.\n\nPharmacokine Considerations\n--------------------\nContext title: E14_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.2442528009414673"], "In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: The 503A Bulks List Final Rule is effective March 21, 2019. As of that date, drug products compounded using any of the four bulk drug substances that are identified as not being included on the list do not qualify for the exemptions under 503A of the FD&C Act. Drug products compounded using one of the six bulk drug substances that are on the list will qualify for the exemptions under section 503A of the FD&C Act provided the drug products are compounded in compliance with the other conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ5. Going forward, how will FDA decide whether to place a bulk drug substance on the 503A Bulks List?\n\nAs described in the final rule, FDA is evaluating nominated bulk drug substances using four criteria: the physical and chemical characteristics of the substance, the safety of the substance in compounded drug products, evidence of effectiveness, and historical use of the substance in compounded drug products. As required by section 503A of the FD&C Act, FDA is consulting with the Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee (PCAC) and USP regarding the 503A Bulks List and is developing the list through notice and comment rulemaking.\n\nQ6. Why did FDA find the four substances it is not placing on the 503A Bulks List to be inappropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act?\n\nFor reasons described at length in the proposed rule that published on December 16, 2016 (81 FR 91071), entitled \"List of Bulk Drug Substances That Can Be Used To Compound Drug Products in Accordance With Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,\" and in the briefing materials presented to the PCAC, applying the four criteria identified in Question 5 above, FDA determined that these four substances are not appropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ7. What information did FDA rely on to make its determinations for the bulk drug substances that are addressed in the final rule?\n\nAs stated in the December 16, 2016 proposed rule, FDA considered information obtained from publicly available sources, including peer-reviewed medical literature. Some of this information was referenced in the nominations, and the remainder FDA gathered through independent searches of medical and pharmaceutical databases. FDA did not review raw data. The nature, quantity, and quality of the information FDA assessed varied considerably from substance to substance. In some cases, there were very little data. For other substances, reports in the literature were more plentiful and sometimes comprised hundreds or thousands of articles. In those cases, generally, the Agency limited its review to a sample of the best literature sources available (e.g., review articles in widely known, peer-reviewed journals; meta-analyses; reports of randomized controlled trials).\n\nQ8. What should I do if I want to use one of the four bulk drug substances that has been identified in the final rule as not being placed on the list to compound a route of administration or dosage form different than what the bulk drug substance was nominated and considered for when it was determined that it would not be placed on the list (e.g., the bulk drug substance was considered in the context of compounding an injectable drug product, but I want to use it to compound a tablet)?\n\nIf you would like to compound a drug product using a bulk drug substance identified as not placed on the list, you may submit a citizen petition under 21 CFR 10.30. The petition should ask FDA to consider revising the rule to include the bulk drug substance. The petition should explain any differences in how you propose to use the bulk drug substance as compared with how it was previously nominated and evaluated for inclusion on the list.\n\nQ9. Does FDA plan to add additional substances to the 503A Bulks List going forward?\n\nMany substances have been nominated for the 503A Bulks List, and FDA has been evaluating them on a rolling basis. FDA intends to publish additional notice and comment rulemaking to address whether these substances should be included on the list.\n\nQ10. Where can I get more information, if needed?\n\nQuestions regarding compliance with the 503A Bulks List Final Rule should be directed to Compounding@fda.hhs.gov.\n--------------------\nContext title: Section 503A Bulks List Final Rule Questions and Answers; Small Entity Compliance Guide; Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 7.001612663269043", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: The available evidence of effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of a drug product compounded with the substance, if any such evidence exists\n\nIn evaluating candidates for the 503A bulks list under these criteria, FDA is using a balancing test. No single one of these criteria is dispositive; rather, FDA is considering each criterion in the context of the others and balancing them, on a substance-by-substance basis, to evaluate whether a particular substance is appropriate for inclusion on the list.\n\nOnce the evaluation of a substance is complete, FDA will present the results of its review to the PCAC to obtain its advice on whether to include the substance on the list.20Section 503A requires that FDA create the 503A bulks list by regulation in consultation with the USP. To this end, FDA has been periodically meeting with USP and discussing the list. FDA will publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that identifies substances FDA proposes for placement on the 503A bulks list and the substances FDA has evaluated but is not proposing to include on the 503A bulks list. After publication of the NPRM, the public will have an opportunity to comment on the proposed rule. After considering the comments submitted to the docket, FDA will publish a final rule that establishes the 503A bulks list and identifies the substances that were considered and will not be placed on the list. FDA does not intend to evaluate all of the sufficiently supported nominations before publishing the first NPRM. Instead, after FDA has made a decision on whether to propose a group of substances (e.g., 10 substances) it intends to publish an NPRM with respect to that group of substances and continue to prepare the list on a rolling basis.\n\nA final rule will list the substances that FDA has determined can be used in compounding under section 503A and those substances that have been evaluated and not placed on the 503A bulks list, if any.\n\nAfter a final rule is published, drug products compounded using the substances on the 503A bulks list will be eligible for the section 503A exemptions provided the drug product is compounded in compliance with the other conditions of section 503A.

This list will be codified at 21 CFR part 216 subpart E.\n\nHowever, until a substance has been evaluated and is identified in a final rule as being included or not included on the 503A bulks list, FDA does not intend to take action against a State-licensed pharmacy, Federal facility, or licensed physician compounding a drug product using a bulk drug substance that is not a component of an FDA-approved drug product and that is not the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph, provided that the following conditions are met:\n\nThe bulk drug substance appears in 503A Category 1 on FDA's website at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Pharmac\n\nYCompounding/UCM467373.pdf. A Category 1 substance may be eligible for inclusion on the 503A bulks list, was nominated with sufficient supporting information for FDA to evaluate it and has not been identified by FDA as a substance that presents a significant safety risk in compounding prior to the publication of a final rule.\n2. The original manufacturer and all subsequent manufacturers of the bulk drug substance are establishments that are registered under section 510 (including foreign establishments that are registered under section 510(i)) of the FD&C Act);\n3. The bulk drug substance is accompanied by a valid COA; and\n4. The drug product compounded using the bulk drug substance is compounded in compliance with all other conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nOriginal manufacturer means the entity that originally produced the bulk drug substance and not a subsequent packer, repacker, labeler, or distributor.\n\nThis policy does not apply to a licensed pharmacist in a State-licensed pharmacy or Federal facility, or a licensed physician, that compounds a drug using a bulk drug substance that does not meet each of the above conditions, and the bulk drug substance is not the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph or a component of an FDA-approved drug.\n\n2 Substances Not Nominated or Nominated Without Adequate Support\n\nAs stated above, one of the categories of bulk drug substances FDA has identified on its website is substances nominated for the 503A bulks list that may be eligible for inclusion on the list, but that FDA is unable to evaluate for inclusion on the list at this time because the substances were nominated with insufficient supporting evidence for FDA to evaluate them (503A Category 3). In the Federal Register of October 27, 2015, FDA established a docket (October docket) where these substances can be re-nominated with sufficient supporting information or where nominations for substances that were not previously nominated can be submitted.\n\nAfter a substance is nominated to the October docket,22 FDA will determine whether the nomination is supported with sufficient information to allow FDA to evaluate it. After FDA makes that determination, the nominated substance will be placed in one of the three categories described in section 2.2 above, and the categorization will be published on the FDA website. Once the category of a substance is published, FDA intends to apply the policy described in Section 3.1 of this guidance to that substance. FDA generally expects to categorize bulk drug substances nominated to the October docket and to publish updated categories on its website on the first business day of each month. Please note that until substances nominated for the October docket have been categorized, the policy does not apply to those substances.\n\nFootnote 22: This includes re-nominations of substances with sufficient supporting information.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf you feel that a substance that you nominated does not appear on the appropriate list or category as described in this guidance you can submit your comment to docket number FDA-2015-N-3534. If you have new information on a previously nominated substance that was placed in Category 3, the substance can be re-nominated with the additional information.\n\nA nominator may also submit a comment to the docket requesting withdrawal of any of its nominations. If the party nominating the substance was the sole nominator, FDA will update the categories described in this guidance to reflect the withdrawn nomination.23 FDA intends to provide notice to the public before removing any nominated substances from Category 1 or Category 2.\n\nFootnote 23: If multiple parties nominated the same substance, each party that nominated the substance must withdraw its nomination for the nominated substance to be considered withdrawn and for the categories to be updated to reflect that withdrawal.\n\nWithdrawal of a nomination upon the nominator's request and the resulting updates to the categories described in this guidance, do not reflect a determination by FDA regarding the validity of the nomination or of any reasons given by the nominator for requesting withdrawal. In addition, FDA may continue to evaluate a substance at its discretion even if the nominator submits a comment requesting withdrawal of the nomination.\n\nAppendix: Summary of Policy\n\nThe following table summarizes the interim policy for bulk drug substances set forth in this guidance:\n--------------------\nContext title: Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.906386375427246", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 7: See section 503A(c)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nBulk drug substances used in compounding under section 503A must also meet certain other requirements, including: (1) the bulk drug substance must be manufactured by an establishment registered under section 510 of the FD&C Act and (2) the bulk drug substance must be accompanied by a valid certificate of analysis (COA).9\n\nFootnote 8: See section 503A(c)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn July 2014, FDA issued a guidance, Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that states:\n\nUntil a bulk drug substances list is published in the Federal Register as a final rule, human drug products should be compounded using only bulk drug substances that are components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, or are the subject of USP or NF monographs.10\n\nFootnote 9: See section 503A(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFDA has received comments that this policy could be causing unnecessary and inappropriate disruptions in patient care because there are patients receiving drugs compounded with bulk drug substances that are not components of FDA-approved drugs, or the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph, but that may ultimately be included on the 503A bulks list, and those patients' care should not be disrupted while the list is under development. After considering this issue, FDA has decided to use this guidance to describe its interim policy concerning compounding with bulk drug substances while the 503A bulks list is being developed. FDA has revised the July 2014 guidance to state:\n\nFDA's interim policy concerning bulk drug substances that are not components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or that are not the subject of applicable USP or NF monographs can be found in the guidance, Interim Policy on _Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCompounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n\nFDA seeks to avoid unnecessary disruption to patient treatment while the Agency considers the bulk drug substances that were nominated with sufficient support to permit FDA to evaluate them and promulgates the regulations required under section 503A. Therefore, as described further below, FDA is issuing this interim guidance stating that it does not intend to take regulatory action for compounding drug products under section 503A using a bulk drug substance when an applicable USP or NF monograph for the substance does not exist and the substance is not a component of an FDA-approved product if, among other conditions, FDA has determined that the nomination for the bulk drug substance included adequate information for FDA to evaluate the substance and at this time, the substance does not appear to present significant safety risks.\n\nB. Efforts to Develop the List of Bulk Drug Substances under Section 503A\n\n1. Section 503A Bulks List -- Early History\n\nSection 503A was enacted in 1997 as part of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act. In the Federal Register of April 7, 1998 (63 FR 17011), FDA invited all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on the list of bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding under section 503A and received nominations for 41 different drug substances. In November 1998, FDA published a guidance for industry, Enforcement Policy During Implementation of Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In this guidance, FDA announced that it would not normally take regulatory action relating to a drug product that had been compounded with a bulk drug substance that had been nominated for inclusion on the bulk drug substances list on or before November 21, 1999, while the substance was being evaluated, as long as the compounding complied with the other effective requirements in section 503A and did not appear to present a significant safety risk.11\n\nFootnote 11: The 1998 guidance was withdrawn in the Federal Register notice announcing the availability of the draft guidance Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. See 78 FR 72901 (Dec. 4, 2013). The final guidance was published in July 2014.\n\nIn January 1999, after evaluating the nominated drug substances and consulting with the Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee (PCAC) as required by section 503A, FDA published a proposed rule listing 20 drug substances on the section 503A bulks list (64 FR 996, January 7, 1999). The preamble to the proposed rule indicated that 10 of the 41 nominated substances were the subject of a USP or NF monograph, or components of FDA approved drugs and did not need to be considered for inclusion on the list.12 The proposed rule also described 10 nominated substances that were still under consideration for the bulk drug substances list and stated that one of the substances was withdrawn by its nominator at the first meeting of the PCAC. The PCAC reconvened in May 1999 to discuss bulk drug substances included in the proposed rule, in addition to other bulk drug substances (64 FR 19791; April 22, 1999).\n\nHowever, after a 2002 U.S. Supreme Court decision holding that certain provisions of section 503A were unconstitutional,13 FDA suspended its efforts to develop the bulk drugs list under section 503A.\n\nFootnote 13: For additional legal history of section 503A, see the guidance Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and cosmetic Act.\n\nBecause of the amount of time that had passed between the publication of the proposed rule and the enactment of the 2013 Drug Quality and Security Act, which removed the provisions of the FD&C Act that the U.S. Supreme Court held to be unconstitutional in 2002, FDA felt it was necessary to begin again to develop the section 503A bulk drug substance list. In the December 4, 2013, Federal Register (78 FR 72841), FDA published a notice withdrawing the 1999 proposed rule and inviting all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on a list of bulk drug substances that can be used for compounding under section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nii.2.2 Current Nominations for the 503A Bulks List\n\nIn response to the December 2013, Federal Register notice, over 2,000 substances were nominated for the 503A bulks list. However, many of the substances nominated for the 503A list were for substances that can be compounded without being on the list because they are the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph or are a component of an FDA-approved drug. In addition, many of the nominations were not for substances used in compounding as active ingredients, or did not include sufficient information for FDA to evaluate the nominated substances for inclusion on the list. To improve the efficiency of the process for developing the 503A bulks list, FDA reopened the nomination process in July 2014 (79 FR 37742) and provided more detailed information on what it needs to evaluate nominations for the 503A bulks list. FDA stated that bulk drug substances that were previously nominated would not be considered further unless they were re-nominated with adequate support to permit a meaningful evaluation. Substances that were already eligible for use in compounding or that were not adequately supported would not be evaluated for placement on the 503A bulks list.\n\nIn response to this request for nominations, approximately 740 unique substances were nominated. Of the nominated substances:\n\nApproximately 315 substances are already eligible for use in compounding under section 503A.\n\nThese are the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph or components of an FDA-approved drug product, which can be used in compounding pursuant to sections 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(I) and (II) and, therefore, can be compounded without being included on the 503A bulks list. To determine if a bulk drug substance is the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph, see the USP-NF available at www.USPNF.com. To determine if a bulk drug substance is a component of an FDA approved drug, see the FDA's Orange Book:_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, available at\n\nhttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/default.cfm.\n\nAt least one14 of the nominated substances is not a bulk drug substance.\n\nFootnote 14: The over-the-counter finished drug product Maalox was nominated. Maalox is not a bulk drug substance.\n\nThis is a finished drug product that was nominated by its brand name. Finished drug products are not eligible for the 503A bulks list because they do not meet the definition of a bulk drug substance in 21 CFR 207.3.\n\nAt least one of the substances is considered a biological product subject to approval in a biologics license application (BLA) under section 351 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act when used for the indication proposed in the nomination.\n\nThis substance is not eligible for the 503A bulks list because biological products subject to approval in a BLA under section 351 of the PHS Act are not eligible for the exemptions in section 503A of the FD&C Act.15 No biological products subject to approval in a BLA will be considered for the 503A bulks list.\n\nFootnote 15: The nominated substance is sodium hexachloroplatinate (IV) hexahydrate. See the revised draft guidance, Mixing, Diluting, or Repackaging Biological Products Outside the Scope of an Approved Biologics License Application for FDA\u2019s proposed policies regarding State-licensed pharmacies, Federal facilities, and outsourcing facilities that mix, dilute, or repackage biological products outside the scope of an approved BLA.\n--------------------\nContext title: Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 5.972378730773926", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: 2 Provisions of Section 503A That Require Regulations or Other FDA Actions\n\nSpecific provisions of section 503A of the FD&C Act require rulemaking or other action by FDA. FDA's policy related to these specific provisions is described below.\n\n2.1.1 Withdrawn or Removed List\n\nFDA promulgated a final rule, codified at 21 CFR 216.24, which lists drug products that cannot be compounded because they have been withdrawn or removed from the market because the drug products or components of the drug products have been found to be unsafe or not effective. FDA intends to update this list periodically, and expects compounds to comply with the list as it currently exists and with any final updates.\n\n2.2.2 Bulk Drug Substances List\n\nSection 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(III) of the FD&C Act provides that a drug product can be compounded using bulk drug substances that do not have an applicable USP or NF monograph (section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(I) of the FD&C Act) and are not components of FDA-approved drugs (section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act) if the bulk drug substances appear on a list developed by FDA and issued through regulation.\n\nIn the Federal Register of April 7, 1998 (63 FR 17,011), FDA invited all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on the list. In the Federal Register of January 7, 1999 (64 FR 996), FDA published a proposed rule listing bulk drug substances that can be used in pharmacy compounding. In the Federal Register of December 4, 2013 (78 FR 72,841), FDA published a notice withdrawing the 1999 proposed rule and inviting all interested persons to nominate bulk drug substances for inclusion on a list of bulk drug substances that can be used for compounding under section 503A of the FD&C Act. FDA's interim policy concerning bulk drug substances that are not components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or that are not the subject of applicable USP or NF monographs can be found in the guidance, Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n\n2.3.3 \"Demonstrable Difficulties\" for Compounding\n\nUnder section 503A(b)(3)(A) of the FD&C Act, a compounded drug product would not qualify for the exemptions provided in subsection (a) if it is identified by FDA through regulation as a drug product that presents demonstrable difficulties for compounding that reasonably demonstrate an adverse effect on the safety or effectiveness of the drug product. In the Federal Register of December 4, 2013 (78 FR 72,840), FDA published a notice inviting all interested persons to nominate drug products or categories of drug products for inclusion on a list of drug products that present demonstrable difficulties for compounding (difficult-to-compound list). This provision is not enforceable until FDA promulgates an implementing regulation.\n\niii.1.4 Memorandum of Understanding Between FDA and the States\n\nSection 503A(b)(3) of the FD&C Act states that FDA, in consultation with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) will develop a standard MOU for use between FDA and the states that will address the interstate distribution of inordinate amounts of compounded drug products and provide for appropriate investigation by a state agency of complaints relating to compounded drug products distributed outside that state. On January 21, 1999, FDA published a notice in the Federal Register announcing the availability of a draft standard MOU, developed in consultation with the NABP. This draft MOU was not finalized. FDA intends to publish a new draft MOU for comment that will replace the January 1999 draft.\n\nUnder section 503A(b)(3)(B)(ii), an individual or firm in a state that does not enter into an MOU with FDA that distributes, or causes to be distributed, compounded drug products out of the state in which they are compounded, can compound for interstate distribution outside the state only 5% of the total prescription orders dispensed or distributed by the individual or firm. FDA does not intend to enforce the 5% limit on interstate distribution until after FDA has finalized an MOU and made it available to the states for their consideration and signature. The Federal Register notice that will announce the availability of the draft MOU will specify a time period during which the MOU will be made available to the states to sign. After this time period expires, FDA intends to begin enforcing the 5% limit in states that have not signed the MOU.\n\nIV Guidance on Regulatory Action\n\nRequirements Applicable to Drug Products that Meet the Conditions of Section 503a\n\nAs stated above, a compounded drug product intended for use in humans that meets the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act and its associated regulations is exempt from the requirements under sections 501(a)(2)(B), 502(f)(1), and 505 of the FD&C Act.\n\nHowever, individuals and firms may be subject to a warning letter, seizure of product, injunction, and/or criminal prosecution for violations of other requirements of the FD&C Act. Such violations may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nThe drug product must not consist in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance, or be prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have been contaminated with filth or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health. (Sections 501(a)(1) and (a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act)\n\nIf the drug product purports to be a drug that is recognized in an official compendium, its strength must not differ from, and its quality or purity must not fall below, the standards set forth in the compendium, unless the difference is plainly stated on its label. (Section 501(b) of the FD&C Act)3. For a drug product not subject to section 501(b) of the FD&C Act, the drug's strength must not differ from, and its quality or purity must not fall below, that which it purports to have. (Section 501(c) of the FD&C Act)\n\nIf the drug product purports to be a drug that is recognized in an official compendium, it must be packaged and labeled as prescribed in the compendium. (Section 502(g) of the FD&C Act)\n\nThe drug product's labeling, advertising, and promotion must not be false or misleading. (Sections 502(a), 502(bb),10 and 201(n) of the FD&C Act)\n\nFootnote 10: Section 502(bb) was added to the FD&C Act by section 103(b) of the DQSA.\n\n2 Enforcement Action When a Drug Does Not Meet the Conditions of Section 503A\n\nIf FDA determines that an individual or firm compounds a drug product that does not meet the conditions of section 503A, then in addition to the violations listed above in section IV.A., the individual or firm that compounds the drug product may also be subject to a warning letter, seizure of product, injunction, and/or criminal prosecution for violations of sections 501(a)(2)(B), 502(f)(1), and 505 of the FD&C Act.11 Such violations may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nFootnote 11: See Medical Ctr. Pharm. v. Mukasey, 536 F.3d 383, 405 (5th Cir. 2008) (\u201ccompounded drugs are in fact \u2018new drugs\u2019 as defined by [21 U.S.C.] \u00a7 321(p) but are exempt from the requirements of [21 U.S.C.] \u00a7 351(a)(2)(B), 352(f)(1), and 355 if and only if they comply with the conditions set forth in [21 U.S.C.] \u00a7 353a.\u201d).\n\n2.2.1 Producing Adulterated Drugs\n\nIn accordance with section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR parts 210 and 211, the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, and holding of a drug must conform with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements. If an individual or firm compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act, those drug products would be subject to CGMP requirements.\n\n2.2 Producing Unapproved New Drugs\n\nIn accordance with section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, an individual or firm must not introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any new drug unless an approved NDA or ANDA is in effect for that drug product. If an individual or firm compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act, those drug products would be subject to the new drug approval requirements.\n\n3.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIn accordance with section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 201.5, drug products that are not labeled with adequate directions for use are misbranded. If an individual or firm compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act, those drug products would be subject to the requirements for adequate directions for use.\n\nIn addition to sections 501(a)(2)(B), 502(f)(1), and 505 of the FD&C Act, an individual or firm that compounds any drug products that do not meet the conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act would be subject to the requirements listed in section IV.A, above, as well as other requirements of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations.\n\nEnforcement Approach\n\nGenerally, FDA expects to employ a risk-based enforcement approach with respect to violative compounded drugs, giving the highest enforcement priority to compounded drugs and violations of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations that pose the greatest public health risks. However, FDA emphasizes that it need not identify a particular safety problem before pursuing enforcement action.\n--------------------\nContext title: Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 4.113295078277588", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry , Can substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n--------------------\nContext: Section 503A Bulks List\n\nFinal Rule\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\n(Small Entity Compliance Guide)\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nMay 2019\n\nCompoundingSection 503A Bulks List Final Rule Questions and Answers\n\nGuidance for Industry\n\n(Small Entity Compliance Guide)\n\nAdditional copies are available from:\n\nOffice of Communications, Division of Drug Information Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Food and Drug Administration 10001 New Hampshire Ave., Hillandale Bldg., 4th Floor Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002 Phone: 855-543-3784 or 301-796-3400; Fax: 301-431-6353 Email: druginfo@fda.hhs.gov http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nMay 2019\n\nCompounding\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]\n\nSection 503A Bulks List Final Rule\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nGuidance for Industry1\n\nFootnote 1: This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Regulatory Policy and the Office of Unapproved Drug Labeling Compliance in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n(Small Entity Compliance Guide)\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public.

To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to help small businesses better understand and comply with the final rule establishing the list of bulk drug substances2 that can be used in compounding under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 353a) (final rule or 503A Bulks List Final Rule). On February 19, 2019 (84 FR 4696), FDA published a final rule that establishes FDA's criteria for evaluating bulk drug substances for inclusion on the list of bulk drug substances that may be used to compound drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act (the 503A Bulks List or the list) and that places six substances on the list. The final rule, entitled \"List of Bulk Drug Substances That Can Be Used To Compound Drug Products in Accordance With Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,\" also identifies four substances that were considered for and not included on the list.\n\nFootnote 2: FDA is evaluating bulk drug substances nominated for the 503A Bulks List on a rolling basis and intends to address additional substances in future rulemaking.\n\nThe 503A Bulks List Final Rule is effective March 21, 2019. FDA has prepared this guidance in accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28)3 to assist small businesses in complying with the 503A Bulks List Final Rule.\n\nFootnote 3: 5 U.S.C. 601.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.\n\nInstead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nSection 503A of the FD&C Act describes the conditions under which a compounded drug product qualifies for exemptions from certain requirements of the FD&C Act related to FDA approval prior to marketing, current good manufacturing practice requirements, and labeling with adequate directions for use. One of the conditions that must be met for a compounded drug product to qualify for these exemptions is that a licensed pharmacist in a State-licensed pharmacy or Federal facility or a licensed physician compounds the drug product using bulk drug substances that (1) comply with the standards of an applicable United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or National Formulary monograph, if a monograph exists, and the USP chapter on pharmacy compounding; (2) if such a monograph does not exist, are drug substances that are components of drugs approved by FDA; or (3) if such a monograph does not exist and the drug substance is not a component of a drug approved by FDA, appear on a list of bulk drug substances developed by FDA through regulation.4\n\nFootnote 4: See section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 353a(b)(1)(A)(i)).\n\nAs noted above, the 503A Bulks List Final Rule establishes criteria for evaluating bulk drug substances for inclusion on the 503A Bulks List, identifies six bulk drug substances FDA is placing on the list, and identifies four other bulk drug substances that were considered and are not being included on the 503A Bulks List.\n\nIII Questions and Answers\n\nWhat active ingredients are subject to this final rule?\n\nThe 503A Bulks List Final Rule addresses only 10 of the substances nominated for the 503A Bulks List. The final rule identifies six bulk drug substances FDA is placing on the list: Brilliant Blue G, also known as Coomassiee Brilliant Blue G-250; cantharidin (for topical use only); diphenylcyclopropone (for topical use only); N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG) (for topical use only); squaric acid dibutyl ester (for topical use only); and thymol iodide (for topical use only). The final rule also identifies four other bulk drug substances that are not being included on the list: oxitriptan, piracetam, silver protein mild, and tranilast.\n\nAlthough only the 10 substances listed above are specifically addressed in the final rule, the criteria for evaluation identified in the final rule will be applied to all bulk drug substances that are considered for the 503A Bulks List.\n\nCan substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule be used in compounding under 503A?\n\nNo. As stated above, section 503A provides compounded drug products with exemptions from certain requirements of the FD&C Act, including premarket approval, but only when those compounded drug products meet the conditions of section 503A. A compounded drug product that includes one of the four bulk drug substances that are not being placed on the list would not meet those conditions and therefore would not qualify for the exemptions from the FD&C Act.\n\nIn addition, as described in the Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry,5 substances that have been evaluated and not placed on the 503A Bulks List no longer qualify for the interim policy concerning compounding with bulk drug substances.\n\nFootnote 5: We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, be sure to check the Agency\u2019s guidance website at http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/FDABasicsforIndustry/ucm234622.htm.\n\nQ3. What should I do if I am a pharmacist and I receive a prescription for a compounded drug product that includes one of the four bulk drug substances that is not being placed on the 503A Bulks List as part of this final rule?\n\nA drug product compounded using a bulk drug substance that is identified in a final rule as not being placed on the 503A Bulks List does not qualify for the exemptions under section 503A of the FD&C Act. Compounding with any of the four substances identified in the 503A Bulks List Final Rule, or with substances identified in any other final rule as not being placed on the 503A Bulks List, may subject the compounder to regulatory action.\n\nQ4. When and how do compounders have to comply with this final rule?\n\nThe 503A Bulks List Final Rule is effective March 21, 2019. As of that date, drug products compounded using any of the four bulk drug substances that are identified as not being included on the list do not qualify for the exemptions under 503A of the FD&C Act. Drug products compounded using one of the six bulk drug substances that are on the list will qualify for the exemptions under section 503A of the FD&C Act provided the drug products are compounded in compliance with the other conditions of section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ5. Going forward, how will FDA decide whether to place a bulk drug substance on the 503A Bulks List?\n\nAs described in the final rule, FDA is evaluating nominated bulk drug substances using four criteria: the physical and chemical characteristics of the substance, the safety of the substance in compounded drug products, evidence of effectiveness, and historical use of the substance in compounded drug products. As required by section 503A of the FD&C Act, FDA is consulting with the Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee (PCAC) and USP regarding the 503A Bulks List and is developing the list through notice and comment rulemaking.\n\nQ6. Why did FDA find the four substances it is not placing on the 503A Bulks List to be inappropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act?\n\nFor reasons described at length in the proposed rule that published on December 16, 2016 (81 FR 91071), entitled \"List of Bulk Drug Substances That Can Be Used To Compound Drug Products in Accordance With Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,\" and in the briefing materials presented to the PCAC, applying the four criteria identified in Question 5 above, FDA determined that these four substances are not appropriate for use in compounding drug products under section 503A of the FD&C Act.\n\nQ7.

Section 503A of the FD&C Act includes certain restrictions on the bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding and directs FDA to develop a list of bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding under that section. FDA is developing this list of bulk drug substances (the 503A bulks list), and this guidance describes FDA's interim regulatory policy for licensed pharmacists in State-licensed pharmacies and Federal facilities and for licensed physicians that compound human drug products using bulk drug substances while the list is being developed.2,3\n\nFootnote 2: This guidance does not apply to drugs compounded from bulk drug substances for use in animals. For proposed policies pertaining to compounding drug products from bulk drug substances for use in animals, see FDA\u2019s draft guidance, Compounding Animal Drugs from Bulk Drug Substances.\n\nAll FDA guidances are available on the FDA guidance web page. FDA updates guidances regularly. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, always consult the guidance web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformationGuidances/default.htm.\n\nIn general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Background\n\nCompounding From Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Act\n\nSection 503A of the FD&C Act describes the conditions that must be satisfied for human drug products compounded by a licensed pharmacist in a State-licensed pharmacy or Federal facility, or by a licensed physician, to be exempt from the following three sections of the FD&C Act: section 505 (concerning the approval of drugs under new drug applications or abbreviated new drug applications); section 502(f)(1) (concerning the labeling of drugs with adequate directions for use); and section 501(a)(2)(B) (concerning current good manufacturing practice requirements).\n\nOne of the conditions that must be met for a compounded drug product to qualify for these exemptions is that a licensed pharmacist, or licensed physician compounds the drug product using bulk drug substances that:\n\nComply with the standards of an applicable United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or National Formulary (NF) monograph, if a monograph exists, and the USP chapter on pharmacy compounding;\n\nIf such a monograph does not exist, are drug substances that are components of drugs approved by the Secretary; or\n\nIf such a monograph does not exist and the drug substance is not a component of a drug approved by the Secretary, appears on a list developed by the Secretary through regulations issued by the Secretary under subsection (c) of section 503A.4 Footnote 4: See Section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act.\n\nA bulk drug substance is defined as meaning \"the same as active pharmaceutical ingredient as defined in 21 CFR 207.1(b).\" See 21 CFR 207.3. Active pharmaceutical ingredient is defined as \"any substance that is intended for incorporation into a finished drug product and is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body,\" but the term \"does not include intermediates used in the synthesis of the substance\" (see section 503A(b)(1)(A) and 21 CFR 207.3).5({}^{,})6 FDA has interpreted \"an applicable USP or NFmonograph\" to mean an official USP or NF drug substance monograph. Accordingly, FDA does not consider USP monographs for dietary supplements to be \"applicable\" USP or NF monographs within the meaning of section 503A(b)(1)(A)(i)(I).\n\nUnder section 503A(c)(1), before developing this list through regulation, FDA must convene and consult an advisory committee on compounding unless FDA determines that the issuance of such regulation before consultation with the advisory committee is necessary to protect the public health. FDA must also consult with USP when promulgating the regulations.7 The criteria for determining which bulk drug substances should appear on the section 503A bulks list \"shall include historical use, reports in peer reviewed medical literature, or other criteria the Secretary may identify.\"8\n\nFootnote 7: See section 503A(c)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nBulk drug substances used in compounding under section 503A must also meet certain other requirements, including: (1) the bulk drug substance must be manufactured by an establishment registered under section 510 of the FD&C Act and (2) the bulk drug substance must be accompanied by a valid certificate of analysis (COA).9\n\nFootnote 8: See section 503A(c)(2) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIn July 2014, FDA issued a guidance, Pharmacy Compounding of Human Drug Products Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that states:\n\nUntil a bulk drug substances list is published in the Federal Register as a final rule, human drug products should be compounded using only bulk drug substances that are components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, or are the subject of USP or NF monographs.10\n\nFootnote 9: See section 503A(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act.\n\nFDA has received comments that this policy could be causing unnecessary and inappropriate disruptions in patient care because there are patients receiving drugs compounded with bulk drug substances that are not components of FDA-approved drugs, or the subject of an applicable USP or NF monograph, but that may ultimately be included on the 503A bulks list, and those patients' care should not be disrupted while the list is under development. After considering this issue, FDA has decided to use this guidance to describe its interim policy concerning compounding with bulk drug substances while the 503A bulks list is being developed. FDA has revised the July 2014 guidance to state:\n\nFDA's interim policy concerning bulk drug substances that are not components of drugs approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or that are not the subject of applicable USP or NF monographs can be found in the guidance, Interim Policy on _Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nCompounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n--------------------\nContext title: Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.1836352348327637"], "As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: Consequently, in appropriate cases, FDA may take additional steps within its authority to assure that pediatric use information is included in biological product labeling.12 Such actions may include invoking the \"marketed drugs\" provision under PREA, in certain circumstances, to require sponsors to conduct pediatric assessments, or take other appropriate steps, to support pediatric labeling for both the biosimilar product and the reference product.13\n\nFootnote 13: See section 505B(b) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIf a biosimilar applicant believes that none of the situations described above apply to its proposed product, the applicant should contact FDA for further information.\n\nQ.I.17: When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n\n[Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n\nA.I.17. Section 505B(e) of the FD&C Act requires applicants subject to PREA to submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP) before the date on which the applicant\n\nsubmits the required assessments or investigation, and no later than 60 calendar days after the date of an end-of-phase 2 (EOP2) meeting or at such other time as agreed upon by FDA and the applicant. FDA has issued guidance on the PSP\n\nprocess, including the timing of PSP submission.14\n\nFootnote 14: See the guidance for industry Pediatric Study Plans: Content of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans (July 2020).\n\nSections 505B(e)(2)(C) and 505B(e)(3) of the FD&C Act set forth a process for reaching agreement between an applicant and FDA on an initial PSP that generally lasts up to 210 days. Given the potential length of this process, and in the absence of an EOP2 meeting for a proposed biosimilar product, FDA\n\nrecommends that if a sponsor has not already initiated a comparative clinical study intended to address the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I)(cc) of the PHS Act, the sponsor should submit an initial PSP as soon as feasible, but no later than 210 days before initiating such a study. This is intended to provide adequate time to reach agreement with FDA on the initial PSP before the study is initiated. Depending on the details of the clinical program, it may be appropriate to submit an initial PSP earlier in development. FDA encourages the sponsor to meet with FDA to discuss the details of the planned development program before submission of the initial PSP.\n\nFor additional information on submission of the PSP, including a PSP template, please refer to:\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResource\n\ns/ucm049867.htm. After the initial PSP is submitted, FDA and the sponsor work to reach timely agreement on the plan; this process is set forth in section\n\n505B(e)(2)-(3) of the FD&C Act. FDA does not formally grant or deny a request for a waiver or deferral in response to the initial PSP.\n\nQ.I.18: For biological products intended to be injected, how can an applicant demonstrate that its proposed biosimilar product has the same dosage form as the reference product? [Final December 2018]\n\nA.I.18. Under section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the PHS Act, an applicant must demonstrate that the \"dosage form\" of the proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product is the same as that of the reference product. For purposes of implementing this statutory provision, FDA considers the dosage form to be the physical manifestation containing the active and inactive ingredients that delivers a dose of the drug product. In the context of proposed biosimilar products intended to be injected, FDA considers, for example, \"injection\" (e.g., a solution) to be a different dosage form from \"for injection\" (e.g., a lyophilized powder). Thus, if the dosage form of the reference product is \"injection,\" an applicant could not obtain licensure of a proposed biosimilar product with a dosage form of \"for injection\" even if the applicant demonstrated that the proposed biosimilar product, when constituted or reconstituted, could meet the other requirements for an application for a proposed biosimilar product.\n\nFor purposes of section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the PHS Act, FDA also considers emulsions and suspensions of products intended to be injected to be distinct dosage forms. Liposomes, lipid complexes, and products with extended-release characteristics present special scenarios due to their unique composition, and prospective applicants seeking further information should contact FDA.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that this interpretation regarding the same dosage form is for purposes of section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(IV) of the PHS Act only. For example, this interpretation should not be cited by applicants seeking approval of a new drug application under section 505(c) of the FD&C Act, approval of an abbreviated new drug application under section 505(j) of the FD&C Act, or licensure of a BLA under section 351(a) of the PHS Act for purposes of determining whether separate applications should be submitted and assessed separate fees for different dosage forms.\n\nQ.I.19: If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]\n\nA.I.19. A sponsor may submit a single IND application for a development program that is intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act and includes use of a non-U.S.-licensed product. The sponsor should submit information supporting the proposed clinical investigation with the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product under the IND application. This scenario may occur, for example, if a sponsor seeks to use data from a clinical study comparingits proposed biosimilar product to a non-U.S.-licensed product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act, and proposes to conduct a clinical PK study, with PD data, as appropriate, in the United States with all three products (i.e., the proposed biosimilar product, the U.S.-licensed reference product, and the non-U.S.-licensed product) to support establishment of a bridge between all three products and scientific justification for the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity to the U.S.-licensed reference product.\n\nA non-U.S.-licensed comparator product is considered an investigational new drug in the United States, and thus would require an IND application for importation and use in the United States (see 21 CFR 312.110(a)). If a sponsor intends to conduct a clinical investigation in the United States using a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product, the IND requirements in 21 CFR part 312 also would apply to this product (see, e.g., 21 CFR 312.2).\n\nWith respect to chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) information, a sponsor should submit to the IND application as much of the CMC information required by 21 CFR 312.23(a)(7) as is available. However, FDA recognizes that a sponsor may not be able to obtain all of the CMC information required by 21 CFR 312.23(a)(7) for a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product for which it is not the manufacturer. In these circumstances, the sponsor can request in an IND submission that FDA waive the regulatory requirements related to CMC information on the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product (21 CFR 312.10). The waiver request must include at least one of the following:\n\nAn explanation why compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.23(a)(7) is unnecessary or cannot be achieved\n\nInformation that will satisfy the purpose of the requirement by helping to ensure that the investigational new drug will have the proper identity, strength, quality, and purity\n\nOther information justifying a waiver15 Footnote 15: See 21 CFR 312.10(a).\n\nInformation that is relevant to whether the investigational new drug will have the proper identity, strength, quality, and purity may include, for example, information indicating whether the investigational new drug has been licensed by a regulatory authority that has similar scientific and regulatory standards as FDA (e.g., ICH countries). This should include, to the greatest extent possible, summary approval information and current product labeling made public by the foreign regulatory authority. In addition, a sponsor should also provide information on the conditions and containers that will be used to transport the drug product to the U.S. clinical site(s) and information on the relabeling and repackaging operations that will be used to relabel the drug product vials for investigational use. This should include information on how exposure of the product to light and temperature conditions outside of the recommended storage conditions will be prevented. A risk assessment on the impact the relabeling operations may have on drug product stability should also be included.\n\nThe sponsor should consult with the appropriate FDA review division regarding the CMC information necessary to support the proposed clinical study.\n\nAs would be applicable to all investigational new drugs, FDA reminds sponsors that the investigator brochure (IB) for studies to be conducted under the IND application should be carefully prepared to ensure that it is not misleading, erroneous, or materially incomplete, which can be a basis for a clinical hold (see 21 CFR 312.42(b)(1)(iii) and (b)(2)(i)). For example, the term reference product should be used in the IB only to refer to the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which the proposed product is evaluated for purposes of submitting a 351(k) application.\n--------------------\nContext title: Questions and Answers on Biosimilar Development and the BPCI Act Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.529213905334473", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 22: See section 505B(e)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(2)(A).\n\nThe sponsor should submit the iPSP to the relevant drug's IND for review by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research as appropriate. In cases where the sponsor has no active IND for the drug but the sponsor expects to open the IND with an initial phase 3 study, the sponsor should submit the iPSP as a pre-IND submission. In this situation, the FDA encourages the sponsor to schedule a pre-IND meeting before submission of the iPSP, and such submission should precede initiation of any phase 3 studies or combined phase 2 and phase 3 studies. In cases where the drug development program includes the possibility of using expedited programs,23 the FDA encourages the sponsor to have discussions about the pediatric development plans with the review division as early as possible.\n\nFootnote 23: For further information on expedited programs, see the guidance for industry Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions\u2014Drugs and Biologics (May 2014).\n\nAfter the sponsor submits an iPSP, the FDA has 90 days to review the iPSP and provide a written response to the iPSP, or meet with the sponsor to discuss the iPSP, as appropriate.24 This review process includes consultation with FDA's internal Pediatric Review Committee (PeRC).25 The sponsor then has a second 90-day period during which it may review FDA comments and initiate any needed negotiations to discuss the iPSP. By the end of this second 90-day review period, the sponsor must submit an agreed iPSP.26 The FDA then has 30 days after receipt of the agreed iPSP to review and issue correspondence confirming agreement or issue correspondence stating disagreement.27 If the FDA does not agree, the iPSP is considered a non-agreed iPSP (see section VIII., Non-Agreed Initial PSPs). The total length of time forreview of an iPSP should not exceed 210 days. A sponsor should not submit a marketing application or supplement until the FDA confirms agreement on the iPSP.\n\nV Content of the Initial Psp\n\nThe FD&C Act requires that an iPSP include \"(i) an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct (including, to the extent practicable, study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints, and statistical approach); (ii) any request for a deferral, partial waiver, or waiver (\\ldots) if applicable, along with any supporting information; and (iii) other information specified in the regulations\" issued by the FDA.28 This section of the guidance describes information that is required or recommended to be included in the iPSP submission. In certain situations, it may be premature to include a detailed outline of a planned pediatric study (or studies) because additional data are needed (e.g., efficacy, safety, potential endpoints). In such cases, the outline of the pediatric studies should include a brief explanation for the lack of more detailed information. The sponsor receives feedback at the time of the review of the iPSP on the planned request for waivers and/or deferrals. For example, the FDA feedback may indicate concurrence with the planned deferral and/or waiver or, if FDA does not concur, include recommendations for the sponsor on the timing of pediatric drug development and on whether to include pediatric data in the initial marketing application instead of obtaining a deferral. However, FDA does not make a formal decision about granting a waiver and/or deferral of required pediatric assessments, or reports on the molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation, until the time of the approval of the marketing application.\n\nFootnote 28: See section 505B(e)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(2)(B).\n\nAppendix: Initial Pediatric Study Plan Template provides a template that we recommend sponsors complete for the iPSP submission.29 The FDA acknowledges that the development program for a drug, including the design of the pediatric studies, may change as the sponsor collects new data from nonclinical studies, clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs (e.g., data from drugs in the same or similar class). The iPSP should include a well-constructed pediatric plan based upon current knowledge of the drug and disease epidemiology; sponsors can submit amendments to an agreed iPSP at any time,30 including changes to the pediatric plan that need to be considered based on additional data described above (see also section VII., Content and Timing of Requested Amendment to an Initial PSP).\n\nFootnote 29: The template also is available at https://www.fda.gov/media/84944/download.\n\nFootnote 30: See section 505B(e)(5) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(5).\n\nIn addition, sponsors can include information in the iPSP (see section 2 in section V.B., Recommendations for the Content of Each Section of the iPSP) about plans for submission of a concurrent or future proposed pediatric study request (PPSR), as appropriate. However, the sponsor should submit the iPSP and PPSR as separate documents to facilitate the FDA's appropriate review and comment.\n\n2.2.1 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nAlthough, as stated above, the FDA does not make a formal decision about granting a waiver and/or deferral of required pediatric assessments or reports on the molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation until approval of the marketing application, the FDA considers the information contained in an agreed iPSP when considering any requests for waiver and/or deferral at the time of the marketing application review.\n\nMaterially Incomplete iPPs\n\nFailure to include required information may result in an iPSP that the FDA considers materially incomplete. For example, if a sponsor fails to address all pediatric age groups and all indications for which the drug is being developed that are subject to PREA, the FDA generally considers the iPSP to be materially incomplete.31 Additionally, if a sponsor fails to provide justification for any planned waivers or deferrals, the FDA may consider the iPSP to be materially incomplete. If the iPSP is considered materially incomplete, the FDA intends to contact the sponsor, and the sponsor should submit a complete iPSP within 30 days to address the identified deficiencies. A new 210-day review period will start when the sponsor submits a complete iPSP.32\n\nFootnote 31: The FDA anticipates that there will be additional considerations for applications described in section 505B(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act that require submission of reports on the molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation described in section 505B(a)(3) of the FD&C Act.

When finalized, these guidances will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on these topics.\n\nHowever, if the sponsor includes sufficient information for the FDA to evaluate the plan, even if the FDA disagrees with the proposed plan, the FDA in general considers the iPSP to be sufficient for initial review. For example, if a sponsor includes a plan to request a full waiver with a justification and the FDA disagrees with this plan, the FDA does not intend to consider such disagreement as grounds for a determination that the iPSP is materially incomplete.\n\nRecommendations for the Contents of Each Section of the iPSP\n\nThis section provides specific recommendations for the content of each section of the iPSP.\n\nTitle Page\n\nSponsors should include relevant administrative information on the title page (e.g., drug name, IND number, indication or indications that apply) (see Appendix: Initial Pediatric Study Plan Template).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n1 Overview of the Disease/Condition in the Pediatric Population\n\nThis section should briefly summarize (1 to 3 pages)33 available information on the pathophysiology of the disease, methods of diagnosis, and currently available treatments and/or prevention strategies in the pediatric population, including neonates.

Additionally, the sponsor should discuss current understanding of and available evidence supporting any similarities and differences between the disease in adults and in the pediatric population.\n\nFootnote 33: The recommended page count for each section of the iPSP applies to the overall iPSP and not to the individual active ingredients in the case of a fixed-dose combination product.\n\n2 Overview of the Drug or Biological Product\n--------------------\nContext title: Pediatric Study Plans- Content of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 3.1133360862731934", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: Pediatric Study Plans:\n\nContent of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans Guidance for Industry\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)\n\nJuly 2020\n\nProcedural\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nAbstract\n\nThis guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on this topic.

To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nContents Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nI Introduction\n\nThe purpose of this guidance is to provide recommendations to sponsors regarding the submission of an initial pediatric study plan (iPSP) and any amendments to the iPSP. Specifically, this guidance provides the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding implementation of the requirement for sponsors to submit an iPSP, described in section 505B(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).\n\nThis guidance addresses the following:\n\nApplications for which an iPSP is required\n\nTiming of an iPSP submission\n\nContent of an iPSP\n\nContent and timing of a requested amendment to an agreed iPSP\n\nA template that is recommend to be used for an iPSP submission2\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]\n\ngiven by the FDA at the end-of-phase 1 meeting, for drugs for life-threatening diseases,7 and at the end-of-phase 2 meeting, for other drugs.8\n\nFootnote 7: See 21 CFR 312.81(a).\n\nFootnote 8: For additional information on end-of-phase 1 meetings and end-of-phase 2 meetings, see 21 CFR 312.47(b) and 312.82(b).\n\nThe pediatric rule also stated that sponsors should submit, at least 1 month in advance of the end-of-phase 2 meeting, certain background information, including a proposed timeline for protocol finalization, enrollment, completion, and data analysis, or, in the alternative, information to support a planned request for waiver or deferral. However, on October 17, 2002, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia held that the FDA had exceeded its statutory authority when issuing the pediatric rule and the court enjoined the rule's enforcement.9\n\nFootnote 9: Association of Am. Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. v. FDA, 226 F. Supp. 2d 204, 222 (D.D.C. 2002).\n\nCongress subsequently passed PREA, which was signed into law on December 3, 2003.10 Many of the provisions described under the pediatric rule were adopted under PREA. Under PREA as originally enacted and under its reauthorization under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007,11 a sponsor was not required to submit a proposed timeline and plan for the submission of pediatric studies during the investigational new drug application (IND) phase of drug development. Under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), signed into law on July 9, 2012, for the first time PREA12 includes a provision that requires a sponsor planning to submit an application for a drug subject to PREA to submit an iPSP early in the development process.13 The intent of the iPSP is for a sponsor to identify needed pediatric studies early in development and begin planning for these studies. Early dialogue with the FDA on a comprehensive pediatric development plan, including both required pediatric studies under PREA and potential pediatric uses under the BPCA, is intended to result in a more efficient pediatric drug development program. The timing and content of the submission of an iPSP are described below. The FD&C Act, as amended by FDASIA, requires the FDA to issue regulations and guidance to implement these and other provisions.14\n\nFootnote 10: Public Law 108-155, 117 Stat. 1936 (Dec. 3, 2003).\n\nFootnote 11: Public Law 110-85, 121 Stat. 823 (Sept. 27, 2007).\n\nFootnote 12: By convention, section 505B is often referred to as PREA, after the act that added that section to the FD&C Act. We follow that naming convention in this guidance.\n\nThe FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA), further updated PREA with respect to certain drugs intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target determined to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer, and for which an original marketing application is submitted on or after August 18, 2020.15\n\nFootnote 15: Public Law 115-52, 131 Stat. 1005 (Aug. 18, 2017).

In the absence of an end-of-phase 2 meeting, the sponsor should submit the iPSP as early as practicable but before the initiation of any phase 3 studies, or any combined phase 2 and phase 3 studies, of the drug that is the subject of the iPSP. If a phase 3 study, or a combined phase 2 and phase 3 study, will not be conducted or will be conducted but not under IND, the sponsor should submit the iPSP no later than 210 calendar days before it submits a marketing application or supplement. Sponsors should contact the appropriate component of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research if they believe exceptional circumstances exist.\n\nFootnote 22: See section 505B(e)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(2)(A).\n\nThe sponsor should submit the iPSP to the relevant drug's IND for review by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research as appropriate. In cases where the sponsor has no active IND for the drug but the sponsor expects to open the IND with an initial phase 3 study, the sponsor should submit the iPSP as a pre-IND submission. In this situation, the FDA encourages the sponsor to schedule a pre-IND meeting before submission of the iPSP, and such submission should precede initiation of any phase 3 studies or combined phase 2 and phase 3 studies. In cases where the drug development program includes the possibility of using expedited programs,23 the FDA encourages the sponsor to have discussions about the pediatric development plans with the review division as early as possible.\n\nFootnote 23: For further information on expedited programs, see the guidance for industry Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions\u2014Drugs and Biologics (May 2014).\n--------------------\nContext title: Pediatric Study Plans- Content of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.0075278282165527", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: When a sponsor is not able to develop an appropriate pediatric formulation for an age group.\n\nFor studies of subsequently developed (i.e., later-generation) products with the identical mechanism of action when ongoing, competing studies in the pediatric population are being or have been conducted and when there is no convincing evidence that the new active ingredient would provide a superior pharmacologic, toxicity, or activity profile when compared to products with the same molecular mechanism of action already studied or under investigation, potentially resulting in a very small number of patients available to participate in a new investigation.\n\nWhen a drug or drugs with the same mechanism of action directed at the same molecular target expressed in the same cancer(s) in children has/have failed to demonstrate evidence of activity.\n\n.4.2 Deferrals\n\nFDA may defer submission of reports on the investigation when the criteria set forth in section 505B(a)(4) of the FD&C Act are met. Although decisions about each application will be made based on the facts of that application, a deferral of submission may be appropriate in the following circumstances (note that this is not an exhaustive list):31\n\nFootnote 31: To qualify for a deferral, the applicant must submit (i) certification of the grounds for deferring the assessments or reports on the investigation; (ii) a pediatric study plan as described in section 505B(e) of the FD&C Act; (iii) evidence that the studies are being conducted or will be conducted with due diligence and at the earliest possible time; and (iv) a timeline for the completion of such studies. Section 505B(a)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act.\n\nIf the pediatric study(ies) should be delayed until additional safety or effectiveness data have been collected; for example:\n\nuntil sufficient non-clinical evidence demonstrates tumor response to the known inhibition of a defined molecular target(s) or pathway.\n\nwhen there is uncertainty regarding whether the activity of a drug occurs only in combination with another agent, until such time that one or more biologically rational combinations demonstrate an effect.\n(\\circ) until additional clinical evidence of safety or effectiveness of the drug has been collected. (\\bullet) Until such time that an appropriate pediatric formulation for investigational purposes is available, provided there has been due diligence in formulation development. (\\bullet) If the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before the pediatric study(ies) is completed.\n\nIV Global Implications and International Collaboration\n\nFDA recognizes the global scope of drug development and strongly encourages all stakeholders to support internationally coordinated and collaborative approaches to development of drugs to treat cancers in pediatric patients. Due to the rarity of pediatric cancers, which are frequently being subdivided into even rarer subpopulations based on underlying molecular features, international collaboration is increasingly important for facilitating the development of new treatments. Furthermore, the number of investigational drugs of potential interest far exceeds the number of pediatric patients available to enroll in clinical trials. Therefore, global coordination is increasingly important for prioritizing drugs of interest in general and for specific cancers in pediatric patients, especially for drugs of the same class, for early pediatric evaluation. This aids in preventing duplication of studies and competition for scarce patients and limiting unnecessary exposure of pediatric patients to investigational drugs.\n\nThe following opportunities exist to facilitate coordinated, global approaches to pediatric development:\n\n*Pediatric Cluster Teleconferences\n\nInformal at least monthly teleconferences between the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), together with representatives from Health Canada, the Japanese Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency, and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration coordinated by FDA's Office of Pediatric Therapeutics.\n\nProvide opportunities for high-level scientific discussion of issues relating to development of specific drug products. Relevant documents and information are shared between participating regulatory agencies under the terms of existing confidentiality agreements.\n\nRegulatory agencies may request that a particular topic be placed on the agenda for discussion. Sponsors are informed of specific comments resulting from the discussions and may receive details of the discussions after the teleconference.\n\nSponsors also can submit a request to either the FDA (to either the appropriate review division or office or the Oncology Center of Excellence Pediatric Oncology Program) or EMA that their drug product - or more generally, the appropriateness of potential indications by drug class - be considered for discussion.\n\nCommon Commentary Process\n\nEstablished by FDA and the EMA to inform sponsors of the outcome of scientific exchanges related to select drug products or topics discussed at Pediatric Cluster teleconferences.\n\nIs intended to facilitate early sponsor interactions with the relevant agencies and neither alter nor replace routine review procedures.\n\nFDA recommends this mechanism for high level scientific review of early pediatric development plans and reaching consensus, when possible, to facilitate alignment of advice to sponsors seeking uniformity of design concepts for iPSPs and Pediatric Investigation Plans (PIPs).\n\nApplies to drug products for which a pediatric development plan is contemplated or has been submitted to both FDA and the EMA and is under review, preferably early in the regulatory process.\n\nFDA or EMA can nominate a product or topic for discussion.\n\nFDA has assumed primary responsibility for drafting a document that summarizes the discussion and generally includes recommendations. After review and clearance by both agencies, the Common Commentary document is shared with the sponsor. This document is nonbinding, and it does not provide final regulatory decisions.\n\nSponsors may advise the appropriate review division or office or the OCE Pediatric Oncology Program that they wish to have their product's iPSP (and PIP, if already submitted to EMA) and their proposed global pediatric development be the subject of a Common Commentary. Sponsors may seek FDA clarification following receipt of the Common Commentary by requesting a Type C meeting with the review division or office.\n\nFormal Parallel Scientific Advice (PSA)\n\nProvides formal mechanism for provision of concurrent exchange of advice from EMA assessors and FDA reviewers with sponsors on scientific issues to optimize drug development.\n\nConsideration of PSA and a request for this process should be made to the appropriate review division or office early and well in advance of the submission of the iPSP in order to help avoid any possible delay in submission of the NDA/BLA due to the failure to reach agreement on the iPSP.\n\nInformation regarding the PSA procedure, including how to apply, is available.32 Footnote 32: GENERAL PRINCIPLES EMA-FDA PARALLEL SCIENTIFIC ADVICE (HUMAN MEDICIONAL PRODUCTS) https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofGlobalRegulatoryOperationsandPolicy/OfficeofInternationalPrograms/UCM557100.pdf.\n\nAdditionally, FDA encourages participation in international multi-stakeholder meetings such as the Pediatric Strategy Forums organized by the ACCELERATE Platform33 and other international meetings or conferences which bring sponsors, investigators, patient advocates, andregulators together to discuss development strategies for specific pediatric cancers in the context of the number of investigational drugs available for assessment and the highly variable unmet medical needs of distinct pediatric populations with specific childhood cancers. We recommend stakeholders, including sponsors, investigators, and patient advocates consider coordinating early multi-stakeholder input to inform decision-making related to the initial pediatric clinical evaluation of appropriate investigational drugs to both avoid unnecessary duplication and provide an efficient framework for a longer-term development strategy of promising new drugs. An international perspective on clinical trial feasibility and the extent of unmet clinical need, as well as the scientific rationale for early evaluation and continued development of a class of molecularly targeted products or individual investigational drugs may help inform appropriate development plans of promising drugs for children with cancer globally.\n--------------------\nContext title: FDARA Implementation Guidance for Pediatric Studies of Molecularly Targeted Oncology Drugs- Amendments to Sec. 505B of the FD&C Act Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.19835719466209412", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: VI Relationship of Agreed Initial Psp to the Requirement to Submit a Pediatric Study Plan with an Application\n\nFor NDAs, BLAs, or supplemental applications subject to PREA, sponsors must include an agreed iPSP in the application when a deferral of pediatric studies is requested.54 In such cases, submission of the iPSP (specifically, the agreed iPSP) fulfills the requirement of the sponsor to submit a pediatric study plan, which must be included in the appropriate section of the application.55 Failure to fulfill the requirement to submit a pediatric study plan with the application may be grounds for refusal to file an application.56 Any planned requests for waivers and/or deferrals included in the iPSP serve as the official request with the application submission.57 The PeRC will review any requests for waivers and/or deferrals and make recommendations as needed to the review division.58 A final decision about granting or denying such requests is made by the review division at the time of approval of the marketing application.\n\nFootnote 54: See sections 505B(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II), 505B(a)(1) and 505B(e) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II), 355c(a)(1), and 355c(e).\n\nFootnote 55: See sections 505B(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and 505B(e)(3) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and 355c(e)(3).\n\nVII Content and Timing of Requested Amendment to an Initial Psp\n\nSponsors can request an amendment to an agreed iPSP at any time. Requests can include, for example, changing a date listed in section 11 of the iPSP that would significantly delay the initiation and/or completion of pediatric studies (e.g., by more than 12 months), changing planned requests for a deferral to planned requests for a waiver or partial waiver, or changing a planned request for a waiver or partial waiver to a planned request for a deferral. For example, emerging safety data from nonclinical juvenile animal studies and/or adult human clinical trials may support converting a planned request for a deferral to a planned request for a waiver for reasons of safety. Alternatively, the need for additional safety data from adult human clinical trials may support a delay in the initiation of pediatric clinical trials. In addition, formulation data could necessitate a change in a development program. The PeRC will be consulted on the review of significant amendments to an agreed iPSP.59\n\nFootnote 59: See section 505B(e)(6) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(6).\n\nA request for an amendment to an agreed iPSP should include the following:\n\nThe requested change(s) supported with a justification\n\nA copy of the agreed iPSP with the requested change(s) tracked and clearly identified\n\nA clean copy of the proposed amended iPSP\n\nAmendments should not be considered agreed upon until the FDA issues a letter stating that the amendments are acceptable.\n\nOnce the FDA accepts for filing an application or supplemental application, it is not necessary to submit amendments to the iPSP because changes to the plan for pediatric development can be negotiated during the review cycle as appropriate. For example, a sponsor submits a marketing application with an agreed iPSP, and the review division files the application. The sponsor proposes to modify the timeline for studies after filing the application; in this case, it is not necessary to submit an amended iPSP, but instead the newly proposed timeline can be negotiated with the review division during the review cycle of the application.\n\nThe timeline for submission, review, and agreement on an amended iPSP is the same as on an iPSP.60 (See Section IV., Timing of an Initial PSP Submission). If the FDA does not agree to the amended iPSP, the original agreed iPSP remains in force. If the sponsor submits an amendment to an agreed iPSP within 210 days of the planned submission of an NDA, BLA, or supplement, the amendment may not be considered agreed absent sufficient time for the FDA review. However, the sponsor may submit the NDA, BLA, or supplement with the previously agreed iPSP. FDA intends to, as appropriate, consider changes to the plan for pediatric development during the application review cycle (see section VIII., Non-Agreed Initial PSPs).\n\nFootnote 60: See section 505B(e)(5) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(e)(5).\n\nHowever, if, under certain situations, the agreed iPSP included nonclinical and/or pediatric clinical studies that were expected to have been completed before submission of the NDA, BLA, or supplement, failure of the sponsor to complete these agreed studies in a timely manner may result in a refusal to file.61 In this situation, a sponsor should submit a request for an amendment to the agreed iPSP that includes an updated timeline for the studies and justification for the delay in completing one or more of the agreed pediatric studies. If the FDA considers the justification for the delay to be inadequate and does not agree with the proposed iPSP amendment, the agreed iPSP would remain in force until the FDA and sponsor agree on an amended iPSP (See Section VIII., Non-Agreed Initial PSPs), and the failure of the sponsor to complete the agreed nonclinical and/or pediatric clinical studies in a timely manner still may result in a refusal to file.\n\nFootnote 61: See section 505B(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 355c(a)(1)), which requires that the assessments or reports on the molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation be submitted with the application or supplement to which PREA applies. See also 21 CFR 314.101(d).\n\nVIII Non-Agreed Initial PSPs\n\nIf the FDA and the sponsor are unable to reach agreement on an iPSP at the end of the 210-day review period, the FDA intends to issue a letter stating that the iPSP is considered a non-agreed iPSP. As discussed in section IX., Reaching Agreement on the Non-Agreed Initial PSP, there is no established timeline for the review and agreement of a non-agreed iPSP. Therefore, sponsors are encouraged to work with FDA to reach agreement during the initial 210-day review period.\n\nIf the FDA and the sponsor are unable to reach agreement on the proposed amendments to an agreed iPSP, the FDA intends to issue a letter stating that the amended iPSP is considered a non-agreed amended iPSP. Under this circumstance, the agreed iPSP would be considered to be in force until the FDA and sponsor agree on an amended iPSP.\n\nAs stated above, for NDAs, BLAs, or supplemental applications subject to PREA, sponsors must include an agreed iPSP in the application when a deferral of pediatric studies is requested, and the failure to submit an agreed iPSP when a deferral is requested may be grounds for refusal to file the application.62 All correspondence with the FDA regarding any non-agreed amendments should be included in the appropriate section of the application.\n\nFootnote 62: See sections 505B(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II), 505B(a)(1), and 505B(e) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II), 355c(a)(1), and 355c(e). See also 21 CFR 314.101(d).\n\nIX Reaching Agreement on the Non-Agreed Initial Psp\n\nWhen a sponsor receives a letter of nonagreement, the FDA makes every effort to work with the sponsor and resolve the area(s) of disagreement as quickly as possible; however, no statutory timeline is attached to this process. If the sponsor disagrees with the FDA's recommendations, the sponsor can request a meeting with the FDA. After the sponsor and the FDA have resolved any disagreements, the sponsor should submit the proposed agreed iPSP for FDA review.\n\nAppendix: Initial pediatrictic study plan template1\n\nFootnote 1: This template is also available at https://www.fda.gov/media/84944/download.\n\nWhen submitting an initial pediatrictic study plan (iPSP), sponsors should mark the submission \"INITIAL pediatrictic STUDY PLAN\" in large, bolded type at the beginning of the title page. For an agreed iPSP or amended iPSP, sponsors should mark the submission \"PROPOSED AGREED PEDIATRIC STUDY PLAN\" or \"AMENDED PEDIATRIC STUDY PLAN,\" respectively, in large, bolded type at the beginning of the title page.\n\nINITIAL pediatrictic STUDY PLAN TITLE PAGE\n\nThe proprietary name and the established name of the drug, if any, or, for biological products, the proper name including any appropriate descriptors\n\nDosage form:\n\nNDA/BLA/IND (#):\n\nDrug class:\n\nApproved indication (if applicable):\n\nProposed indication (if applicable):\n\nProposed General Plan: (i.e., full or partial waiver, deferral, and inclusion of a pediatric assessment or molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation in the future application)\n\nCross-reference to other investigational new drug applications for which an iPSP is submitted for this drug development program\n\nOVERVIEW OF THE DISEASE/CONDITION IN THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION (1-3 pages)\n\nOVERVIEW OF THE DRUG OR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT (1-3 pages)\n\nOVERVIEW OF PLANNED EXTRAPOLATION TO SPECIFIC PEDIATRIC POPULATIONS (1-3 pages)\n\nPLANNED REQUEST FOR DRUG-SPECIFIC WAIVER(S) (1-3 pages)\n\nPLANNED REQUEST FOR DEEFRAL(S) OF PEDIATRIC STUDIES (1-2 pages)Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nTABULAR SUMMARY OF PLANNED NONCLINICAL AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nAGE-APPROPRIATE FORMULATION DEVELOPMENT (1-3 pages)\n\nNONCLINICAL STUDIES (1-3 pages)\n\nCLINICAL DATA TO SUPPORT DESIGN AND/OR INITITATION OF STUDIES IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS (1-5 pages)\n\nPLANNED PEDIATRIC CLINICAL STUDIES\n\n1 Pediatric Pharmacokinetic or Pharmacokine/Pharmacodynamic Studies (1-10 pages)\n\n2 Clinical Effectiveness and Safety Studies (1-10 pages)\n\nTIMELINE OF THE PEDIATRIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN (1 page)\n\nAGREEMENTS FOR PEDIATRIC STUDIES WITH OTHER REGULATORY AuthorITIES (1-3 pages)\n\nIf there is a pending or agreed pediatric investigational plan with EMA (European Medicines Agency), sponsors should provide the corresponding application number (e.g., EMEA-000206-PIP01-08).\n--------------------\nContext title: Pediatric Study Plans- Content of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 0.17980723083019257", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: As per the details in Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry , When should a proposed biosimilar product applicant submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP)?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 35: See sections 505B(a)(1), 505B(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II), and 505B(e) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(a)(1), 355c(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II), and 355c(e).\n\nIf new information, such as data from ongoing or planned studies, indicates that a criterion for a waiver (or partial waiver) is met, the sponsor can change planned requests for deferral of pediatric assessments or reports on the molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation in the iPSP to planned requests for waiver (or partial waiver). The sponsor should submit these changes as an amendment to an agreed or amended iPSP.\n\nAt the time of approval of an application, the FDA may grant a deferral of required pediatric assessments or reports on the molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation if it finds that: (1) the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete; (2) pediatric studies should be delayed until additional safety or effectiveness data have been collected; or (3) there is another appropriate reason for deferral.46 The planned request for a deferral should list the proposed deferred studies in the same order as they are presented in the table in section 6 of the iPSP.\n\nFootnote 46: See section 505B(a)(4)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(a)(4)(A)(i). In addition, the sponsor must submit: (1) a certification of the grounds for deferring the assessments or reports on the molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation; (2) an iPSP; (3) evidence that the studies are being conducted or will be conducted with due diligence and at the earliest possible time; and (4) a timeline for the completion of the studies. See section 505B(a)(4)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 355c(a)(4)(A)(ii).\n\nThe planned request for a deferral should include adequate justification and any currently available evidence supporting the justification for a deferral (1 to 2 pages). If the FDA agrees that a plan for a deferral is reasonable early in the preapproval development period (e.g., end-of-phase 1 or end-of-phase 2 meeting), such agreement would reflect the FDA's best judgment at that time.\n\nIf the sponsor becomes aware of new or additional information that affects the decision to plan for any deferral of pediatric assessments or reports on the molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigation, the sponsor should reconsider the agreed iPSP and should submit an amended iPSP at the earliest possible time. The FDA may also request that the sponsor amend the iPSP to reflect any new information (see section VI., Relationship of Agreed Initial PSP to the Requirement to Submit a Pediatric Study Plan with an Application).\n\n6 Tabular Summary of Planned Nonclinical and Clinical Development\n\nThis section should include a summary in tabular form of all planned: (1) nonclinical development to be conducted in support of the proposed pediatric clinical trials (see also section 8); and (2) clinical pediatric development (categorized by age). The table should include a column to identify whether the sponsor plans to request a deferral of the study (i.e., the sponsor does not plan to submit the data until after FDA approves the application). The table should also include any age groups for which the sponsor plans to request waivers. An example table is included below. The table is provided as an example only. The specific studies planned for a specific drug (e.g., the type of studies, the age groups studied) may differ from those studies listed in the example table.\n\nCase example: Drug X is a new drug under development in adults for disease Y. The sponsor is seeking a partial waiver of pediatric studies required under PREA for patients less than 2 years of age because necessary studies are impossible or highly impracticable. The rarity of the diagnosis in children less than 2 years of age is supported by literature data. The course of disease Y and the effects of drugs in this class are expected to be sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients. However, the similarity of the exposure-response relationship between the two populations is not known. Therefore, the sponsor is proposing to include adolescents 12 to less than 17 years of age in the adult trial and is not seeking a deferral request. In patients 2 to less than 12 years of age, the sponsor plans to conduct a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) study followed by an efficacy/safety study. The sponsor is proposing stratification by body size in the phase 2 PK/PD study as age is not expected to be a significant covariate for PK or PD for the drug. The sponsor did not propose further stratification by age for the efficacy/safety study in patients 2 to less than 12 years of age. The following is an example table based on this case:\n\nEXAMPLE TABLE: Table of Nonclinical and Clinical Development for Drug X\n\nMay not be applicable for all drugs.\n\n** See section 11 of the Initial Pediatric Study Plan Template.\n\nPK = pharmacokinetic; PD = pharmacodynamic; R = randomized; DB = double-blind; PC = placebo-controlled\n\nNote: A table generated for a specific drug may not be the same as the sample case above and should be based on the planned studies needed for the drug.\n\n7 Age-Appropriate Formulation Development\n\nIf the current formulation is not suitable for all pediatric age groups, sponsors should provide specific plans for the development of an age-appropriate formulation for all pediatric age groups that will be studied. In this section (1 to 3 pages), sponsors should include information regarding planned excipients, to the extent practicable, which will be contained in any pediatric formulation being developed. Sponsors also should provide details of measures taken to ensure appropriate design of a drug formulation, including, to the extent practicable, the design of delivery systems (e.g., capsules, tablets, infusions, devices) to be used in pediatric studies.47\n\nFootnote 47: For more on considerations for age-appropriate formulations, see the 2014 European Medicines Agency Guideline on Pharmaceutical Development of Medicines for Pediatric Use, available at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/research-development/paediatric-medicines/paediatric-investigation-plans/paediatric-formulations.\n\n8 Nonclinical Studies\n\nThis section should provide a brief summary (1 to 3 pages) of the data from relevant nonclinical studies that support the use of the drug in all pediatric age groups the sponsor will study in the proposed clinical trials. The sponsor should include information that supports the maximum dose and duration of treatment to be used in pediatric studies. If the sponsor has determined that the nonclinical data are sufficient to support the proposed clinical trials and additional nonclinical studies are not planned, this summary should include such a statement and justification for this conclusion. If a sponsor plans to conduct a juvenile animal study, we recommend sponsors contact the review division for feedback before initiating this study.\n\nIf the existing nonclinical data are not sufficient to support the proposed clinical trials,48 sponsors should provide a brief description for each of the nonclinical studies they will conduct, including, at a minimum the following:\n\nFootnote 48: We support the principles of the 3Rs (reduce/refine/replace) for animal use in testing when feasible. The FDA encourages sponsors to consult with review divisions when considering a nonanimal testing method believed to be suitable, adequate, validated, and feasible. The FDA will consider if the alternative method could be assessed for equivalency to an animal test method.\n\nThe species to be studied\n\nThe age of animals at the start of dosing\n\nThe duration of dosing\n\nThe route of administration\n\nThe target organ systems of concern with key developmental endpoints to be evaluated, as appropriate\n\n6.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor further information see other guidances, as appropriate.49\n\nFootnote 49: See the guidance for industry Nonclinical Safety Evaluation of Pediatric Drug Products (February 2006) and the ICH guidances for industry M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals (January 2010) and S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals (March 2010).\n\nSponsors should also list the planned nonclinical studies in the table in section 6 and note (as described in section 11) the timeline for conduct of any such studies.\n\n9 Clinical Data to Support Design and/or Initiation of Studies in Pediatric Patients\n\nThis section should provide a brief summary (1 to 5 pages) of any clinical data that support the design or initiation of pediatric studies. This section also should include a summary of available data in adult or pediatric patients who have received treatment with the drug (or related drugs) for the proposed indication, for other conditions, or in earlier studies. This section is intended to provide an overview of information already available to support design or initiation of pediatric studies; therefore, a detailed review of available data is not needed in this section.\n\n10.

For approved indications, new information on efficacy/effectiveness under conditions of actual use should also be described in this section, if available. New information about efficacy/effectiveness in uses other than the approved indication(s) should not be included, unless relevant for the benefit-risk evaluation in the approved indication. Information on indications approved during the reporting interval should also be included in this section. The level of detail provided in this section should be sufficient to support the characterisation of benefit in Section 17.3 and the benefit-risk assessment in Section 18.\n\nNew information on efficacy/effectiveness might also include changes in the therapeutic environment that could impact efficacy/effectiveness over time, e.g., vaccines, emergence of resistance to anti-infective agents.\n\n3.17.3 Characterisation of Benefits\n\nSection 17.3 of the PBRER provides an integration of the baseline benefit information (see Section 3.17.1) and any relevant new benefit information (see Section 3.17.2) that became available during the reporting interval for approved indications.\n\nThis section should provide a concise but critical evaluation of the strengths and limitations of the evidence on efficacy/effectiveness, considering the following, when available:\n\nA brief description of the strength of evidence of benefit, considering comparator(s), effect size, statistical rigor, methodological strengths and deficiencies, and consistency of findings across trials/studies;\n\nNew information that challenges the validity of a surrogate endpoint, if used;\n\nClinical relevance of the effect size;\n\nGeneralizability of treatment response across the indicated patient population, e.g., information that demonstrates lack of treatment effect in a sub-population;\n\nAdequacy of characterization of dose-response;\n\nDuration of effect;\n\nComparative efficacy; and\n\nA determination of the extent to which efficacy findings from clinical trials are generalizable to patient populations treated in medical practice.\n\nThe level of detail provided in PBRER Section 17.3 should be sufficient to support the analysis of benefit-risk in Section 18.\n\nWhen there are no new relevant benefit data, this section should provide a characterisation of the information in Section 17.1 of the PBRER.\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.1780378818511963", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , What efficacy/effectiveness information should be presented in section 17.1 (Important Baseline Efficacy/Effectiveness Information) of the PBRER?\n--------------------\nContext: If stipulated by applicable regional requirements, the MAH should provide, in a regional appendix, information on any final, ongoing, or proposed changes to the national or local authorised product information.\n\nLevel of Detail Within PBRER\n\nThe level of detail provided in certain sections of the PBRER should depend on the medicinal product's known or emerging important benefits and risks. This approach is applicable to those sections of the PBRER in which there is evaluation of safety data, efficacy/effectiveness data, safety signals, and benefit-risk. Therefore, the extent of information provided in such PBRER sections will vary among individual PBRERs.\n\nFor example, when there is important new safety information, a detailed presentation of that information should be included, plus the relevant benefit information, in order to facilitate a robust benefit-risk analysis. Conversely, when little new important safety information has become available during the reporting interval, a concise summary of baseline benefit information should be sufficient, and the benefit-risk evaluation would consist primarily of an evaluation of updated interval safety data.\n\nEfficacy/Effectiveness\n\nFor the purpose of this Guideline, evidence on benefits in clinical trials and in everyday medical practice should be reported. Because the terms are not harmonized across regions, the terms \"efficacy/effectiveness\" are used in this Guideline to clarify that information from both clinical trials and everyday medical practice are within the scope of the information on benefit to be included within the PBRER. In some regions, efficacy refers to evidence of benefit from controlled clinical trials while effectiveness implies use in everyday medical practice. Conversely, in other regions, this distinction is not made.\n\nBenefit-Risk Evaluation\n\nWhen a drug is approved for marketing, a conclusion has been reached that, when used in accordance with approved product information, its benefits outweigh its risks. As new information about the drug emerges during marketing experience, benefit-risk evaluation should be carried out to determine whether benefits continue to outweigh risks, and to consider whether steps need to be taken to improve the benefit-risk balance through risk minimisation activities, e.g., labelling changes, communications with prescribers, or other steps.\n\nPeriodicity and PBRER Data Lock Point\n\n2.8.1 International Birth Date and Data Lock Point\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 1.494058609008789", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , What efficacy/effectiveness information should be presented in section 17.1 (Important Baseline Efficacy/Effectiveness Information) of the PBRER?\n--------------------\nContext: When available, based on contractual agreements, the MAH should summarise significant findings from periodic reports provided during the reporting interval by other parties (e.g., sponsors, MAHs, other contractual partners).\n\nLack of Efficacy in Controlled Clinical Trials\n\nData from clinical trials indicating lack of efficacy, or lack of efficacy relative to established therapy(ies), for products intended to treat or prevent serious or life-threatening illnesses (e.g., excess cardiovascular adverse events in a trial of a new anti-platelet drug for acute coronary syndromes) could reflect a significant risk to the treated population and should be summarised in this section.\n\nLate-Breaking Information\n\nThis section should summarise information on potentially important safety and efficacy/effectiveness findings that arise after the DLP but while the PBRER is in preparation. Examples include clinically significant new publications, important follow-up data, clinically relevant toxicological findings and any action that the MAH, a data monitoring committee, or a regulatory authority has taken for safety reasons. New individual case reports should not be included unless they are considered to constitute an important index case (i.e., the first instance of an important event), an important safety signal, or where they may add information to the evaluation of safety concerns already presented in the PBRER (e.g., a well documented and unconfounded case report of aplastic anaemia in a medicinal product known to be associated with adverse effects on the bone marrow).\n\nAny significant change proposed to the reference product information which has occurred after the DLP of the report but before submission should also be included in this section, where feasible. Such changes could include a new contraindication, warning/precaution, or new adverse drug reaction.\n\nThe data presented in this section should also be taken into account in the evaluation of risks and new information (see Section 3.16.3 of this Guideline).\n\nOverview of Signals: New, Ongoing, or Closed\n--------------------\nContext title: E2C_R2_Guideline\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.4014118015766144", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: In light of the details from Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report) , What efficacy/effectiveness information should be presented in section 17.1 (Important Baseline Efficacy/Effectiveness Information) of the PBRER?\n--------------------\nContext: Study ID (e.g., protocol number or other identifier);\n\nStudy title (abbreviated study title, if applicable);\n\nStudy type (e.g., randomized clinical trial, cohort study, case-control study);\n\nPopulation studied (including country and other relevant population descriptors, e.g., paediatric population or trial subjects with impaired renal function);* Study start (as defined by the MAH) and projected completion dates;\n\nOngoing (clinical trial has begun);\n\nCompleted (clinical study report is finalised).\n\n3.7.1 Completed Clinical Trials\n\nSection 7.1 of the PBRER should provide a brief summary of clinically important emerging efficacy and safety findings obtained from clinical trials completed during the reporting interval.

Which regulations contain provisions relevant to the IVD industry?\n\nListed below are some of the regulations that implement the Act and that are relevant to IVDs covered by this guidance. See Table 1 (Appendix 1) for additional information.

For example:\n\n610.40, Test Requirements (Testing Requirements for Communicable\n\nDisease Agents)\n\n610.42, Restrictions on Use for Further Manufacture of Medical Devices\n\n2. How do I determine the applicability of the IDE regulation to my IVD study?\n\nWe recommend that you begin with the exemptions in 21 CFR 812.2(c). Your\n\nproposed IVD study is exempt from most provisions of the IDE regulation if it fits any one of the following three categories:\n\na. The IVD is a pre-amendments device (i.e., a device that was in\n\ncommercial distribution prior to the enactment of the 1976 Medical\n\nDevice Amendments to the Act), other than a transitional device (see the\n\nGlossary for definition), and is used or investigated according to the\n\nindications in the labeling at that time.\n\nb. The IVD is a device, other than a transitional device, that has been\n\nfound to be substantially equivalent to a pre-amendments device and is\n\nused or investigated according to the indications in the labeling reviewed\n\nby FDA in determining substantial equivalence.\n\nc. The IVD\n\n({}^{\\star}) is properly labeled in accordance with 21 CFR 809.10(c);\n\n({}^{\\star}) is noninvasive (see question #5 below);\n\n({}^{\\star}) does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents\n\nsignificant risk (see question #4 below);\n\n({}^{\\star}) does not by design or intention introduce energy into a subject;\n\nand(\\bullet) is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure (see question # 6 below).\n\nFor your study to be exempt from most of the requirements of the IDE regulation under this third category, it must meet all of the conditions listed in \"c\" above. (See also the decision tree in Appendix 1.) You should refer to 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 for applicable requirements relating to IRBs and informed consent, including for device studies that meet the criteria described in 21 CFR 812.2(c). Additionally, investigators for those studies are still subject to 21 CFR 812.119 (the provision entitled \"Disqualification of a clinical investigator.\")\n\nIf your proposed study does not fit into one of the three categories listed above, you, the sponsor, must have an approved IDE (21 CFR 812.2) before you may begin your investigation, including any shipment of your investigational IVD. (Note: A device that is approved under a premarket approval application (PMA) or cleared under a 510(k) and then used in a study in accordance with the approved or cleared labeling is not investigational and, therefore, is not subject to the IDE regulation.)\n\nThe requirements for an IDE depend on the level of risk that the study presents to subjects.\n\nFor a significant risk device (see the Glossary for definition), the sponsor must apply to FDA for an IDE approval (see 21 CFR 812.1, 812.20). For a non-significant risk device (see the Glossary for definition), the sponsor must meet the abbreviated requirements of 21 CFR 812.2(b), including review and approval of the investigation by an institutional review board (IRB) and compliance with informed consent requirements. A non-significant risk study is considered to have an approved IDE when the abbreviated requirements are met.\n\nNote: The requirements of the \"Protection of Human Subjects\" and \"Institutional Review Boards\" regulations (21 CFR Parts 50 and 56) apply to all clinical investigations regulated by FDA under section 520(g) of the Act, as well as other clinical investigations that support applications for research or marketing permits. (21 CFR 50.1, 56.101; see also Section V, Human Subject Protection, of this guidance.) Therefore, all studies of investigational IVDs that will support applications to FDA are subject to 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, even if they are not subject to most requirements of 21 CFR Part 812.\n\n3. How do I determine if the study is a significant or non-significant risk study under 21 CFR 812.2(b)?A significant risk IVD device is generally one that is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to health, safety, or welfare of a subject. 21 CFR 812.3(m).\n\nFor IVDs, we interpret \"potential for serious risk\" in relation to the nature of the harm that may result to the subject. Misdiagnosis and/or error in treatment caused by inaccurate test results would be considered a significant risk if the potential harm to the subject could be life-threatening, or could result in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to the body structure.\n\nFalse positive results can lead to unnecessary confirmatory testing, unnecessary treatment that can be invasive or have harmful side effects, and/or unnecessary psychological trauma when serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions are involved. False negative results can lead to a delay in establishing the correct diagnosis, failure to start or continue needed treatment, false security that may prevent timely follow-up and retesting, and contribute to the potential spread of infectious agents to others. If the potential risk does not rise to the level described above, the study is not considered to pose a significant risk. FDA recommends the sponsor consider all these factors when determining the risk associated with your investigational IVD. (See 21 CFR 812.3(m) and also \"Information Sheet Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors,\" available at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/Guida\n\nncesInformationSheetsandNotices/ucm113709.htm, particularly the one on\n\n\"Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Devices\" at\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo\n\ncuments/ucm126622.htm.)\n\nHow do I determine if an invasive sampling technique presents a significant risk under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3)?\n\nTo determine whether an invasive sampling technique presents a serious risk, we recommend that you base your risk determination on the nature of the harm that may result from sampling. For example, FDA considers sampling techniques that require biopsy of a major organ, use of general anesthesia, or placement of a blood access line into an artery or large vein (subclavian, femoral, or iliac) to present a significant risk.\n\n5 What does noninvasive mean?\n\nA noninvasive device is one that does not, by design or intention:\n\na. penetrate or pierce the skin or mucous membranes of the body, the ocular cavity, or the urethra; or b. enter the ear beyond the external auditory canal, the nose beyond the nares, the mouth beyond the pharynx, the anal canal beyond the rectum, or the vagina beyond the cervical os.\n\n(21 CFR 812.3(k)).\n\nBlood sampling that involves simple venipuncture is considered noninvasive, and the use of surplus samples of body fluids or tissues that are left over from samples taken for noninvestigational purposes is also considered noninvasive (21 CFR 812.3(k)).\n\n6. What does it mean to have \"confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure?\"\n\nFor an investigational study to be exempt under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3), clinical investigators must use a medically established means of diagnosis (e.g., another cleared or approved IVD or culture) of the disease or condition as the basis for decisions regarding treatment of all subjects participating in the study. 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3)(iv). Additionally, test results from the exempt IVD investigation should not influence patient treatment or clinical management decisions before the diagnosis is established by a medically established product or procedure.\n\nIf an investigational test uses a new technology or represents a significant technological advance, established diagnostic products or procedures may not be adequate to confirm the diagnosis provided by the investigational IVD. For example, if an investigational test is designed to identify an infection at the earliest stages of viral infection (before formation of antibodies), established diagnostic products or procedures that rely on the detection of antibodies to the virus would be inadequate to confirm diagnoses. Under these conditions the study would not meet the criteria for exemption under 812.2(c)(3) since the testing could not be confirmed with a medically established diagnostic product or procedure. You may consider whether the device is a non-significant risk device subject to abbreviated IDE requirements (21 CFR 812.2(b)).\n\n7. What if no medically established means for diagnosing the disease or condition exists?\n--------------------\nContext title: In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies - Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.1731656789779663", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: 3.2 Are IDE exempt studies subject to the requirements for informed consent and IRB review and approval under Parts 50 and 56?\n\nIf an exempt study is being conducted to collect data to support either a clinical investigation or a marketing application, then the study must comply with 21 CFR Part 50 and should comply with 21 CFR Part 56. 21 CFR 50.1(a), 21 CFR 50.20, 21 CFR 56.101(a), 21 CFR 56.103.\n\n3.3.3 Does FDA require IRB review and approval of off-label use of a legally marketed device?\n\nNo, when a physician uses a legally marketed device outside its labeling to treat a patient and no research is being done, IRB review is not required. Note: Although not required by FDA, an IRB may still decide on its own initiative to review such use. Yes, when the off-label use of a legally marketed device is part of a research study collecting safety and effectiveness data involving human subjects, IRB review and approval is required (21 CFR 812.2(a)).\n\nFor additional information on the off-label use of devices, see the FDA Information Sheet guidance, \" 'Off-label' and Investigational Use of Marketed Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices.\"6\n\nFootnote 6: This guidance can be found at: www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/offlabel.html\n\nMust an IRB review a study conducted after submission of a (510(k)) to FDA but prior to FDA's decision on that submission?\n\nYes. During FDA's review of the premarket notification submission, the device remains an investigational product. Therefore, the human subject protection (informed consent and additional safeguards for children in research), IRB, and IDE regulations apply. The device may not be distributed, except for investigational use, unless FDA clears the device for marketing.\n\n16 Can a physician use an unapproved device in an emergency?\n\nIn general, an unapproved medical device may be used only on human subjects when the device is under clinical investigation and when used by investigators participating in a clinical trial. Section 561 of the Act, however, recognizes that there may be circumstances under which a health care provider may wish to use an unapproved device to save the life of a patient or to prevent irreversible morbidity when there exists no other alternative therapy. For investigational devices under an IDE, the IDE regulation permits deviations from the investigational plan without prior approval when necessary to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency. (See 21 CFR 812.35(a)). A physician may treat a patient with an unapproved medical device in an emergency situation if he/she concludes that:\n\nThe patient has a life-threatening condition that needs immediate treatment;7 Footnote 7: FDA considers \u201clife-threatening condition\u201d to include serious diseases or conditions such as sight-threatening and limb-threatening conditions as well as other situations involving risk of irreversible morbidity.\n\nNo generally acceptable alternative treatment for the condition exists; and\n\nBecause of the immediate need to use the device, there is no time to use existing procedures to get FDA approval for the use.\n\nFDA expects the physician to make the determination that the patient's circumstances meet the above criteria, to assess the potential for benefit from the use of the unapproved device, and to have substantial reason to believe that benefits will exist. In the event that a device is used in circumstances meeting the criteria listed above, the physician should follow as many of the patient protection procedures listed below as possible:\n\nInformed consent from the patient or a legal representative;\n\nClearance from the institution as specified by their policies;Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nConcurrence of the IRB chairperson;\n\nAn assessment from a physician who is not participating in the study; and\n\nAuthorization from the IDE sponsor, if an IDE exists for the device.\n\nWhile prior approval for shipment or emergency use of the investigational device is not required, the use must be reported to FDA by the IDE sponsor within 5 working days from the time the sponsor learns of the use. 21 CFR 812.35(a)(2) and 812.150(a)(4). The report should contain a summary of the conditions constituting the emergency, patient outcome information, and the patient protection measures that were followed. If no IDE exists, the physician should follow the above procedures and report the emergency use to CDRH or CBER.\n\nFor additional information on the procedures physicians and IRBs should follow in an emergency use situation, please see Chapter III Expanded Access to Unapproved Devices of the guidance entitled, \"IDE Policies and Procedures.\"8\n\nFootnote 8: This guidance may be found at: www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/idepolcy.html\n\nWhat if the situation is not an emergency? Can a patient with a serious illness or condition have access to an investigational device outside a study?\n\nYes, FDA recognizes that there are circumstances in which an investigational device is the only option available for a patient faced with a serious or life-threatening condition (hereinafter referred to as \"compassionate use\"). Unlike emergency use of an unapproved device discussed above, prior FDA approval is needed before compassionate use occurs. Section 561(b) of the act and 21 CFR 812.35. In order to obtain agency approval, the sponsor should submit an IDE supplement requesting approval for a protocol deviation under section 812.35(a) in order to treat the patient. The IDE supplement should include:\n\nA description of the patient's condition and the circumstances necessitating treatment;\n\nA discussion of why alternatives therapies are unsatisfactory and why the probable risk of using the investigational device is no greater than the probable risk from the disease or condition;\n\nAn identification of any deviations in the approved clinical protocol that may be needed in order to treat the patient; and\n\nThe patient protection measures listed above that will be followed.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nThe patient identified in the supplement should not be treated with the device until FDA approves its use under the proposed circumstances. In reviewing this type of request, FDA will consider the above information as well as whether the preliminary evidence of safety and effectiveness justifies such use and whether such use would interfere with the conduct of a clinical trial to support marketing approval.\n\nIf the request is approved, the attending physician should devise an appropriate schedule for monitoring the patient, taking into consideration the investigational nature of the device and the specific needs of the patient. The patient should be monitored to detect any possible problems arising from the use of the device. Following the compassionate use of the device, a follow-up report should be submitted to FDA in which summary information regarding patient outcome is presented. If any problems occurred as a result of device use, they should be discussed in the supplement and reported to the reviewing IRB as soon as possible.\n\nAdditional information on the procedures physicians and IRBs should follow in compassionate use situations may be found in Chapter III Expanded Access to Unapproved Devices of the guidance entitled, \"IDE Policies and Procedures.\"9\n\nFootnote 9: This guidance may be found at: www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/idepolcy.html\n\n18 What is the definition of a custom device?\n\nTo be considered a custom device, the device must meet all of the following criteria, which are described in section 520(b) of the act and at 21 CFR 812.3(b):\n\n(1) It necessarily deviates from devices generally available or from an applicable performance standard or premarket approval requirement in order to comply with the order of an individual physician or dentist;\n\n(2) The device is not generally available to, or generally used by, other physicians or dentists;\n\n(3) It is not generally available in finished form for purchase or for dispensing upon prescription;\n\n(4) It is not offered for commercial distribution through labeling or advertising; and\n\n(5) It is intended for use by an individual patient named in the order form of a physician or dentist, and is to be made in a specific form for that patient, or is intended to meet the special needs of the physician or dentist in the course of professional practice (such as a particular operating tool).\n\n19 Does an IRB need to review custom use?\n\nFDA regulations do not require review and approval for custom device use. However, FDA recommends that as many of the patient protection measures listed in paragraph 16 be followed as possible. IRBs should be familiar with the regulatory requirements for custom devicesbecause physicians or institutions may seek information from the IRB about the use of a custom device in patients at their healthcare facility. IRBs may develop procedures for the use of custom devices to ensure that patient protection measures are thoughtfully carried out.\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Devices Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.23762583732605", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: 2. What is the ASR rule?\n\nThis guidance document refers to three regulations as \"the ASR rule.\" Published in 1997, the regulations define and classify ASRs (21 CFR 864.4020), impose restrictions on the sale, distribution, and use of ASRs (21 CFR 809.30), and establish requirements for ASR labeling (21 CFR 809.10(e)).\n\n3. What was the objective of the ASR rule?\n\nThe ASR rule was designed to accomplish several policy objectives. One of the primary goals of the rule was to ensure the quality of the primary, active reagents of finished IVDs or LDTs. Another focus of the rule is the requirement for appropriate labeling to be appended to test results when ASRs are used by clinical laboratories in LDTs, so that healthcare users can understand when tests are being developed and validated by the laboratory and have not undergone FDA clearance or approval. 62 FR 62244. FDA adopted the approach of regulating most ASRs by means of general controls and exempting them from premarket notification requirements as the least burdensome approach. This approach relies primarily on cGMPs, medical device reporting, and labeling requirements to adequately control the risks associated with these devices. In addition, laboratories that develop tests using ASRs must be in compliance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. 263a 62 FR 62252.\n\n4. What does the ASR rule require?\n\nThe rule classifies most ASRs as Class I devices subject to general controls under section 513(a)(1)(A) of the Act, but exempt from premarket notification. The general controls require ASR manufacturers to register and list their devices, 21 CFR 807.20(a), submit medical device reports (21 CFR Part 803), follow labeling requirements, 21 CFR 809.10(e), and follow cGMPs, 21 CFR 809.20(b). The rule also restricts the sale, use, distribution, labeling, advertising and promotion of ASRs. 21 CFR 809.30. One of these restrictions allows only physicians and other persons authorized by applicable State law to order LDTs that are developed using ASRs. 21 CFR 809.30(f). Another restriction requires the laboratory that develops an LDT using an ASR to add a statement disclosing that the laboratory developed the test and it has not been cleared or approved by FDA when reporting the test result to the practitioner. 21 CFR 809.30(e).\n\nThe restrictions also prohibit advertising and promotional materials for ASRs from making any claims for clinical or analytical performance. 21 CFR 809.30(d)(4). Consistent with this restriction, the labeling for Class I, exempt ASRs must bear the statement, \"Analytic Specific Reagent. Analytical and performance characteristics are not established.\" 21 CFR 809.10(e)(1)(x). Manufacturers who wish to make analytical and/or clinical performance claims for a product should submit an application to FDA for premarket review rather than marketing the product as an ASR. For example, performance claims might include statements such as, \"This ASR can be used for quantification of [an analyte] to determine [a diagnosis]\".\n\n5 Are some ASRs Class II or Class III, requiring a premarket submission?\n\nYes. Although most ASRs are Class I, there are some ASRs that are Class II and Class III and that must be cleared or approved by FDA before they can be marketed in the United States. 21 CFR 864.4020. FDA classifies medical devices, including diagnostic devices such as ASRs, into Class I, II, or III according to the level of regulatory control that is necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. These classifications include consideration of the level of risk associated with the device. 21 U.S.C. 360c. The classification of an ASR determines the appropriate premarket process.\n\nAn ASR is a Class II device if the reagent is used as a component in a blood banking test of a type that has been classified as a Class II device (e.g., certain cytomegalovirus serological and treponema pallidum nontreponemal test reagents). 21 CFR 864.4020(b)(2).\n\nAn ASR is a Class III device if the reagent is intended as a component in tests intended either:\n\nto diagnose a contagious condition that is highly likely to result in a fatal outcome and prompt, accurate diagnosis offers the opportunity to mitigate the public health impact of the condition (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV/AIDS) or tuberculosis (TB)); or\n\nfor use in donor screening for conditions for which FDA has recommended or required testing in order to safeguard the blood supply or establish the safe use of blood and blood products (e.g., tests for hepatitis or for identifying blood groups). 21 CFR 864.4020(b)(3).\n\nFDA considers ASRs intended to be used as a component in tests for diagnosis of HIV (including monitoring for viral load or HIV drug resistance mutations) to be Class III ASRs.\n\n6 How does a manufacturer know whether its device is an ASR?\n\nWe recommend that ASR manufacturers consult this document for guidance on whether their product is or is not within the scope of the ASR rule. Manufacturers should contact FDA if they are unsure about the classification of their device to discuss any applicable regulatory requirements. Manufacturers who wish to obtain FDA advice on this matter in advance of marketing may consult with OIVD, or, with CBER for questions about HIV ASRs or ASRs for blood or cellular and tissue products.\n\nContains Non-Binding Recommendations\n\nII. What Meets the ASR Definition?\n\nThere has been some confusion about which products fall within and outside the definition of an ASR. Some of this confusion relates to a misunderstanding that a product is an ASR if it is labeled as one, even if the product contains analytical or clinical performance claims and does not meet the definition of an ASR.\n\nIn the preamble to the ASR rule, FDA stated that ASRs are the \"active ingredients\" of tests that are used to identify one specific disease or condition. ASRs are purchased by manufacturers who use them as components of tests that are cleared or approved by FDA and also by clinical laboratories that use the ASRs to develop LDTs used exclusively by that laboratory. 62 FR 62243, 62244. This is in contrast to what the preamble referred to as a \"kit or system for 'in vitro diagnostic use\" that has a proposed intended use, indications for use, instructions for use, and performance characteristics. 62 FR 62243, 62250.\n\nThe ASR rule was intended to require that ASR manufacturers take certain actions, such as following cGMPs, to help ensure the quality of these reagents so that IVD manufacturers and laboratories who purchase them can produce tests that are safe and effective. A premise underlying the rule, however, is that laboratories and IVD manufacturers, rather than ASR manufacturers, design and develop the test in which the ASR is used, using their judgment and knowledge, and provide all necessary verification and validation.\n\nBased upon this description, together with the ASR definition, FDA views an ASR as having the following characteristics:\n\nused to detect a single ligand or target (e.g., protein, single nucleotide change, epitope);\n\nnot labeled with instructions for use or performance claims; and\n\nnot promoted for use on specific designated instruments or in specific tests.\n\n7. What are some examples of entities that FDA considers to be ASRs?\n\nExamples of entities that are ASRs include:\n\na single antibody (e.g., an anti-troponin I polyclonal or monoclonal antibody, whether untagged or tagged, e.g., conjugated to horseradish peroxidase),\n\na single forward/reverse oligonucleotide primer1 pair (e.g., a primer pair for amplification of a single amplicon, such as for amplification of the (\\Delta)F508 locus of the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR)), or single forward or reverse primer individually,Contains Non-Binding Recommendations\n\na nucleic acid probe2 (whether untagged or tagged, e.g., conjugated to biotin or Cytm3) intended to bind a single complementary amplified or unamplified nucleic acid sequence, Footnote 2: For the purposes of this guidance, a probe is defined as a molecule that is intended to isolate, bind, or identify a specific target or ligand.\n\na single purified protein or peptide (e.g., purified B-type natriuretic peptide).\n\nThe above-listed examples would not be considered ASRs if they are marketed with clinical or analytical performance claims (e.g., quantification of an infectious agent, assessment of cardiac risk).\n\nIn addition to the examples listed here, there may be other products that can be appropriately marketed as ASRs provided they meet the criteria listed above, i.e., the ASR is used to detect a single ligand or target (e.g., protein, single nucleotide change, epitope), is not labeled with instructions for use or performance claims, and is not promoted for use on specific designated instruments or in specific tests. In the future, with the development of novel technologies, there may be products that meet the definition of an ASR (21 CFR 864.4020) that are dissimilar to the examples listed above. In those cases, ASR manufacturers should contact FDA with questions about specific products.\n\n8. What are some examples of entities that FDA does not consider to be ASRs?\n\nMultiple individual ASRs (e.g., antibodies, probes, primer pairs) bundled together in a single pre-configured or optimized mixture so that they must be used together in the resulting LDT. For example, a set of 5 primer pairs combined in a single tube that are used to detect 5 different viral genotypes requires that all of these pairs be used together, and that they work together to accurately detect all five genotypes. This is an analytical claim for the product, and FDA does not consider this type of product to be an ASR.\n--------------------\nContext title: Commercially Distributed Analyte Specific Reagents (ASRs)- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.2166948318481445", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: A:: The regulation requires an applicant whose submission relies in part on clinical data to disclose certain financial interest and arrangements. A \"covered clinical study\" means any study of a drug (including a biological product) or device in humans submitted in a marketing application or reclassification petition that the applicant or FDA relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an effective product), or any study in which a single investigator makes a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety. This would, in general, not include phase 1 tolerance studies or pharmacokinetic studies, most clinical pharmacology studies (unless they are critical to an efficacy determination), large open safety studies conducted at multiple sites, treatment protocols, and expanded access protocols. (21 CFR SSS 54.2 and 54.3.) ANDAs are subject to 21 CFR part 54 (21 CFR SS 314.94(a)(13)), as are 510(k)s (21 CFR SS 807.87(i)). In addition, applications for biological products, including applications submitted under 351(k) of the Public Health Services Act, are also subject to the regulation.\n* Q:: Does the regulation apply to studies in support of labeling changes?\n\nA:: The regulation applies to studies submitted in a supplement when those studies meet the definition of a covered clinical study. The definition includes studies to support safety labeling changes where individual investigators make a significant contribution to the safety information. Studies to support the effectiveness of a new claimed indication are also included. (21 CFR SSS 54.2 and 54.3.)\n* Q:: Do actual use and labeling comprehension studies conducted to support a request to switch a drug product from prescription to over-the-counter (OTC) status fit the definition of covered clinical study?\n\nA:: Applicants who file supplements requesting that FDA approve a switch of a prescription drug to OTC status or who file a new drug application for OTC use often conduct actual use and labeling comprehension studies. These may be intended to demonstrate that the product is safe and effective when used without the supervision of a licensed practitioner; in other cases, they may test labeling comprehension or other aspects of treatment by consumers. Actual use studies performed to support these applications are considered covered clinical studies if they are used to demonstrate effectiveness in the OTC setting or if they represent a safety study where any investigator makes a significant contribution (21 CFR SSS 54.2 and 54.3). Labeling comprehension studies would not be considered covered studies.\n\nQ: Are clinical investigators of in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) covered under this regulation?\n\nYes. Applicants who submit marketing applications for IVDs that include covered clinical studies must provide the appropriate financial certification or disclosure information (21 CFR SS 54.3). Although IVD studies may only involve specimens, under 21 CFR SS 812.3(p), \"subject\" is defined as a \"human who participates in an investigation, either as an individual on whom or on whose specimen an investigational device is used or as a control.\" Under 21 CFR SS 812.3(h), an \"investigation\" is defined as a clinical investigation or research involving one or more subjects to determine the safety or effectiveness of a device.\" Thus, if an investigation of an IVD is used to support a marketing application and it meets the definition of a covered clinical study, it would be subject to this regulation (21 CFR SS 54.3).\n\nFDA REVIEW\n\nQ: Under what circumstances relating to financial disclosure would FDA refuse to file an application?\n\nFDA may refuse to file any marketing application supported by covered clinical studies that does not contain, for each clinical investigator who is not an employee of the sponsor, a certification that no financial interest or arrangement specified in 54.4(a)(3) exists, a disclosure statement identifying the specified financial interests or arrangements and the steps taken to minimize bias, or a certification that the applicant has acted with due diligence to obtain the required information but was unable to do so and stating the reason (21 CFR SS 54.4(c)). In general, if, during the filing review, an FDA reviewer identifies missing information, an attempt will be made to contact the applicant to obtain the missing information; however, applicants should take reasonable steps to ensure that applications are complete upon submission. Applicants are encouraged to discuss their concerns on particular matters about financial information with FDA.\n\nQ: Who will review a disclosure of the specified financial interests and arrangements when such information is submitted in a marketing application?\n\nFDA review staff, which may include project managers, consumer safety officers, medical officers, and/or others with regulatory or scientific expertise or supervisory authority, will evaluate financial disclosure information.\n\nQ: What will FDA reviewers consider when evaluating the financial disclosure information?\n\nFDA reviewers will evaluate the information disclosed about each covered clinical study in an application to determine the impact of any disclosed financial interests or arrangements on the reliability of the data. See 21 CFR SS 54.5(a). FDA may consider many factors in making its evaluation (21 CFR SSS 54.5(a) and (b)).\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPart 54 does not categorically prohibit financial interests or arrangements, but it does require applicants to submit a list of clinical investigators who are full-time and part-time employees of the sponsor and to disclose or certify with respect to other investigators so that FDA can assess the possibility of bias. The type of financial interest or arrangement disclosed is important because some financial interests and arrangements are of greater concern than others when assessing the reliability of the data. For example, outcome payments (that is, payment that is dependent on the outcome of the study) elicit the highest concerns, followed by proprietary interests in the test article (such as patents, royalties, etc.). With respect to equity interests and/or SPOOS, the amount and nature of the equity interests and payments may be considered.\n\nWhen a clinical investigator has disclosable financial interests or arrangements, the FDA reviewer will carefully consider the steps taken by the sponsor to minimize bias19 as described in the attachment to the FORM FDA 3455. These steps may include study design, use of multiple clinical investigators and study sites, and replication of study results. The agency also gives careful scrutiny to data from clinical investigators who are full-time or part-time employees of the sponsor, because of the possibility of significant financial interests in the outcome of studies. (Hereafter, we refer to these investigator types jointly as \"disclosing investigators.\") Investigators for whom the applicant is not able to disclose or certify, despite exercising due diligence, will be considered on a case by case basis.\n\nFootnote 19: See Question A.2 for a discussion of methods to minimize bias.\n\nThe FDA reviewer may consider elements of the study design, including the method of randomization, the level of blinding (double-blind, single-blind), the presence or absence of a control group, whether placebo or active, the nature of the primary and secondary endpoints (objective, subjective), the method of endpoint assessment, the method of evaluation (including whether someone other than the disclosing investigator measured the endpoints), and whether many investigators, most of whom were not disclosing investigators, participated in the study. The FDA reviewer may also consider the total number of investigators and subjects in the study, the number and percentage of subjects enrolled by the disclosing investigator, information obtained from on-site inspections, and the data (including adverse events) of the disclosing investigator compared to other investigators in the study. The reviewer may look at a re-analysis of the data performed either by the applicant or FDA that excludes the disclosing investigator's results, other relevant types of reanalysis, and/or whether the results were replicated over multiple studies.\n\nFootnote 22: FDA also recognizes that subjects participating in a clinical trial may be interested in the financial interests/arrangements of the clinical investigator at the site where the subject is considering participation. The Department of Health and Human Services Guidance Document, \u201cFinancial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidance for Human Subject Protection,\u201d which is applicable to FDA regulated research, recommends that consideration be given to providing potential subjects with information about the financial interests and arrangements of the parties involved in the research. This guidance is available at http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/guid.pdf.\n\nAppendix I Recorokkeeping\n\nQ: What are the recordkeeping requirements for financial disclosure information?\n\nThe recordkeeping requirements for applicants are described in 21 CFR SS 54.6. Applicants must retain certain information on clinical investigators' financial interests and arrangements (21 CFR SS 54.6(a)) and permit FDA employees to have access to the information and to copy the records at reasonable times (21 CFR SS 54.6(b)(2)). Records are to be maintained for two years after the date of approval of the application (21 CFR SS 54.6(b)(1)).\n\nAdditionally, IND and IDE sponsors are required to maintain complete and accurate records of financial disclosure information as part of the records for the investigation (21CFR SSS 312.57(b) and 812.140(b)(3)) and to retain the records pursuant to the required retention periods identified in the IND and IDE regulations (21 CFR SSS 312.57(c) and 812.140(d)).\n--------------------\nContext title: Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Industry,and FDA Staff\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.701162338256836", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: This question is about Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Am I required to follow the \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study?\n--------------------\nContext: Research With Noncommercial Intent\n\nSome believe that the IND regulations do not apply to clinical investigations that are not intended to investigate a drug's potential for commercial sale. Whether the IND regulations apply to a planned clinical investigation does not depend on whether the intent of the clinical investigation is commercial or noncommercial. Therefore, these types of studies would require an IND under part 312, unless they meet the criteria for an exemption in SSSS 312.2(b) or 320.31(b) (see section IV) or the criteria in SS 361.1, or the compound used is labeled with a cold isotope and used in the manner described in section V.\n\nVII Frequently asked questions\n\n1 Do I need an IND if I use a lawfully marketed drug for an unlabeled indication?\n\nIf you are a health care provider and you prescribe a marketed drug to treat a patient for an unlabeled indication (also referred to as off-label use), an IND is not required because this use is considered to be within the scope of medical practice and not a clinical investigation. However, if you use the marketed drug for the same purpose in a clinical investigation intended to evaluate the drug's ability to treat a disease or condition, an IND is required under part 312 unless the clinical investigation meets the criteria for an exemption for studies of lawfully marketed drugs (see 21 CFR 312.2(b) and section IV.A of this guidance).\n\nIf a drug marketed for use in adults is studied in an investigator-initiated, single-center study involving children, is an IND needed?\n\nAn IND is required under part 312 unless the clinical investigation meets the criteria for an exemption in SS 312.2(b) (see section IV.A). The criterion of most importance for the exemption in this situation is whether the change in study population from adult to pediatric, or any other condition of use in the study, would significantly increase the risks (or decrease the acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug (21 CFR 312.2(b)(1)(iii)). Whether risk would be significantly increased would depend on a variety of factors, including, for example, the age of the pediatric population being studied, the extent of prior pediatric experience with the drug in clinical studies or clinical practice, the amount of information available to support dosing in the study population, and the overall toxicity profile of the drug.\n\nThere are drugs on the market that have not been approved by FDA. Do clinical investigations using those drugs need an IND?\n\nThere are certain currently marketed drug ingredients that were first marketed before Congress passed the FD&C Act of 1938 (requiring demonstration of safety before marketing) or before it passed the 1962 amendments to the FD&C Act (requiring demonstration of effectiveness and safety before marketing). Sponsors of clinical investigations that use products with theseingredients should consult with FDA to determine whether the ingredient is lawfully marketed.23 If the ingredient is not lawfully marketed, an IND is required under part 312.\n\nFootnote 23: Ordinarily, such inquiries would be directed to CDER, Office of Compliance, Office of Unapproved Drugs & Labeling Compliance.\n\n4. Can I do research on radiolabeled endogenous peptides, such as neuropeptides, without an IND?\n\nIf the research is intended to obtain basic information about the metabolism of the peptide or its role in physiology, pathophysiology, and biochemistry, and the criteria in 21 CFR 361.1 are met (i.e., among other things, the dose of endogenous peptide to be administered is known not to cause a clinically detectable pharmacologic effect in humans), an IND is not required (see the RDRC guidance). However, if the study hypothesis concerns the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of a disease in patients, or the criteria in SS 361.1 are otherwise not met, an IND is required under part 312.\n\n5. Do clinical investigations of positron emission tomography (PET) drugs need INDs?\n\nAn IND generally would be required for a PET drug investigation, unless the investigation meets the criteria in 21 CFR 361.1. To meet these criteria, the research must be intended to obtain basic information regarding the metabolism (including kinetics, distribution, and localization) of a radioactively labeled drug or regarding human physiology, pathophysiology, or biochemistry, but not intended for immediate therapeutic, diagnostic, or similar purposes or to determine the safety and effectiveness of the drug in humans for such purposes (i.e., to carry out a clinical trial) (21 CFR 361.1(a)).\n\n6. If a complementary or an alternative medicine that was derived from organic materials from a botanical source (e.g., broccoli, sprouts) is administered to subjects to study cancer prevention, is an IND required?\n\nA clinical investigation of a complementary or an alternative medicine derived from organic materials that is intended to evaluate the medicine's ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease requires an IND under part 312.24\n\nFootnote 24: See the guidance for industry on Rotanical Drug Products.\n\n7. Is an IND required if a product containing attenuated microorganisms is evaluated for amelioration of symptoms of a disease or prevention of the disease?\n\nEven when a microorganism is attenuated with the intention to increase safety of a product, a clinical investigation that evaluates the potential for that microorganism to relieve symptoms of a disease or prevent the disease requires an IND under part 312, unless the study meets the criteria for an exemption under 21 CFR 312.2(b).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf a product containing substances generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in food is administered to subjects in a study intended to evaluate the effect of the substance on the pathogenesis of a human disease, is an IND required?\n\nSubstances designated as GRAS for use in food are generally not approved as drug products. A clinical investigation of a GRAS substance that is intended to evaluate the product's ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease requires an IND under part 312, unless the substance to be studied is also a lawfully marketed drug and the clinical investigation meets the criteria for exemption under 21 CFR 312.2(b).\n\nFor purposes of the exemption from the IND requirements for studies using radioisotopes and FDA's exercise of enforcement discretion for studies using cold isotopes, what support is needed to determine that the labeled drug does not have a clinically detectable pharmacological effect?\n\nThere is no requirement for a formal dose-response study to define the lower threshold for a clinically detectable pharmacological effect, and, in some cases, a study may not be needed. For example, if the labeled drug is an endogenous compound and the circulating blood levels or excretion rates of the endogenously produced substance are well known, there could be a basis to conclude that some small fraction of these levels or rates of administration (e.g., administration over a given interval of a very low percentage of the amount of a substance that is produced endogenously during the same interval) represents an amount without detectable pharmacological effect. Similarly, if large amounts of a substance such as an amino acid or a sugar are regularly consumed as foodstuffs, it may be possible to conclude that consumption of a small amount of these substances (e.g., a small percentage of the amount usually consumed during a meal), at least by the oral route, would be without detectable pharmacological activity (also see footnote 11).\n\n10. Do I need an IND if my study uses a home-made version of a lawfully marketed drug?\n\nSome investigators, or research pharmacies affiliated with the institution in which an investigator is conducting a study, compound their own versions of lawfully marketed drug products for use in clinical studies. For example, FDA is aware of instances in which the methacholine used in respiratory studies for challenge purposes has been prepared locally from raw materials obtained from a chemical supply company. Studies that use a drug product that is prepared from raw materials in place of the approved, finished product marketed by the manufacturer must be conducted under an IND (21 CFR part 312). These studies cannot meet the criteria for an exemption from the IND requirements for marketed drugs (SS 312.2(b)) because the drug product manufactured by the investigator or research pharmacy is not considered to be the lawfully marketed drug.\n\n11. Do I need an IND if my study enrolls only a small number of subjects?\n\nThe number of subjects enrolled has no bearing on whether the study is subject to the IND regulations. The definition of clinical investigation specifically includes studies with as few as one subject (see section III.B).\n\n12 Do I need an IND if my study enrolls only healthy volunteers?\n\nThe clinical condition of study subjects (e.g., the presence or absence of disease) has no bearing on whether the study is subject to the IND requirements in part 312. The definition of clinical investigation refers only to subjects involved in an experiment. It makes no distinction between healthy subjects or those with a disease (see section III.B).\n\nVIII Process for addressing novelties concerning the application of the IND requirements\n--------------------\nContext title: Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) - Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.761293888092041"], "Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1?

It does not create any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.\n\nI Introduction\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist institutional review boards (IRBs), clinical investigators, and sponsors in complying with FDA's informed consent regulations for clinical investigations. This guidance supersedes FDA's guidance entitled \"A Guide to Informed Consent,\" issued in September 1998, and finalizes FDA's draft guidance entitled \"Informed Consent Information Sheet,\" issued in July 2014. This document is structured to first present general guidance on FDA's regulatory requirements for informed consent and a discussion of the roles of IRBs, clinical investigators, sponsors, and FDA related to informed consent, followed by a series of frequently asked questions.\n\nIn a final rule published on January 19, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal departments and agencies revised the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects. The final rule became effective in 2018 (codified for HHS at 45 CFR 46, subpart A; \"the 2018 Common Rule\").2,3 The 2018 Common Rule sets forth requirements for the protection of human subjects involved in research that is conducted or supported by federal departments or agencies that have adopted the Common Rule. The revisions include significant changes to the provisions regarding informed consent. FDA is currently engaged in notice and comment rulemaking to harmonize its human subject protection\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]\n\nof the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.\n\nII Summary of the Consent process\n\nTo many, the term informed consent is mistakenly viewed as synonymous with obtaining a subject's signature on the consent form;9 however, obtaining documentation of a subject's informed consent is only part of the consent process. Informed consent involves providing a prospective subject, or their legally authorized representative (LAR), with adequate information to allow for an informed decision about participation in the clinical investigation prior to enrollment. Informed consent also involves facilitating the prospective subject's understanding of the information, providing adequate opportunity for the prospective subject to ask questions and to consider whether to participate, obtaining the prospective subject's voluntary agreement to participate prior to enrollment, and continuing to provide information as the clinical investigation progresses or as the enrolled subject or situation requires.10\n\nFootnote 9: In this guidance document, the terms informed consent form and informed consent document are used interchangeably.\n\nExcept as provided in 21 CFR 50.23 and 50.24,11 (see section III.A.1, \"Exceptions to Informed Consent\"), no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in FDA-regulated research unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's LAR (21CFR 50.20).12 To be legally effective, the informed consent process must satisfy the general requirements under 21 CFR 50.20 and include the relevant elements of informed consent described at 21 CFR 50.25 (see section3), \"FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\").\n\nFootnote 12: As described in guidance, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances, with respect to its current regulations governing the requirement for informed consent when human specimens are used for FDA-regulated in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device investigations. See \u201cGuidance on Informed Consent for in Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable: Guidance for Sponsors, Institutional Review Boards, and Food and Drug Administration Staff\u201d, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-informed- Consent-vitro-diagnostic-device-studies-using-leftover-human-specimens-are-not\n\nFDA considers advertising used to recruit subjects into the clinical trial to be the start of the ongoing consent process, and the information provided in any online or hard copy recruitment materials should be consistent with the informed consent document. Generally, FDA recommends that any advertisement to recruit subjects be limited to the information the prospective subjects need to determine their interest and potential eligibility. The FDA information sheet \"Recruiting Study Subjects\" includes information regarding scripts for those who will interface with subjects to determine basic eligibility.13\n\nFootnote 13: See the FDA Information Sheet \u201cRecruiting Study Subjects,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/recruiting-study-subjects, for further information.\n\nOnce a prospective subject is identified, and before research activities requiring prior consent occur, a person knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and capable of answering questions raised by the prospective subject should conduct a consent discussion. The consent discussion and the consent form must contain information to allow prospective subjects to make an informed decision about participation in a clinical investigation and provide an opportunity for prospective subjects to ask questions about the clinical investigation and the information in the consent document (see section3), \"FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\") (21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25).14 The consent form serves several purposes, including helping to ensure that prospective subjects receive the required information, providing a \"take home\" reminder of the elements of the clinical investigation, providing contact information in case additional questions or concerns arise, and documenting prospective subjects' voluntary agreement to participate as well as the date of their agreement.\n\nFootnote 14: The regulations allow use of a \u201cshort form\u201d consent form when the elements of informed consent are presented orally to the subject (21 CFR 50.27(b)(2)). For a discussion of the short form written consent, see section3.5.4.2, \u201cShort Form.\u201d\n\nThe informed consent process is an ongoing exchange of information throughout a subject's participation in a clinical trial and does not end after the consent form is signed. For example, if new safety information or protocol changes occur during the conduct of the study, additional information may need to be given to the subject, and/or the subject may need additional opportunities to ask questions and receive answers throughout the clinical investigation (see sectionIII.3.5, \"Providing Significant New Findings to Subjects,\" and Frequently Asked Question #16).\n\nIII FDA Informed Consent Requirements and Discussion\n\nThe informed consent process and consent form must meet the general requirements of 21 CFR 50.20, and must include the basic elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25(a) (when used, a short form written consent document states that the elements of informed consent required by 21 CFR 50.25 have been presented orally; see sectionIII.5.4b \"Short Form\" for more details). If appropriate to the clinical investigation, one or more of the additional elements of informed consent at 21 CFR 50.25(b) must also be addressed. For \"applicable clinical trials\" as defined in 42 U.S.C. 282(j)(1)(A) initiated on or after March 7, 2012, an additional element of informed consent (i.e., inclusion of the specified statement regarding ClinicalTrials.gov) is required by 21 CFR 50.25(c).15 The text of 21 CFR 50.20 and 21 CFR 50.25 is set out in italics below, followed by a discussion of each regulation.\n\nFootnote 15: For further information, see sectionIII.D, \u201cElement of Informed Consent for \u2018Applicable Clinical Trials.\u201d\n\nGeneral Requirements for Informed Consent\n\n21 CFR 50.20:\n\nExcept as provided in 50.23, and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.\n\nAn investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.\n\nThe information that is given to the subject or the representative shall be in language understandable to the subject or the representative.\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.4218577146530151", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1?

When final, this guidance will represent FDA\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\n\nUnder section 704(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 374(a)(1)), FDA may inspect and copy records relating to the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 312.58(a), 312.68, and 812.145(b)). FDA generally will not copy records that include the subject's name unless there is reason to believe the records do not represent the actual cases studied or results obtained. When FDA requires subject names, FDA will treat such information as confidential. On rare occasions, FDA may be required to disclose this information to third parties, such as to a court of law (see 21 CFR 20.63(a) and 20.83(a) and (b)). Therefore, the consent process should not promise or imply absolute confidentiality by FDA.\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor systems that are interoperable or fully integrated, sponsors and clinical investigators should have a detailed understanding of data flow and data visibility to allow for a clear description in the informed consent of the parties granted access to the patient's data.\n\nVI Inspection, recordkeeping, and record retention requirements\n\nFDA must have access to records and may inspect and copy all records pertaining to a clinical investigation in accordance with 21 CFR 312.62, 312.68, 812.140, and 812.145. All relevant information in the EHR pertaining to the clinical investigation must be made available to FDA for review upon request (21 CFR 312.62(b), 312.68, 812.140(a), and 812.145).20 This information should be made available and viewable to FDA as original records in the EHR or as certified copies. During an inspection, FDA may also request other paper or electronic records to support data in the eCRF (e.g., case histories, other data pertaining to the clinical investigation) (see 21 CFR 312.62(b), 312.68, 812.140(a)(3), and 812.145). In addition, FDA may request to review the EHR audit trail information during inspection.\n\nFootnote 20: If the necessary records are not available for a foreign clinical study that is not conducted under an IND, FDA may not accept the study data in support of an IND or an application for marketing approval. If the records exist but a sponsor or an applicant cannot disclose them to FDA because such disclosure is prohibited by applicable foreign law, the sponsor or applicant may seek a waiver of this requirement (21 CFR 312.120(c)). For FDA to rely on such data that cannot be disclosed, the sponsor and FDA would need to agree on an alternative validation procedure.

Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 64: See section IV.A.4 for guidance regarding identification of the most up-to-date version of the informed consent form.\n\niv.2.4 Identification of Revised Consent Forms\n\nThe IRB should ensure that there is a way to identify a revised consent form so that continued use of a previously approved version does not occur. While not required by FDA regulations, the use of date stamps is one possible mechanism for ensuring use of the most recently approved version of the consent form.\n\nThe Clinical Investigator\n\nThe clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects during a clinical investigation, and for ensuring that, unless an exception applies, legally effective informed consent is obtained from each subject or the subject's LAR before that subject takes part in the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 50.20(a), 312.60, and 812.100). Legally effective informed consent includes meeting all applicable Federal, State, and local laws that require additional information in the informed consent form beyond what FDA regulations require. Sponsors and investigators may wish to seek legal guidance regarding specific local consent requirements applicable to their research.\n\nThe clinical investigator should notify the IRB regarding the consent process, including who (e.g., the investigator or another study team member) will conduct the consent discussion. Any information that will be given to subjects to review and discuss as part of informed consent must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval (21 CFR 56.109(a)-(b) and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)). An investigator may not begin the informed consent process with prospective subjects until the IRB reviews and approves the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process (21 CFR 50.20, 50.27, and 56.109).\n\nThe clinical investigator's institution may have standard language or a standard format for consent forms (for example, for those elements that deal with confidentiality, compensation, answers to questions, and the voluntary nature of participation). FDA recognizes that investigators may also need to identify and meet institutional requirements and incorporate them into the consent form for the IRB's initial review of the clinical investigation.\n\nDuring the clinical investigation, the investigator may need to revise the consent form to address new information that might arise during the conduct of the trial, such as a change to the protocol or new safety information. The investigator will need to obtain IRB review and approval of the revised consent form (21 CFR 50.27 and 56.109). In addition, because the consent form is being modified to reflect new information that might affect the willingness of already enrolled and actively participating subjects to continue in the clinical investigation, the IRB should determine the need to inform the previously enrolled subjects of the new information and determine their willingness to continue in the research (see\n\nFrequently Asked Questions #16).\n\nAny new information that is part of the consent process must be reviewed and approved by the IRB as a change in approved research before it is initiated, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject (see 21 CFR 56.108(a)(4)). In the rare event that urgent safety information is provided to the subject prior to IRB approval, the IRB should promptly be notified of both the safety issue and the notification of subjects.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the clinical investigator:\n\niv.2.1 Delegation of Consent Discussion\n\nFDA regulations require that the investigator obtain the legally effective informed consent of subjects (21 CFR 50.20, 312.60 and 812.100). If the investigator delegates this responsibility, FDA expects that the individual to whom the responsibility is delegated be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform this activity. The individual obtaining informed consent should be knowledgeable about the clinical investigation and have the appropriate training and credentials to be able to address any questions or concerns the subject may have about the study and/or alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject. The investigator should have a detailed plan for the supervision and training of staff, and oversight of the clinical investigation, including the informed consent process.65 Even when a task is delegated to another individual, the investigator remains responsible for ensuring that legally effective informed consent is obtained for all subjects in accordance with 21 CFR part 50.\n\niv.2.2 Financial Relationships and Interests\n\nThe clinical investigator should consider whether information related to financial relationships or interests should be provided to subjects.66 Clinical investigators should consider the potential effects that a financial relationship might have on the clinical investigation or on interactions with subjects. When there are financial relationships or interests, clinical investigators should consider the following actions:\n\nFootnote 66: See the HHS guidance document, \u201cFinancial Relationships and Interests in Research Involving Human Subjects: Guidance for Human Subject Protection,\u201d available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/financial-conflict-of-interest/index.html#.\n\nIncluding information in the informed consent form, such as:\n\nThe source of funding and funding arrangements for the conduct and review of the clinical investigation, or\n\nInformation about a financial arrangement or interest (e.g., stock in the study sponsor, patent on the investigational product) of an institution or an investigator and how it is being managed.\n\nUsing special measures to modify the informed consent process when a potential or actual financial conflict exists, such as:\n\nHaving another individual who does not have a potential or actual conflict of interest involved in the consent process, especially when a potential or actual conflict of interest could influence the tone, presentation, or type of information presented during the consent process.\n\nUsing independent monitoring of the consent process.\n\nAlthough the clinical investigator should consider these issues regarding financial relationships and interests, IRBs have the final responsibility of determining whether subjects should be provided with information regarding the source of funding, funding arrangements, or financial interests of parties involved in the clinical investigation as part of the informed consent process (see 21 CFR 56.109 and 56.111(a)(4)-(5)).\n\nThe Sponsor\n\nSponsors often provide clinical investigators with a model consent form that may be adapted by the clinical investigator to meet local needs. When the consent form for studies that require an IND or IDE application is submitted to FDA for review, FDA's comments are generally directed to the sponsor (see sectionIV.4.1, \"Investigational New Drugs and Biologics,\" and sectionIV.4.2, \"Investigational Medical Devices\"). The sponsor should promptly provide the clinical investigator with any necessary modifications required to satisfy the regulations at 21 CFR 50.25 so that changes can be made to the consent forms. A modified model consent form reflecting the changes may be used to convey the necessary edits. Because the clinical investigator must receive IRB approval before starting the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 312.66 and 21 CFR 812.110(a)), the sponsor should work closely with the clinical investigator to make certain the modified consent form is reviewed and approved by the IRB. The clinical investigator should provide the sponsor with a copy of the consent form approved by the IRB.\n\nBelow are specific areas for consideration by the sponsor:\n\niv.3.1 Considerations for Multicenter Clinical Investigations\n\nFor multicenter clinical investigations, changes may need to be made to the consent form to address local and institutional requirements. For multicenter clinical investigations reviewed by more than one IRB, when local IRB review results in substantive modifications to the consent form, i.e., changes that affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects, FDA expects the sponsor to share the revisions with all investigators and their IRBs. In this situation it may be more efficient to share the changes with the sites using a modified model consent form, when appropriate. If the multicenter clinical investigation has a central IRB cooperating with local IRBs or human research protection offices, the revisions should be forwarded to the central IRB.67 Alternatively, local issues may be addressed by the central IRB depending on the review agreement between the local IRB(s) and central IRB. Note that for medicaldevice studies that require submission of an IDE application, such changes must be submitted to FDA.68\n\nFootnote 68: See 21 CFR 812.35(a).\n\nFootnote 69: The 2018 Common Rule requires that any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research conducted or supported by a Federal Department or Agency must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States, unless the research is not subject to the provision (45 CFR 46.114(b)). The compliance date for research subject to this provision was January 20, 2020. On September 28, 2022, FDA issued a proposed rule to harmonize with this requirement to the extent practicable and consistent with statutory provisions (see https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/28/2022-21089/institutional-review-boards-cooperative-research). The January 19, 2017, final rule revising the Common Rule is available at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/finalized-revisions-common-rule/index.html.\n\n.4.2 Sponsor Personnel\n--------------------\nContext title: Informed Consent Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -3.7406065464019775", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1? Is it acceptable to have more than one investigator at a single site?\n--------------------\nContext: Do individuals who are listed in Section #6 on the 1572 have to submit information about their financial interests?\n\nYes. Under 21 CFR Part 54 (Disclosure of Financial Interests by Clinical Investigators), a person listed or identified as an investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects must submit financial disclosure information to the sponsor. For purposes of this financial disclosure regulation, the term investigator also includes the spouse and each dependent child of the investigator and subinvestigator. (21 CFR 54.2(d) and 54.4). For additional information about financial disclosure, see FDA's Guidance for Industry Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators (http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126832.htm)VIII Section #7: Name and Code Number, If Any, of the Protocol(s) in the Ind for Study(ies) to be Conducted by the Investigator\n\n36. What information should be included in this section?\n\nList the name and code number (if any) of all the protocols under the IND that will be conducted by the investigator signing the 1572. A code number is an identifying number assigned by the sponsor.\n\nAs a reminder, some investigators may be responsible for submitting certain clinical trial information to the National Institutes of Health clinical trials data bank under 42 U.S.C. 282(j), 402(j) of the Public Health Service Act. Although not all investigators will be expected to meet this requirement, go to www.clinicaltrials.gov for further information about potential responsibilities.\n\nIX Section #8: Clinical Protocol Information\n\n37. How should Section #8 be completed for a phase 4 study?\n\nPhase 4 refers to the timing of a clinical study (i.e., postmarketing) rather than the characteristics of the study, which are described under 21 CFR 312.21, Phases of an investigation. A postmarketing clinical trial would meet the description of a phase 2 or 3 investigation and a full protocol would be submitted. The investigator does not need to mark either of the boxes in Section #8, but should identify in Section #7 that the study is a phase 4 study.\n\n38. Can an investigator submit the study protocol instead of an outline of the study protocol?\n\nYes. The protocol or a detailed description is required for any phase 2 or 3 clinical trial. Phase 1 studies can be supported by an outline (see 21 CFR 312.53).\n--------------------\nContext title: Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572) Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.0016350746154785", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Given the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Should co-investigators be listed on the 1572 in Section #1?

Inspections (21 CFR 812.145)\n\nInvestigators are required to permit FDA to inspect and copy any records pertaining to the investigation including, in certain situations, those which identify subjects.\n\n5. Submitting Reports (21 CFR 812.150)\n\nAn investigator shall prepare and submit the following complete, accurate, and timely reports:\n\na. To the sponsor and the IRB:\n\n(1) Any unanticipated adverse device effect occurring during an\n\ninvestigation. (Due no later than 10 working days after the investigator first learns of the effect.)\n\n(2) Progress reports on the investigation. (These reports must be provided at regular intervals, but in no event\n\nless often than yearly. If there is a study monitor, a copy of the report should also be sent to the monitor.)(3) Any deviation from the investigational plan made to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency. (Report is due as soon as possible but no later than 5 working days after the emergency occurs. Except in emergency situations, a protocol deviation requires prior sponsor approval; and if the deviation may affect the scientific soundness of the plan or the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects, prior FDA and IRB approval are required.)\n\n(4) Any use of the device without obtaining informed consent. (Due within 5 working days after such use.)\n\n(5) A final report. (Due within 3 months following termination or completion of the investigation or the investigator's part of the investigation. For additional guidance, see the discussion under the section entitled \"Annual Progress Reports and Final Reports.\")\n\n(6) Any further information requested by FDA or the IRB about any aspect of the investigation.\n\nb. To the Sponsor:\n\n(1) Withdrawal of IRB approval of the investigator's part of an investigation. (Due within 5 working days of such action).\n\n6. Investigational Device Distribution and Tracking\n\nThe IDE regulations prohibit an investigator from providing an investigational device to any person not authorized to receive it (21 CFR 812.110(c)). The best strategy for reducing the risk that an investigational device could be improperly dispensed (whether purposely or inadvertently) is for the sponsor and the investigators to closely monitor the shipping, use, and final disposal of the device(s). Upon completion or termination of a clinical investigation (or the investigator's part of an investigation), or at the sponsor's request, an investigator is required to return to the sponsor any remaining supply of the device or otherwise to dispose of the device as the sponsor directs (21 CFR 812.110(e)). Investigators must also maintain complete, current and accurate records of the receipt, use, or disposition of investigational devices (21 CFR 812.140(a)(2)). Specific investigator recordkeeping requirements are set forth at 21 CFR 812.140(a).\n\n7. Prohibition of Promotion and Other Practices (21 CFR 812.7)\n\nThe IDE regulations prohibit the promotion and commercialization of a device that has not been first cleared or approved for marketing by FDA. This prohibition is applicable to sponsors and investigators (or any person acting on behalf of a sponsor or investigator), and encompasses the following activities:\n\na. Promotion or test marketing of the investigational device\n\nb. Charging subjects or investigators for the device a price larger than is necessary to recover the costs of manufacture, research, development, and handling c. Unduly prolonging an investigation beyond the point needed to collect data required to determine whether the device is safe and effective, and d. Representing that the device is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is being investigated.\n8. Annual Progress Reports and Final Reports\n\nThe IDE regulations do not specify the content of the annual progress or final reports. With respect to reports to the IRB, the IRB itself may specify what information it wishes to be included in these reports. Because FDA does require the information listed below, it is suggested that, at a minimum, the annual progress and final reports to the sponsor and the IRB also include the following items:\n\na. IDE number\n\nb. Device name\n\nc. Indications for use\n\nd. Brief summary of study progress in relation to investigational plan\n\ne. Number of investigators and investigational sites\n\nf. Number of subjects enrolled\n\ng. Number of devices received, used, and the final disposition of unused devices\n\nh. Brief summary of results and conclusions\n\ni.

What is required for CMC changes submitt d in a PAS or changes being effected supplements submitted to deemed 351(a) BLAs?\n\nFDA requires applicants or application holders of biological products--whether approved under the FD&C Act or licensed under the PHS Act--to notify FDA about each change in the conditions established in an approved application. The types of reporting categories for biological products generally are the same for an NDA (see 21 CFR 314.70) and for a BLA (see 21 CFR 601.12), and in both cases, the applicant or application holder is expected to demonstrate that the postchange product continues to be of acceptable quality as it may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. Overall, the nature and type of data required to support such a demonstration has historically been similar for biological products approved under the FD&C Act or licensed under the PHS Act.\n\nHowever, there are limited differences with respect to the type, timing, and evaluation of certain data in submissions, and verification of these data during the review cycle and inspection varies. For example, validation data would be required to be submitted in BLA supplements to support certain postapproval changes (21 CFR 601.12). In another example, for biological products that do not fall within the specified categories of biological products described in 21 CFR 601.2 (\"non-specified biological products\"), compliance with the establishment standards set forth under 21 CFR 600.10, 600.11, 600.12, and 600.13 may be required for a BLA supplement to support certain postapproval changes (e.g., addition of a new facility).\n\nApplication holders that intend to propose manufacturing changes are encouraged to contact OPQ/OPRO at CDER-OPO-Inquiries@fda.hhs.gov. FDA is committed to working with application holders to minimize any potential burden.\n\nv.1.1 Data Necessary to Support a Process or Manufacturing Site Change\n\nSupplements to applications for biological products subject to the transition provision that remain under review after the transition date, including supplements submitted prior to the transition date, must comply with 21 CFR 601.12 and other applicable regulations. Applicants should also consult relevant guidances for biological products. A supplement submitted to a deemed BLA to support process or manufacturing site changes must contain, for the lots manufactured using the postchange process, manufacturing process validation data (see 21 CFR 601.12). Specifically, process validation for a BLA should be performed at commercial manufacturing scale, prior to submission of a supplement. Process validation information should be included in the supplement as this may affect submission and implementation timelines of the changes for commercial distribution.\n\nA supplement requesting approval of a proposed change to the manufacturing site for a biological product also must assess the effects of the change and contain sufficient information to support the safety, purity, and potency of material manufactured with the change (21 CFR 601.12(a)(2); compare 21 CFR 314.70). In assessing the effects of the change, information demonstrating comparability of the pre and postchange material should also be submitted, consistent with the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidance for industry Q5E Comparability of Biotechnological/Biological Products Subject to Changes in Their Manufacturing Process (June 2005) and the recommendations below.\n\nComparability data.\n\nThe type and amount of data needed to support a comparability exercise depends on the extent of the changes and the potential risk to product quality. A robust control strategy for drug substance and drug product is critical in generating comparability data. For example, a potency assay that is accurate, precise, and reliable will facilitate the review of manufacturing changes. In some cases, in addition to the typical battery of release tests, extended characterization may be necessary for comparison, in particular for process changes that may affect purity, potency, or safety of the product.\n\nBatch analysis data.\n\nAppropriate stability data.\n\nGenerally, limited real-time stability data for the postchange product and comparability study results, including stability data under accelerated and stressed storage conditions, are sufficient to leverage existing stability data to support the shelf life of the postchange product.\n\nAs with all biological products, FDA may recommend changes to the control strategy throughout the product life cycle to modernize outdated assays, to address product-specific issues, and to help ensure that biological products remain safe, pure, and potent for their approved conditions of use.\n\nvi.2.2 Facility Inspections Related to Certain Supplements to a Deemed 351(a) BLA\n\nWhether a biological product is regulated under the FD&C Act or the PHS Act, application holders for biological products should be ready for FDA inspections to assure such compliance with the conditions of approval.\n\nAfter March 23, 2020, supplements submitted to deemed BLAs, including supplements submitted prior to the transition date but with an action date after the transition date, must comply with the inspection requirements as specified in the relevant regulations in 21 CFR part 600.\n\nIn particular, supplements for site changes where facilities are added to the license or supplements for major manufacturing changes may be subject to an inspection. FDA intends to contact the holder of a deemed BLA to schedule any such inspection during the review of the supplement. After March 23, 2020, holders of deemed BLAs that submit a site change or major manufacturing change supplement are advised that, as with the holder of any BLA, they should be ready for an inspection while in operation and manufacturing the product for which the change is requested during the supplement review timeframe.\n\nQ17. Can the application holder for a deemed 351(a) BLA for a biological product originally approved through the 505(b)(2) pathway submit a supplement that relies, in part, on FDA's finding of safety, purity, and potency for another licensed biological product?\n\nSupplements to a deemed 351(a) BLA, like any supplement to any 351(a) BLA, must meet the requirements of section 351(a) of the PHS Act. The holder of a deemed BLA for a biological product originally approved through the 505(b)(2) pathway may not, for example, submit an efficacy supplement to the deemed 351(a) BLA that relies on FDA's finding of safety, purity, and potency for another licensed biological product (e.g., for a newly approved indication or other condition of use for a related biological product).\n\nThere might be instances where there is a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a stand-alone NDA or a pending 505(b)(2) efficacy supplement to a 505(b)(2) application that would be administratively converted to a pending efficacy supplement to the corresponding deemed 351(a) BLA on the transition date. To obtain approval under section 351(a) of the PHS Act, the applicant may need to amend the administratively converted supplement to provide the scientific data necessary to meet the requirements of section 351(a) of the PHS Act, or a right of reference to such data, for the change proposed in the supplement.\n\nQ18. Can a biological product approved in an NDA that is deemed to be a 351(a) BLA on the transition date subsequently be a \"reference product\" for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product?\n\nA biological product approved in an NDA (including a 505(b)(2) application) that is deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act may be a reference product for a 351(k) BLA. The term \"reference product\" is defined as the single biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act against which a biological product is evaluated in an application submitted under section 351(k) of the PHS Act (see section 351(i)(4) of the PHS Act).\n\nSponsors may request advice from FDA regarding proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product development programs that identify a biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as the intended reference product. A sponsor will be able to submit a 351(k) BLA that references the biological product approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act as its reference product after the NDA for the biological product is deemed to be a 351(a) BLA.\n\nQ19. Can an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a \"deemed\" 351(a) BLA seek a determination of biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act to another biological product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act?\n\nAny person (including an application holder for a biological product that is the subject of a \"deemed\" 351(a) BLA) may seek to establish the biosimilarity or interchangeability under section 351(k) of the PHS Act of a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable product to another biological product licensed or deemed licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act. FDA intends to work with applicants to address scientific or regulatory issues that may arise in the context of these 351(k) development programs, and to provide additional procedural information. Any sponsor or applicant may contact the relevant review division within the Office of New Drugs in FDA's CDER to request advice on a 351(k) development program.\n\nD. Transition of Biological Products from the Orange Book to the Purple Book\n\nQ20. Will any therapeutic equivalence evaluations for biological products previously listed in the Orange Book be reflected in the Purple Book?\n--------------------\nContext title: The \u201cDeemed to be a License\u201d Provision of the BPCI Act- Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -5.829699993133545", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: Footnote 20: For example, see ICH Q7 and ICH Q10.\n\nAs noted above, a CP can be submitted in an original application or can be submitted in a PAS. A PAS containing the CP must be approved by FDA before the proposed changes are implemented, as outlined in the protocol, and the product is distributed in accordance with the approved reporting category (see 21 CFR 314.70(e) and 601.12(e)). A CP can be for a one-time change(s), or be used repeatedly for a specified type of change over the life cycle of a product. A CP can also be submitted to cover an identical change(s) that affects multiple applications (e.g., grouped supplements, trans-BLA).23\n\nFootnote 21: See 21 CFR 314.70(e) and 601.12(e). We note that CMC changes covered by a CP may reflect appropriate product quality improvements, process improvements, variability reduction, innovations, and pharmaceutical quality system enhancements (see ICH Q10).\n\nA CP can be useful in providing predictability for the implementation of future changes to an approved product, including its manufacturing process. By delineating the specific approach to be used to evaluate one or more future changes and the rationale for that approach, you can gain FDA's approval of the plan well in advance of the need to implement the change(s). This can facilitate a more efficient process for both applicants' submissions and FDA's review. In addition, depending on the extent of available knowledge regarding the product and process, the associated risk of the proposed change(s), and the suitability of the control strategy in effect, FDA may be able to approve a protocol that justifies reporting certain changes in a manner not requiring approval from FDA prior to distribution of a product produced with the change (i.e., a CBE-30 supplement, CBE-0 supplement, or an annual report).\n\nFDA recommends that you consider a CP submission that proposes a reduced reporting category for particular changes only if you have a sufficient understanding of the product and manufacturing process to assess the risks associated with implementing the proposed change. Such understanding should be derived from one or more of the following, as appropriate:\n\nPrior knowledge (public domain or internally documented)24 Footnote 24: Prior knowledge can include established chemical, biological and engineering principles, scientific and technical literature, and applied manufacturing experience. For example, prior knowledge can include relevant knowledge and experience gained from using platform technology. Prior knowledge can be used at the beginning of development and iteratively updated with development data (including data from nonclinical and clinical studies) during the life cycle of the product. See ICH Q8(R2), ICH Q10, and ICH Q11.\n\nDevelopment of the drug substance and its manufacturing process25 Footnote 25: See, e.g., ICH Q11.\n\nPharmaceutical development (development of the product and its manufacturing process)26 Footnote 26: See, e.g., ICH Q8(R2).\n\nProcess validation activities that include process design, process qualification, and continued process verification27 Footnote 27: See, e.g., FDA guidance for industry Process Validation: General Principles and Practices (January 2011).\n\nQuality risk management activities28 Footnote 28: See, e.g., ICH Q9.\n\nStudies conducted at less than commercial scale to gain an increased understanding of the effects of the change(s) on product quality29\n\nSeeking approval of a CP as part of the original application may facilitate your ability to prospectively plan to optimize the manufacturing process or otherwise adjust the control strategy rapidly and predictably in the immediate postapproval period as manufacturing experience is gained. If the product and process understanding available at the time of the original application approval is not sufficient to support the risk assessment for future changes, a CP can also be submitted in a PAS once additional commercial manufacturing experience is gained. In general, as part of its assessment of a CP and a proposed reduced reporting category, FDA intends to take into consideration the type of change and its associated potential risks, the extent of your available product and process understanding, the suitability of the control strategy, and the nature and extent of the tests and studies planned, including the acceptance criteria to be achieved, to support the change.\n\nWhen you submit a CP to FDA, we recommend that the CP include a descriptive title, version number, and date for tracking purposes, and that you submit the CP in Module 3, section 3.2.RRegional Information.30 For an original application, the cover letter should note that one or more CPs has been included in the submission; for a PAS containing a CP, you should note in the cover letter that the subject of the submission is a \"Comparability Protocol.\"\n\nFootnote 30: See ICH guidance for industry The CTD \u2014 Quality (August 2001) (ICH M4Q).\n\nOnce approved by FDA, a submission containing a CP provides an agreed-upon plan for you to perform the specified activities in the CP and implement the proposed change(s), and in many cases, a justification to report the change(s) using a reduced reporting category, contingent upon your analysis of the data from the implementation of the change(s). Notification of the change(s) using the reporting category specified in the approved CP submission is appropriate if all of the predefined acceptance criteria for success in the approved CP have been achieved. If the activities specified in the approved CP are not performed or if the predefined acceptance criteria for success are not achieved, then any reduced reporting category is not justified. In the latter case, the change(s), if pursued, must be reported in accordance with 21 CFR 314.70 or 601.12 and should follow applicable FDA guidances addressing postapproval changes.31\n\nFootnote 31: See guidances on postapproval changes listed in footnote 19. If an assessment indicates that a change has adversely affected product quality, FDA recommends that the change be submitted in a PAS regardless of the recommended reporting category for the change (see FDA guidance for industry Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA (April 2004)).\n\nMany types of CMC changes in the drug substance, product, production process, quality controls, equipment or facilities that would ordinarily require a PAS or other postapproval supplement can be addressed in a CP submission. However, certain changes are considered not suitable for a CP because they would likely result in an unacceptably high or uncertain risk to product quality (e.g., changes that would need supportive data derived from a nonclinical safety, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, or clinical safety or efficacy study to assess the effects of the change). See the Appendix for questions and answers on using CPs for making postapproval CMC changes, including examples of changes that are considered suitable or not suitable for a CP.\n\n4 Comparability Protocol Submission -- Content Recommendations\n\nThe CP submission should provide a comprehensive, detailed plan for the implementation of a proposed change(s) and should include the information described below. FDA uses this information to assess whether the outcomes of any proposed test or study would or would not support the specified future change(s). Such information should be sufficient to merit the proposed reduced reporting category for the implementation of the change(s).\n\n5 Summary\n\nFDA recommends that you provide a summary of the CP submission using tabular (e.g., a list of tests and studies, analytical procedures, and acceptance criteria), narrative, and/or graphic presentations, as appropriate. The summary should include a brief overview of the following:\n\nA description of and rationale for the proposed CMC change(s)\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nSupporting information and analysis\n\nComparability protocol for the proposed change(s)\n\nProposed reduced reporting category\n\nOther information\n\nThe remainder of the CP submission should provide the detailed information as described in sections B through F below.\n\nDescription of and Rationale for the Proposed CMC Change(s)\n\nThe proposed change(s) should be described in sufficient detail to enable FDA to evaluate the relevance and adequacy of the CP. FDA recommends that you include information on the basis and rationale for the change(s), where applicable.\n\nSupporting Information and Analysis\n\nSupporting information submitted with the CP should demonstrate your understanding of those aspects of the product, manufacturing process, risk, and control strategy that are relevant to the proposed change(s).\n\nThe supporting information should include the following, as applicable:\n\nPrior knowledge32 used to justify the proposed CMC change(s)\n\nA summary of the risk assessment of the proposed change(s) The risk assessment should identify the potential effects of the change(s) on product quality.33 The extent of the risk assessment should be commensurate with the level of risk associated with the proposed change(s). If multiple changes are proposed for simultaneous implementation or if a specified type of change will be made repeatedly over the life cycle of the product, the risk assessment should also address the potential for cumulative effects of these changes on product quality. Footnote 32: See footnote 33: A number of different approaches can be taken to perform risk assessments of the potential effects of the change(s) on product quality (see ICH Q8(R2), ICH Q9, and ICH Q11 for more information on possible approaches).\n--------------------\nContext title: Comparability Protocols for Postapproval Changes to the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Information in an NDA, ANDA, or BLA \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.816662788391113", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nPRIOR APPROVAL (PAS) CHANGES BEING EFFECTED in 30\n\nDAYS (CBE30)*\n\nANNUAL REPORT (AR)\n\nChange in a membrane material or\n\ndimensions of the final sterilization filter.\n\nproduct contact equipment.\n\nFDA recommends that the following manufacturing changes be submitted in a CBE supplement under 21 CFR 601.12(c)(5).

An applicant has the option to submit one or more CPs describing the specific tests, validation studies, and acceptance criteria to be achieved in order to demonstrate the lack of adverse effect(s) for specified types of manufacturing changes on product quality. A CP shall be submitted as a PAS requiring approval from the FDA before distribution of a product made using the change outlined in the protocol. If approved, the CP may justify a less burdensome reporting category for the particular change (Ref. [9]).21 A less burdensome reporting category should be requested and approved by FDA as part of the CP.\n\nFootnote 21: 21 CFR 601.12 (e).\n\nAfter a CP is approved, an applicant may introduce changes to the CP. Under 21 CFR 601.12(e), such changes shall be submitted as a PAS (major change). Notwithstanding this requirement, as provided in 21 CFR 601.12(a)(3), to make CPs more useful and flexible, FDA may provide for a less burdensome notification of certain types of modifications to an approved CP.22 Footnote 22: 21 CFR 601.12(a) and (e).\n\nA CP may be submitted for a single, or multiple related changes, and may cover a single or multiple BLAs (i.e., a \"trans-BLA\"). Submission and approval of a CP may enable:\n\ngreater predictability regarding the timing of implementation of CMC changes;\n\nplacing the product into distribution sooner than without the use of a protocol; and\n\nmore effective planning of the product supply chain.\n\nRecommendations for Reporting Categories\n\nThe FDA reviews manufacturing changes reported across licensed biological products within the scope of this guidance using the tiered reporting system23 described in section IV.A. of this guidance.\n\nFootnote 23: 21 CFR 601.12.\n\nIn the Appendix of this guidance, a table of frequent manufacturing changes and recommended reporting categories is provided. It is meant to serve as a guide to assist applicants and the FDA to identify reportable post-approval changes and determine appropriate reporting categories. It is based, in part, upon our overall assessment of the potential risks to process performance and product quality caused by the change. This assessment is supported by the Agency's accumulated experience resulting from inspections and reviews of post-approval manufacturing changes. The recommendations for reporting categories provided in the Appendix should be read to determine the appropriate category for the specific manufacturing change(s) under consideration. This table does not represent an exhaustive list of possible reportable manufacturing changes; a manufacturing change may still be considered reportable even if not listed in the table.\n\nAlthough the selection of a reporting category for a change generally should be made in accordance with the recommendations provided in this guidance, a different selection may in some instances be determined to be appropriate, provided it complies with applicable regulatory requirements. Early consultation with the FDA is recommended to determine the appropriate reporting category for manufacturing change(s) not described in the table in the Appendix, or when considering an adjustment to the recommended reporting categories. The Agency will make a decision regarding the reporting category based upon available information and the Agency's current thinking.\n\nSome manufacturing changes may be reported in multiple categories, depending upon the type and extent of the change and its potential effects. When considering the correct reporting category for a submission, the applicant should ensure that the highest risk change determines the reporting category that is chosen for the submission. For example, there may be several moderate-risk changes associated with one major risk change, in which case the reporting category for the highest risk change may define the appropriate submission type (e.g., PAS).\n\nWhen multiple changes are made to a process, it may be appropriate to consider the cumulative impact of all changes, which may lead to a higher reporting category.\n\nWe recommend, if an applicant includes multiple changes in one supplement, that all of the changes in the supplement be somehow related or pertain to a similar step in the manufacturing process (e.g., changes associated with an increase in a production scale, or multiple changes made to a purification process). While the inclusion of multiple related changes in one supplement may result in a higher reporting category proportionate to the change with the highest risk as well as cumulative impact of all changes, this approach is expected to provide a comprehensive assessment of the combined effect of all changes onprocess performance and product quality. Inclusion of multiple unrelated changes in one submission, even those in the same reporting category, could result in a potential delay in implementing all of the changes (e.g., approximability of any single change may affect approximability of all the changes included in the supplement).\n\nV Special Considerations\n\nChange in Process Parameters\n\nProcess parameters (operating and performance) are frequently adjusted over a product's lifecycle. Additional knowledge and experience about material attributes, operating and performance parameters, and the way their interaction affects product quality and process performance typically enable a more informed risk assessment and risk ranking. Any change to process parameters (operating or performance) outside of an approved validated range(s) should be evaluated with respect to criticality, impact on process performance and product quality, and effectiveness of the overall control strategy and must be reported to FDA.24 The reporting category selected should be commensurate with the risk of an unintended outcome resulting from changes involving these elements.\n\nFootnote 24: 21 CFR 601.12.\n\nChange in a Supplier of Raw Materials\n\nWe recommend the following manufacturing changes be reported in a PAS:\n\nA change in a supplier of raw materials that have a substantial potential to affect product quality, including inactivation, detoxification, immunization in the production of hyperimmune plasma, or conjugation (e.g., PEG, acridinium ester, biotin, beads); and\n\nA change in a supplier of raw materials that have a substantial potential to affect product quality, including an ability to maintain specified pH or ionic strength in the manufacture of plasma-derived fractionated products (e.g., phosphate, tris, ethanol).\n\nWe recommend the following manufacturing changes be reported in a CBE30:\n\nA change in a supplier of raw materials used to aid in filtration (e.g., celite, diatomaceous earth, activated carbon); or\n\nA change in a supplier of trypsin or serum used in the manufacture of viral vaccine products.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nWe recommend the following manufacturing change be reported in an AR:\n\nA change in a supplier of raw materials that have a minimal potential to affect product quality, provided that the materials' specific use, physicochemical properties, impurity content, and acceptance criteria remain unchanged.\n\nMiscellaneous changes not specified in Appendix\n\nThe Appendix contains examples for the types of manufacturing changes most commonly seen by FDA and is not intended to be comprehensive. If you plan to implement a manufacturing change that is not covered in the Appendix, it is your responsibility to perform a risk assessment to determine the appropriate reporting category and to contact the appropriate FDA Review Division if you have questions.\n\nVI Glossary\n\nAcceptance Criteria - Numerical limits, ranges, or other suitable measures for acceptance of the results of analytical procedures which the Drug Substance or Drug Product or materials at other stages of their manufacture should meet (Ref. [16]).\n--------------------\nContext title: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved Application- Certain Biological Products Guidance for Industry\n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.910136699676514", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: Adverse Effect\n\nSome manufacturing changes have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug. In many cases, the applicant chooses not to implement these manufacturing changes, but sometimes the applicant wishes to do so. If an assessment indicates that a change has adversely affected the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug, FDA recommends that the change be submitted in a prior approval supplement, regardless of the recommended reporting category for the change. For example, a process change recommended for a changes-being-effected-in-30-days supplement could cause the formation of a new degradant that requires qualification and/or identification. The applicant's degradation qualification procedures may indicate that there are no safety concerns relating to the new degradant. Even so, the applicant should submit this change in a prior approval supplement with appropriate information to support the continued safety and effectiveness of the drug. During the review of the prior approval supplement, FDA will assess the impact of any adverse effect on the drug as this change may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug.\n\nApplicants are encouraged to consult with CVM's Division of Manufacturing Technologies, HFV-140, if there are any questions on whether a change in a characteristic would be viewed by CVM as adversely affecting the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug.\n\nV Components and Composition\n\nChanges in the qualitative or quantitative formulation, including inactive ingredients, as provided in the approved application are considered major changes and must be submitted in a prior approval supplement, unless exempted by regulation or guidance (21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(ii)(A)). The deletion or reduction of an ingredient intended to affect only the color of the drug product may be reported in an annual report (21 CFR 514.8(b)(4)(ii)(B)). Guidance on changes in components and composition that may be submitted in a changes-being-effected supplement or annual report is not included in this document because of the complexity of these recommendations, but may be covered in one or more guidance documents describing post-approval changes (e.g., SUPAC documents).\n\nVI Manufacturing sites\n\nGeneral Considerations\n\nCVM must be notified when a manufacturer changes to a manufacturing site that is different from those specified in the approved application (21 CFR 514.8(b)(1)(i)). Manufacturing sites can include those used by an applicant to, for example, (1) manufacture or process drug products,7 in-process materials, Type A predicated articles, drug substances or drug substance intermediates, (2) package drug products, (3) label drug products, and (4) test components, drug product containers, closures, packaging materials, in-process materials, Type A predicated articles, or drug products. Sites include those owned by the applicant or contract sites used by an applicant. Testing sites include those performing physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological testing to monitor, accept, or reject materials as well as those performing stability testing. Sites used to label drug products are considered those that perform labeling of the drug product's primary or secondary packaging components. Sites performing operations that place identifying information on the dosage form itself (e.g., ink imprint on a filled capsule) are considered to be facilities that manufacture or process the drug product. FDA recommends that the supplement or annual report should identify whether the proposed manufacturing site is an alternative to or replacement for the site or sites provided for in the approved application.\n\nFootnote 7: Manufacturing or processing a drug also includes the preparation (e.g., sterilization, depyrogenation, irradiation, washing) of container closure systems or packaging components. Changes in the site used to fabricate packaging components (e.g., bottles) or manufacture packaging materials (e.g., resins) need not be reported to CVM if there are no other changes (e.g., dimensions, composition, processing aids). If other changes occur, the reporting category should be based on the recommended reporting categories for these changes (i.e., the manufacturing site change does not need to be considered when determining the appropriate reporting category).\n\nFDA recommends that a move to a different manufacturing site, when it is a type of site routinely subjected to FDA inspection, be submitted as a prior approval supplement if the site does not have a _satisfactory CGMP inspection_8 for the _type of operation_9 being moved (see sections VI.B.1 and 2).\n\nFootnote 8: See Glossary for a definition of satisfactory CGMP inspection.\n\nFootnote 9: See Attachment A for a discussion of the term type of operation.\n\nFor labeling, secondary packaging, and testing site changes, the potential for adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a drug as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug is considered to be independent of the type of drug or specific type of operation being performed. Therefore, the recommended reporting category for any one of these manufacturing site changes will be the same for all types of drugs and operations. For manufacturing sites used to (1) manufacture or process drugs including, for example, drug products, Type A predicated articles, in-process materials, drug substances, or drug substance intermediates or (2) performprimary packaging operations, the potential for adverse effect depends on factors such as the type of drug and operation being performed. Therefore, recommended reporting categories may differ depending on the type of drug and operation.\n\nExcept for the situations described in sections VI.B.4, VI.C.1.b, and VI.D.5, construction activities at a manufacturing site or moving production operations within a building or between buildings at the same manufacturing site, do not have to be reported to CVM.\n\nWe recommend that a move to a manufacturing site that involves other changes (e.g., process, equipment) should be evaluated as a multiple related change (see section XI) to determine the appropriate reporting category.\n\nA change from one drug substance manufacturer to another typically involves more than simply a site change. In the majority of cases, there will be additional differences (e.g., route of synthesis, process, solvents, equipment). Without extensive knowledge of both sources (i.e., old and new), an applicant cannot adequately describe the differences between the sources, or evaluate the multiple change. Therefore, in the case where the applicant does not have the extensive knowledge to provide this information and evaluation, the site change should be reported in a prior approval supplement. When an applicant does have the extensive knowledge to describe the differences between the sources, it can report the change as appropriate after evaluation as a multiple change. If the change is not reported in a prior approval supplement, the applicant should include a statement in the submission that the change involves no changes that should be reported in a prior approval supplement.\n\nMajor Changes (Prior Approval Supplement)\n\nThe following are examples of changes considered to have a substantial potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of a drug as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug.\n\nA move to a different manufacturing site, except one used to manufacture or process a drug substance intermediate, when the new manufacturing site has never been inspected by FDA for the type of operation that is being moved, or the move results in a restart at the new manufacturing site of a type of operation that has been discontinued for more than two years.\n\nA move to a different manufacturing site, when the new manufacturing site does not have a satisfactory CGMP inspection for the type of operation being moved.\n\nA move to a different manufacturing site for (1) the manufacture, processing, or primary packaging of drug products when the primary packaging components control the dose delivered to the patient or the formulation modifies the rate or extent of availability of the drug, or (2) the manufacture or processing of in-process materials with modified-release characteristics. Examples of these types of drug products include modified-release solid oral dosage forms,10 transdermal systems, liposomal drug products, depot drug products, oral and nasal metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), dry powder inhalers (DPIs), and nasal spray pumps. Footnote 10: Certain operations relating to the manufacture, processing, or primary packaging of modified-release solid oral dosage form drug products need not be reported in a prior approval supplement (see sections VI.C.1.c and VI.D.6).\n\nTransfer of the manufacture of an aseptically processed sterile drug substance or aseptically processed sterile drug product to (1) a newly constructed or refurbished aseptic processing facility or area, or (2) an existing aseptic processing facility or area that does not manufacture similar (including container types and sizes) approved drug products. Once this change has been approved, subsequent site changes to the facility for similar drug product types and processes may be submitted as a changes-being-effected-in-30-days supplement (see section VI.C.1.b).\n\nTransfer of the manufacture of a drug product sterilized by terminal processes to a newly constructed facility at a different manufacturing site. Once this change has been approved, subsequent site changes to the facility for similar drug product types and processes may be submitted as a changes-being-effected-in-30-days supplement (see section VI.C.1.a).\n\nModerate Changes (Supplement-Changes Being Effected)\n--------------------\nContext title: CVM GFI #83 Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Changes to Approved NADA:ANADA \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -6.981513500213623", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Referring to Changes to an Approved NDA or ANDA Guidance for Industry, Can CDER be notified in an annual report when the filling speed line for a sterile product is increased by changing the speed of filling through the fill heads or adding filling heads.\n--------------------\nContext: Prior approval--Certain changes are considered to have sufficient risk to require regulatory authority review and approval prior to implementation and are requested by the MAH in a suitably detailed regulatory submission.\n\nNotification--Certain moderate- to low-risk changes are judged to not require prior approval and generally require less information to support the change. These changes are communicated to the regulatory authority as a formal notification that takes place within a defined period of time before or after implementation, according to regional requirements. A mechanism for immediate notification is useful when prior approval is not required, but timely awareness of the change by the regulator is considered necessary.\n\nIn addition, the changes that are not required to be reported to regulators are only managed and documented within the PQS, but may be verified during routine or other inspection.\n\nHarmonization or convergence toward a system of risk-based categorization of postapproval changes is encouraged as an important step toward achieving the objectives of this guidance. Such a system provides inherent, valuable flexibility in regulatory approach and a framework that can support additional regulatory opportunities, such as:\n\nFacilitating the use of tools and enablers described in this guidance by providing a range of request and notification categories available as a target for a lowering of regulatory submission requirements.\n\nThe use of a lower category for request/notification if certain criteria/conditions are met and the relevant supporting documentation is provided as described in regional regulatory guidance; the need for regulatory inspection associated with the change may preclude the ability to use a lower category.\n\nProviding options for converging to the same or similar reporting category as in other jurisdictions.\n\nA risk-based categorization system may be accomplished by having the principles captured in regulations with further details in guidance, as appropriate, which can provide additional flexibility to modify expectations as science and technology evolve. For examples of risk-based categorization systems, refer to the existing regulations and guidance of ICH members, and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and guidance on changes to authorized products.\n\nIII Established Conditions (3)\n\nIntroduction (3.1)\n\nThis guidance establishes a harmonized approach to defining which elements in an application are considered necessary to assure product quality and therefore would require a regulatory submission if changed postapproval. These elements are being defined in this guidance as Established Conditions for Manufacturing and Control (referred to as ECs throughout this guidance).\n\nECs in the Regulatory Submission (3.2)\n\nIii.1.1 ECs Definition (3.2.1)\n\nECs are legally binding information considered necessary to assure product quality. As a consequence, any change to ECs necessitates a submission to the regulatory authority.\n\nIii.1.2 ECs in a Regulatory Dossier (3.2.2)\n\nThis section describes scientific risk-based approaches which can be used when defining ECs and their reporting categories. Regional legal frameworks, supplemented through regulation and guidance, may define ECs with their reporting categories and/or may allow the scientific risk-based approaches described in this section to be considered.\n\nAll regulatory dossiers contain a combination of ECs and supportive information. Supportive information is not considered to be ECs but is provided to share with regulators the development and manufacturing information at an appropriate level of detail. Knowledge gained throughout the product lifecycle (including pharmaceutical development and characterization of chemical and biological drug substance and drug product) is the basis for identifying the elements of CMC that are ECs and those elements which are supportive information.\n\nAn MAH should clearly identify the elements of CMC which they consider to be ECs and those which they consider to be supportive information. The rationales for the ECs are provided in the appropriate Common Technical Document (CTD) modules.\n\nSimilarly, the rationales for the associated reporting categories for changes to the ECs should be provided in the appropriate CTD modules. The regulator assesses the ECs with respect to established scientific guidelines. Where appropriate, regulators approve the EC and associated reporting category in line with the principles outlined in section II.\n\nSee Appendix 1 for more information regarding sections of the dossier that contain ECs and supportive information. Unless otherwise specified by regulatory requirement, identifying ECs for a given product is not mandatory.\n\nECs should not be confused with CMC regulatory commitments (e.g., stability, postapproval CMC commitment, and other commitments) made by an MAH to provide data or information to the regulatory agency in an MAA. Such information, in the context of this guidance, is considered supportive information. Changes to CMC regulatory commitments are managed according to existing regional regulations and guidance.\n\nii.1.3 Identification of ECs (3.3.3)\n\nThis section outlines approaches to define ECs for manufacturing processes and analytical procedures. A similar approach can be used to define other types of ECs (e.g., performance of the container closure system, device elements of drug-device combination products) and should be justified by the applicant and approved by the regulatory agency.\n\nThe extent of ECs may vary based on the company's development approach, product and process understanding, and the potential risk to product quality. Appropriate justification should be provided in support of the identification of ECs, the proposed reporting categories for ECs, and those aspects that are not ECs.\n\na. Identification of ECs for manufacturing processes (3.2.3.1)\n\nA control strategy is designed to ensure that a product of required quality will be produced consistently (ICH Q8(R2)). It is a planned set of controls, derived from current product and process understanding, that assures process performance and product quality. The controls can include parameters and attributes related to drug substance and drug product materials and components, facility and equipment operating conditions, in-process controls, finished product specifications, and the associated methods and frequency of monitoring and control (ICH Q10).\n\nThe ECs for a manufacturing process should be defined based on product and process understanding, taking into account all of the relevant elements of the control strategy. In addition to the unit operation and the sequence of steps, and in considering the overall control strategy, ECs proposed and justified in a manufacturing process description should be those inputs (e.g., process parameters, material attributes) and outputs (that may include in-process controls) that are necessary to assure product quality.\n\nProcess parameters that need to be controlled to ensure that a product of required quality will be produced should be considered ECs. These ECs are identified through an initial risk assessment and application of knowledge gained from executed studies, prior knowledge, and a criticality assessment that determines the level of impact that a process parameter could have on product quality. The criticality assessment should account for severity of harm and whether the ranges studied sufficiently account for the expected variability in the EC. Critical process parameters (CPPs) and other process parameters where an impact on product quality cannot be reasonably excluded should be identified as ECs.\n\nOnce ECs are identified, an updated assessment of the potential risk to product quality associated with changing the EC, taking into account the overall control strategy, informs the reporting category for the EC. The assessment of potential risk is derived from risk management activitiesas described in ICH Q9. The output of the risk assessment can include changes to manufacturing process ECs that range from high to low risk to product quality. The reporting category should be defined based on level of risk. A justification of the potential risk associated with changing ECs and corresponding reporting categories should be provided.\n\nA decision tree which illustrates the above step-wise approach to identifying ECs and reporting categories for process parameters is shown in Figure 1. The principles in the decision tree can be applied to identify ECs for other parts of the manufacturing process and control strategy (e.g., relevant elements of input material attributes, equipment, and in-process controls) and associated reporting categories.\n\nThe details of ECs and the associated reporting category will depend on the extent to which the company can apply knowledge from product and process understanding (i.e., development and experience accumulated throughout the product lifecycle) to manage the risks to product quality. Different approaches can be used alone, or in combination, to identify ECs for manufacturing processes; these include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nParameter-based approaches, including:\n\nFigure 1: Decision Tree for Identification of ECs and Associated Reporting Categories for Manufacturing Process Parameters\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]\n\n3.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIdentification of ECs for analytical procedures (3.2.3.2)\n--------------------\nContext title: Q12 Technical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmaceutical Product Lifecycle Management Guidance for Industry Guidance for Industry \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -7.131649494171143"], "Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?": ["\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: The definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n\nThe determination of the amount of added sugars contributed by a powdered fruit or vegetable juice that is added as an ingredient to a product and that is not reconstituted to single strength juice during processing (e.g., that is added to a pureed fruit or to a yogurt) would be the same as the determination of the sugars contributed by a liquid or frozen fruit or vegetable juice concentrate. In our response to question 11, we have suggested that when calculating the added sugars declaration for a product containing concentrated fruit or vegetable juice, the total moisture content of the finished product can be considered to go towards reconstitution of the fruit juice concentrate in the formulation. Thus, the total moisture content of a finished product formulated with powdered fruit or vegetable juice concentrates can be considered to contribute towards the dilution of the powdered fruit or vegetable juice. Further, the sugars contributed by the powdered fruit or vegetable juice that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type must be declared as added sugars on the label, as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule.\n8. Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates? We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12). We require that, when a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)). If you use Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 to calculate the amount of added sugars in a product containing juice concentrate, you must document this information in the records regarding the amount of added sugars added to the food during processing (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). If you use the amount of sugars present in a single strength juice and/or a juice concentrate, that is determined through chemical analysis or other available information, when calculating the amount of added sugars in a product containing fruit juice concentrate, you must document the source of the information and/or the amount of sugars determined through chemical analysis in the records that you make and keep (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). If a diluted juice concentrate slightly exceeds the amount of sugar that would be found in the same volume of the same type of 100 percent fruit juice, manufacturers should document the average and consistency with cGMPs in the records that they make and keep.\n9. Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis? The amount of added sugars declared on the label must be in grams (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The added sugars definition includes sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. For juice, the serving size is based on volume (e.g., 8 oz. or 240 ml) while the amount of added sugars per serving is based on weight. Therefore, when calculating the weight of added sugars per serving, you may need to consider the densities of both the finished juice product and the single strength juice of the same type. You may choose to arrive at the gram amount of added sugars in different ways. Please see our responses to questions 11 and 12 for examples of how to calculate the amount of added sugars in products containing concentrated fruit juices on both a volume and weight basis.\n10. How should I calculate the amount of added sugars in a fruit or vegetable juice (juice made from a single type of fruit or vegetable) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength juice where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9)? In the hypothetical example below, we provide three general steps to calculate the amount of added sugars (in grams) for an apple juice product (240 ml serving size) that is reconstituted to have a sugar content above that in a single strength apple juice. The product in this hypothetical example is reconstituted to have juice soluble solids above the minimum Brixrequirement in 21 CFR 101.30 where the excess sugar content is above what is consistent with cGMPs (see Q&A 9). Therefore, all sugars in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of the same type of single strength juice must be declared as added sugars. The apple juice example here uses the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration. This example is provided solely to demonstrate one method of calculating the added sugars content of the product. You can use alternate methods.\n\nStep 1: Obtain the total weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size in the final apple juice product.\n\nThis amount would be used for the total sugar declaration per 240 ml serving size of your finished apple juice product.\n\nStep 2: Obtain the weight of sugars (in grams) per 240 ml serving size if the apple juice were reconstituted to single strength juice (i.e., the weight of sugar in the theoretical single strength juice of the same type).\n\nThere are different ways to obtain this information. For example, you may obtain such information from your juice concentrate supplier. You may look up such information in private or public nutrient databases. You may also choose to experimentally make a single strength apple juice and measure the total amount of sugar per 240 ml serving. In addition, you may use the following method to calculate the amount of sugar per 240 ml serving in a single strength apple juice.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 6.082624912261963", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines includes a recommendation for healthy eating patterns that limit added sugars (including honey, syrups, and other caloric sweeteners) to less than 10 percent of calories per day (Ref. 3).\n\nNutrition Facts Label Final Rule\n\nIn the Federal Register of May 27, 2016, we issued a final rule updating the Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods to reflect new scientific information (see 81 FR 33742). The Nutrition Facts label final rule includes changes in the individual nutrients that must be declared and also changes some of the DVs. The science underlying the Nutrition Facts label final rule, referenced above, is also reflected in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires that added sugars be included in the Nutrition Facts label and established a DV for added sugars. The Nutrition Facts label final rule defines \"added sugars,\" in part, to include sugars that are either added during the processing of foods or are packaged as such (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). The term includes free sugars (free mono- and disaccharides), sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The Nutrition Facts label final rule requires added sugars to be declared on the food label by stating \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" indented directly below \"Total Sugars\" (see 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(ii)).\n\nThe Nutrition Facts label final rule requires a declaration for added sugars, in part, because excess consumption of added sugars makes it difficult to meet nutrient needs within the calorie limits generally needed to maintain a healthy weight and can lead to an increase in overall caloric intake. Further, healthy dietary patterns characterized, in part, by lower amounts of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, as compared to less healthy dietary patterns, are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary_Guidelines demonstrates that meeting nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits is difficult with more than 10 percent of total daily calories from added sugars (50 grams of added sugars based on a 2,000 calorie diet). Based on this science, the Nutrition Facts label final rule establishes a DV for added sugars, 50 grams based on a 2,000 calorie diet for adults and children 4 years of age and older and 25 grams based on a 1,000 calorie diet for children 1 through 3 years of age (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(vii)).\n\nPure (100%) honey, pure (100%) maple syrup, other single-ingredient sugars and syrups, and certain cranberry products sweetened with added sugars contribute to the DV of added sugars, regardless of whether they are added by consumers to foods (e.g., maple syrup poured over pancakes; sugar added to dried cranberries to increase palatability) or consumed in isolation (e.g., a spoonful of honey). FDA's definition encompasses the types of added sugars that were evaluated in the science underlying the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommendation that no more than 10 percent of calories be from added sugars. These sugars were considered \"empty calories\" or \"calories for other uses\" in the USDA Food Patterns.\n\nDraft Guidance\n\nIn the Federal Register of March 2, 2018 (83 FR 8953), we made available a draft guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, and Certain Cranberry Products; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availability\" (hereafter referred to as \"the draft guidance\") and asked interested parties to submit comments by May 1, 2018. In the Federal Register of April 25, 2018 (83 FR 17961), we extended the comment period to June 15, 2018. We have considered comments to the draft guidance, and we have made modifications, where appropriate, that are now reflected in this final guidance.\n\nFarm Bill\n\nAfter we published the Nutrition Facts label final rule and the Serving Size final rule, and draft guidance, the President signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (\"the Farm Bill\"). Section 12516 of the Farm Bill states that the food labeling requirements under section 403(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)) shall not require that the Nutrition Facts label of any single-ingredient sugar, honey, agave, or syrup, including maple syrup, that is packaged and offered for sale as a single-ingredient food bear the declaration \"Includes Xg Added Sugars.\" Therefore, single-ingredient sugars, honey, agave, and syrups, including maple syrup, do not need to have this statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving of their product on their label. At the same time, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet.\n\nIII Discussion\n\nAlthough the gram amount of added sugars in a serving of pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups does not need to be declared on the label, these single-ingredient sugars and syrups are required under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV that they contribute to added sugars in the diet. The percent DV on pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups provides important information to consumers about how the addition of sugar from these products contributes to their total daily diet. In the absence of the declaration of the amount of added sugars in a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product, a statement that includes information about the amount of sugars in a serving, as well as how that amount contributes to the consumer's diet and the percent DV for added sugars, provides information that can assist consumers in constructing a diet that is consistent with recommendations in the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines.\n\nTherefore, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the use of a \"(\\dagger)\" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV and, per the Farm Bill, the term \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" would not need to appear on the line on the Nutrition Facts label disclosing the added sugars percent DV. The \"(\\dagger)\" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading within a footnote in the Nutrition Facts label box that includes a description of the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent DV for added sugars in the diet. The footnote containing this factual statement should be placed beneath the required footnote that states, \"The % Daily Value (DV) tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice\" (see illustration below).5 Our intent to exercise enforcement discretion is limited to any pure, single-ingredient honey and maple syrup, and other pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups.\n\nFootnote 5: Note that the illustration provides an example of a truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of the product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet. FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for the use of any truthful and not misleading statement about the gram amount of sugar added to the diet by one serving of a single-ingredient sugar or syrup product and its contribution to the percent Daily Value for added sugars in the diet.\n\nWe also intend to exercise our enforcement discretion for certain cranberry products described here (dried cranberries without added flavorings and cranberry beverages made up of cranberry juice that is sweetened with added sugars that provide an amount of total sugars in a serving that does not exceed the level of total sugars in a serving of a comparable product with no added sugars) to allow for the use of a \"(\\dagger)\" symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV. The \"(\\dagger)\" symbol should direct consumers to a statement that is truthful and not misleading on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nManufacturers could explain, through the use of such statements, that the sugars added to dried cranberries or the cranberry beverage product are meant to increase the palatability of the naturally tart fruit and that the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. We have provided illustrations of such statements that we consider to be truthful and not misleading below.\n\nAt this time, we are not aware of products, other than the dried cranberry and cranberry beverage products previously discussed, for which the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars. Therefore, at this time we only intend to exercise enforcement discretion for cranberry products previously discussed with respect to the use of the \"(\\uparrow)\" that would direct consumers to truthful and not misleading statements on the package outside the Nutrition Facts label, and do not intend to exercise enforcement discretion on other products (e.g., a granola bar or trail mix containing dried sugar-sweetened cranberries). We note that we would consider whether the same type of enforcement discretion discussed with respect to the cranberry products previously described might be warranted for other products where the addition of sugars is intended to increase palatability, such as naturally tart fruits, and for which the amount of total sugars per serving is at a level that does not exceed the amount of total sugars in a comparable product with no added sugars.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: 2.7039294242858887", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: 3. Do I need to take into consideration sugars from ingredients that are used in formulating my product when determining the added sugars declaration for a serving of my product?\n\nIngredients containing free mono- and disaccharides that meet our definition of added sugars need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (e.g. sugars from cane sugar and concentrated fruit juice added to sweeten an apple sauce). Manufacturers may need to work with ingredient suppliers to determine the amount of added sugars provided by ingredients used in formulating food products.\n\n4. Do the sugars in dried fruits meet the definition of added sugars?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we responded to comments on dried fruits (see response to comment 212, 81 FR 33742 at 33837). We said that dried fruits which have not had any sugar added to them should not be considered to contain added sugars because they are essentially a dehydrated whole fruit and still retain the nutrients and other components of a whole fruit (e.g. diced dried apples). However, if additional sugar is added to a dried fruit, the sugar added to the dried fruit must be declared on the label as added sugars (81 FR 33742 at 33837).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\n5. Are the sugars used in the production of vinegar added sugars?\n\nIn the production of vinegar, naturally occurring sugars are first fermented into alcohol and then a secondary fermentation occurs in which alcohol is converted to vinegar. For most vinegar products, no sugars remain in the final product. Vinegars that do not contain any sugars in the finished food would not need an added sugars declaration. However, we are aware of some vinegars (e.g., balsamic vinegar) that are made using ingredients that are often used as sweeteners in foods, and that are similar to concentrated fruit juices (e.g., grape must). According to the definition of added sugars, sugars found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected in the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type are added sugars. Therefore, fruit juices that are concentrated before or during processing of some vinegars contain sugars that are consistent with our definition of added sugars. To the extent that sugars that meet our definition of added sugars are present in the finished product, the added sugars must be declared on the label and in labeling, as required in our Nutrition Facts label final rule. We understand that the manufacturing of vinegar involves several steps, and manufacturers need to consider the impact of these steps (e.g. potential concentration due to water loss when aged in wooden barrels) on the final added sugars declaration.\n\n6. The definition of added sugars excludes the \"fruit component of fruit spreads.\" What constitutes the \"fruit component\" of a non-standardized fruit spread?\n\nPlease see our response to question 1 above. The fruit component of a non-standardized fruit spread would include whole fruits, pieces of fruit, dried fruit, fruit or vegetable pures (single strength or concentrated), fruit pulps, single strength juices, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders that are not made from fruit or vegetable juices.\n\n7. Do sugars found in fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the form of the fruit or vegetable (e.g., concentrated fruit and vegetable pures, fruit and vegetable pastes, and fruit and vegetable powders) need to be declared as added sugars on the label?\n\nIn the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833), we explained that we excluded from the definition of \"added sugars\" whole fruit, fruit pieces, dried fruit, pulps, and pures because they are nutrient rich and maintain the basic properties of a fruit when added to foods and are not considered to contain added sugars (see response to comment 208, 81 FR 33742 at33835). We also explained that sugars from 100 percent fruit and vegetable juices, and sugars from certain fruit and vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under certain regulations, fruit juice concentrates used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, and preserves under our standards of identity, and 100 percent juice concentrate sold directly to consumers (e.g. frozen orange juice concentrate) are excluded from the definition of \"added sugars.\"\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33833 through 33834), we explained that, while foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices can be a part of a healthful diet, the sugars added to the foods by the concentrated fruit or vegetable juice provide additional calories. Over the course of the day, small amounts of calories in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages can add up and make it difficult to balance the amount of calories expended (81 FR 33742 at 33834). For these reasons, we consider foods sweetened with concentrated fruit or vegetable juices to be sugar-sweetened foods (id).\n\nWe also explained that in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) report (Ref. 1) (81 FR 33742 at 33835).\n\nWe are applying these same guiding principles when determining when the sugars in an ingredient are added sugars. Concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes, and some fruit and vegetable powders are essentially whole fruits and vegetables that have been processed to change the physical form of the fruit or vegetable and to remove moisture. They maintain the basic properties of a whole fruit or vegetable, even if the peel and seeds may be removed. Their composition and use is more consistent with that of whole fruits or vegetables, dried fruits or vegetables, pulps and pureses than that of concentrated fruit juices, which are commonly used by industry in place of sugars. Therefore, the sugars in concentrated fruit and vegetable pureses, fruit and vegetable pastes and some fruit and vegetable powders contribute to the diet the same way that sugars found in whole fruits or vegetables do, and do not have to be declared as added sugars on the label. However, we consider sugars in powders made from fruit and vegetable juices to be the same as those found in concentrated fruit and vegetable juices because such powders are essentially concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that have all moisture removed. Therefore, some or all sugars contributed by a powder made from fruit or vegetable juices must be declared as added sugars on the label as required by the Nutrition Facts label final rule, depending on the degree of reconstitution in the finished food.\n\nThe definition of added sugars includes sugars from concentrated fruit and vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. The definition of added sugars excludes sugars from fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers. We said, in the preamble of the Nutrition Facts label final rule, that concentrated juice products made from 100 percent juice (e.g., frozen orange juice concentrate) that are sold directly to consumers (e.g. in grocery stores or on the Internet) are typically reconstituted with water by consumers before consumption, and the packaging of such products typically provides directions for reconstituting the concentrated juice to 100 percent juice (81 FR 33742 at 33834). Similarly, powders made from fruit and vegetable juices that are sold to consumers in drink mixes typically provide directions to dilute the product with water before consumption. Therefore, we would consider powdered fruit and vegetable juices made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength (100 percent) to be the same as non-powdered 100 percent fruit or vegetable juices described in the final rule. Therefore, the sugars in powdered fruit and vegetable juice made from 100 percent juices which are sold to consumers in drink mixes with instructions to use water to reconstitute the juice to single strength do not need to be declared as added sugars on the label.\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -0.4251098930835724", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: A food that already contains some endogenous sugar and additional added sugars, either directly or as a component in an ingredient, such as sweetened fruit added to yogurt, would be misbranded if the actual \"Total Sugars\" amount is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label, or the records requirements for \"Added Sugars\" are not met (see SS 101.9(g)(11)).\n\nDo sugars present in a sweet fermented beverage after fermentation need to be declared as total or added sugars on the label?\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains only sugars that meet our definition of added sugars (e.g. table sugar), then the amount of sugars present in a serving of the product after fermentation must be declared as both total and added sugars (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains both sugars that do and do not meet our definition of added sugars, you may determine the amount of total sugars in the finished food analytically. You have the following options related to the added sugars declaration:\n\nDetermine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in the finished product and make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information you relied upon that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation; or\n\nDeclare the amount of added sugars added prior to fermentation and make and keep records to verify the amount (21 CFR 101.9(g)). The amount of added sugars declared should not exceed the amount of total sugars on the label; or\n\nIf you have no way to determine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in the finished food, but have reason to believe that a significant reduction of added sugars took place during fermentation, you may submit a petition, under 21 CFR 10.30, to request an alternative means of compliance. The petition should provide scientific data or other information for why the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product is likely to be significantly reduced compared to the amount added prior to fermentation. A significant reduction would be where reduction in added sugars after fermentation may be significant enough to impact the label declaration for added sugars by an amount that exceeds the reasonable deficiency acceptable within good manufacturing practice under SS 101.9(g)(6). In addition, the scientific data or other information should include the reason why you are unable to determine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in a serving of the finished product and a description of the process that you used to come to that conclusion.\n\nIngredients made primarily from sugar and created through non-enzymatic browning are added to some products for coloring and flavoring purposes (e.g. caramel color). After non-enzymatic browning occurs, the sugar is reduced in the ingredient. In such a case, how much sugar must be declared as added sugars on the label? If the remaining amount of the sugar contributed by an ingredient that undergoes non-enzymatic browning is detectable by testing in the finished product, you may declare that amount of sugar that is detectible by analytical testing in the finished product as the added sugars declaration. When such an ingredient is added to a product that contains other sugars that do not meet the definition of added sugars, you must make and keep records, which should include records of the results of the analytical testing that is used to demonstrate the amount of added sugars contributed by the ingredient in the finished product after non-enzymatic browning occurs, and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(v)(A)).\n\n20. If sugar is added for fermentation during the leavening process of a baked good and some of the sugars are consumed by yeast, should the reduction in the amount of sugars be accounted for the declaration of added sugars?\n\nAs described in our response to question 19, you may declare the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation. If you do so, you must make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information relied upon by the manufacturer that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(v)(A)).\n21. There is a chance that added sugars content prior to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation may be higher than the total sugars content of the finished food determined through chemical analysis. How do I approximate the added sugars value in this case?\n\nThe added sugars declaration should not exceed the total sugars declaration. In a case where sugars added prior to or during processing are reduced through non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation, and the manufacturer chooses to declare the amount of sugars added prior to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation, the added sugars declaration could conceivably exceed the amount of total sugars determined through chemical analysis. In such a case, you should declare the same amount for added sugars as the amount of total sugars obtained through analytical testing for a serving of the food.\n\nV Question and Answer on Format Issues\n\n1. What are the specifications for thickness of lines and leading (i.e., space between lines) on the Nutrition Facts label?\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(ii)(C) and (d)(1)(v) establish certain format requirements with respect to leading and the use of hairline rules.\n\nAdditionally, Appendix B to Part 101 in Title 21 provides examples of graphic enhancements (i.e., illustrations) that FDA uses. For more examples of graphic enhancements that FDA uses, please see our webpage at: https://www.fda.gov/media/99151/download.\n\nQuestion and Answer on the Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals\n\n1. What are the requirements (e.g. for rounding) for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals declared on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels? What does \"levels of significance\" mean in this context?\n\nWe require, under 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii), that the quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals, excluding sodium, be the amount of the vitamin or mineral included in a serving of the product using the units of measurement and the levels of significance given in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) (which refers to the Reference Daily Intakes (RDI) table). However, zeros following decimal points may be dropped, and additional levels of significance may be used when the number of decimal places indicated is not sufficient to express lower amounts (e.g., the RDI for zinc is given in whole milligrams, but the quantitative amount may be declared in tenths of a milligram). This is consistent with the requirements for the declaration of quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the Supplement Facts label (see 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B)).\n\nIn addition, regarding conventional foods, quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals present at less than 2 percent of the RDI are not required to be declared on the Nutrition Facts label. However, they may be declared by a zero or by the use of an asterisk (or other symbol) that refers to another asterisk (or symbol) that is placed at the bottom of the table that is followed by the statement \"Contains less than 2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients)\" or \"Contains (<)2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients).\" Alternatively, if vitamin D, calcium, iron or potassium is present in amounts less than 2 percent of the RDI, label declaration of the nutrient(s) is not required if the statement \"Not a significant source of _(listing the vitamins or minerals omitted)\" is placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii)).\n\nRegarding dietary supplements, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium must be declared when they are present in a dietary supplement in quantitative amounts by weight that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling of foods in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c). (21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)).\n\nAs for the phrase \"levels of significance,\" as used in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii) and 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) and whether the phrase refers to statistical testing of hypotheses or mathematical concepts related to the degree of accuracy starting with the first nonzero digit, the phrase \"levels of significance\" refers to the degree of accuracy when rounding nutrients for purposes of declaring quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals on the label.\n\nOur regulations, at 21 CFR 101.9(c), provide specific rounding requirements for nutrients such as sodium. Before we issued the Nutrition Facts label final rule, sodium and potassium content was to be expressed as zero when the serving contained less than 5 milligrams (mg), to the nearest 5 mg increment when the serving contained less than or equal to 140 mg, and to the nearest 10 mg increment when the serving contained more than 140 mg. The Nutrition\n\n4.2.2 Contains Nonbinding Recommendations\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -1.6976919174194336", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: The amount of added sugars declared on the label should never exceed the amount of total sugars on the label.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(i) Do Honey, Maple Syrup, and Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n\nIn the Federal Register of June 20, 2019 (84 FR 28726), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products,\" which provides clarity on the labeling of added sugars for such products (Ref. 1). In that guidance, we discuss section 12516 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334) (\"the Farm Bill\"), which states that the food labeling requirements cannot require the declaration \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" in a serving of these single-ingredient products. While these products are not required to have this declaration of the gram amount of added sugars, the Farm Bill did not change the requirement under the Nutrition Facts label final rule to include the percent DV for the contribution of sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet, so the percent DV for added sugars must still be included consistent with 21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(ii). We stated that we intend to exercise enforcement discretion by permitting the use of the \"+\" symbol immediately following the percent DV declaration for added sugars on packages and containers of single-ingredient sugars and syrups. This symbol would lead to a footnote inside the Nutrition Facts label, explaining the amount of added sugars that one serving of the product contributes to the diet, as well as the contribution of a serving of the product toward the percent DV for added sugars. This symbol and footnote are not required; however, we encourage you to use them.\n\nV.A.1.(a).(ii) Do Added Sugars in Dried Cranberry Products and Cranberry Beverage Products Have to be Declared as Added Sugars?\n\nYou must still declare added sugars in grams and the corresponding percent DV on labels for all dried cranberry products and cranberry beverage products (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). In the Declaration of Added Sugars on Honey, Maple Syrup, Other Single-Ingredient Sugars and Syrups, and Certain Cranberry Products guidance, we said that we intend to exercise enforcement discretion for these cranberry products to allow the use of a symbol immediately following the added sugars percent DV declaration which would lead to a truthful and not misleading statement outside the Nutrition Facts label explaining that sugars are added to improve the palatability of naturally tart cranberries (see Ref. 1). This symbol can be used for cranberry products that are sweetened with added sugars and that contain total sugars per serving at levels no greater than comparable products with no added sugars (i.e. unsweetened grape juice) (Ref. 1).\n\nV.A.1.(a).(iii) Does Allulose Count as an Added Sugar?\n\nThe final rule does not reach a decision as to whether allulose should be excluded from the labeling of carbohydrate, sugars, and/or added sugars. We stated that, as a monosaccharide, itmust be included in the declaration of each, pending any future rulemaking that would otherwise exclude it from the declaration (81 FR 33742 at 33796; 21 CFR 101.9(c)(i) through (iii)).\n\nIn the Federal Register of April 18, 2019 (84 FR 16272), we announced the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Allulose and Calories from Allulose on Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels.\" This guidance, when finalized, would advise manufacturers of our intent to exercise enforcement discretion for the exclusion of allulose from the amount of \"Total Sugars\" and \"Added Sugars\" declared on the label and the use of a general factor of 0.4 calories per gram for allulose when determining \"Calories\" on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels, pending review of the issues in a rulemaking (Ref. 2).\n\nv.a.1.(b) How Do I Calculate Added Sugars?\n\nIn the Federal Register of November 5, 2018 (83 FR 55266), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels: Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals.\" This guidance provides questions and answers (Q&A) on topics related to compliance with the labeling of added sugars. The Q&A discusses how you should determine the amount of added sugars in a serving of a product, as well as which ingredients need to be taken into consideration when calculating the added sugars declaration for a serving of a product (Ref. 3).\n\nThis guidance also provides a detailed discussion on the calculation of added sugars for ingredients and products such as concentrated fruit and vegetable purees, fruit and vegetable pastes, fruit and vegetable powders, juice cocktails, or juice blends, which often contain juice concentrates (Q&A IV. 7-12), products for which manufacturers employ a hydrolysis step (Q&A IV. 14-16), and products that undergo non-enzymatic browning or fermentation (Q&A IV. 18-21) (Ref. 3). Please refer to this guidance for questions you may have regarding the calculation and declaration of added sugars for a serving of your product.\n\nv.a.2 Vitamin D\n\nVitamin D is now considered a nutrient of \"public health significance\" for the general population, and its declaration is now mandatory (81 FR 33742 at 33884). Both the gram amount and the percent DV for Vitamin D must be declared at the bottom of the label, directly preceding the calcium declaration (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(ii)). While only the term \"vitamin D\" can be used on the food labels (21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv)), the specific form that is added to a food must be listed in the ingredient list statement (21 CFR 101.4). For Supplement Facts labels, the source ingredient may be identified within the nutrition label in parentheses immediately following or indented beneath the name of a dietary ingredient and preceded by the word \"as\" or \"from\" (21 CFR 101.36(d)). When you do not identify a source ingredient within the nutrition label, you must list it in an ingredient statement (21 CFR 101.4(g)). You should not list it in both places (81 FR 33742 at 33891).\n\nv.a.3 Potassium\n\nPotassium is also now considered a nutrient of \"public health significance\" for the general population (81 FR 33742 at 33884). It has been assigned an RDI, instead of a DRV (21 CFR 101.9(8)(iv)). We now require the declaration of both the gram amount and the percent DV for potassium at the bottom of the label, directly following the iron declaration. Potassium is now covered under the term \"mineral\" that appears in each section of 21 CFR 101.9. Any listing of potassium on the Nutrition Facts label must meet the specific nutrient declaration requirements for minerals under 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4), 101.9(g)(4)(i), 101.9(g)(4)(ii), and 101.9(g)(6). These requirements are discussed further in section VII.E \"Has Nutrient Compliance or the Level of Variance Allowed Changed?\" below.\n\nHave There Ben Any Changes to the Definition or Presentation of Nutrients That Were Already Required to Be Declared?\n\nv.b.1 Dietary Fiber\n\nAny dietary fiber declared on the label must meet the new definition of dietary fiber (21 CFR 101.9(c) and (c)(6)(i)), which is discussed in the following section. This definition includes a listing of dietary fiber that FDA has determined should be in the calculation of dietary fiber for declaration on Nutrition Facts labels. The new definition and process to amend the listing of dietary fiber is discussed in this section.\n\nv.b.1.(a) How Is Dietary Fiber Defined?\n\nDietary fiber is now defined as \"non-digestible soluble and insoluble carbohydrates (with 3 or more monomeric units), and lignin that are intrinsic and intact in plants; isolated or synthetic non-digestible carbohydrates (with 3 or more monomeric units) determined by FDA to have physiological effects that are beneficial to human health\" (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)). Soluble fiber and insoluble fiber both must meet this new definition of dietary fiber (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)(A) and (B)).\n\nv.b.1.(a).(i) Which Isolated or Synthetic Non-Digestible Carbohydrate(s) Qualify as Dietary Fiber?\n\nThe following isolated or synthetic non-digestible carbohydrate(s) should be included in the calculation of the amount of dietary fiber, as FDA has determined that they have physiological effects that are beneficial to human health:\n\nBeta-glucan soluble fiber (as described in 21 CFR 101.81(c)(2)(ii)(A));\n\nPsyllium husk (as described in 21 CFR 101.81(c)(2)(ii)(A)(6));\n\nCellulose;\n\nGuar gum;\n\nPectin;\n\nLocust bean gum; and\n\nHydroxypropylmethylcellulose. (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(i)).\n\nIn the Federal Register of June 15, 2018 (83 FR 27894), we announced the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled \"The Declaration of Certain Isolated or Synthetic Non-Digestible Carbohydrates as Dietary Fiber on Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels,\" where we stated that we intend to propose that the following eight non-digestible carbohydrates be added to the definition of dietary fiber, as well:\n\nMixed plant cell wall fibers (a broad category that includes fibers like sugar cane fiber and apple fiber, among many others);\n\nArabinoxylan;\n\nAlginate;\n\nInulin and inulin-type fructans;\n\nHigh amylose starch (resistant starch 2);\n\nGalactooligosaccharide;\n\nPolydextrose; and\n\nResistant maltodextrin/dextrin (see Ref. [4]).\n\nUntil we complete rulemaking to add any additional non-digestible carbohydrates to the regulatory definition of dietary fiber, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion to allow manufacturers to include the eight recognized fibers when calculating the amount of dietary fiber to declare on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels.\n--------------------\nContext title: Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -2.488189220428467", "\n--------------------\nQuestion: Having read through Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Should the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices be determined on a volume basis or on a weight basis?\n--------------------\nContext: Should sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch and other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g., beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label?\n\nYes. Sugars created through the controlled hydrolysis of starch or other complex carbohydrates in the production of plant-based beverages (e.g. beverages made from oats and rice) or other foods need to be declared as Added Sugars on the Nutrition Facts label because the sugars created through controlled hydrolysis add empty calories to the diet (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii); 81 FR 33742 at 33831 through 33832 (comment 201 and response), 33835 (comment 207 and response)).\n\nIn the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule, we explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, because the manufacturer purposely used hydrolysis to increase the product's sugar content (81 FR 33742 at 33832).\n\nWe understand that manufacturers may use hydrolysis of starches and other complex carbohydrates in the production of some plant-based beverages for purposes other than to increase the sugar content and sweetness of the final product. For example, a manufacturer might use hydrolysis to reduce a product's viscosity (thickness). When we issued our proposed rule to amend the Nutrition Facts label requirements, some comments to the proposed rule said that we should exclude certain ingredients from the definition of added sugars because the ingredients are not added to the product for the intended purpose of sweetening. We responded that, in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we consider the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Report (81 FR 33742 at 33835). The sugars created in the production of plant-based beverages, as well as other ingredients and foods that undergo controlled hydrolysis, contribute empty calories to the diet.\n\nAdditionally, we said in our answer to question 14 above that when an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis (e.g. maltodextrin or corn syrup) is added to a food during processing, those mono- and disaccharides contributed by the ingredient need to be declared as Added Sugars on the label.\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nFor the Added Sugars declaration, we consider sugars created through the hydrolysis of starch or other complex carbohydrates inherent to grains, such as oats or rice, to be the same as sugars created through the hydrolysis of starch in the production of ingredients, such as maltodext, because in both cases, sugars are created through controlled hydrolysis. Because the hydrolysis process is controlled, manufacturers can determine the amount of sugars created and present in the final product.\n\n16. Does the sugar created through enzymatic hydrolysis of lactose in low-lactose dairy products need to be declared as added sugars?\n\nWe received several comments to the Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels proposed rule related to lactose in dairy ingredients, which are summarized in Comment 209 of the Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels final rule (the final rule) (81 FR 33742 at 33835). The sugars in dairy ingredients, except lactose as defined in 21 CFR 168.122, are not included in the definition of added sugars. Moreover, lactose that meets our standard of identity is an added sugar.\n\nLactose, as a sugar in a dairy product, is a disaccharide that is captured on the Nutrition Facts label under the Total Sugars declaration. However, lactose that meets the definition in 21 CFR 168.122 is captured on the Nutrition Facts label under both the Added Sugars and Total Sugars declarations. We are aware that the enzyme lactase is used by industry to hydrolyze lactose present in dairy products for the purposes of reducing the lactose content in low-lactose dairy products. The hydrolysis of lactose results in the monosaccharides glucose and galactose. Regardless of whether hydrolysis of lactose, present in dairy products or in dairy ingredients by lactase is being utilized to reduce lactose or to increase the sweetness of the product, hydrolysis of lactose under such circumstances does not result in an increase in sugars that would affect the Total Sugars declaration. Moreover, to the extent lactose that meets our standard of identity in 21 CFR 168.122 is subject to hydrolysis, the Added Sugars declaration would be the same before and after the hydrolysis of such a lactose ingredient using lactase. Since the hydrolysis of lactose found in dairy products (e.g. milk) and dairy ingredients (e.g. stabilizers and texturizers), and the hydrolysis of lactose that meets our standard of identity, do not result in an increase in the Total Sugars declaration, the hydrolysis process also does not result in an increase in the caloric content of the food. Thus, the sugars created through enzymatic hydrolysis of lactose, whether present as a component of a dairy product, a dairy ingredient, or contributed by the addition of lactose that meets the definition in 21 CFR 168.122, do not change the declarations for Total Sugars or Added Sugars for the product.\n\nIf sugars are added to a food that already contains inherent sugars (e.g. yogurt), does that make \"added sugars\" a Class I nutrient for purposes of compliance under 21 CFR 101.9(g)? If so, does that mean that the composite must be formulated to be at least equal to the value for the added nutrient (added sugars) declared on the label per 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(i), or is 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5) allowing up to 20% in excess of the value declared applicable?\n\nAdded sugars would be a nutrient in a fortified or fabricated food (21 CFR 101.9(g)(3)(i)). Added sugars is not a nutrient listed in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(i). The nutrients listed in this regulation include: vitamins, minerals, protein, and dietary fiber.\n\nWhen a food contains sugars that are endogenous and not exogenous sugars, the nutrient content of the composite for \"Total Sugars\" and \"Added Sugars\" would be subject to 21 CFR 101.9(g)(5). Section 101.9(g)(5) requires that the nutrient content of the composite be no greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label and states that no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved.\n\nHowever, because there are no generally recognized analytical methods available to quantify added sugars in a food when the food contains sugars that do and do not meet our definition of added sugars, the parenthetical after \"added sugars\" in SS 101.9(g)(5) states that, \"when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars.\" The parenthetical is intended to clarify that the requirement in SS 101.9(g)(5) for the added sugars declaration would only apply when there is an analytical method available to quantify the added sugars. When a food contains a combination of sugars that do and do not meet our definition of added sugars, we would verify the declaration of added sugars in a food using the records required by SS 101.9(g)(10) and (11).\n\nWith respect to the total sugars declaration, SS 101.9(g)(5) would apply whether the food contains only added sugars, only sugars that do not meet our definition of added sugars, or a combination of these sugars in a food because there would be an analytical method to quantify \"Total Sugars\" under any of these circumstances.\n\nA food that already contains some endogenous sugar and additional added sugars, either directly or as a component in an ingredient, such as sweetened fruit added to yogurt, would be misbranded if the actual \"Total Sugars\" amount is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label, or the records requirements for \"Added Sugars\" are not met (see SS 101.9(g)(11)).\n\nDo sugars present in a sweet fermented beverage after fermentation need to be declared as total or added sugars on the label?\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains only sugars that meet our definition of added sugars (e.g. table sugar), then the amount of sugars present in a serving of the product after fermentation must be declared as both total and added sugars (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)).\n\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations\n\nIf the fermented beverage contains both sugars that do and do not meet our definition of added sugars, you may determine the amount of total sugars in the finished food analytically. You have the following options related to the added sugars declaration:\n\nDetermine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in the finished product and make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information you relied upon that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation; or\n\nDeclare the amount of added sugars added prior to fermentation and make and keep records to verify the amount (21 CFR 101.9(g)). The amount of added sugars declared should not exceed the amount of total sugars on the label; or\n--------------------\nContext title: Guidance for Industry- Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals \n--------------------\nRelevance with the question: -4.44350004196167"]}
