["As described in the context of the Completeness Assessments for Type II API DMFs under GDUFA Guidance for Industry, DMF holders do not need to wait for a new ANDA applicant to request a letter of authorization before the DMF is assessed to be available for reference. Under GDUFA, the DMF holder is required to pay a DMF fee when the DMF is first referenced in a generic drug submission submitted to the FDA on the basis of a letter of authorization (LOA) from the DMF holder. However, if a generic drug submission contains all the necessary active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) information and does not rely on information contained in a DMF, no Completeness Assessment (CA) will be performed for that specific DMF. Instead, the API information will be evaluated during the ANDA filing review, and the applicant submitting the generic drug submission containing the API information must pay the required fee. Upon payment of the DMF fee and completion of the CA, if the DMF is found complete, the DMF number will be made publicly available on FDA's website, indicating that the DMF is available for reference by generic drug submission applicants. If the DMF fails the CA, the FDA will send a GDUFA DMF Incomplete Letter describing the missing elements to the DMF holder. The DMF holder can address the deficiencies and resubmit or amend the DMF to complete the CA, after which the DMF number will be made publicly available if found to be complete.\n\nIn summary, the availability of a DMF for reference is primarily determined by the completeness of the DMF and the payment of the required DMF fee, rather than being contingent on a new ANDA applicant requesting a letter of authorization.", "In response to the question about safety criteria for consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients, the most relevant regulatory guideline is from the Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

An exception is made for retrospective validation of well-established processes that have been used without significant changes to API quality due to changes in raw materials, equipment, systems, facilities, or the production process. This validation approach can be used when critical quality attributes and critical process parameters have been identified, appropriate in-process acceptance criteria and controls have been established, there have not been significant process/product failures attributable to causes other than operator error or equipment failures unrelated to equipment suitability, and impurity profiles have been established for the existing API. Batches selected for retrospective validation should be representative of all batches made during the review period, including any batches that failed to meet specifications, and should be sufficient in number to demonstrate process consistency. Retained samples can be tested to obtain data to retrospectively validate the process.\n\nFor prospective and concurrent validation, three consecutive successful production batches should generally be used as a guide, but there may be situations where additional process runs are warranted to prove consistency of the process. Generally, data from 10 to 30 consecutive batches should be examined to assess process consistency for retrospective validation, but fewer batches can be examined if justified. The number of process runs for validation should depend on the complexity of the process or the magnitude of the process change being considered.\n\nIt's important to note that regardless of the type of validation, the quality system should confirm the ongoing robustness of the process, and the validation protocol should be established, specifying critical process steps, acceptance criteria, the type of validation to be conducted (e.g., retrospective, prospective, concurrent), and the number of process runs. The validation report should summarize the results obtained, comment on any deviations observed, and draw the appropriate conclusions, including recommending changes to correct deficiencies. Any variations from the validation protocol should be documented with appropriate justification.\n\nIn summary, a retrospective approach to validation remains acceptable for well-established processes, provided that certain conditions are met, as outlined in the Q7 guidelines.", "In the context of the \"Guidance for Industry- Interim Procedures for Qualified Health Claims in the Labeling of Conventional Human Food and Human Dietary Supplements,\" the term \"recognized antioxidant activity\" refers to scientific evidence that demonstrates the participation of a substance in physiological, biochemical, or cellular processes that inactivate free radicals or prevent free radical-initiated chemical reactions.

Specifically, the guidance addresses the criteria for an application to be submitted under section 505 of the FD&C Act and the processes and implications of the transition of approved new drug applications (NDAs) to deemed Biologics License Applications (BLAs).\n\nThe guidance provides insights into critical aspects such as the interpretation of the transition provisions, the process for transitioning approved NDAs to deemed BLAs, the statutory implications for application holders and the subsequent administrative steps. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of maintaining compliance with statutory requirements and explains the implications for exclusivity periods, application numbering, licensing, and the proper naming of biological products.\n\nFurthermore, the guidance includes provisions related to the assignment of application numbers and licensing numbers for deemed BLAs, the removal of biological products from the Orange Book to the Purple Book, and the compliance policy for labeling requirements. It also addresses the interactions with FDA, data submissions, and compliance considerations for biological product sponsors affected by the transition provision.\n\nTherefore, the \"The \u2018Deemed to be a License\u2019 Provision of the BPCI Act: Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry\" provides comprehensive insights into the regulatory framework and considerations related to the submission of applications for biological products during the transition period, making it the most relevant guidance for addressing the question.", "Based on the provided context from the Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances guidelines, specific information that should be included in the application about a starting material that is a commercially available chemical as per section 5.14 includes:\n\n1. Basic Information: The application should include basic information about the starting material, such as its chemical name, chemical formula, and molecular weight.\n\n2. Impurity Profile: Information on the impurity profile of the starting material should be provided, including the actual and potential impurities that are reasonably expected in the proposed starting material.\n\n3. Control Strategy Justification: The application should justify the control strategy for the drug substance manufacturing process based on the impurity profile of the starting material.\n\n4. Additional Purification Steps: If the drug substance manufacturer needs to perform additional purification steps to ensure the consistent quality of a commercially available starting material, these steps should be included as part of the drug substance manufacturing process in section 3.2.S.2.2.\n\n5. Starting Material Specification: Applicants should provide and justify a specification for the proposed starting material, including tests for identity and purity, acceptance criteria for impurities, residual solvents, reagents, elemental impurities, and mutagenic impurities. The analytical procedures used should be suitably validated.\n\n6. Lifecycle Management: The applicant's Pharmaceutical Quality System (PQS) should address changes upstream of the defined starting material, managing residual risks to the drug substance quality.\n\nTherefore, when considering the information required about a commercially available starting material, it's important to provide details on the starting material's identity, impurity profile, control strategy, specification, and any additional purification steps if necessary. These elements are crucial for demonstrating the suitability of the starting material and ensuring the quality and safety of the drug substance manufacturing process.", "As per the ANDAs- Stability Testing of Drug Substances and Products, if one among the three batches in accelerated conditions shows a significant change, the regulatory guidelines suggest the following:\n\n1. If significant change occurs within the first three months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, a discussion should be provided addressing the effect of short-term excursions outside the label storage condition, e.g. during shipping or handling. This discussion can be supported, if appropriate, by further testing on a single batch of the API for a period shorter than three months but with more frequent testing than usual. It is considered unnecessary to continue to test an API for the whole six months when a significant change has occurred within the first three months.\n\n2. If a significant change occurs between three and six months' testing at the accelerated storage condition, the proposed retest period should be based on the data available at the long-term storage condition.\n\n3. If one batch among the three shows a significant change, it is necessary to assess its impact on the overall stability and retest periods. This may involve further testing, re-evaluating the storage conditions, and possibly adjusting the retest period and shelf life based on the available data and the rationale provided by stability studies.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to maintain records of the stability testing results, conduct investigations into any out of specification (OOS) results or significant atypical trends, and report any confirmed significant change or OOS result immediately to the relevant competent authorities.\n\nThese guidelines emphasize the importance of ongoing monitoring and evaluation of stability data to ensure products remain within acceptance criteria throughout their intended shelf life.", "In context with the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels, the unique aspect about the ingredient labeling of dietary supplements is the presentation within the \"Supplement Facts\" panel. Ingredients that are sources of dietary ingredients may be listed directly within the \"Supplement Facts\" panel, eliminating the need to list them again separately in the ingredient statement. However, in cases where ingredients such as excipients or fillers are present, an ingredient statement is necessary. The ingredient list must be displayed prominently and conspicuously, using a type size no less than 1/16 inch in height. The ingredients must be listed in descending order of predominance by weight, and specific requirements exist for declaring spices, natural flavors, artificial flavors, artificial colors, and other dietary ingredients.\n\nIt is important to note that the term \"ingredient\" in the context of dietary supplements refers not only to the active dietary ingredients but also to substances such as binders, colors, excipients, fillers, flavors, and sweeteners. This differs from the conventional food labeling guidelines and reflects the unique nature of dietary supplements, where various components play critical roles in the overall formulation and product characteristics.\n\nAdditionally, the guidance provides specific requirements for \"Supplement Facts\" panel formatting, placement, and compliance with the regulations. The food and drug legislation does not prescribe the use of specific approved nutrition databases for determining nutrition values for dietary supplements or conventional foods. Instead, FDA provides flexibility in choosing sources for nutrition information, allowing for the use of commercially available nutrition databases or data published by authoritative sources.", "While the information provided mentions various guidelines and requirements related to prescription drug distribution, including the need for pedigrees in certain situations, it does not address the specific requirement for pedigrees when an ADR drop-ships on behalf of a non-ADR directly to a pharmacy or customer as per the initial question. The provided information is more focused on drug distribution, compounding, individual case safety reports, and the Prescription Drug Marketing Act requirements.\n\nIf there are specific concerns or questions about the requirement for pedigrees in the context of drop-shipping by an ADR and non-ADR, it would be best to refer directly to the FDA's regulations and guidance on drug distribution and pedigree requirements for a more accurate and explicit answer.", "In accordance with the given context from S10 Photosafety Evaluation of Pharmaceuticals, when the initial assessment of phototoxic potential based on physicochemical properties indicates a phototoxic risk, the decision to conduct nonclinical photosafety studies should be influenced by the following factors:\n1. Photochemical Properties: A compound that does not have a molar extinction coefficient (MEC) greater than 1000 L mol^-1 cm^-1 at any wavelength between 290 and 700 nm is not considered to be sufficiently photoreactive to result in direct phototoxicity. However, it should be noted that phototoxicity by indirect mechanisms could still occur even if the MEC value is lower.\n\n2. Phototoxicity Evaluation: If the drug developer chooses to conduct a test for photoreactivity, a negative result could eliminate the need for further photosafety assessment. Otherwise, nonclinical and/or clinical photosafety assessment of the substance should be conducted.\n\n3. In Vitro Testing: The 3T3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity test (3T3 NRU-PT) is currently the most widely used assay and could be considered as an initial test for phototoxicity, particularly when trying to reduce animal testing.\n\n4. In Vivo Testing: When conducting nonclinical in vivo assays for systemic administration, it is important to consider factors such as species selection, study duration, and irradiation conditions, especially aligning with the intended clinical route of administration.\n\n5. Assessment Strategies: The choice of the photosafety assessment strategy is up to the drug developer. An initial assessment of the phototoxicity potential based on photochemical properties and pharmacological/chemical class should be undertaken before outpatient studies.\n\nIn summary, the decision to conduct nonclinical photosafety studies should be influenced by the photochemical properties of the compound, the intended route of administration, and the available data on the compound or chemical class-related compounds. The specific decision and strategy for photosafety evaluation should be determined on a case-by-case basis, considering the potential phototoxic risk and aligning with relevant regulatory guidelines.\n", "In the context of the information provided from the \"Q7 Good Manufacturing Practice Guidance for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Guidance for Industry,\" any proposal for GMP relevant changes, including the reprocessing of components or products, should be drafted, reviewed, and approved by the appropriate organizational units and reviewed and approved by the quality unit(s) (13.12). The potential impact of the proposed change on the quality of the intermediate or API should be evaluated, and classification procedures may help in determining the level of testing, validation, and documentation needed to justify changes to a validated process (13.13). Measures should be taken to ensure that all documents affected by the changes are revised after the change has been implemented (13.14). There should also be an evaluation of the first batches produced or tested under the change and an assessment of the potential impact on established retest or expiry dates (13.15, 13.16).\n\nIn terms of reprocessing, introducing an intermediate or API back into the process and reprocessing by repeating appropriate chemical or physical manipulation steps is generally considered acceptable. However, such reprocessing should be included as part of the standard manufacturing process if used for a majority of batches (14.20). Introducing unreacted material back into a process and repeating a chemical reaction is considered reprocessing and should be carefully evaluated to ensure that the quality of the intermediate or API is not adversely affected (14.22).\n\nAdditionally, before reworking batches that do not conform to established standards or specifications, an investigation into the reason for nonconformance should be performed and reworked batches should be subjected to appropriate evaluation, testing, stability testing if warranted, and documentation to show that the reworked product is of equivalent quality to that produced by the original process (14.30, 14.31). The reprocessing and reworking of materials are fundamental aspects of maintaining the quality and integrity of pharmaceutical products, and the guidelines provide specific recommendations and requirements for such processes.\n\nTherefore, the guidance recognizes the potential need for reprocessing of components or products in the pharmaceutical manufacturing process, but emphasizes the importance of thorough evaluation, testing, and documentation to ensure the quality and integrity of the final product.", "In accordance with the context provided, the most relevant response to the question of whether absorption studies need to be done on each test article, as per the GLPs, would be the following:\n\nThe GLPs do not mandate that absorption studies need to be done on each test article, or which type of study is satisfactory. The GLPs do require, however, that the protocol describe the method used if one is necessary to achieve the study objectives. Additionally, the critical requirement is to ensure that the study director incorporates test and control article identification and characterization in the final report, and if the study director is affiliated with a contract laboratory, the sponsor can append such information to the final report rather than provide it directly to the study director.\n\nFurthermore, the responsibility for storage of archival material may be assigned to either the testing laboratory or the sponsor of the study, as determined by the specific provisions of the contract between the sponsor and the contractor.", "Based on the provided context from CVM GFI #156, the question about the selection of dosimeter locations for dose mapping studies seems to be out of scope for this particular guideline, as it mainly deals with comparability protocols for chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information for new animal drugs. Therefore, the information from the provided regulatory guidelines does not directly address the question about dosimeter selection for dose mapping studies.\n\nIf you have specific questions about dose mapping studies, I recommend referring to guidelines or resources that specifically address the conduct and requirements for dose mapping studies, such as ICH M3(R2) or ICH S9 for nonclinical evaluation, or other relevant regulatory guidance related to dosimetry and radiation studies. These guidelines may provide specific details on how to select locations for dosimeters in dose mapping studies.", "Based on the provided contexts, it seems there might be a confusion in the given question and the associated contexts. The contexts provided seem to be related to informed consent in clinical trials and include information about safety, research procedures, and the consent process rather than specific Medical Device Patient Labeling guidance. In light of the content provided, it is important to clarify the specific topic related to medical device patient labeling to accurately address the application of Factors 2 and 3 as well as provide relevant examples. The provided contents mainly revolve around informed consent requirements, clinical trial oversight, and investigational study conduct guidelines.\n\nIf you have specific questions related to medical device patient labeling guidance, informed consent process regulations for medical devices, or other topics not covered in the given contexts, please feel free to ask for assistance and I'd be happy to help clarify and provide relevant information.", "In the context of \"Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff,\" a study is a systematic evaluation conducted in the development of an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) product, including feasibility assessments, analytical assessments, method comparisons, and evaluations to determine the clinical utility of a product. This involves conducting investigations using human subjects or specimens to assess the safety and effectiveness of the diagnostic device.\n\nAdditionally, the guidance emphasizes the importance of designing well-controlled clinical studies based on valid scientific evidence to ensure reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device. This involves considering factors such as bias, variability, study objectives, subject selection, stratification, site selection, and comparative study designs to gather credible and accurate data.\n\nThe guidance also outlines the regulatory framework for the level of evidence and study design, including compliance with good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines and regulations, such as 21 CFR Parts 50, 54, 56, and 812, which articulate the requirements for conducting clinical investigations of medical devices. It further discusses the statutory standard for approval of a premarket approval (PMA), emphasizing the importance of valid scientific evidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, and objective trials to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device under its intended uses and conditions of use.\n\nIn summary, a study in the context of this guidance refers to the systematic evaluation and investigation conducted to assess the safety and effectiveness of in vitro diagnostic devices, with a focus on gathering valid scientific evidence through well-controlled clinical studies in compliance with regulatory requirements and GCP guidelines.", "In response to the question, \"From what I've read in Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug Manufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry, How does FDA intend to prioritize inspections as travel restrictions are eased or lifted?\"\n\nThe FDA intends to prioritize inspections based on several factors including mission-critical assessments related to the public health benefit of U.S. patients having access to the product subject to inspection. This includes considerations such as breakthrough therapy designation, orphan-drug designation, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation, and whether the product is used for critical care or as a medical countermeasure, among others. Inspections may also be prioritized for-cause, preapproval, and pre-license inspections.\n\nAdditionally, the FDA aims to support its assessment of pending applications, preclude the need for an inspection in follow-up to a reported concern or defect, and justify a follow-up or compliance inspection based on the outcome of remote interactive evaluations. The Agency intends to use information obtained from remote interactive evaluations to rank or prioritize a facility for an inspection, particularly a surveillance current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) inspection. It also endeavors to ensure the quality of imported products, expanding the use of other tools and approaches for assessing manufacturing facilities while inspections are limited.\n\nIt is important for facilities to cooperate with remote interactive evaluations and maintain transparency equivalent to an FDA inspection. The FDA will conclude a remote interactive evaluation with a closeout meeting, during which it will usually present a written list of observations, and this information may be used for various regulatory purposes such as supporting FDA's assessment of pending applications, precluding the need for an inspection, or justifying a follow-up or compliance inspection. Observations from remote interactive evaluations may also be combined into a single written list of observations issued at the close of the inspection, if the remote interactive evaluation is intended to supplement a scheduled inspection.\n\nOverall, the FDA's intent is to use remote interactive evaluations as a tool to prioritize inspections and assess the facilities in a manner that supports regulatory decision-making and public health safety.", "The context provided does not directly pertain to the specific question about whether the scope of section 13 of the PBRER only includes controlled clinical trials. Therefore, let me provide a direct answer based on the regulatory guidelines for generating postmarket periodic safety reports.\n\nIn the context of ICH E2C(R2) for Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER), the scope of section 13 does not specifically pertain to controlled clinical trials. Instead, section 13 of the PBRER pertains to \"Lack of Efficacy in Controlled Clinical Trials.\" This section typically includes information on the reasons for lack of efficacy observed in controlled clinical trials and may encompass relevant data from nonclinical studies, uncontrolled clinical trials, or observational studies that could provide insights into the efficacy issue observed in controlled trials. Therefore, the scope of section 13 extends beyond controlled clinical trials and encompasses a broader range of clinical and nonclinical data relevant to the issue of lack of efficacy.\n\nFurthermore, the PBRER encompasses a wide range of information related to safety and efficacy, including data from various sources such as completed and ongoing clinical trials, non-interventional studies, literature, and other sources. Hence, the evaluation of efficacy in section 13 may consider data beyond controlled clinical trials to provide a comprehensive assessment of the product's benefit-risk profile.", "Given the context provided from CVM GFI #156 Comparability Protocols, it seems that the most relevant regulatory guideline to help answer the question about release profiles is the Q11 Guideline. The Q11 Guideline discusses the control strategy, critical quality attributes (CQAs), design space, and risk assessment, all of which are essential elements for achieving desired release profiles of a drug product.\n\nTo achieve the desired release profile, the product should have a well-defined control strategy, including parameters and attributes related to drug substance and drug product materials, process parameters, and in-process and finished product specifications. These controls are derived from current product and process understanding and assure process performance and product quality.\n\nCritical Quality Attributes (CQAs) play a crucial role, as they are the physical, chemical, biological, or microbiological properties or characteristics that should be within an appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the desired product quality. It is important to identify potential CQAs of the drug product, including those affecting drug release, and to establish an appropriate control strategy based on enhanced product and process understanding.\n\nThe concept of a design space is also relevant. The design space is the multidimensional combination and interaction of input variables and process parameters that have been demonstrated to provide assurance of quality. Working within the design space ensures that it is not considered a change, while movement out of the design space is considered a change and would normally initiate a regulatory post-approval change process. Understanding and defining the design space is crucial for ensuring the desired product quality, including release profiles.\n\nIn summary, to achieve the desired release profiles, it is important to have a well-defined control strategy, identify critical quality attributes, and understand the design space, as outlined in the Q11 Guideline. These elements help ensure a systematic approach to achieving the desired product quality, including release profiles, and provide the basis for comparative assessments and risk assessments when implementing changes to achieve the desired profile.", "The guidance provided in the Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship context strongly emphasizes the responsible role of the clinical investigator and the IRB in ensuring compliance with FDA requirements, including review and approval of the informed consent form. It reiterates that the clinical investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects and for obtaining legally effective informed consent. The IRB is emphasized as the body responsible for reviewing and approving the clinical investigation, consent form, and any other information to be given to subjects as part of the consent process.\n\nThe guidance states that sponsors should rely on the clinical investigator to assure that the IRB is functioning in compliance with the regulations. It further highlights that the clinical investigator should be kept apprised of any direct communication between the IRB and the sponsor and should provide the sponsor with a copy of the consent form approved by the IRB.\n\nTherefore, based on the information from the Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance, the sponsor is not directly required to review the consent form approved by the IRB to ensure that all FDA requirements are met. Instead, the sponsor should rely on the clinical investigator and the IRB to fulfill their respective responsibilities in the review and approval of the informed consent and related documentation.\n\nIn summary, according to this guidance, the ultimate responsibility for review and approval of the consent form rests with the clinical investigator and the IRB, while the sponsor should rely on these parties to ensure compliance with FDA requirements.", "Based on the given contexts about M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals, the guidance on metabolites in ICH M3(R2) primarily addresses the evaluation and characterization of drug metabolites to ensure their safety and potential impact on clinical trials and human use. In the provided contexts, the guidelines specify the need to evaluate and characterize metabolites when they are present at exposures greater than 10 percent of total drug-related exposure in humans.\n\nThe guidelines encompass the scientific assessment of metabolites in nonclinical studies with a focus on their toxicological impact, pharmacological activity, and potential risks. These include considerations such as disproportionate drug metabolites, pharmacologically active metabolites, and their impact on safety, efficacy, and clinical trial design. The provided guidance suggests specific scenarios where further nonclinical evaluation of metabolites is warranted based on their exposure levels and potential impact on safety and efficacy.\n\nIn the context of a prodrug, where a metabolite provides most of the pharmacologic activity, the guidance provided in M3(R2) does apply. The guidance does not specifically address prodrugs, however, if the active metabolite is not adequately produced in the animal species, then the target molecule for toxicological evaluation is the active metabolite. This would necessitate additional testing beyond that recommended for metabolites. Therefore, the timing of the nonclinical testing of the active metabolite in this case would follow the general timelines as outlined in ICH M3(R2) rather than the timing indicated for metabolite testing in section III (3) of M3(R2).\n\nThe guidance aims to provide a comprehensive framework for assessing the safety of drug metabolites, including prodrugs, ensuring that their potential impact on clinical trials and human use is thoroughly evaluated and understood.\n\nIf there are additional specific questions or if further details are needed, please feel free to ask.", "In the context of Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, it is important to determine the language barriers faced by study subjects and when assessing if informed consent documents need to be translated into the native language of study subjects who do not understand English.\n\nThe guidance primarily focuses on the requirements related to the translation of informed consent documents for study subjects who do not understand English. It emphasizes that when the prospective subject is fluent in a language other than English and the consent interview is conducted in that language, the IRB should assure that a translated consent form is prepared and that the translation is accurate. It also emphasizes the importance of using language understandable to the subject, using an approved short form translated into the subject's language, providing a written summary in the subject's language, and ensuring that the translator is fluent in both English and the subject's language.\n\nMoreover, the guidance highlights that assent by children and parental permission must be obtained and documented in language understandable to the parents if they do not understand English, emphasizing the importance of ensuring that the child who will be participating in the research should not be used as an interpreter for the parent.\n\nIn conclusion, in this specific context, it is important to ensure that informed consent documents are translated into the written language native to study subjects who do not understand English to ensure that the consent process provides the subject with sufficient opportunity to understand the information being presented.", "In the context of the question regarding the most appropriate metric to assess a drug's effect on the QT/QTc interval when the data are collected in a placebo-controlled parallel design study, the relevant information can be found in the ICH E14 guidance.\n\nAccording to the ICH E14 guidance, in a placebo-controlled parallel design study where there is no corresponding placebo value for each patient, the most appropriate metric to assess a drug's effect on the QT/QTc interval is the largest time-matched mean difference between the drug and placebo (baseline-adjusted) over the collection period. Additional approaches to the assessment of central tendency could include analysis of changes occurring around the Cmax for each individual, especially important if the drug has large between-subject variability in the rate of absorption or metabolism. Furthermore, categorical analyses of QT/QTc interval data based on the number and percentage of patients meeting or exceeding some predefined upper limit value are recommended. These categorical analyses are most informative when it is possible to compare the rate of supra-threshold readings in the treatment and control groups.\n\nIt's important to note that there is no consensus concerning the choice of upper limit values for absolute QT/QTc interval and changes from baseline, and multiple analyses using different limits are recommended. Additionally, the document emphasizes the importance of analyses of the relationship between drug exposure and QT/QTc interval changes, which can provide additional information to assist in the planning and interpretation of studies assessing cardiac repolarization.\n\nIn summary, the ICH E14 guidance highlights the recommended metrics and approaches for assessing a drug's effect on QT/QTc interval in placebo-controlled parallel design studies, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating the potential proarrhythmic effects of non-antiarrhythmic drugs.", "No, substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule cannot be used in compounding under 503A. As per the Interim Policy on Compounding Using Bulk Drug Substances Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, substances that have been evaluated and not placed on the 503A Bulks List no longer qualify for the interim policy concerning compounding with bulk drug substances. Additionally, the final rule establishing the list of bulk drug substances that can be used in compounding under section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act clearly identifies four bulk drug substances that are not being included on the list. Compounding with any of these substances may subject the compounder to regulatory action. Therefore, it is important for compounders to comply with the final rule, and substances not included on the list should not be used in compounding under 503A.", "As per the details in the \"Pediatric Study Plans- Content of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans\" guidance for industry, a proposed biosimilar product applicant should submit an initial pediatric study plan (PSP) before the date on which the applicant submits the required assessments or investigation, and no later than 60 calendar days after the date of an end-of-phase 2 (EOP2) meeting, or at such other time as agreed upon by FDA and the applicant. In cases where a sponsored development program includes the possibility of using expedited programs, it is encouraged to have discussions about the pediatric development plans with the review division as early as possible. Furthermore, the guidance specifies that if the sponsor has not already initiated a comparative clinical study intended to address the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I)(cc) of the PHS Act, the sponsor should submit an initial PSP as soon as feasible, but no later than 210 days before initiating such a study. The guidance also encourages sponsors to meet with FDA to discuss the planned development program before submission of the initial PSP.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate time for the submission of an initial PSP depends on the progress of the sponsor's development program, but it should be submitted before the expected start of the clinical study intended to address the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A)(i)(I)(cc) of the PHS Act and should allow sufficient time for FDA review and agreement on the plan.", "In section 17.1 (Important Baseline Efficacy/Effectiveness Information) of the Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER) in accordance with the details from the Providing Postmarket Periodic Safety Reports in the ICH E2C(R2) Format, the efficacy/effectiveness information to be presented should summarize the information on the efficacy/effectiveness of the medicinal product as of the beginning of the reporting interval. This information should relate to the approved indication(s) of the medicinal product listed in the reference product information. The level of detail provided in this section should be sufficient to support the characterisation of benefit in PBRER Section 17.3 and the benefit-risk assessment in Section 18. The information should be presented separately for medicinal products with multiple indications, populations, and/or routes of administration, where relevant.\n\nNew information on efficacy/effectiveness in approved indications that may have become available during the reporting interval should be presented in section 17.2 (Newly Identified Information on Efficacy/Effectiveness) of the PBRER. However, it's important to note that new information about efficacy/effectiveness in uses other than the approved indication(s) should not be included, unless relevant for the benefit-risk evaluation in the approved indication.\n\nOverall, the efficacy/effectiveness information presented in section 17.1 should provide a baseline understanding of the product's efficacy/effectiveness at the beginning of the reporting interval, while section 17.2 should cover any newly identified information on efficacy/effectiveness in approved indications during the reporting interval. This information is essential for the benefit-risk assessment in the subsequent sections of the PBRER.", "Based on the provided context from the \"Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\" as well as the given regulatory guidelines, it appears that the specific question about following the \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in the context of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device studies is not explicitly addressed.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the \"Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\" and the related regulatory guidelines primarily focus on the conduct of IVD studies, investigational device exemptions, protection of human subjects, and related requirements and considerations specific to in vitro diagnostic devices.\n\nIn the absence of explicit guidance on the requirement to follow 21 CFR Part 58 specifically for IVD studies, it is recommended to consult with regulatory authorities or qualified experts in the field to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and best practices concerning nonclinical studies and good laboratory practices, particularly when conducting studies that involve nonclinical data generation or assessment of biological effects.\n\nIt's important to highlight that while the context did not provide a direct response to the question about the requirement of following 21 CFR Part 58 for IVD studies, it did offer valuable insights into the applicable regulations and considerations relevant to conducting in vitro diagnostic device studies, especially in the context of investigational device exemptions and protection of human subjects.\n\nIf specific details on the application of \"Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies\" to IVD studies are required, reaching out to regulatory authorities or subject matter experts for further guidance would be advisable.", "In the context of Sponsor-Investigator-IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, the decision to list co-investigators on the Form FDA 1572 (Statement of Investigator) in Section #1 depends on the arrangements between the sponsor, investigator, and the IRB.
