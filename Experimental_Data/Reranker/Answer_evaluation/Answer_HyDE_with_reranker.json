Furthermore, the submission must comply with the requirements specified in 21 CFR 312.120(b).\n\nIt is important to note that FDA regulations require sponsors to promptly review information about the safety of the investigational drug obtained or otherwise received, and to notify FDA and all participating investigators in an IND safety report of any serious and unexpected adverse experiences associated with the use of the drug, regardless of whether they occurred in a foreign study not conducted under the IND.\n\nIn summary, the decision to include foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study under an IND is not mandatory and is at the discretion of the sponsor. If included, certain requirements, including the submission of information in compliance with 21 CFR 312.120, need to be met.", "In the context of stability testing data of modified release dosage forms, the recommendations for assessing the reversibility of toxicity align with those stipulated in the guidelines provided by the FDA. These guidelines provide a framework for stability studies and the general considerations for pharmaceutical dosage forms. While the specific guidance does not directly address the assessment of reversibility of toxicity for modified release dosage forms, the overarching principles of stability testing, including the evaluation of various attributes that may influence product quality, safety, and effectiveness, are relevant to ensuring the reversibility of toxicity.\n\nStability Testing Data of Modified Release Dosage Forms:\n1. Evaluation of reversibility should be considered in the stability testing program, particularly if severe toxicity is observed at clinically relevant exposures, or if the toxicity is only detectable at an advanced stage of the pathophysiology in humans where a significant reduction in organ function is expected.\n2. The assessment of reversibility can be based on a study of reversibility or on a scientific assessment, which includes the extent and severity of the pathologic lesion, regenerative capacity of the affected organ system, and knowledge of other drugs causing similar effects.\n3. If full reversibility is not anticipated, this should be considered in the clinical risk assessment. A trend towards reversibility and a scientific assessment predicting eventual full reversibility are generally sufficient.\n4. If the toxicity is known to be irrelevant to humans, is only observed at high exposures not considered clinically relevant, or is similar to that induced by related agents with manageable risk based on prior clinical experience, a reversibility study may not be warranted.\n\nBased on the provided guidance and the indirect relevance to stability testing and ensuring product safety, the assessment of reversibility should be aligned with the general principles of stability testing and the specific attributes deemed critical for evaluating the quality, safety, and efficacy of the modified release dosage forms.", "According to the Small Entity Compliance Guide- Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels, the nutrients required to be listed in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel of dietary supplements are:\n\n1.

These guidelines ensure that the nutrients in dietary supplements are accurately and appropriately listed on the Supplement Facts panel.", "Full reversibility is not always necessary for regulatory considerations concerning toxicities observed in nonclinical studies as per the E7 guideline. In cases of severe toxicity with potential adverse clinical impact, the assessment of reversibility is essential but it is not always required to demonstrate full reversibility. Instead, demonstrating the potential for full reversibility may be sufficient, supported by a trend towards reversibility and a scientific assessment indicating that the trend would eventually progress to full reversibility. Factors such as the severity and potential clinical impact of the toxicity, as well as the regenerative capacity of the affected organ system, should be considered in the evaluation of reversibility. However, it is important to note that the assessment of reversibility should be considered in the clinical risk assessment and appropriately reflected in the product labeling.\n\nAdditionally, the E7 guideline emphasizes the importance of including an appropriate representation of the geriatric population, including those with concomitant therapies and co-morbidities, in the clinical development program to adequately characterize efficacy and safety in this population. Therefore, when developing a drug for a marketing application, it is crucial to enroll geriatric patients in the clinical development program, with efforts made to include those using concomitant therapies and with co-morbidities. If enrollment of geriatric patients is insufficient despite the applicant's efforts, a specific plan to collect data postmarketing should be discussed during development and presented in the marketing application. Information relevant to the geriatric patient population, including any limitations, should be reflected in the product labeling.\n\nThe incorporation of geriatric data from the entire spectrum of the geriatric patient population in a drug evaluation program has become increasingly important, given the age-related physiological changes in the geriatric population that can affect drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic responses. This includes consideration of the complexity and unique characteristics of the geriatric population, such as concomitant therapies and co-morbidities, in the clinical development program.", "As outlined in the \"Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry,\" if a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), the need for a separate IND for the non-U.S.-licensed product should be carefully evaluated based on the specific circumstances and scientific justifications. While the guidance provides important information related to the assessment of biosimilarity and the use of non-U.S.-licensed comparator products in certain studies, there are other regulatory guidelines most relevant to the question and outlined below that also address the requirements and considerations for such clinical investigations.\n\nThe \"FDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IND- Frequently Asked Questions Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\" highlights the importance of ensuring that non-IND foreign studies conducted in support of an IND or application for marketing approval for a drug comply with good clinical practice (GCP) requirements.

The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines recommend limiting added sugars to less than 10 percent of daily caloric intake, including sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice. This definition of added sugars excludes sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices sold directly to consumers and certain other exempted sources.\n\n2. The Nutrition Facts Label Final Rule requires the declaration of \"added sugars\" on the label, including sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that exceed expected levels from 100 percent juice.\n\n3. The Farm Bill exempts single-ingredient sugars, honey, agave, or syrup, including maple syrup, from the declaration of the amount of added sugars on the label. However, the Farm Bill maintains the requirement to include the percent Daily Value contributed by sugars from these products to the added sugars in the diet.\n\n4. The FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion by allowing a symbol to be placed immediately following the added sugars percent Daily Value on pure, single-ingredient sugars and syrups labels, excluding the requirement to state \"Includes Xg Added Sugars\" on the line within the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nGiven this context, step 4 for calculating the amount of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation involves adherence to the FDA's regulations and guidance related to the declaration of added sugars, as well as consideration of any exemptions provided by the Farm Bill. It is important for manufacturers to accurately reflect the contribution of added sugars from juice ingredients, in line with the FDA's current recommendations and regulations.", "Based on the information presented in  \"Interpretation of the 'Deemed to be a License' Provision of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry,\" the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product listed by the FDA does not need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA. According to the guidance, the holder of an approved NDA for a biological product does not need to take any affirmative steps for its NDA to be deemed a BLA. The guidance specifies that an approved application under the FD&C Act for a biological product will be \"deemed to be a license\" for the biological product on the transition date by operation of the statute. Furthermore, regulatory expectations and processes for the transition of approved NDAs to deemed BLAs are set by the FDA, including the issuance of communications to application holders indicating the transition of approved NDAs to deemed BLAs and the necessary updates to listing information.\n\nThe guidance clarifies that full reversibility is generally not necessary, but a trend towards reversibility and a scientific assessment that this trend would eventually progress to full reversibility are typically sufficient. However, a toxicity study that includes a terminal non-dosing period may be generally warranted in cases of severe toxicity at clinically relevant exposures or when the toxicity is only detectable at an advanced stage in humans and significant reduction in organ function is expected.\n\nIt also covers the assignment of application numbers for deemed BLAs and the notification and issuance of license numbers to application holders.

The validation approach may be used under the following conditions:\n\n1. Critical quality attributes and critical process parameters have been identified.\n2. Appropriate in-process acceptance criteria and controls have been established.\n3. There have not been significant process/product failures attributable to causes other than operator error or equipment failures unrelated to equipment suitability.\n4. Impurity profiles have been established for the existing API.\n\nBatches selected for retrospective validation should be representative of all batches produced during the review period, including any batches that failed to meet specifications, and should be sufficient in number to demonstrate process consistency. Retained samples can be tested to obtain data to retrospectively validate the process.\n\nRetrospective validation is advisable only for well-established processes meeting the specified conditions. For new processes or where changes have been made that may impact the quality of the API, prospective validation is generally recommended. The number of process runs for validation will depend on the complexity of the process or the magnitude of the process change being considered. For retrospective validation, generally data from 10 to 30 consecutive batches should be examined to assess process consistency, but fewer batches can be examined if justified.\n\nUltimately, the decision to use a retrospective validation approach should be based on a thorough assessment of the process, product, and the potential risks involved. Each manufacturer should assess whether the process has gained sufficient understanding to provide a high degree of assurance in its manufacturing process to justify commercial distribution of the product.\n\nIt is important to note that ongoing programs to collect and analyze product and process data are recommended to evaluate the state of control of the process.

This approach is consistent with the ICH E14 guidance for crossover studies. Additionally, analysis of changes occurring around the Cmax for each individual may be important if the drug has large between-subject variability in the rate of absorption or metabolism.\n\nFurthermore, concentration-response analysis, in which all available data across all doses are used to characterize the potential for a drug to influence QTc, can serve as an alternative to the by-time-point analysis or intersection-union test as the primary basis for decisions to classify the risk of a drug. Concentration-response analysis involves models such as descriptive pharmacodynamic (PD) models (e.g., linear or E(max) models) or empirical models that link pharmacokinetic (PK) models (dose-concentration-response) with PD models. However, it's important to consider that concentration-response analysis can be challenging when more than one molecular entity, such as multiple drugs or parent plus metabolites, contributes to the QTc effect. \n\nWhen a thorough QT/QTc study of a usual or modified design is not feasible, alternative methods for evaluation of QT/QTc and proarrhythmic potential may be considered, including as many of the usual thorough QT/QTc design features as possible, intensive ECG data acquisition in early phase single or multiple ascending dose studies, and utilization of concentration-response analysis. Ultimately, the assessment of QT/QTc interval potential should encompass a totality of evidence approach, incorporating nonclinical data, time course of QT prolongation, the magnitude of QT prolongation, categorical analyses of outliers, and certain adverse events in patients that can signal potential proarrhythmic effects. It's important to note that the use of concentration-response analysis and related methods are non-binding recommendations and should be evaluated in the context of the specific drug development program.", "Based on the information provided, substances that have been considered and not placed on the 503A Bulks List through a final rule cannot be used in compounding under 503A.

To address this, the FDA's guidance emphasizes that the determination should factor in considerations related to the quantities of added sugars in the finished product. The key is to calculate the amount of added sugars contributed by concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type. This places importance on identifying and quantifying the sugars that meet the definition of added sugars and including them in the added sugars declaration on the label.\n\nThe guidance specifies that when calculating the weight of added sugars per serving, it may be necessary to consider the densities of both the finished juice product and the single strength juice of the same type. Additionally, it mentions that industry guidance and scientific assessments about the presence of added sugars in ingredients and the finished product should be used to determine the declaration of added sugars. \n\nThe guidance also provides examples and explanations of how to calculate the added sugars declaration, including considerations for various types of ingredients, such as concentrated fruit or vegetable pures, flavor extracts, and dried fruits. Moreover, it highlights the need for careful assessment and documentation of the added sugars content in various production scenarios, including situations involving non-enzymatic browning and fermentation.\n\nIn summary, the determination of the added sugars contribution from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices should be based on a comprehensive assessment of the ingredient composition and production processes, considering the definition of added sugars and relevant scientific data to accurately quantify and declare the added sugars on the nutrition label in compliance with the FDA's Nutrition Facts label final rule."]
